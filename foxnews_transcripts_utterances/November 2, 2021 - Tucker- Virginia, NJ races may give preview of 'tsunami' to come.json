      "sentences": "I want to begin with a FOX News Alert tonight. There has been a hitch in the highly anticipated count in the Virginia governor's race. Fairfax County, which is the biggest and most Democratic county in the State of Virginia will not be supplying its vote results on time. We're supposed to have early vote shortly after seven o'clock Eastern, but an hour ago, a Fairfax County official announced that there is a delay. They say they need to rescan the ballots. They're going to release a partial count quote, \"of their early vote in-person\" sometime this evening. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Bill Hemmer will be tracking that for us. We're also going to talk to Brit Hume -- trying to figure out how many votes they need apparently. Just kidding. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Exactly one year from today is the congressional midterm elections. Tonight, two governors' races in solidly Democratic states on the Eastern Seaboard may give us a preview of what could be a tsunami to come. In New Jersey where polls have just closed, finance goon, Phil Murphy who appears to have declared himself king of the long-suffering Goomba Republic faces a surprisingly sharp challenge from a Republican called Jack Ciattarelli. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It seems impossible that Murphy could actually lose in a state where entire cemeteries vote. There are more than a million Democrats registered in New Jersey than are Republicans, but despite those numbers, he may come close and that would be a deeply ominous sign for the party of Joe Biden. We'll know the outcome of that race in just a few moments, of course, we'll bring it to you immediately. And then in the Commonwealth of Virginia, previously mentioned, that is the most consequential election of the year. Terry McAuliffe was once the governor of the state. He ran and won eight years ago as a moderate, a pro- business Democrat, a deal maker who didn't have time for ideology and he won big. And now he's back after four years, McAuliffe wants to run Virginia again, but this time he is a new man. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Like so many in his social class, Terry McAuliffe has gone woke. He is an apostle for Bidenism, for equity, diversity in the race-based politics of everything. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A few weeks ago, McAuliffe announced that parents no longer have the authority over their own children. Public schools in Virginia are going to force feed your kids racist propaganda and there is nothing you can do about it. If you complain, you're a white supremacist. McAuliffe said that repeatedly on television and he meant it, and then to underscore the point, Terry McAuliffe appeared at his final rally last night with his only actual constituent, that would be the head of the country's most radical teachers union, Randi Weingarten, the person who bankrolls the Democratic Party. Like Terry McAuliffe, Randi Weingarten isn't from Virginia. Like Terry McAuliffe, she has never had children in public schools, and so in that way, it was a perfect match. Here is part of what she said. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

That vision could get Glenn Youngkin elected governor. We expect it to find out tonight, and now these hiccups with the count in Fairfax County. There is a lot to assess tonight and of course, it goes without saying that we're going to begin our coverage with the great Brit Hume, FOX's senior political analyst.

It isn't all there is to the race by any means, but it's a big factor and it has weighed down Terry McAuliffe as he himself has said, not so much, Tucker, that he didn't have Biden come into the state to campaign for him because he's trying desperately to turn out a full measure of his own Democratic base, which if it all turns out, might well deliver him the vote. There are more Democrats than there are Republicans in the State of Virginia, a state which is, despite some people's claim that it is sort of purple, it's not, it's a blue state now and a win by Youngkin in there or even a very -- something very close to a win would be quite a negative message for the Democrats to receive as they look ahead to next year.",

One more thing, Tucker, we ought to take notice of and that is this. The Youngkin Campaign sought to make education and other things, but education principally, the big issue. The McAuliffe Campaign tried to make Donald Trump the biggest issue, and he tried as hard as he possibly could to tie Glenn Youngkin to Donald Trump calling him an outlier, telling some big whopper last night during the final events of the campaign that Trump was actually in the state campaigning with Youngkin, which was absolutely false, but that gives you an idea of it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Youngkin has played an interesting game where Trump is concerned. He has not criticized Trump. He did not reject his endorsement, said in fact, he was glad to receive Trump's endorsement, but he never campaigned with him, and he is certainly no Trump acolyte. Trump would like, I think, to pretend that he was, particularly if he wins, Trump will be claiming all the credit. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it may be an interesting sign of how Republicans will choose to campaign going forward, trying not to alienate the Trump base, which is very important to them, but not to tie themselves to Trump, which Democrats believe Trump to be the biggest issue in their favor.

I don't have an answer for you. I can tell you what election officials are telling us, they had an early scan, they need to do it again. They will release a partial result of that second scan sometime early this evening, and then we'll have to wait and see as for the explanation after that. But listen, population rank is one out of 103 counties and cities, it's a big deal when you're talking about this amount of votes in an election that we know is going to be tight, whether it's McAuliffe or Youngkin or who wins by a point or two, even less than that, it is going to be a tight race. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Come down here, Tucker, if I've got a moment here. This is Chesterfield. You know what are the suburbs doing without Donald Trump on the ballot? What about those members of the Republican Party that said, they are going to cast their vote somewhere else or the Independents were going to be in his favor.

I'll show you one more though because we think, you know pretty much of a bellwether for a statewide election, here you go, Tucker, 92 percent of the vote is in in Loudoun County right now, Terry McAuliffe leads 55-44, so he has just started to take a little bit of an edge here out of Glenn Youngkin's vote here. We think Youngkin needed to be at 42 at the bottom 43-44 in order to win statewide. Right now, he is at 44, so right on that margin here, and we'll see what happens with the remaining eight percent of the vote in Loudoun County. There's a ton to go through, Tucker.

I want you to think about the rural areas, think about the suburbs and a couple of these key areas. Right now, at the moment, Glenn Youngkin has to feel pretty good right now. The rural part of the state, southwestern down here, on a percentage basis now, not a real vote total, but a percentage basis, he is outperforming Donald Trump in some of these rural counties. Scott County at 89 percent. A moment ago, I was here in Lee County, he is at almost 90 percent. By comparison 11 months ago, Trump on a percentage basis was 84 and over here in Scott County, he was 83. The point is, Republicans did very well under Donald Trump last November, but at the moment, Glenn Youngkin on a percentage basis is outperforming him. That's got to be impressive for the Youngkin camp. Now, Southeastern Virginia, haven't checked in here for a while. This is Virginia Beach. This is really interesting to watch. Let's come back to the governor's race here. Currently, Youngkin is at 58 percent, Tucker, with about half of the vote in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We had Youngkin at a floor of 52 in order to do very well across the state, he is already up by six points on the floor with half the vote in. This is Norfolk right here in blue, strong Democratic area, strong African-American vote. Joe Biden won this district last November with about 71 to 72 percent of the vote with about little less than half, 41 percent. Terry McAuliffe is under performing Joe Biden on a percentage level, so we're going to keep an eye on this here and Youngkin's numbers there you see below. What's happening in the suburbs? I'll go back to Chesterfield to check in here. You've got a -- we just had a big dump here in Chesterfield of votes coming in at 85 percent. Youngkin is holding on at 55 percent. Why is that critical? We believe that he had -- his floor would have been 51 percent. So, you've got 15 percent of the vote outstanding and Youngkin is hanging on in a significant way in Chesterfield. Suburbs of Richmond critical to winning the state throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia. Loudoun County, let's see what's up, okay. We just had another cache in the votes here, you're at 98 percent and Youngkin is hanging on at 44.5 to McAuliffe's 55. Why is that important? We thought that Youngkin would have to score 42, 43, 44 at a minimum now to win statewide. So in Loudoun County, if you drop him down to 43 percent, he could still win the state based on a lot of these estimates, but so far, with two percent outstanding, Youngkin stands a very good chance of outperforming that vote there in Loudoun County. And just because we talked about it Tucker, here is Fairfax, the most populated county in the state. You're only at seven and a half percent, so you've got a lot of votes still outstanding in Fairfax. So it's 8 30 in Virginia, Tucker. Glenn Youngkin has got to be feeling pretty good, but again, this race is going to be tight throughout the entire night. Back to you.",

The opening of the borders, the surge of foreign nationals into this country, that has affected how people vote.

Who listened to the voters, who responded to their demands, who sought to help heal the wounds that they've endured, and who sucked up to their donors? And the answer to that is really clear, Terry McAuliffe, at every step of this race kept on putting his foot in his mouth on behalf of his donors.",

The answer to that is not bringing out the person who made parents miserable over the course of the last 18 months and that's what Terry McAuliffe did. He brought Randi Weingarten out, and once again stuck his thumb in the eye of parents and parents today apparently responded in force.

We're at 64 percent of the statewide voting on the screen and Youngkin is hanging onto a 55-45 lead right now. I'll show you just one county down here, this is the area of Richmond, again, Washington, D.C. is up here, Northern Virginia counties here. Richmond is yet to report, but this is Henrico County. Why am I pointing that out? This has been blue for a long time, a considerable time. We've got almost 97 percent of the vote and Terry McAuliffe is getting 54 percent of the vote. That would be good for the Democrats. But if you went back and looked at 2017, you see that Ralph Northam was up about 60 percent, so in this Democratic county alone at the moment, McAuliffe is underperforming. Why do I bring that out? Because this is the pattern we're seeing in so many places across the state where Youngkin is doing better or he is hitting the number that he needed to hit in order to get victory here. Can't call it just yet, but at 55-44 we're getting closer here in Southwestern Virginia. He is running up the numbers. We expected that, not as many votes as you find these suburbs, in these northern counties here. I'll just check in Loudoun while we have a minute right now. Here you go, Tucker. Ninety-nine percent of the vote is in, McAuliffe at 55 percent. Remember Youngkin had to get a minimum of 41 percent. That was his floor. Others expect it to be a little higher than that, but he is performing very well in Loudoun County. So, that's the picture as we see it right now. If you're in the Glenn Youngkin camp, you're pretty happy with the results thus far. It's not over, but he did some things right in this election. We can say that 11 months removed from a Joe Biden 10-point victory. And by the way, Republicans feel like they can take the Lieutenant Governor and the A.G. spot as well tonight.

      "utterance": "I want to begin with a FOX News Alert tonight. There has been a hitch in the highly anticipated count in the Virginia governor's race. Fairfax County, which is the biggest and most Democratic county in the State of Virginia will not be supplying its vote results on time. We're supposed to have early vote shortly after seven o'clock Eastern, but an hour ago, a Fairfax County official announced that there is a delay. They say they need to rescan the ballots. They're going to release a partial count quote, \"of their early vote in-person\" sometime this evening. Bill Hemmer will be tracking that for us. We're also going to talk to Brit Hume -- trying to figure out how many votes they need apparently. Just kidding. Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Exactly one year from today is the congressional midterm elections. Tonight, two governors' races in solidly Democratic states on the Eastern Seaboard may give us a preview of what could be a tsunami to come. In New Jersey where polls have just closed, finance goon, Phil Murphy who appears to have declared himself king of the long-suffering Goomba Republic faces a surprisingly sharp challenge from a Republican called Jack Ciattarelli. It seems impossible that Murphy could actually lose in a state where entire cemeteries vote. There are more than a million Democrats registered in New Jersey than are Republicans, but despite those numbers, he may come close and that would be a deeply ominous sign for the party of Joe Biden. We'll know the outcome of that race in just a few moments, of course, we'll bring it to you immediately. And then in the Commonwealth of Virginia, previously mentioned, that is the most consequential election of the year. Terry McAuliffe was once the governor of the state. He ran and won eight years ago as a moderate, a pro- business Democrat, a deal maker who didn't have time for ideology and he won big. And now he's back after four years, McAuliffe wants to run Virginia again, but this time he is a new man. Like so many in his social class, Terry McAuliffe has gone woke. He is an apostle for Bidenism, for equity, diversity in the race-based politics of everything. A few weeks ago, McAuliffe announced that parents no longer have the authority over their own children. Public schools in Virginia are going to force feed your kids racist propaganda and there is nothing you can do about it. If you complain, you're a white supremacist. McAuliffe said that repeatedly on television and he meant it, and then to underscore the point, Terry McAuliffe appeared at his final rally last night with his only actual constituent, that would be the head of the country's most radical teachers union, Randi Weingarten, the person who bankrolls the Democratic Party. Like Terry McAuliffe, Randi Weingarten isn't from Virginia. Like Terry McAuliffe, she has never had children in public schools, and so in that way, it was a perfect match. Here is part of what she said."

She said that until Terry McAuliffe was the governor eight years ago, certain people in Virginia were not quote, \"seen and respected.\" In other words, the state was a racist hell-hole and then, thank heaven, Terry McAuliffe, Bill Clinton's sketchy nearly indicted hatchet man from Upstate New York arrived and liberated the place. Terry McAuliffe is Virginia's Abe Lincoln. That's what they're telling you. It's hilarious. Here is Virginia's most famous political expert, a guy who works at a local college explaining that only bigots oppose Abe Lincoln."

That's the case all of them including their little experts are making for Terry McAuliffe they're telling the other guys are racist. Now, they're saying that because during election season, that usually works for Democrats, but what's interesting is that in this case, it is not working. Glenn Youngkin is the Republican candidate in this race. He is not a racist. He is a Christian. He is a decent uncommonly gentleman, too gentle for politics in fact, many assumed. And yet over the past few weeks, Glenn Youngkin has made a powerful and moving case for the America that most people still want, a colorblind meritocracy where all of us are judged for who we are as people, as individuals under God, and not for how we look, as a member of some group. That vision could get Glenn Youngkin elected governor. We expect it to find out tonight, and now these hiccups with the count in Fairfax County. There is a lot to assess tonight and of course, it goes without saying that we're going to begin our coverage with the great Brit Hume, FOX's senior political analyst. Brit, thanks so much for coming on. First, what do you think is going on in Fairfax County? Why does this always happen? And second, what does this race mean to the country?"

We'll just have to wait and see, I think, Tucker."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a couple of things is that the Democratic Party nationally is in trouble and voters are, you know, disappointed at Biden, angry at Biden, distressed about what other things they see about inflation. Many are distressed about what they think is going on in their schools that they didn't seem previously to be quite aware of. People were terribly disappointed in the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, and the list goes on. This is the first real opportunity that people have had to cast a ballot in objection to the sitting party in Washington against a candidate in a state race. It isn't all there is to the race by any means, but it's a big factor and it has weighed down Terry McAuliffe as he himself has said, not so much, Tucker, that he didn't have Biden come into the state to campaign for him because he's trying desperately to turn out a full measure of his own Democratic base, which if it all turns out, might well deliver him the vote. There are more Democrats than there are Republicans in the State of Virginia, a state which is, despite some people's claim that it is sort of purple, it's not, it's a blue state now and a win by Youngkin in there or even a very -- something very close to a win would be quite a negative message for the Democrats to receive as they look ahead to next year."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "utterance": "And one more thing, well, yes --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, would a loss -- would a loss here by McAuliffe, by the Democrat endorsed by the leaders of the party, would that slow down Biden's agenda? Do you think there would be a reassessment like maybe people don't love this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think it would help. You know, when the voters are turning out against your party and you've got, you know a great big controversial proposal pending and you're worried about votes peeling away and you don't have any despair, this is -- obviously, a defeat tonight would not help at all even a close call might not help. One more thing, Tucker, we ought to take notice of and that is this. The Youngkin Campaign sought to make education and other things, but education principally, the big issue. The McAuliffe Campaign tried to make Donald Trump the biggest issue, and he tried as hard as he possibly could to tie Glenn Youngkin to Donald Trump calling him an outlier, telling some big whopper last night during the final events of the campaign that Trump was actually in the state campaigning with Youngkin, which was absolutely false, but that gives you an idea of it. Youngkin has played an interesting game where Trump is concerned. He has not criticized Trump. He did not reject his endorsement, said in fact, he was glad to receive Trump's endorsement, but he never campaigned with him, and he is certainly no Trump acolyte. Trump would like, I think, to pretend that he was, particularly if he wins, Trump will be claiming all the credit. But it may be an interesting sign of how Republicans will choose to campaign going forward, trying not to alienate the Trump base, which is very important to them, but not to tie themselves to Trump, which Democrats believe Trump to be the biggest issue in their favor. It's a very interesting situation."

Hey, Bill."

      "speaker": "BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Hey, Tucker. Good evening to you. You're talking with Brit about what's happening here in Fairfax County, why is it so important? There are a lot of votes in Fairfax County, Tucker. Go back 11 months ago to the presidential election and you see the Democratic domination that Joe Biden had over Donald Trump, he is at 70 percent with 419,000 raw votes that equated to 251,000 votes in his column last November, so come to present day in the governor's race right now and you ask yourself, why do you have less than one percent of the vote in? I don't have an answer for you. I can tell you what election officials are telling us, they had an early scan, they need to do it again. They will release a partial result of that second scan sometime early this evening, and then we'll have to wait and see as for the explanation after that. But listen, population rank is one out of 103 counties and cities, it's a big deal when you're talking about this amount of votes in an election that we know is going to be tight, whether it's McAuliffe or Youngkin or who wins by a point or two, even less than that, it is going to be a tight race. Come down here, Tucker, if I've got a moment here. This is Chesterfield. You know what are the suburbs doing without Donald Trump on the ballot? What about those members of the Republican Party that said, they are going to cast their vote somewhere else or the Independents were going to be in his favor. Well, Chesterfield County right now with 83 percent of the vote in, Youngkin holds about 55 percent of the vote. His party, his team has to be very happy with this result right now in Chesterfield. I'll show you one more though because we think, you know pretty much of a bellwether for a statewide election, here you go, Tucker, 92 percent of the vote is in in Loudoun County right now, Terry McAuliffe leads 55-44, so he has just started to take a little bit of an edge here out of Glenn Youngkin's vote here. We think Youngkin needed to be at 42 at the bottom 43-44 in order to win statewide. Right now, he is at 44, so right on that margin here, and we'll see what happens with the remaining eight percent of the vote in Loudoun County. There's a ton to go through, Tucker. I'll check in with you a bit later in the hour."

      "speaker": "ZITO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this election has been about local issues, things that are very important to voters on a very community-based level -- education, security, inflation -- those are the things that they are voting on. I think the mistake that the Democrats have made is they have tried to nationalize this race and make it all about Donald Trump, but voters are more complicated than that, whether you did or did not support Trump in 2020 or 2016, these voters have moved on. They are thinking about their kids, they are thinking about their communities and that is what they are voting on, and I think that Democrats have largely missed that and I think Youngkin really tapped into understanding the aspirational notion of localism, right? Anytime you listen to him talk, he has talked about the voters. He always said, \"This is not about me, this is about you,\" and that aspirational quality was very important to voters that were very concerned about their education, about security, and about the inflation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

Like better roads, lower taxes, a safer walk to the grocery store."

They are still sort of encased in the bubble, if you ask any questions sort of about the polling, Biden will dismiss, \"Oh we're fine. Oh, they go up and down.\" They're very dismissive and not believing that they're in trouble, and they believe that voters sent them with a mandate to spend like drunken sailors. What voters sent them to Washington for was to calm things down. They've done the exact opposite and people are reacting to overreach. This is all about overreach, and it is also an inside-outside election. It is very different than a right-left election, and when it's an inside-outside election, the party that is in power traditionally loses races."

Standing outside of Youngkin's campaign bus where five young people dressed as white nationalists, pretending to support Youngkin. Naturally, the Terry McAuliffe Campaign thinking these phony white nationalists were legit immediately condemned them and Youngkin as quote \"disgusting and disqualifying.\" Well, it turns out the whole white nationalist scene was created by The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump, anti-Republican political action committee. When asked about the stunt, The Lincoln Project said, it was to remind Virginia voters that the G.O.P. embraces racist values.

It's none of your business what we're teaching your kids.\" In all the time that you've worked on this, have you come across anybody in any of those positions, teacher administrators, school union head, who has been open-minded and like talked to you, had a real dialogue as they say with you or has it been entirely dismissive?"

We actually, you know, we had a passing of one School Board member when they brought in a new individual, that individual had more Town Halls in two weeks than anyone else on that School Board and I think parents, their frustration had come from, you know not being able to hear their voice, and you know we asked for Town Halls, they don't want to -- they don't want to, you know listen. And you realize, for Loudoun, it's because they are covering up sexual assaults, and this pushes into the election where you know parents said look, I can care about my children's education. My children's education matters, and you know specifically the safety when I send them on the school bus or drop them off matters even more, and that's gravitated for a lot of people. And you know I think one side, Terry McAuliffe was saying, look, the associations and unions matter, but you have Glenn Youngkin saying parents matter and I'm going to empower you and I think that's resonated at least through this campaign."

Youngkin is ahead among economy voters by 25 points and education voters by 40 points, but the people who are most focused on the pandemic, they are going for McAuliffe by an even wider 57 point margin. Virginia has begun its recovery from pandemic shutdowns. Over half rate the state's economy positively either excellent or good, and those folks like McAuliffe. Now, at the same time, just 16 percent say they are getting ahead financially; about as many say they're falling behind. Most of them though, 66 percent say they are holding steady financially. Now, Youngkin campaigned on cutting taxes, including eliminating state and local taxes on groceries that has helped to give him a big lead among the 21 percent who say that the candidate's positions on taxes were actually the single most important factor to their vote this time around. Now, President Biden's remarks on the national economy are negative, 54 disapproved, so we'll see how much there is a link between the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe and the White House as this race continues to play out -- Tucker."

I keep hoping those are going to get better. But the shortages are continuing and the prices of all the commodities that we buy are going up drastically.

We're hearing it constantly. We purchase many tanks, propane tanks for homeowners and businesses, industrial gas tanks, CO2 tanks. The manufacturers are eight to ten months behind they tell us, and they can't even quote us prices as price of steel has already gone up at least 40 percent.

I currently have 15 openings, I can't fill them. We have a brand new welding supply store in Rockland County, New York just above New York City, I can't get it open. CDL drivers, we're trying everything we can to get those, and that's one of our major problems across the country, the bottlenecks, finding delivery drivers. We've resorted to -- my 19-year-old daughter came home from college to help me make a video we're going to use on social media for advertising to show how easy it is to deliver propane essentially. But on top of all this across the country, we have the United States Department of Transportation on February 7th is implementing new strenuous training requirements for all new permit holders to get their CDL. So essentially, for 30 years, we've had the same process. It was fairly easy to get a permit and you go out and practice. Now, they require behind the wheel documented training and authorized training center modules. So the problems we have now are going to be compounded greater February 7th, five times, I guarantee."

The rural part of the state, southwestern down here, on a percentage basis now, not a real vote total, but a percentage basis, he is outperforming Donald Trump in some of these rural counties. Scott County at 89 percent. A moment ago, I was here in Lee County, he is at almost 90 percent. By comparison 11 months ago, Trump on a percentage basis was 84 and over here in Scott County, he was 83. The point is, Republicans did very well under Donald Trump last November, but at the moment, Glenn Youngkin on a percentage basis is outperforming him. That's got to be impressive for the Youngkin camp. Now, Southeastern Virginia, haven't checked in here for a while. This is Virginia Beach. This is really interesting to watch. Let's come back to the governor's race here. Currently, Youngkin is at 58 percent, Tucker, with about half of the vote in. We had Youngkin at a floor of 52 in order to do very well across the state, he is already up by six points on the floor with half the vote in. This is Norfolk right here in blue, strong Democratic area, strong African-American vote. Joe Biden won this district last November with about 71 to 72 percent of the vote with about little less than half, 41 percent. Terry McAuliffe is under performing Joe Biden on a percentage level, so we're going to keep an eye on this here and Youngkin's numbers there you see below. What's happening in the suburbs? I'll go back to Chesterfield to check in here. You've got a -- we just had a big dump here in Chesterfield of votes coming in at 85 percent. Youngkin is holding on at 55 percent. Why is that critical? We believe that he had -- his floor would have been 51 percent. So, you've got 15 percent of the vote outstanding and Youngkin is hanging on in a significant way in Chesterfield. Suburbs of Richmond critical to winning the state throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia. Loudoun County, let's see what's up, okay. We just had another cache in the votes here, you're at 98 percent and Youngkin is hanging on at 44.5 to McAuliffe's 55. Why is that important? We thought that Youngkin would have to score 42, 43, 44 at a minimum now to win statewide. So in Loudoun County, if you drop him down to 43 percent, he could still win the state based on a lot of these estimates, but so far, with two percent outstanding, Youngkin stands a very good chance of outperforming that vote there in Loudoun County. And just because we talked about it Tucker, here is Fairfax, the most populated county in the state. You're only at seven and a half percent, so you've got a lot of votes still outstanding in Fairfax. So it's 8 30 in Virginia, Tucker. Glenn Youngkin has got to be feeling pretty good, but again, this race is going to be tight throughout the entire night. Back to you."

Glenn Youngkin defeats Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race.\" It doesn't mean that's true, it doesn't mean it's happened, but it means people who are following this really closely think Glenn Youngkin is doing better than a lot of people expected. Amazing. So that will have consequences if it's true. Elections always have consequences. One of the consequences of the presidential election a year ago was the subsequent protest at the Capitol on January 6th, and the consequence of that has been a complete reordering of the way this country works, the way we understand politics, and the way that our civil liberties are protected or stripped from us. That is the subject of the second episode of our \"Tucker Carlson Original\" series called \"Patriot Purge.\" We spent months interviewing people who were at the scene then and who have suffered the consequences since for this episode.

We are not going to do that. We can't do that. It's not official yet. And Fairfax County, most significantly the largest and most Democratic county in the State of Virginia somehow doesn't have all of its votes counted. There is going to be some kind of delay according to the McAuliffe Campaign. But again, we know that Glenn Youngkin is outperforming Donald Trump across the state. Some Members of Congress are already congratulating him, so the question is why has Glenn Youngkin done so much better than any Republican has a right to do in a very Democratic state that Joe Biden just won by 10 points? Well, there are a lot of reasons. Joe Biden is collapsing, the country is in trouble. The teachers unions have destroyed your kid's education, but immigration is also a factor in this race. The opening of the borders, the surge of foreign nationals into this country, that has affected how people vote. Now, the Biden administration is saying, they are going to send $450,000.00 to every illegal immigrant who has been traumatized by our immigration laws, reparations for illegals, hard to believe that's real, but it is. Robby Starbuck is running for Congress in the State of Tennessee. He joins us tonight to assess what we are watching in Virginia. Robby, thanks so much for coming on. I mean, this has got to be -- and again, this race has not been called, but clearly, it is trending Youngkin.

You have no right to weigh in on your own kid's education.\" We're going to give a half a million dollars to illegal aliens in reparations, like they don't say this stuff out loud.

So, they've reached this point where they are willing to be out in the open and just be totally overt about it, because this group of people have total contempt for our country. They really do for the American people, normal everyday people. They have nothing but contempt for them."

No one is calling any races on this show, that's for sure, but we're hearing it could be a good night for all three statewide Republicans running in Virginia, and again, you just cannot overstate what a departure from the expected this is. Once again, Joe Biden just won this state by 10 points. It was considered a flat out blue Democratic state. So the question is why is this happening? Crime appears to be an issue. Most people kind of liked their society, they don't want to see it disintegrate. Vince Coglianese has been covering this from across the river in Washington, D.C. where he is a leading radio show host. He joins us tonight with his analysis. Vince, thanks a lot for joining us.

      "speaker": "VINCE COGLIANESE, RADIO SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes, it absolutely is and what you're seeing is demoralized police departments at the hands of Democrats across the state, certainly in Northern Virginia and that played a role here as you saw police officers and Sheriffs deciding to side with Glenn Youngkin because they believe and the communities that they serve believe that Youngkin and the Republicans that are at the top of the ticket in this statewide election are going to be protecting these communities. So like a lot of communities around the country where Democrats have had control, you've seen more violence, you've seen more homicides, and you see communities that were left less safe. And so now, public safety is absolutely one of the factors that played into what I think were a lot of voters showing up to the polls today in Virginia."

They don't like crime. Why is this a tough lesson to learn?"

Every time he did something buffoonish, the answer was that he was serving some sort of moneyed interest and not the voters themselves. So as we look back at this race and we compare these two men and then of course, the other people who are down ticket, it's going to be a very straightforward comparison. Who listened to the voters, who responded to their demands, who sought to help heal the wounds that they've endured, and who sucked up to their donors? And the answer to that is really clear, Terry McAuliffe, at every step of this race kept on putting his foot in his mouth on behalf of his donors."

      "speaker": "COGLIANESE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's an act of total self-sabotage. I couldn't believe that Terry McAuliffe would do that. I mean, you look at these polls including from places like \"The Washington Post,\" they say education is the number one issue and your opponent, Glenn Youngkin has the edge. The answer to that is not bringing out the person who made parents miserable over the course of the last 18 months and that's what Terry McAuliffe did. He brought Randi Weingarten out, and once again stuck his thumb in the eye of parents and parents today apparently responded in force. They decided, you know what, I'm going to show up and I'm going to change who is in charge in Virginia. Again, we'll see how these results go, but things are looking very good for Glenn Youngkin."

The early vote here started on the 17th of September and we didn't get that debate until the 29th where Terry McAuliffe said out loud that parents shouldn't be telling schools what they should teach. That's a sign that early voting should not be that long. After Terry McAuliffe said that, I guarantee you, there are Democrats who regretted their vote in the Commonwealth."

We're at 64 percent of the statewide voting on the screen and Youngkin is hanging onto a 55-45 lead right now. I'll show you just one county down here, this is the area of Richmond, again, Washington, D.C. is up here, Northern Virginia counties here. Richmond is yet to report, but this is Henrico County. Why am I pointing that out? This has been blue for a long time, a considerable time. We've got almost 97 percent of the vote and Terry McAuliffe is getting 54 percent of the vote. That would be good for the Democrats. But if you went back and looked at 2017, you see that Ralph Northam was up about 60 percent, so in this Democratic county alone at the moment, McAuliffe is underperforming. Why do I bring that out? Because this is the pattern we're seeing in so many places across the state where Youngkin is doing better or he is hitting the number that he needed to hit in order to get victory here. Can't call it just yet, but at 55-44 we're getting closer here in Southwestern Virginia. He is running up the numbers. We expected that, not as many votes as you find these suburbs, in these northern counties here. I'll just check in Loudoun while we have a minute right now. Here you go, Tucker. Ninety-nine percent of the vote is in, McAuliffe at 55 percent. Remember Youngkin had to get a minimum of 41 percent. That was his floor. Others expect it to be a little higher than that, but he is performing very well in Loudoun County. So, that's the picture as we see it right now. If you're in the Glenn Youngkin camp, you're pretty happy with the results thus far. It's not over, but he did some things right in this election. We can say that 11 months removed from a Joe Biden 10-point victory. And by the way, Republicans feel like they can take the Lieutenant Governor and the A.G. spot as well tonight. But we'll see in time whether or not that becomes official. Tucker, back to you."

So Charlie Hurt is the opinion editor of \"The Washington Times,\" more significant, he is a son, a generational son of the Commonwealth of Virginia, deeply knowledgeable of its politics, culture, and people. He joins us tonight on the eve of what looks like a pretty big moment. Charlie Hurt, what do you make of this?"

      "utterance": "Finally, you had a guy and of course the way we got here was things had to get so bad that you had to have a guy come along call out the fact that you have schools poisoning our children with racist nonsense and say, you know what, this is not American, and you know what, parents don't want this. And of course, the reaction to that is people like Terry McAuliffe says, shut up, parents shouldn't have any role in this and the voters say, no, actually, you know what, we do have a role in this and we are going to blow the doors off of this thing and return sanity to politics in America."

      "utterance": "Well, so I keep thinking about that -- I've been thinking about you, I mean, not to embarrass you, but I happen to know you live in a multiracial community in Virginia, it is a multiracial state and people seem to get along pretty well actually. They don't need to have stuff ground in their face day in and day out. Why are they constantly picking the wounds that are healing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Because it is very effective in politics. It turns out that if you can't have a free and fair debate or an open debate about something, things go really bad. So if every time you open your mouth, your opponent says, \"You are a racist. You are racist.\""

      "utterance": "It turns out, that's really not a hospitable way to have a conversation. But you are right, Tucker. You know, you go into a hospital in regular normal Virginia, and you have people of all races, all creeds, everything working together to help somebody, to help a patient for example."

      "utterance": "Yes."

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "There is none of this stuff. But as soon as you turn on the TV, you turn on CNN and you listen to this, you listen to people like Terry McAuliffe, and would think this is the most racist place on Earth. It's not. People are sick and tired of it, and I haven't seen exit polling, but I guarantee you, we are going to find, there were a lot of Democrats who came out and said, you know what, I'm sick and tired of this stuff. It is all a distraction for the failures of Democrats, especially in big cities. This is a distraction, and we are going to put this stuff to bed once and for all."

      "utterance": "Amazing, amazing. Very clear at this point that Glenn Youngkin has the advantage in this race. It has not been called, but it looks like potentially Republicans can sweep all three statewide offices, which is just absolutely incredible. So after this night is over, we recommend you go watch \"Patriot Purge.\" Our second episode out today. Episode 3 be out tomorrow. It is all on tuckercarlson.com.
