Then after eight years of Obama's onerous energy regs, after he signed the disastrous Paris Accords, the Democrats hit a major roadblock with the election of Donald Trump. DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: For over 40 years America was vulnerable to foreign regimes that used energy as an economic weapon.

Oh, along with Russia, of course. Thank you very much, Joe. Joe Biden is literally begging some of the most despotic regimes around to pump more oil again, let's remember the steps that got us here. Biden's own administration took out an early hit on the oil and gas industry driving down production, which of course drove up energy costs. Then they started funding a proxy war against Russia, and launched meaningless sanctions against Russian oil, which only further stoked energy prices. And now Biden and company they're fine with high gas prices. In fact, they want high gas prices. But they knew the issue was hurting them politically. So they recklessly tap the strategic petroleum reserves, which did artificially drop the price of gas. Well, that ticked off the Saudis and OPEC and Russia. So they simply responded by saying, OK, Joe, Two can play at that market manipulation game, we're going to cut our production by 2 million barrels per day. In other words, everything Biden did backfired, and we're left holding the bag. His oil play will go down as one of the most costly, most craven and most despicable political maneuvers in recent American history. And now, Biden and company they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Americans are about to get hammered. They're even worse than before. And recession is now a certainty. But it's not Biden's fault, of course not. After all, he bragged repeatedly during the campaign of all the great relationships he had forged with foreign leaders around the world.",

But I think you put it well. And as I write in 'Only The Strong' the Democrats plan is decline my design. We don't have $5 gallon gas in this country by accident. It's not an unintended consequence. It's not bad luck, or the evil machinations of oil company executives or OPEC. It's because Joe Biden and progressive Democrats want gas to be that expensive. They want you to get out of your gas guzzling SUV or minivan, they want farmers to have to stop using diesel for tractors and other farm instruments. They think that you're going to be able to replace all these things with electric vehicles, which by the way, really are coal powered, or natural gas powered or nuclear powered vehicles, because the electricity has to come from somewhere. And it doesn't come from the sun when it's not shining or the wind when it's not blowing. And at root, Laura, what this really is, just gets back to the far left anti-capitalist views. I mean, energy literally powers our modern economy. You know, our founding fathers didn't have much different quality of life than Jesus disciples did. And that's because 1800 years on the sources of energy were the same. It's only in the last 200 years, with fossil fuels versus coal, and then oil and gas.

Going back to the Jimmy Carter era, speaking of Democratic presidents who intentionally tried to hobble American energy. These are things that steps that we can take to restore America's oil and gas production, that we can encourage more drilling, more production, not only for our own energy needs for those of our allies and partners all around the world.

And in Chicago, 2021 stats reveal less than 11.8 percent of Hispanic third graders, and only 9.7 percent of black students read at grade level. This is again, you keep saying it can't get worse. That's worse. Joining me now is Tony Kinnett, Co-Founder & Executive Director of Chalkboard Review. He's a former Indiana teacher who was fired after he exposed the nonsense was going on with CRT at the schools. Tony, when you hear people say that Democrats care about the kids that racism is keeping kids back. What are they doing via the teachers unions in the schools to cause this to happen? TONY KINNETT, CO-FOUNDER & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHALKBOARD REVIEW: Well, clearly the idea of using the exact same progressive policies over and over again, to attempt to teach reading and math in a way that is not actually shown to improve reading or math scores for any student based on any research that we've done. Trying that again and again, and accept it expecting some kind of different result is the definition of insanity. And now we are seeing these children pay the price for that kind of incompetence. And quite honestly, it's a shame to see that some of the biggest schools in our country are doing the largest amount of harm to our students who need this material the most.",

There he is. And he's a serial killer with Piglet. The horror of all of this is, people who didn't create these characters are manipulating them and maiming them in the public imagination. That's my biggest objection here. And if they wanted to get to the history of Velma, \"The New York Times\" said she is canonically a lesbian. When Hanna-Barbera created here, it was a spinoff of a character on Dobie Gillis from the 50s. This is a real far cry from the original.",

Then after eight years of Obama's onerous energy regs, after he signed the disastrous Paris Accords, the Democrats hit a major roadblock with the election of Donald Trump. DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: For over 40 years America was vulnerable to foreign regimes that used energy as an economic weapon. Americans quality of life was diminished by the idea that energy resources were too scarce to support our people. Well, the truth is that we have near limitless supplies of energy in our country, powered by new innovation and technology we are now on the cusp of a true energy revolution."

Oh, along with Russia, of course. Thank you very much, Joe. Joe Biden is literally begging some of the most despotic regimes around to pump more oil again, let's remember the steps that got us here. Biden's own administration took out an early hit on the oil and gas industry driving down production, which of course drove up energy costs. Then they started funding a proxy war against Russia, and launched meaningless sanctions against Russian oil, which only further stoked energy prices. And now Biden and company they're fine with high gas prices. In fact, they want high gas prices. But they knew the issue was hurting them politically. So they recklessly tap the strategic petroleum reserves, which did artificially drop the price of gas. Well, that ticked off the Saudis and OPEC and Russia. So they simply responded by saying, OK, Joe, Two can play at that market manipulation game, we're going to cut our production by 2 million barrels per day. In other words, everything Biden did backfired, and we're left holding the bag. His oil play will go down as one of the most costly, most craven and most despicable political maneuvers in recent American history. And now, Biden and company they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Americans are about to get hammered. They're even worse than before. And recession is now a certainty.

But I think you put it well. And as I write in 'Only The Strong' the Democrats plan is decline my design. We don't have $5 gallon gas in this country by accident. It's not an unintended consequence. It's not bad luck, or the evil machinations of oil company executives or OPEC. It's because Joe Biden and progressive Democrats want gas to be that expensive. They want you to get out of your gas guzzling SUV or minivan, they want farmers to have to stop using diesel for tractors and other farm instruments. They think that you're going to be able to replace all these things with electric vehicles, which by the way, really are coal powered, or natural gas powered or nuclear powered vehicles, because the electricity has to come from somewhere. And it doesn't come from the sun when it's not shining or the wind when it's not blowing. And at root, Laura, what this really is, just gets back to the far left anti-capitalist views. I mean, energy literally powers our modern economy. You know, our founding fathers didn't have much different quality of life than Jesus disciples did. And that's because 1800 years on the sources of energy were the same. It's only in the last 200 years, with fossil fuels versus coal, and then oil and gas. And then you add nuclear power into that mix that we've achieved true energy."

We did this in the late Obama era. Once we went back the senate and the house in 2015 for instance, we lifted the 40-year old ban on oil exports. Going back to the Jimmy Carter era, speaking of Democratic presidents who intentionally tried to hobble American energy. These are things that steps that we can take to restore America's oil and gas production, that we can encourage more drilling, more production, not only for our own energy needs for those of our allies and partners all around the world. Again the Biden administration, the Democrats are doing this on purpose. They recognize the political danger of it, though, that's why they're taking such risky steps like this."

And I want to know who was responsible. I want to see the emails. And I think you guys are perfectly positioned, if you get the Senate to take charge of this matter, because we can't let this happen again, this is too important. Senator, I can't wait to read your book. Thank you so much. Now, on top of what they're doing to our oil reserves, they're trashing our schools. This tonight from Illinois, a new report by the group West Wirepoints, reveals that children in Illinois schools aren't performing at even the most basic level, and it's hitting minorities especially hard. Now statewide in 2019, even before the pandemic, just 36 percent of all third graders were reading at grade level, 36 percent. Now that goes down to 27 percent for Hispanic students and 22 percent for black students. Now it gets worse when you look at the cities and Decatur 17 percent of Hispanic third graders and 2 percent of black students read at grade level 2 percent. And in Chicago, 2021 stats reveal less than 11.8 percent of Hispanic third graders, and only 9.7 percent of black students read at grade level. This is again, you keep saying it can't get worse. That's worse. Joining me now is Tony Kinnett, Co-Founder & Executive Director of Chalkboard Review. He's a former Indiana teacher who was fired after he exposed the nonsense was going on with CRT at the schools. Tony, when you hear people say that Democrats care about the kids that racism is keeping kids back. What are they doing via the teachers unions in the schools to cause this to happen? TONY KINNETT, CO-FOUNDER & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHALKBOARD REVIEW: Well, clearly the idea of using the exact same progressive policies over and over again, to attempt to teach reading and math in a way that is not actually shown to improve reading or math scores for any student based on any research that we've done. Trying that again and again, and accept it expecting some kind of different result is the definition of insanity. And now we are seeing these children pay the price for that kind of incompetence. And quite honestly, it's a shame to see that some of the biggest schools in our country are doing the largest amount of harm to our students who need this material the most."

Now the share of students who passed the math exam fell 12 percentage points from 31 points percent before the pandemic to 19 percent in 2022. That's the lowest ever recorded in D.C.

And again, she's another person, she's not -- the other Democrats in Texas kind of run to the right of maybe Republicans in Massachusetts. It's not a particularly leftwing state at the local level. But all these Democrats are still in trouble. They're getting rightwing challengers. And what we see generally in the Rio Grande Valley is going to show it. Today the \"Cook Political Report\" came out and said this is actually leaning towards Mayra for the first time. So all this, the whole summer of Joe Biden has got his aviators back, that seems to be puttering out in real time."

That's my biggest objection here. And if they wanted to get to the history of Velma, \"The New York Times\" said she is canonically a lesbian.

What we are seeing is if you offer the voters your January 6th investigation or your LGBTQ priorities, or your climate change, it doesn't affect them. It doesn't touch them.
