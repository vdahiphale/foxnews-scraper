The media is freaking out after months of legal drama and uncertainty. Elon Musk is closing in on his blockbuster deal to buy Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free speech. The world's richest man making a surprise offer to go through with his bid to buy the social media giant on the terms he originally agreed to. Some in the press are now very concerned about it with one reporter warning that the outcome of the midterms could be impacted. Tweeting this, for those of you asking. Yes, I do think this site can and will change pretty dramatically if Musk gets full control over it. No, there is no immediate replacement if it gets done early enough based on the people he's aligned with, yes, it could actually affect the midterms. And others in the media don't like it either.",

I mean, it's a value, it's a kind of a value neutral term, but you know what they're talking about. They're telling you that they know the jig is up. Right? They're like, it's like when squatters realize that the owners coming back to their house and they better cover up the rug stains, you know, with furniture and get the heck out. That's what's happening right now. I think they do realize they had a free run on this thing. but you got to remember, you know, there's a lot of interesting things that most people aren't on Twitter. The problem is the people who are on Twitter are the media specifically, and they mistakenly believe that the attitudes and assumptions on Twitter reflect the country's thoughts. No, it's actually just the media cycling through their own thoughts over and over again. And it's interesting because these are the people that use and abuse Twitter most, and they're the people who need it least. Right? If you're in the media you already have your, what do you call it, your megaphone. And yet they run to Twitter and they need it even more. So, there's a sense of desperation that they're kind of losing. They're losing a crutch. Twitter was their crutch. They could actually find their opinions from Twitter. It was like a little opinion tree. Like if you didn't know what to think about, let's say, gender affirmation surgery, and it's so complicated. You can go and pick your little opinion off Twitter and just say, this will, you know, this'll help reduce, you know, the mental anguish of a confused teen or whatever you want. Or if there's something about education, you could pick that opinion that says, you know what? These are domestic terrorists. You know who are threatening the teacher's unions. They have it all preset for you. You can just pull them out. But they're very selfish because they got what they wanted out of this deal with Twitter. They already got Biden elected, right?

You couldn't get a drink order, and you know, the police chief and the mayor would sit in the back and kind of run things and they got everything calm. And then all of a sudden, half the regulars were like, this place is great. And the other regulars like, this place sucks now.

It's October 17th, the trial going forward, but it was just report about half an hour ago that an Apollo Global Management who was doing the preferred financing, has pulled out of the deal. I mean, this is not a fin -- a completed situation here. The question is not about free speech. It's about the line between free speech and misinformation for liberals. And that's a difficult line to tread because this was particularly important during the COVID pandemic when the governments, both the Trump administration and then the Biden administration were working with the social media companies to make sure that there was not that information getting about the disease itself, about the vaccine, et cetera.

The media is freaking out after months of legal drama and uncertainty. Elon Musk is closing in on his blockbuster deal to buy Twitter with the stated goal of restoring free speech. The world's richest man making a surprise offer to go through with his bid to buy the social media giant on the terms he originally agreed to. Some in the press are now very concerned about it with one reporter warning that the outcome of the midterms could be impacted. Tweeting this, for those of you asking. Yes, I do think this site can and will change pretty dramatically if Musk gets full control over it. No, there is no immediate replacement if it gets done early enough based on the people he's aligned with, yes, it could actually affect the midterms. And others in the media don't like it either."

I mean, it's a value, it's a kind of a value neutral term, but you know what they're talking about. They're telling you that they know the jig is up. Right? They're like, it's like when squatters realize that the owners coming back to their house and they better cover up the rug stains, you know, with furniture and get the heck out. That's what's happening right now. I think they do realize they had a free run on this thing. but you got to remember, you know, there's a lot of interesting things that most people aren't on Twitter. The problem is the people who are on Twitter are the media specifically, and they mistakenly believe that the attitudes and assumptions on Twitter reflect the country's thoughts. No, it's actually just the media cycling through their own thoughts over and over again. And it's interesting because these are the people that use and abuse Twitter most, and they're the people who need it least. Right? If you're in the media you already have your, what do you call it, your megaphone. And yet they run to Twitter and they need it even more. So, there's a sense of desperation that they're kind of losing. They're losing a crutch. Twitter was their crutch. They could actually find their opinions from Twitter. It was like a little opinion tree. Like if you didn't know what to think about, let's say, gender affirmation surgery, and it's so complicated. You can go and pick your little opinion off Twitter and just say, this will, you know, this'll help reduce, you know, the mental anguish of a confused teen or whatever you want. Or if there's something about education, you could pick that opinion that says, you know what? These are domestic terrorists. You know who are threatening the teacher's unions. They have it all preset for you. You can just pull them out. But they're very selfish because they got what they wanted out of this deal with Twitter. They already got Biden elected, right?

This guy bumped into my shoulder on the way back from the bathroom and they complained to management. And management was kind of in step with the regs and said, all right, we're going to do some things. We're going to hire a bouncer, you know, we're going to have a little VIP room in the back. We're going to have a dress code that we're going to enforce. And then things started changing, right? They started not letting people in. You couldn't get a drink order, and you know, the police chief and the mayor would sit in the back and kind of run things and they got everything calm. And then all of a sudden, half the regulars were like, this place is great. And the other regulars like, this place sucks now.

But I think that what's so amazing about this is that everyone on the left is screaming, you know, my gosh, it's going to affect the election quotes like, \"be afraid they're going to reshape the election.\" They're going to, you know, and it's so -- it's so typical of the hypocrisy of the left where everything they're afraid of happening, they've already done. You know, it's like Bobulinski was just saying in the sound, you know, had I been able to talk to the American people, had this information not been suppressed on social media about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, that election might not have been that turned out the way it did turn out. But now they're saying, my gosh, free speech. We can't have free speech. And it shows you how quickly the left has moved its agenda where we have to fight and say, hey, it's a good thing. Freedom of speech is a good thing when people are saying, no, it's wrong. People will be able to say things. But you know, they -- it's just a hypocrisy that is so obvious and the employees are freaked out and they're, what are they saying?

They wanted more transparency about how the algorithm worked, and they thought that that was important for their employees. Now, I don't know how many of those executives are going to be around after he does take over if he does. You're right. It's October 17th, the trial going forward, but it was just report about half an hour ago that an Apollo Global Management who was doing the preferred financing, has pulled out of the deal. I mean, this is not a fin -- a completed situation here. The question is not about free speech. It's about the line between free speech and misinformation for liberals. And that's a difficult line to tread because this was particularly important during the COVID pandemic when the governments, both the Trump administration and then the Biden administration were working with the social media companies to make sure that there was not that information getting about the disease itself, about the vaccine, et cetera. And I think that's what people's principal concern is here. And I'm waiting for Elon Musk to give a good answer besides, you know, I'm going to reinstate Donald Trump and I'm going to let all of you know, get rid of all of the bots. What are you going to do about the fact that people do use these tools to spread falsehoods that are potentially dangerous to their health, for instance? I know they have huge armies monitoring."

So, he's saying to everybody, you know what? You're taking your life in your hand if you're going to go after someone's -- go into someone's home and try to rob it. But what I liked about what he said, I've never heard anyone in the past year used the word foreigner. All I hear is illegal. Or I hear a migrant, immigrant. He said, these people are foreigners. They don't belong here. They shouldn't be here. And they are hitting us at the point when we are most vulnerable in our homes and in our businesses and when we have no place to sleep, essentially.

The other thing that this administration doesn't admit is that they -- because of their work with the Iranians and the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, both of those things have pushed the Saudis closer to Russia and China. And so, that policy is playing out while they're also refusing to -- when Trump was in office, he had this deal. He said, we could refill the strategic petroleum reserves at $24.00 a barrel. We should take that deal. Are you with me? And Chuck Schumer is like heck, no, we're not. We are not for that. We are not going to do anything. So, now we're looking at $100 a barrel. It's supposed to be our emergency reserves and they're releasing it today and saying here's how we're going to help you to get through the Midterms. They're going to release 10 million more barrels.

Rumors of a rocky relationship have been following the pair since Brady's decision to return to the NFL.

Men pursue this mission, and traditionally, the wife is there to support that mission. She was responsible for him leaving New England. I heard that from a very trusted source. She said, Tom, you don't need Belichick. You could do this by yourself. You're not getting enough credit. So, he goes down to Tampa, wins the Super Bowl, loses in the playoffs, and he comes back and retires. This whole thing was her idea to leave Boston and go down and win rings in Florida.

They have options that you don't, right? They have rich, beautiful people. They have this -- their suffering is that they can't stick to one thing, because there's always something better. There's always something younger. You know, most people don't have Tom and Gisele's options. As a world- famous celebrity, I understand this. Options to many are the forbidden fruit, but for people like me, they are the fruit. They are everywhere. I could pick them at any time. And so, it makes the most perfect and beautiful marriage even more vulnerable than the high school janitor married to his high school sweetheart. That could be a stronger marriage because that's the only I option either of them had. But they can have -- like, if she wants to, she could date me but I'm obviously, you know, in a relationship but I've could -- you know, I could weigh the options, right?
