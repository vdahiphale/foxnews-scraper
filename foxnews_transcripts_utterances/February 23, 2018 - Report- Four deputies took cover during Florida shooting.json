So, I place a lot of the blame on the school board with that and some of the programs that they've initiated with the state attorney and the sheriff's office in the years past.

The NRA stands for supporting these shooting sports and the high school (inaudible) team there at Stoneman Douglas High School, which it was in the district that I represented. It was to support their shooting sports team, their marksmanship team, who used Kevlar mats to shield a lot of those students, some of those cadets did. And when I think about Enterprise and some of these other companies, we don't see anyone going out and attacking beer wholesalers or alcohol distributors when we have deaths due to dui or things of this nature. And for that student that assaulted -- well, you know, verbally assaulted Senator Marco Rubio, what about Planned Parenthood? The $568.7 million that they get as an abortion provider and that's blood money. But what incenses me more than anything else, no one remembers in the United States of America remembers the name Steven Wiliford. Steven Wiliford is an NRA member.

      "sentences": "Judges matter. Let's take gun legislation. Now, even if the president and the Republican Congress are successful in pressing his agenda, judges with radical outlooks can undo it all. That applies to a whole host of issues. This is why it's so critical for President Trump to nominate and seek confirmed as many judges as possible on both the district and appellate courts. Since Trump took office, check this out, major initiatives have been stalled or stopped altogether by the courts, including his travel ban on some majority Muslim countries, his plans to withhold funds from those sanctuary cities, his plan to rescind the DACA program, and just yesterday, his plan to end Obama-era oil and gas emission regs. And let's not forget the ban on transgender people serving in the military. So just his first nine in months in office, cities or states filed 24 lawsuits against the president. According to Reuters, Obama was not subjected to similar lawsuits during the same time period. Now a few weeks ago, New York District Court Judge Nicholas Garaufis (ph), a Clinton appointee blocked President Trump's decision to end Obama's DACA program. He's the second federal judge to do so. Now, Judge Nick Garaufis is an interesting character. When the DACA case landed on his bench last year, he reacted like an MSNBC pundit. He claimed that the president's ending the DACA program was, quote, \"arbitrary and capricious.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Gracias, Judge Luis Gutierrez. This judge has a history of editorializing from the bench and it ends up being like legislating from the bench. Americans didn't elect Judge Garaufis to change our immigration policy. Certainly not the authority of the executive to enact sensible immigration regulation. He was appointed to be a check on other branches of government, not a replacement for them. So, if he wants to get into legislating, he should take off his long black robe, pound the pavement, and then run for office. And by the way, this isn't the first time that that judge crossed the line from impartial jurist to policymaker. In 2012, he imposed racial quotas on the New York City Fire Department as a way to address the complaints from minorities who failed the department's entrance exams. Now, declaring the fire department a, quote, \"bastion of white male privilege,\" Judge Garaufis required the department to hire two black firefighters and one Hispanic for every five hired. Now, parts of his ruling were later vacated by the appeals court that questioned his impartiality. They barred him from presiding over future trials relating to the case. That's how bad it was. Sadly, no one barred him from ruling on the DACA program. Frankly, he should have recused himself because his liberal bias was that obvious. Garaufis sat on the bench and repeatedly slammed the president for his, quote, \"recurring redundant drumbeat of anti-Latino commentary,\" \"recurring redundant drumbeat,\" isn't that whole thing redundant. Oh, my gosh, just bad writing. Now, come on, Judge Garaufis was blatant in his disdain for the president and his policies. Then the chief judge of the fourth circuit court of appeals, Roger Gregory, wrote the majority opinion blocking the president's travel ban. Now, that's a different circuit. It's the second time the fourth circuit has pulled this routine. This time Judge Gregory, a George W. Bush appointee believe it or not, claims that the president's travel restriction on six largely Muslim countries is unconstitutionally tainted with an animus toward Islam. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For 285 unbelievably twisted pages the ruling tries to turn Trump's campaign rhetoric into a legal argument. Gregory writes that the travel ban drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination. It sounds like he's talking about his own opinion. They say the ban is an attempt to establish a national religion that excludes Muslims. That's what the fourth circuit ruled. We're going to see how that reasoning holds up at the Supreme Court, which by the way has just announced that it's going to review these travel ban decisions on April 25th. Political grandstanding by jurists, the type that we just talked about, whether from the bench or public forums, we saw what Justice Ginsburg said the other day about the bullying during the election, Hillary and the sexism, all of that ends up undermining confidence in the courts and it certainly compromises our view of an impartial judiciary. And that goes, as I said, for the notorious RBG, Ginsburg, as well. The left wants to do through the courts what they couldn't achieve at the ballot box. It's so transparent to me. Obama certainly knew this game. He was able to stack the federal bench with 334 judges. Clinton appointed 387 judges. And President Trump, well, he understands the threat posed by an activist judiciary. The president has had to deal with activist judges working against him ever since he took office.",

He called out the location, called in other support units arriving for backup. But at that point, he stopped there of what he needed to do. As law enforcement officials, we know that every day when we go to work, that there's a chance that we may not come home to our family members, and we accept that responsibility. And when we hear an active shooter, I don't care if it's within a school, a mall, a house or an office building, when you are the first person there on scene, every second that you delay going into that building and every single gunfire that you hear from inside that building, that means that there's another innocent life being lost and it's unacceptable not to go inside that building.

I don't doubt the actions of some of the Coral Springs police officers that were there that day.

You don't stand outside, you go in. That's like the firefighters at 9/11. They went up in the building when everyone else is leaving. That's your job. That's what you do. That's the danger of being a police officer. But you made comments about the school board in Broward County and lay some blame frankly on them for what happened. Explain that to us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BELL",
      "utterance": "Yes, I do. I think that's the one entity in this whole conversation that has not been brought up. Some of the fault of put on the Broward County school board. For years they know that the schools have been soft targets. They claim that they want to have better police presence inside the schools and they want tougher security, but yet they do not want to cough up the money to pay for that better security and fortify their schools and have better designs, they don't want that. And then when they are fortunate enough to have a school resource deputy on scene, an armed police presence, a lot of the liberal-thinking principals on campus there don't want the police officers making arrests on campus and don't want the drugs to be found on campus and don't want the warrants to be served on campus because it looks like bad stats at the school. So, I place a lot of the blame on the school board with that and some of the programs that they've initiated with the state attorney and the sheriff's office in the years past. For example, the promise program, nobody wants to fill the jails with juveniles. Every police officer will agree on that. So, the promise program is an intervention program where we can stop filling the jails with kids and get them into some alternative programs. But the problem is when that program started, we took all discretion away from the law enforcement officers to affect an arrest if we choose to. Now there's a lot of parents out there screaming for help in terms of mental health services and family intervention for services."

It's the person behind the gun that is the problem. And the problem that we face here today is not going to be a central fix and I'm afraid to say that I don't even think that there's going to be an outcome that will fix this problem. Because until we can link the mental health records into the criminal background checks that we do to purchase a firearm, we won't see if a person has a mental health issue.

It was to support their shooting sports team, their marksmanship team, who used Kevlar mats to shield a lot of those students, some of those cadets did. And when I think about Enterprise and some of these other companies, we don't see anyone going out and attacking beer wholesalers or alcohol distributors when we have deaths due to dui or things of this nature. And for that student that assaulted -- well, you know, verbally assaulted Senator Marco Rubio, what about Planned Parenthood? The $568.7 million that they get as an abortion provider and that's blood money. But what incenses me more than anything else, no one remembers in the United States of America remembers the name Steven Wiliford. Steven Wiliford is an NRA member. He is also an NRA-trained firearms instructor and he was the one that ran to the sound of the guns in Sutherland Springs, Texas at the First Baptist Church. And he was the one that took down that assailant and no one is talking about that. But yet we have the Broward County officers that did not run to the sound of the gun. So, I don't think the NRA should be demonized."

But there was red flag -- it seems like there was mistakes made on the ground. The guy was obviously -- it was tipped that he was going to shoot up a school, at least a few tips that he was going to shoot up the school. Nothing. And it's the NRA's fault? I've got to go to the CNN forum and Michelle, I want to react to this. We had Andrew Klein on our show last night. He is the father of daughter, Ariana Klein. She is a survivor of the shooting.

These are partisan political ones. In the past, they have tried to pass off as, quote/unquote, \"undecided voters,\" people who are working for various Democratic political campaigns or Democratic office holders. It is no surprise. And I think it's interesting because on the one hand, the left is always saying, believe the children. Listen to the children. But when certain children and their parents are telling the truth about the manipulation of this fake news, all of the sudden, they are subject to this kind of criticism from the likes of Jake Tapper, who really is a disgrace. He abdicated his journalistic responsibility and now we are finding out more and more what did this Sheriff Israel know when he was sitting on the stage mauling Marco Rubio and Dana Loesch like lions in the den. You know, it is the collusion, I believe, between the social justice administrators of that school district who adopted radical liberal alternative conflict resolution policies all for the cause of political correctness and eradicating the fact that there were percentages of minority students.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Judges matter. Let's take gun legislation. Now, even if the president and the Republican Congress are successful in pressing his agenda, judges with radical outlooks can undo it all. That applies to a whole host of issues. This is why it's so critical for President Trump to nominate and seek confirmed as many judges as possible on both the district and appellate courts. Since Trump took office, check this out, major initiatives have been stalled or stopped altogether by the courts, including his travel ban on some majority Muslim countries, his plans to withhold funds from those sanctuary cities, his plan to rescind the DACA program, and just yesterday, his plan to end Obama-era oil and gas emission regs. And let's not forget the ban on transgender people serving in the military. So just his first nine in months in office, cities or states filed 24 lawsuits against the president. According to Reuters, Obama was not subjected to similar lawsuits during the same time period. Now a few weeks ago, New York District Court Judge Nicholas Garaufis (ph), a Clinton appointee blocked President Trump's decision to end Obama's DACA program. He's the second federal judge to do so. Now, Judge Nick Garaufis is an interesting character. When the DACA case landed on his bench last year, he reacted like an MSNBC pundit. He claimed that the president's ending the DACA program was, quote, \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Gracias, Judge Luis Gutierrez. This judge has a history of editorializing from the bench and it ends up being like legislating from the bench. Americans didn't elect Judge Garaufis to change our immigration policy. Certainly not the authority of the executive to enact sensible immigration regulation. He was appointed to be a check on other branches of government, not a replacement for them. So, if he wants to get into legislating, he should take off his long black robe, pound the pavement, and then run for office. And by the way, this isn't the first time that that judge crossed the line from impartial jurist to policymaker. In 2012, he imposed racial quotas on the New York City Fire Department as a way to address the complaints from minorities who failed the department's entrance exams. Now, declaring the fire department a, quote, \"bastion of white male privilege,\" Judge Garaufis required the department to hire two black firefighters and one Hispanic for every five hired. Now, parts of his ruling were later vacated by the appeals court that questioned his impartiality. They barred him from presiding over future trials relating to the case. That's how bad it was. Sadly, no one barred him from ruling on the DACA program. Frankly, he should have recused himself because his liberal bias was that obvious. Garaufis sat on the bench and repeatedly slammed the president for his, quote, \"recurring redundant drumbeat of anti-Latino commentary,\" \"recurring redundant drumbeat,\" isn't that whole thing redundant. Oh, my gosh, just bad writing. Now, come on, Judge Garaufis was blatant in his disdain for the president and his policies. Then the chief judge of the fourth circuit court of appeals, Roger Gregory, wrote the majority opinion blocking the president's travel ban. Now, that's a different circuit. It's the second time the fourth circuit has pulled this routine. This time Judge Gregory, a George W. Bush appointee believe it or not, claims that the president's travel restriction on six largely Muslim countries is unconstitutionally tainted with an animus toward Islam. For 285 unbelievably twisted pages the ruling tries to turn Trump's campaign rhetoric into a legal argument. Gregory writes that the travel ban drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination. It sounds like he's talking about his own opinion. They say the ban is an attempt to establish a national religion that excludes Muslims. That's what the fourth circuit ruled. We're going to see how that reasoning holds up at the Supreme Court, which by the way has just announced that it's going to review these travel ban decisions on April 25th. Political grandstanding by jurists, the type that we just talked about, whether from the bench or public forums, we saw what Justice Ginsburg said the other day about the bullying during the election, Hillary and the sexism, all of that ends up undermining confidence in the courts and it certainly compromises our view of an impartial judiciary. And that goes, as I said, for the notorious RBG, Ginsburg, as well. The left wants to do through the courts what they couldn't achieve at the ballot box. It's so transparent to me. Obama certainly knew this game. He was able to stack the federal bench with 334 judges. Clinton appointed 387 judges. And President Trump, well, he understands the threat posed by an activist judiciary. The president has had to deal with activist judges working against him ever since he took office."

Nevertheless, a lot of work remains to be done. The only way to counter the excesses of life tenured judges like Garaufis is for Trump to fill the bench with his own jurists, men and women who stay within their constitutional boundaries. Meanwhile, we'll continue on this show to expose the arbitrary and capricious rulings of judges who frustrate the public will and exceed their article three authority. And that's the Angle. Joining us now for reaction, just outside the Washington D.C., he's at CPAC, Nigel Farage, Fox News contributor and former UK Independence Party leader. All right, Nigel, you're there at CPAC with all those judges.

Very, very important. But he needs to make sure that he keeps majority of both of those houses in the midterms. So how does he keep the Trump revolution rolling? I tell you something, I shared a platform with his in Mississippi back in the presidential campaign. He went around the country speaking to big audiences. He's a wonderful motivator. But what I saw today was a president in a different gear, a president who was using humor, a president who was light, a president who even told a joke against himself about his own bald patch. And I think if Trump goes around the country in the run-up to these midterms and performs anything like he did today at CPAC, he will keep his momentum going and that'll lead through to everything he needs to do."
