And then there is a reaction to what he says that focuses on what the media usually feel is false or problematic in some other way, and they focus on that to the exclusion of the larger conversation. And then Trump fans focused only on what they liked about what he said, what was true, and they decline to talk about the problematic aspects of it. So this conversation is not very fruitful right now from either the Trump White House or the establishment response to it. And just to take an example, Mitt Romney had a tweet last night where he said that something to the effect of these white nationalists are just completely evil. But the people fighting them are all pure of heart. I don't remember exactly what he said. And this is exactly what is so frustrating to people, that we cannot acknowledge just the reality that of course, everyone, most everyone should, of course, condemn white nationalism and other racists. And it's also true that we do have a really serious problem in this country with leftist violence. And the inability of even Republican leaders to just admit that reality, which is just factually true, that's actually just what happened even in this last weekend where you had violence on one side -- you had the murderous violence of the racists and also violence on the other side, it makes it very difficult to have a fruitful conversation.",

He thought they were just positioning for 2020. So it was the case in this instance and in many others that if Republicans do the right thing, they're treated as political actors, and when they don't do the right thing then they are condemned or criticized for being silent by the mainstream media. That's an entirely valid point. It's a good argument. I just think in this instance the argument that matters most is the Donald Trump argument. This is mostly a Donald Trump story if you look at the kinds of things that he said first Saturday, and then he seems to calibrate his argument, as you suggest, on Monday, and then he undid it yesterday. And he undid it by saying things that, again, seemed to be untrue or misleading or taking liberties with the truth, however you want to characterize it. He talked about many of the people as a part of this rally were good, were very fine people. You talk to people who were actually there among the crowd and they say no, that's not actually true.",

What Mollie is referring to is a tweet by Eric Lipton, a reporter with The New York Times who said he was cynical about Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio actually condemning Donald Trump, or urging Donald Trump to condemn white supremacists on the merits. He thought they were just positioning for 2020. So it was the case in this instance and in many others that if Republicans do the right thing, they're treated as political actors, and when they don't do the right thing then they are condemned or criticized for being silent by the mainstream media. That's an entirely valid point. It's a good argument. I just think in this instance the argument that matters most is the Donald Trump argument. This is mostly a Donald Trump story if you look at the kinds of things that he said first Saturday, and then he seems to calibrate his argument, as you suggest, on Monday, and then he undid it yesterday. And he undid it by saying things that, again, seemed to be untrue or misleading or taking liberties with the truth, however you want to characterize it. He talked about many of the people as a part of this rally were good, were very fine people. You talk to people who were actually there among the crowd and they say no, that's not actually true."

      "utterance": "Well, that's the whole point is I don't know that a whole lot of people knew there was economic council. But it compounds this idea that the president, who right now is sitting at a 38 percent approval rating, does not have control over his administration, right? This is just one more not particularly good story on top of bad. And the question I think going forward is whether he can get that back. Is, at some point are voters going to give him any benefit of the doubt? And it slowly is chipping away at that. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
