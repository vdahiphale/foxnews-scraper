Last time I was down with Governor Perry, then governor at the time, sat in a security briefing, 642,000 crimes committed against Texans alone in a seven-year period. In just the past two years alone, 4,000 criminal aliens have been arrested for homicide. In fact, over the past two decades. Criminal immigrants have been responsible for tense of thousands of murders. Now, to these families, our fellow Americans, that crisis is always present. Their lives have been devastated, forever altered, their loved ones murdered. And yet, hate Trump Democrats, hate Trump talking point media people, they are to suggest this is a manufactured crisis? Really? We're talking about an all too common occurrence. It should never happen. Law abiding men and women killed by illegal immigrants that don't respect our laws, our sovereignty, our borders.

Some had previously been deported, all gaining access, because our southern border is wide open. And sadly, this is only one aspect of the crisis at our southern border. Over the past two years, 30,000 criminal aliens arrested for sex crimes, over a hundred thousand were violent assaults. In 2018, 800 gang members apprehended at our southern border. That's a 50 percent increase over the previous year. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yes, last year, we also saw 122 percent increase in fentanyl being smuggled across the southern border. Do you know fentanyl? That's the drug killing Americans every single day in this country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Fentanyl, the deadly substance, often mixed with heroin. Remember heroin? Ninety percent of that, smuggled across our southern boarder. And keep in mind, every seven days, 300 Americans will die from a heroin over dose. That death toll is equal to the number of American troops killed every week in Vietnam, during 1968. That was the deadliest year of that war. So, is that a manufactured crisis? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last year, 17,000 individuals with criminal records apprehended trying to cross the border. Sixty thousand inadmissible or illegal immigrants turned away from our borders every single month. And over the last few weeks, 20,000 children, smuggled or trafficked into the United States. This is not a manufactured crisis or a talking point. Those children matter, those women mater. Those Americans being killed by addiction matter. We talk about the opioid epidemic in the country all the time, this is a big part of it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so do the human beings, by the way, on the other side of the border. Totally understand that 98 percent that want a better life for themselves, their family, their children, their grandchildren, but one out of every three migrant women, who make that dangerous trip, try to make it into the United States, hoping for a better life. They're sexually assaulted and 7 in 10 migrants reported being victim during that trek. It's an arduous journey. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And average of 50 children each day require emergency and medical care after they arrive at the southern border. And you have thousands of illegal immigrants, they have died trying to cross unfamiliar deserts, in unsecured regions of our border. And don't forget about the risks that are posed to our national security, unvetted, illegal immigrants from all over the world use our unsecured southern border in order to gain access to the United States. Sara Carter recently took a trip to the border, actually interviewed two individuals. They're from Bangladesh. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look.",

And yet, the solution they once supported is effective. We know the law works. After completion of the wall, south of San Diego, illegal traffic drops by approximately 92 percent. The wall in El Paso, Texas, resulted in a significant drop as it did, walls in Tucson and Yuma, Arizona, where they extended one wall from five miles to 65 miles, it drops 95 percent.

He's also requesting increased border patrol, and ICE personnel, and an increase in detention capacity and humanitarian resources and counter smuggling tools along with other important technology. It's not a radical plan. It's a plan to keep America safe. It address what is is an urgent serious crisis. So let me say, I understand, by the way, the concerns. Twenty-five percent partial government shutdown are furloughed. Workers furloughed. Look, I've been there in my life, living paycheck to paycheck. It's not fun.

The clashes with border patrol agents, rocks, bottles thrown, chaos, destruction, they also -- that's not manufactured, that's real. Democrats, remember, it wasn't a manufactured crisis because they were politically bludgeoning Trump over the family separation issue, something he eventually stopped that happened in the previous two administrations. It wasn't a manufactured crisis for the Democrats or the media when they were bludgeoning our brave border patrol officers who had to use tear gas after they were being pelted with rocks and bottles. Remember, the left accused them of gassing children. So, Pelosi, Schumer, the rest of the Democratic Party and the media want to stay on manufactured crisis and allow this to continue and play a political game?

So, within 10 minutes of being at the Rio Grande River, on the border, these two men came up to me. They were coming up the road. They apparently thought that I was law enforcement, I was there with an off duty law enforcement officer and I got to tell you, their story was very compelling. Remember, Bangladesh is a special interest country, so these are special interest aliens. And what that means is people from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other nations that are considered special interest aliens. And what that means is, people from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and other nations that are considered special interests aliens, are from countries where either Al-Qaeda, Islamic State other various terrorist groups have had influence. So these two men seemed perfectly fine. They - I had to explain to them that I was a journalist. They agreed to talk with me. They eventually did. Had little bit of understanding of English and they were able to explain that they went from Bangladesh to Dubai through Brazil. And once they get into Brazil, Sean, then they're either going through Costa Rica, Colombia then all the way up through central - sorry I'm at an outdoor area. Then they go all the way up through Central America and into Mexico. And then from Mexico they make their way into the United States.

So, yes, I would imagine that that wouldn't be the case. But remember what the media tenor was going into yesterday's address. We were told, almost guaranteed, the President is going to lie. That the networks needed to deliberate even to carry the speech on their networks without either delay or at all because they needed to fact-check it first. They were demanding that a text of the context of the speech was supposed to be given to them. But then a funny thing happened. The fact checkers didn't have a heck of a lot to do. So then they started to injecting their opinions into the fact checks. I mean, if you saw The Washington Post yesterday, they actually fact-checked the President when he said, the 266,000 illegal aliens were arrested over the last two years. And they said this quoting, \"The number is right, but misleading\". No, no, no, when you fact check something, if the number is right. That should end the fact check. But instead they went into this whole diatribe on how you can't include immigration offenses in there. No, a crime is a crime is a crime and once you start nitpicking at that then you look stupid, even when you're fact-checking. The media really dropped the ball on this one.",

That includes Police Officer Ronald Singh. He was gunned down by that illegal immigrant, just after Christmas. And Officer Singh leaving behind a wife and a 5-month-old baby boy who will never know his father. Democrats, are you really prepared, the media, Democratic Party, liberals, are you going to look at this man's face and tell them that this death say manufactured crisis? Where have your hearts gone? And earlier this week, we interviewed the parents of this young man, Pierce Corcoran and he was killed by a suspected illegal immigrant, driving on the wrong side of the highway without a license, without insurance in the country, 14 years. Are Democrats going to call the Corcorans and tell them what happened, that their son say manufactured crisis? What about Josh Wilkerson or Dominic Durden or Sergeant Brandon Mendoza or Jamiel Shaw, or Grant Roneburger (ph), I can keep going. Just keep watching the names on the side of your screen tonight.

They are speaking out tonight and they have done so many times in the past and they are reminding some of American's politicians and their best friends in the media that this is not a political gain for them.

Last time I was down with Governor Perry, then governor at the time, sat in a security briefing, 642,000 crimes committed against Texans alone in a seven-year period. In just the past two years alone, 4,000 criminal aliens have been arrested for homicide. In fact, over the past two decades. Criminal immigrants have been responsible for tense of thousands of murders. Now, to these families, our fellow Americans, that crisis is always present. Their lives have been devastated, forever altered, their loved ones murdered. And yet, hate Trump Democrats, hate Trump talking point media people, they are to suggest this is a manufactured crisis? Really? We're talking about an all too common occurrence. It should never happen. Law abiding men and women killed by illegal immigrants that don't respect our laws, our sovereignty, our borders. They shouldn't be here at all. Now, if we secured the borders, lives are going to be saved. People will be protected. There won't be permanent separation as in the cases we're telling you about. Now, many of these cases, those responsible, even had long, criminal track records. Some had previously been deported, all gaining access, because our southern border is wide open. And sadly, this is only one aspect of the crisis at our southern border. Over the past two years, 30,000 criminal aliens arrested for sex crimes, over a hundred thousand were violent assaults. In 2018, 800 gang members apprehended at our southern border. That's a 50 percent increase over the previous year. Yes, last year, we also saw 122 percent increase in fentanyl being smuggled across the southern border. Do you know fentanyl? That's the drug killing Americans every single day in this country. Fentanyl, the deadly substance, often mixed with heroin. Remember heroin? Ninety percent of that, smuggled across our southern boarder. And keep in mind, every seven days, 300 Americans will die from a heroin over dose. That death toll is equal to the number of American troops killed every week in Vietnam, during 1968. That was the deadliest year of that war. So, is that a manufactured crisis? Last year, 17,000 individuals with criminal records apprehended trying to cross the border. Sixty thousand inadmissible or illegal immigrants turned away from our borders every single month. And over the last few weeks, 20,000 children, smuggled or trafficked into the United States. This is not a manufactured crisis or a talking point. Those children matter, those women mater. Those Americans being killed by addiction matter. We talk about the opioid epidemic in the country all the time, this is a big part of it. And so do the human beings, by the way, on the other side of the border. Totally understand that 98 percent that want a better life for themselves, their family, their children, their grandchildren, but one out of every three migrant women, who make that dangerous trip, try to make it into the United States, hoping for a better life. They're sexually assaulted and 7 in 10 migrants reported being victim during that trek. It's an arduous journey. And average of 50 children each day require emergency and medical care after they arrive at the southern border. And you have thousands of illegal immigrants, they have died trying to cross unfamiliar deserts, in unsecured regions of our border. And don't forget about the risks that are posed to our national security, unvetted, illegal immigrants from all over the world use our unsecured southern border in order to gain access to the United States.

      "utterance": "Well, Trump says it's bad. Democrats say it's good. Now Trump's president and the wall to Democrats is suddenly immoral. Actually, Democrats, what they're doing is playing politics and risking in the process, the lives of American citizens, just because they don't like Donald Trump, who wants to solve a problem. And yet, the solution they once supported is effective. We know the law works. After completion of the wall, south of San Diego, illegal traffic drops by approximately 92 percent. The wall in El Paso, Texas, resulted in a significant drop as it did, walls in Tucson and Yuma, Arizona, where they extended one wall from five miles to 65 miles, it drops 95 percent. The president is now requesting one tenth of 1 percent of our federal budget to build more strategic barriers. He's also requesting increased border patrol, and ICE personnel, and an increase in detention capacity and humanitarian resources and counter smuggling tools along with other important technology. It's not a radical plan. It's a plan to keep America safe. It address what is is an urgent serious crisis. So let me say, I understand, by the way, the concerns. Twenty-five percent partial government shutdown are furloughed. Workers furloughed. Look, I've been there in my life, living paycheck to paycheck. It's not fun. They will and should and deserve to re coupe all of their money. While they're not working, they deserve it. And this is, though, for others. Life and death, literally, preventable death, which makes this all the more frustrating. Officer Singh is gone forever. The Corcorans will never see their song Pierce again. The families of the people you see on the right of your screen throughout the night tonight, they deserve better. These deaths are not manufactured. This is not a manufactured crisis. And Democrats and their allies in the media, their talking point, frankly is cold, heartless, it's a lie and frankly, a slap in the face to every angel mom and dad and family member in this country that have lost loved once, as a result of open borders and illegal immigration, or every family that has lost a loved one from a heroin overdose or from other drugs smuggled over our wide open borders. The clashes with border patrol agents, rocks, bottles thrown, chaos, destruction, they also -- that's not manufactured, that's real. Democrats, remember, it wasn't a manufactured crisis because they were politically bludgeoning Trump over the family separation issue, something he eventually stopped that happened in the previous two administrations. It wasn't a manufactured crisis for the Democrats or the media when they were bludgeoning our brave border patrol officers who had to use tear gas after they were being pelted with rocks and bottles. Remember, the left accused them of gassing children. So, Pelosi, Schumer, the rest of the Democratic Party and the media want to stay on manufactured crisis and allow this to continue and play a political game? The president, he will have the full authority and power to declare a national emergency and tackle this head on with or without congressional funding approval or he could use the Defense Department. This is about protecting our homeland. But, first, it's up to you. Look at the number on your screen, you might want to call, ask your member of Congress or the Senate, to hold the line. This is too important -- 202-224-3121. Joining us now, Congressman Mark Meadows of Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan of Freedom Caucus as well. Jim, you look like you're standing out the White House.

Independents get it. The only people who don't get it are Democrats in Washington, D.C., and it comes right down to this issue. Democrats in Washington are more concern about stopping the president than they are in helping the country. More concern about stopping President Trump than dealing with 400,000 apprehension on the border last year alone, and the drugs, the gangs, the human traffic violence that you talked about. So, until their constituents tell them -- that's why it's great, you put the number on there. Until their constituents tell them, focus on the country. Focus on the crisis.

Two, the belief that there's no real problem on the border because 400,000 illegals apprehended on the border per year is insignificant. Three, that the belief that because you can't put a wall everywhere, the Rio Grande, you should therefore, put a wall nowhere. Here with reaction, Fox News contributors, Sara Carter, down at the border, Tammy Bruce, Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw. The tape is really compelling, Sara, and, by the way, we have an announcement coming up at the end of the show. You're down there, and I'm watching these two guys and they must have thought you were there to arrest them. I mean, it could of course a more dangerous situation depending. How do they get there from Bangladesh?"

This had been a crisis, an ongoing crisis, through various administrations, and I saw people crossing, maybe unaccompanied minors. In 2014, at least 50 I ran into, that summer, that I was down there. So, within 10 minutes of being at the Rio Grande River, on the border, these two men came up to me. They were coming up the road. They apparently thought that I was law enforcement, I was there with an off duty law enforcement officer and I got to tell you, their story was very compelling. Remember, Bangladesh is a special interest country, so these are special interest aliens. And what that means is people from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other nations that are considered special interest aliens. And what that means is, people from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and other nations that are considered special interests aliens, are from countries where either Al-Qaeda, Islamic State other various terrorist groups have had influence. So these two men seemed perfectly fine. They - I had to explain to them that I was a journalist. They agreed to talk with me. They eventually did. Had little bit of understanding of English and they were able to explain that they went from Bangladesh to Dubai through Brazil. And once they get into Brazil, Sean, then they're either going through Costa Rica, Colombia then all the way up through central - sorry I'm at an outdoor area. Then they go all the way up through Central America and into Mexico. And then from Mexico they make their way into the United States.

And I use that 400,000 number, I think that's the right number to use, because that's the number of apprehensions that Border Patrol agents conduct on the border every single year. That's - how many football stadiums can you fill with that number? That's a completely unsustainable problem and number. And so then we have to ask, well, what's the solution here? Well the solution is a mix of things. Right? It's a physical barrier where that makes sense. It's drone technology, it's sensor technology. And the Democrats like to talk about those latter things. But when you mention walls in certain places they refuse to talk anymore. But that matters, right? Barriers matters. And they can dismiss in the smug way as ineffective and forced sensory solutions. They just dismiss it out of hand without any thought or evidence to back that. But the reality is, those do work, and they do matter.

Trump is the threat, because he will get it done. And what is so craven here and what is so awful is that this is a crisis. A little while ago the Democrats cared for one minute about the two dead children that we had, horrible, horrific situation, we still care about them. That is a crisis.

But, yet if you look at the one sector in Arizona, Yuma border sector it was one of the in the country and they went from five miles of border fencing to 63 miles and they saw a reduction of 95 percent in apprehensions and people being able to cross into the country illegally.

He was showing compassion, and very importantly he was making it clear that he continues to listen to the men and women who are on the frontline who protect this country every day, often at danger to their own lives.

      "utterance": "Well, that's right. It's - I've never seen this level of hatred. They've always disliked Republicans. George Herbert Walker Bush was called a racist by Maxine Waters. George W. Bush was called a racist by Barney Frank, who accused him of ethnic cleansing by inaction for allegedly responding sluggishly to Hurricane Katrina. But this is a whole level of hatred. And I think it has a lot to do with the fact that Donald Trump has put the media on notice. We know the media has engaged in fake news. We know the media has been biased for years. Donald Trump is the first one to call him out on it, and that's why they dislike him so much."

      "utterance": "Well, it's easy from the Ivory Towers of New York and Washington, the media centers - political media centers of the country. So, yes, I would imagine that that wouldn't be the case. But remember what the media tenor was going into yesterday's address. We were told, almost guaranteed, the President is going to lie. That the networks needed to deliberate even to carry the speech on their networks without either delay or at all because they needed to fact-check it first. They were demanding that a text of the context of the speech was supposed to be given to them. But then a funny thing happened. The fact checkers didn't have a heck of a lot to do. So then they started to injecting their opinions into the fact checks. I mean, if you saw The Washington Post yesterday, they actually fact-checked the President when he said, the 266,000 illegal aliens were arrested over the last two years. And they said this quoting, \"The number is right, but misleading\". No, no, no, when you fact check something, if the number is right. That should end the fact check. But instead they went into this whole diatribe on how you can't include immigration offenses in there. No, a crime is a crime is a crime and once you start nitpicking at that then you look stupid, even when you're fact-checking. The media really dropped the ball on this one."

      "utterance": "I know. This is hysterical. I imagine where was Jim Acosta saying that there ought to be a Surgeon General warning during the eight years of the Obama administration when he told whopper after whopper that moved major policy. We're talking about Obamacare, that radically changed the way we get health care in this country. And he said several whoppers, including it'll bend the cost curve down most, economists did not believe that. They said his mother, as she lay dying at a hospital bed in Hawaii, was fighting with her health insurance carriers over paying her hospital bills, turned out that was not true. And of course, the big one, if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. What about the whopper he told when he pulled all the troops out of Iraq. He said after ISIS metastasized, \"Hey, my hands were tied because George W. Bush had entered into a timetable\". That was not true. Where was the graphic? Why didn't people - there to be some sort of graphic saying."

Joe, I would think there's an opportunity here to put politics aside when 90% of heroin comes in from that Southern border, put - when people, when we know the 2 percent of the criminal element that we'd be protecting American lives. That - where is that part of the media and that part of the Democratic Party?"

And my answer was they didn't go to Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to get the feeling on the ground, to talk to the people that were there. And the same thing should be happening here. We should be seeing reporting from the border and on those situations like you talked about, whether it be drug trafficking, human trafficking. Those are the reports we should be seeing instead of people opining from afar of what they think people should think, Sean."

We are traveling to the Lone Star State and we will broadcast from there tomorrow night. We will be interviewing the President and Ted Cruz and Secretary Nielsen and Border Patrol agents themselves. We have a lot to talk to, well, to President and everyone else about tomorrow night. That's tomorrow 9:00 Eastern right here on the Fox News Channel. Think about it from this perspective. When you think about human lives suffering, isn't it worth protecting Americans first? But let not your heart be troubled. The news continues.
