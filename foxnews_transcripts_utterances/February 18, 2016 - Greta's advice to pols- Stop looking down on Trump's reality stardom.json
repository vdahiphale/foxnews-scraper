Politicians, they're up to their eyeballs in a reality show - their own. And they are the willing stars. Every day candidates intentionally tell us where they are so that we can follow them with cameras, nonstop - and we do. That's exactly how the Kardashian show is done. Cameras all the time. Candidates are on camera so much so you know their families, you know where they eat, what they eat. You even know their fashion. Remember Senator Rubio's boots?"

Now, that sounds more like reality TV and the Kardashians than the founding fathers. So, it's time for everyone to admit, especially candidates, election 2016 is really, if you think about it, reality TV with often TMI. And I confess, I'm enjoying this reality show. And that's my \"Off the Record\" comment tonight."
