It's less money than he was going to get if he didn't shutdown the government the first time. I think that he has probably no choice in to signing, because either you get a shutdown. If you try to go to the continuing resolution amount that's pegged to current spending, you'll get even less money. And so I think he signs it, and then he -- it's both-and. He's going to sign it, and I would suspect that either he declares an emergency or starts moving money around and creates a new fight. If he declares emergency, the courts will stop it, but he gets to say I tried.

The thing about this is Republicans frequently say that they are going to do border security. John McCain ran on the need to have a barrier at the border. Republican voters are used to Republican politicians just kind of not caring about it once they are elected to the office. And I think we saw that. I think the Republican Senate is -- no one is going to say, boy, they really fought hard for border security because they can see the proof is in the pudding.

      "utterance": "Well, we have a deal, but will the president go along with it? The deal structure, the agreement is $1.375 billion for a border wall. That's $4.3 billion less than what the president demanded, 55 miles of new border fencing, does not include a strict new cap on -- Democrats had sought on detainees' beds there, provides enough money for 45,000 ICE detention beds, wants to reduce that over the fiscal year. Substantial funding to improve temporary Customs and Border Protection holding facilities and additional resources for alternatives to detention and the family case management program. That's the structure of it. Is it good enough? Let's bring in our panel, Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Josh Kraushaar, he's the politics editor for \"National Journal.\" OK, Jonah, thoughts. JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": I think by any normal beltway standards it's not a great triumph for Donald Trump. It's less money than he was going to get if he didn't shutdown the government the first time. I think that he has probably no choice in to signing, because either you get a shutdown. If you try to go to the continuing resolution amount that's pegged to current spending, you'll get even less money. And so I think he signs it, and then he -- it's both-and. He's going to sign it, and I would suspect that either he declares an emergency or starts moving money around and creates a new fight. If he declares emergency, the courts will stop it, but he gets to say I tried. That would be a political one for him, but it's not a great deal."

      "utterance": "You buy that, Mollie? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think this is a genuine compromise bill. Each side gets a little bit of what they want. The problem is it's a compromise between people who actually want to do something about border security and people who want to do nothing about border security. There are political wins here. Donald Trump needed money for the wall, for the barrier. He gets that. He also gets to keep using this as an issue because he can point to how Congress has failed once again. The people who want generally open borders also have a victory because they can keep having those things. The issue is it's not just about Trump, it's not just about politics, but it's about national sovereignty and our borders and whether they mean anything. And for those people care about those issues, it's a loss."

      "utterance": "So the question is, does the 55 miles of border fencing and the $1.37 billion in the money satisfy the base. Probably not, but I think Mollie and Jonah are right that it puts a pause on the negotiations, it allows Trump to argue on other political issues that are more favorable for him. But it's a compromise. A lot of conservatives are going to be upset, but they will take it for now."

      "utterance": "Not quite right, it seems to me. He did try to say in the middle of the shutdown that it was really the Democrats' fault and all the rest. I understand the teaching moment aspect of it, but the simple fact is the border wall remains an unpopular issue with the majority of the American people. I think the majority of the American people are largely wrong on that. I think you can do all sorts of things on the border. I think the Trump administration should have gotten its $5 billion. But the shutdown didn't lead to any great change in public opinion, and it didn't get him more money for the wall. If he signs this, he gets less, and I don't think he can spin that as a political win, except in the sense that Mollie is talking about where keeping the issue alive is generally good for Trump, but it's also generally good for his opponents."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "We got a little bit of a preview of this with his rally last night, and those are in fact things that he brought forward. I think that the wall was an issue that resonated quite a bit with his voters and he needs to keep pushing for that. The thing about this is Republicans frequently say that they are going to do border security. John McCain ran on the need to have a barrier at the border. Republican voters are used to Republican politicians just kind of not caring about it once they are elected to the office. And I think we saw that. I think the Republican Senate is -- no one is going to say, boy, they really fought hard for border security because they can see the proof is in the pudding. They didn't even get this measly $5 billion which wasn't that much money to ask for. So there might be an issue with Republican voters where they might not be so angry at Trump for trying to get border security. They might not be so happy with how weak and impotent a lot of Republican leaders on the Hill are."

He's still going to attack Democrats for being weak on border security, but he's going to pivot I think to broader issues, broader themes, and also incorporate some of the liberalism of the Green New Deal, of Medicare for all. So this becomes a political issue, it's not going away, and it's going to be something that energizes the base."

I think she has this reputation, apart from one of the things that you mentioned, of being someone whose disposition is very good. But a lot she talked about you couldn't really even identify where she was different from the far left side of her party. She didn't want to say anything that sounded different than what a lot of people are saying on immigration. She signs onto this Green New Deal and calls it aspirational and says she's going to vote for it. A lot of people in this town seem to care about disposition, but I think when you look at actual policies, Trump gets in trouble for having a bad disposition, but he's a pretty standard conservative. She has a good disposition but she kind of seems like a standard liberal."

There are a lot of Democrats out there who aren't concerned -- don't like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and all the woke identity politics stuff, and she seems dispositionally and politically best suited for that. The problem is that she seems like she is still so afraid of the base that she's going to vote for the Green New Deal thing, which I think is insane."
