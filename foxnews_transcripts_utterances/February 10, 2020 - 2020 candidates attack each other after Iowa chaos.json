What is -- you know, if you do A, legalized things like heroin and crack cocaine or whatever else he wants to legalize, are there then going to be more victims of crime as a result of these people not being in jail? I mean, these are big questions, and also, structurally, the federal government has a lot of agencies dedicated to the drug war. So the DEA would have to be eliminated, you'd have lots of parts of ICE and Border Patrol that would no longer be functioning in that capacity. So it's a very big issue. I'm open to lots of arguments about how legalizing marijuana in the United States or other drugs that actually help decrease the violence in places like Chicago and Mexico.

My belief and it's always been this which is why I agree with him about all drugs is that legality creates feasible delivery systems. If you look at a bought -- a pack of cigarettes, right? You have 20 cigarettes, each one gives you a mild narcotic kick. I'm not saying it's safe. We know it's deadly. However, if you ban a pack of cigarettes, the delivery system immediately changes. It becomes more potent and damaging because you're leaving it to street vendors to deal with that illegal thing. So when you compare legal opiates, prescriptions to fentanyl on the street, you can see the differences. People live completely normal lives on opiates, others die on the street when they get their fentanyl mixed also with their Xanax. So modulating delivery systems solve the biggest problem which renders the pleasure you get manageable chunks. So my opiate of choice when I get home from work is no different than your martini of choice. If you have five martinis that's not on society, that is on you. However, the point is, you have to plan for this kind of decision because there are intended and unintended consequences. Will homelessness increase? Will overdoses spike? Will the workforce suffer? That's where I see the problem is where the workforce might suffer. But you can't say that this will cause any worse of a problem than the drug war, because the drug war creates these unmanageable delivery systems that kill people. And when you don't prepare for the consequences, you end up with De Blasio and bail reform which is caused dramatic spikes in crimes in New York City because he didn't think about what might happen.",

      "utterance": "Well, I would tell you that the mood here definitely feels like -- there is some excitement, especially the Bernie Sanders rallies. Like, those people are in love. They follow him. They believe in him. He doesn't talk down to them. It is not condescending. He has always been who he is. Do I see the entire Democratic Party getting behind him to try to oust Donald Trump? I have to tell you today I find that very hard to imagine. But, you know, if he became the nominee, maybe we would see something different. The other dynamic that is happening here is that President Trump is coming tonight. He's going to have his rally here in Manchester. And the beat was the sight of his last rally before the election here in the primary in New Hampshire, where he ran away with it. And I think he has a special affinity for New Hampshire, because that was kind of the first contest that said, OK, he could actually win this thing. He could be on to the White House. And so he will be coming back tonight. And it will be packed. People have been staying up overnight. There are people coming from different states in order to be here. So the -- he -- whatever he has done here, he has locked in his support. And I think that anyone who was independent in 2016 that voted per President Trump has probably switched their registration to Republican to vote for him this time. And he only lost this state by .4 percent in 2016. And I think that they think that they will be able to win that in 2020. I didn't say I think they think -- they think they can. I think they will."

But going back to the chaos in the Democratic Party, I want to say that I agree with Juan in the sense that we do have a very long way to go here. But when it comes to momentum, momentum doesn't just apply to individual candidates. It applies to the party as a whole. When you have the Iowa caucus vote still being in disarray, they still can't figure out whether all the data and information was in the voting system. There is now this cloud over the entire primary process from the beginning about whether the person who may end up winning actually won it fairly. And that is certainly something that the Bernie camp will be thinking about when they go into this if he doesn't get the nomination. And whether they are going to then support the nominee against President Trump, but that Trump campaign has been on the ground all over the place, not just in New Hampshire, Vice president Mike Pence has been in New Hampshire today with Ivanka Trump at diners, meeting and shaking hands. And Democrats have had a very hard time catching up, not just on the ground but on issues. And they are running out of things to run against the president on. In New Hampshire, he ran on dealing with the opioid crisis and he has delivered on that. And I completely with Dana that people will see that issue. See what he has done and decide to change their registration and vote for him."

She thinks for herself as the rest cower before the fringe. The sad thing about this crop, you're grateful for even a grain of common sense. Apparently voicing disgust of an ideological menace that helped kill millions is now an act of blasphemy, anyway, what a mess. Mayor Pete is a thesaurus without specifics. Liz Warren is an evasive phoney. Joe sounded like the guy at the bar after he got fired, talking loudly about all the stuff that he did better than everyone else. It's also kind of bad when Dems say they would not kill a terrorist. Who are they worried about passing off, other terrorists? Oddly, they seem more spiteful of companies which are just people. But lacking economic skills, Democrats think companies are sinister engines run by the Monopoly Guy in a top hat. They plead for unanimously while slamming folks who were once examples of American opportunity as the economy rolls on with more jobs, wages, and satisfaction. They accuse half the country of exploiting the other half. So now, a reasonable Democrat becomes the fringe as others parrot the line that America is racist through and through, which leads to divisive factions and punitive actions. They deny real progress with race which puts future progress in jeopardy. How do you measure change when you reject its existence? Amy is at least rooted in some reality, which means she is toast. You, Jesse, had an interesting perception about Amy. We both think that she might be the surprise."

They are serving up these questions about socialism on a silver platter. And everyone's just looking around at their shoes. These guys really have to want it. But I do get the sense that socialism now in the Democratic Party is too big to beat. They are not going to be able to put it in a corner anymore and pretend it doesn't exist and pay it lip service. They are going to have to make peace with Bernie with the socialist faction at the convention. Because there is a good chance he could wind up with the most delegates at that convention. And they only have themselves to blame with socialism. They have radicalized themselves on Twitter. They've abandoned the middle-class workers in this country. And a lot of the Democratic elites went hard in with the lobbyists, went hard in with Wall Street, and they just didn't deliver the goods for average working class American people. At this point, if you have Bernie, though, a socialist at the top of the ticket who wants the Boston bomber to vote from prison, who wants open borders, who wants a dismantled Wall Street, who wants to revolutionize the capitalist system and do away with the internal combustion engine. You -- when you face off against Trump with someone like that are facing a 40-state landslide. And that's what they are going to have to reckon with."

They will probably be labelled as a socialist, maybe not directly by President Trump. But that will be the message from the supporters. And they're going to have to figure out a way to deal with it. And I think this also falls along generational lines. These polls that came out today show that Bernie Sanders has got a really good grip on the youth, like the younger people, and somebody like a Biden has the older people, because I think that this socialism issue is not just about temperament.

And by the Democrats not standing up and saying, yes, I have a problem with it on the stage. It proves that there are no moderates running in the Democratic Party, and they deserve the label of being socialist. And Bernie Sanders, you know, the question on MSNBC after Chris Matthews said that was, well, is he like a Denmark socialist or is he like a Cuban communist? If you go back and listen to Bernie Sanders' own words about Cuban communism, he was excited about Fidel Castro who was responsible for the murder of the hundreds of thousands of people. He said that redlines in Nicaragua were a good example of how the economy works. So when we are talking about policy here, these are just differences in minor policy.

And a lot of people who voted to push that through now come back and say they regret doing so because of the societal impacts that it had. So, you know, as Dana said, we don't have a whole lot of information, but I can imagine the effects would be the same. And we're talking about an entire structural issue here. What is -- you know, if you do A, legalized things like heroin and crack cocaine or whatever else he wants to legalize, are there then going to be more victims of crime as a result of these people not being in jail? I mean, these are big questions, and also, structurally, the federal government has a lot of agencies dedicated to the drug war. So the DEA would have to be eliminated, you'd have lots of parts of ICE and Border Patrol that would no longer be functioning in that capacity. So it's a very big issue. I'm open to lots of arguments about how legalizing marijuana in the United States or other drugs that actually help decrease the violence in places like Chicago and Mexico. But it's not just a talking point answer. And I don't think that Mayor Pete did a very good job of explaining more thoroughly how he would handle the consequences because it would not be a seamless transition."

      "utterance": "Well, I think so. I mean, the facts are this. It's illegal opiates that are killing people, not legal opiates. My belief and it's always been this which is why I agree with him about all drugs is that legality creates feasible delivery systems. If you look at a bought -- a pack of cigarettes, right? You have 20 cigarettes, each one gives you a mild narcotic kick. I'm not saying it's safe. We know it's deadly. However, if you ban a pack of cigarettes, the delivery system immediately changes. It becomes more potent and damaging because you're leaving it to street vendors to deal with that illegal thing. So when you compare legal opiates, prescriptions to fentanyl on the street, you can see the differences. People live completely normal lives on opiates, others die on the street when they get their fentanyl mixed also with their Xanax. So modulating delivery systems solve the biggest problem which renders the pleasure you get manageable chunks. So my opiate of choice when I get home from work is no different than your martini of choice. If you have five martinis that's not on society, that is on you. However, the point is, you have to plan for this kind of decision because there are intended and unintended consequences. Will homelessness increase? Will overdoses spike? Will the workforce suffer? That's where I see the problem is where the workforce might suffer. But you can't say that this will cause any worse of a problem than the drug war, because the drug war creates these unmanageable delivery systems that kill people. And when you don't prepare for the consequences, you end up with De Blasio and bail reform which is caused dramatic spikes in crimes in New York City because he didn't think about what might happen."

If you run a candidate on the left that wants to legalize narcotics possession in the United States of America, Trump will chew him out and spit them out, and it won't even be close.

And now for the rest of his life, for that moment, it's going to be about a dumb joke. He should have just enjoyed it. But you know what? I stopped watching it because my wife said to me, you know, Greg, this isn't for you. And I go, you're right and I left.

He's been in a ton of movies. You've seen him in so much stuff, TV shows like Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, Fernwood 2 Night, Desperate Housewives. He was in being -- the doctor Being John Malkovich. He was in probably one of the more memorable twilight zones. He was blacklisted. I grew up watching him and countless game shows like password and to tell the truth. But I got to become a friend of his because he was Andrew Breitbart's father in law. And I used to go to when I'd see Andrew and or see Orson, and he was such a wonderful, just a wonderful person. And I mean, this weekend we've lost him, and Robert Conrad, and Kirk Douglas. I mean, we're losing a lot of interesting people. We got to make sure we're replacing them. I wrote an obituary.
