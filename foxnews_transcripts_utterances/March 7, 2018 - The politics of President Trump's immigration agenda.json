      "utterance": "Republicans have thought that they've had an opportunity with Hispanic voters for a very long time. AND the theory is that Hispanic voters are conservative on social issues, many of them own small businesses. They are kind of culturally, socially, they're pro-family. They are ripe for the picking for conservative ideology and for Republican outreach."

      "utterance": "But along comes Donald Trump, who on the day he announced his candidacy, came down the golden escalator and talked about Mexico sending rapists, et cetera, et cetera, and he's had very, very harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric, not just anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric. And a lot of Hispanic voters in America don't like illegal immigration either, but Donald Trump's reason for rejecting the last DACA compromise that came to him was because it didn't do enough to curtail legal immigration, family chain migration, which a lot of Hispanic voters to care about. So I don't know whether Donald Trump has undermined or furthered the Republican Party's efforts for outreach."

      "utterance": "I believe that Trump did according to the exit polls a point or two better with Hispanic voters than Mitt Romney did. But on the more immediate point of DACA, we are now two days passed then what we thought a big deadline on this but really isn't. And I think that the president is just waiting on Democrats. And I have thought for a long time that at some point, a straight DACA legalization for the wall, real money for the wall put in a trust fund, $25 billion really there, is a deal that is there still to be had."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Why is that so difficult? Because the White House came back with a bunch of other things, including this chain migration provision that would've curtailed illegal immigration by 44 percent. And that is something the Democrats wouldn't accept. And that bill got 39 votes in the Senate. So it got much less votes than the wall for DACA."

      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "I think that's a fair bet. Democrats believe that their ticket to success in November of 2018 is to oppose the president, oppose him at all times, and make the harshest arguments about him that they possibly can."
