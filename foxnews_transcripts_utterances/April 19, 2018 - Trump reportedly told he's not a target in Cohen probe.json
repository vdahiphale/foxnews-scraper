It was her foundation that took millions of dollars from the Russians, not Trump's foundations. So, when you look at how it's been treated the FBI did not go after the DNC server.

And by and large, that is just not vastly the case. And I also like the -- I love California. Like Kimberly, I love it. It's a great state, and I hate to see it torn apart. I hate to see this state turned into either \"you're on our team or you're not.\" You're us or them. You're for us or against it.

They've had multiple people from team Trump testified in front of the house and the senate, some of them three to four times. They turn over, over a million documents. They found no collusion. If there was a smoking gun of collusion, it would have leaked because everything else does. There are no crimes that we have seen so far, so I don't know what they're looking for. You know who hasn't even testified in front of Mueller? Brad Parscale, Trump's own campaign manager, the head of the digital media strategy during the election. He's never even been brought in to be interviewed. So, what is Mueller doing? Mueller, I guess, they approved this raid on Cohen for a campaign finance violation to pay off a porn star. I mean, that's like a fine. Bernie Sanders paid 14 grand for taking money from the Australians. You don't raid some guy house over a campaign finance violation."

He was the centerpiece of the dossier. They said he was in Prague and he's meeting with Russians, and they're going to cook up some scheme to rig the election. His passport says he's never even been to Prague. So, I don't have any idea what they're looking for. If you look at the collusion, Hillary was the one that paid for fake news from Russia. She was the one that got that into the bloodstream of the intelligence community. It was her husband that took a half a billion dollars to speak in Moscow, not Trump's spouse. It was her foundation that took millions of dollars from the Russians, not Trump's foundations. So, when you look at how it's been treated the FBI did not go after the DNC server. The FBI did not try to seize Hillary's server. Instead, they tried to seize Trump's lawyers' computers. And, they respected Hillary's attorney-client privilege, obviously, not Trump's attorney-client privilege."

So, I think it's more of a monetary issue, less of a factual issue. And on the Rosenstein thing, Rosenstein was the one that did approve the raid. He's conflicted.

And, I think that he's actually going to be a very well reason, measured addition to the president's team, especially at this juncture. You bring in specialists at certain points in different phases.

But, as a client, he's very difficult, because he'll say, listen, we're not going to talk about anything. And then, he'll go out and tweet and say what's on his mind. Some will say some wrong. So, a lot of attorneys don't want that headache because they cannot rein him in, where Giuliani might have relationship. Guys who work from the past, they know how to deal with him.

And, it's interesting because McCabe was making the case that despite objections from higher-level Justice Department officials, the FBI should be allowed to pursue an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, and that's what he was saying to the reporter. Now, apparently, Comey, who ordered this investigation, and he are at odds, and the inspector general says that McCabe is the one that was lying. So, I don't know. But, yes, refer it -- let's see what happens. But, we don't know for sure that anybody is doing anything that favored Hillary Clinton versus -- to the contrary, what we're seeing is McCabe was saying I want to investigate Clinton."

And he's also -- you know, for example, Andrew McCabe, according to James Comey, is a good person, and good people lie. However, the president is a bad person and morally unfit because the president lied. So, James Comey can't have it both ways, and that is the least of his concerns.

And, you have to wonder if they put pressure on Loretta Lynch to shut down this Clinton Foundation investigation, which Andrew McCabe didn't want to do. And he felt he had to CYA.

But now you have such a big, aggressive push. You have backlash from certain counties to say, \"Wait a second. Don't lump us all into this. We want to follow the law. We want to uphold the law. We want fairness, and we're actually seeking justice, not injustice. We want people to come into this country legally. We welcome with open arms. OK? And that's how it should be.\" When you see the law broken and people coming in and essentially back and forth revolving doors, that's not helping the immigrant, illegal immigrants and their families, the children. The people get separated. It's not healthy. The local law enforcement and ordinances in the border. It's just fraught with complications and problems. And this is an issue that President Trump is not going to give up on, but it also seems that, you know, Governor Brown is digging in. Lieutenant Governor Newsom is digging in.

I also think -- you know, I happen to have a very high opinion of most immigrants who come to this country because most don't commit crimes, and they work very hard. And I hate to see them lumped in with members of MS-13. The problem is if you're letting bad people go and enter into society and hurt people, they get really good at not getting arrested and committing -- continuing to commit crimes. And that's not OK. And you end up having a disingenuous conversation about immigration and about crime. And unfortunately, immigrants get tarred as all being really bad people who want to hurt you and take your stuff. And by and large, that is just not vastly the case. And I also like the -- I love California. Like Kimberly, I love it. It's a great state, and I hate to see it torn apart. I hate to see this state turned into either \"you're on our team or you're not.\" You're us or them. You're for us or against it.

So it's unfair when we have to stigmatize it. But this is just the lawlessness cannot be ignored. When you see people like MS-13, who I had to prosecute, you know, when I was a D.A. in San Francisco and Los Angeles. I mean, the horrific crimes that are committed.

You should be held up. If you rob, you steal, you do things. If it was a normal American citizen and he had a warrant in a different place, they're going to hold you."

So it's no longer the bad guy. OK, Tyrus? Pasta is back in. A new study says that you don't have to avoid pasta if you want to lose weight. So researchers found that people lost more weight on a low glycemic diet with pasta. Kennedy will explain that later. And that pasta itself did not cause weight gain or an increase in body fat. I think if you ate a lot of it, that might be a problem. Well, this doesn't mean that, yes, you can drown yourself in penne or, as Jesse is doing right now, spaghetti and meatballs, but it's great news, because I love spaghetti and meatballs. It's one of my favorites. And I'm sorry. We'll get gluten- free for sweetheart Kennedy next. You don't want any, Juan? OK. Juan. \"OMT.\""
