Nobody can read a decent paragraph anymore. Someday we're going to do a special on that. But for now, consider the substance of what you just heard, to the sense, if there was any.

They are not made by left-wing talk show host or by \"The Washington Post,\" or even by high level C.I.A. employees acting anonymously as whistleblowers. No. In a democracy, the main decisions are made by citizens casting ballots - that, for example, is how you remove a President by beating him in an election. That's always the way we did it here in America. Not anymore. So yes, our democracy is under attack. They are right about that. And yet for all of his faults, Donald Trump is not the attacker. But wait a second, they're telling you, we understand how grave a decision impeachment is, in fact, we're praying over it -- people of faith that we are. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But in this case, impeachment is another avoidable.

And by the way, if foreign interference is such a concern, and by the way, it should be a concern, then why are we more worried about foreign companies sending de facto bribes to the family members of connected politicians? There are a lot of those. We're picking on Joe Biden's son because it's in the news, but it could be a lot of people's sons, trust me, but in the case of Biden's son, nobody thinks he's an expert on Ukrainian energy policy. He got the gig because of his dad. It was influenced peddling, obviously. In this case, that's okay, though, for some reason. So let's just be totally honest. Let's stop lying if we can, just for a second. I know it's hard in modern America where everyone is required to lie all the time. But let's just be honest, for this one moment. In Washington right now, there are no actual rules. Partisan simply invent standards for the purpose of destroying their political enemies. Just today, Hillary Clinton tweeted this, from the late Democratic member of Congress is this quote. \"If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the offenses charged here, then perhaps that 18th Century Constitution should be abandoned to a 20th Century paper shredder.\" That's Barbara Jordan, by the way if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, if the process doesn't reach the outcome that Hillary Clinton wants it to reach, she thinks we ought to scrap the Constitution. Oh. Probably not a question that that concept appeals to Michigan, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. This week, Tlaib told her constituents that the Democratic Party is now considering ways to arrest members of Trump's Cabinet.

That's not politics, of course. That's not the effort to persuade people, bring them over to your side through reason. No. That's something different. Modern partisans on the left don't want to just win the next election. Electoral power is too transient. Voters might change their mind in the election after that. It happened by the way in 2016. Democrats don't want to take that risk again. So they moved on from the goal of winning votes to utterly destroying their opponents, their enemies. They want them imprisoned as you just heard there. They want their families intimidated. They want their supporters humiliated and demoralized. They want to vanquish rather than win over. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's not a good way to run a country.

But can we believe that Elizabeth Warren really means it? Well, maybe not. A recent story in a business website profile the tech bigwigs who are donating to Warren's campaign and amazingly there are quite a few of them. One former Facebook executive Not a recent story in a business website profile the tech bigwigs who are donating to Warren's campaign and amazingly, they're quite a few of them. One former Facebook executive, for example has already donated more than five grand to Warren's presidential campaign. Uber and Twitter investor, Chris Sacca has donated as well. Even more investors and executives in the piece said they were backing Elizabeth Warren, but kept their names anonymous. By the way, employees at Alphabet -- that's the parent company of Google -- have donated almost $130,000.00 to Elizabeth Warren. That's the second most of any company or organization in the United States. If as long as we're ranking them, Amazon is number four on the list, Apple is fifth. So it turns out Big Tech loves Elizabeth Warren, almost as much as it loves Pete Buttigieg who has got no chance, and far more than it loves Joe Biden. So Elizabeth Warren may say that she plans to rein in Big Tech, but Silicon Valley is full of really smart people who got rich by making good bets, and they're betting she doesn't mean it. They don't believe her for a second. Why should we? Well, Seattle is one of the country's most progressive cities and that means that leaders there are treating their city as a test tube for radical ideology. The city has already ceded its public spaces to massive homeless encampments. Now, they're trying another experiment. Mass decriminalization. A report commissioned by Seattle Business Association found that city prosecutors refused to prosecute almost half of all non-traffic criminal cases referred to them by the city's police. For example, more than 1,800 robberies were referred by police over an 18- month period, but less than a thousand of them resulted in criminal charges.

So at this point, you'd think it would be obvious what exactly the fuss is about. After this much talking, you would assume every person in America would understand what crimes Donald Trump is being accused of committing. But no, even now, the story still feels obscure and strangely light. There's nothing mysterious or weighty about it. We already know all of the facts, there's a transcript, and yet they still don't seem very sure shocking. And so maybe for that reason, our news anchors have been doing their very best to keep the blood pressure high. The game is boring, so the cheerleaders have to work overtime, twice as hard. For example, here was MSNBC's best attempt to get you to care."

We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the President that all that assures his impeachment in the House of Representatives. This moment should arguably be a national emergency. The Founding Fathers would have considered it a national emergency if the President publicly lobbied multiple foreign governments to interfere in the next election. It's tough to say lightly. But this is the moment that we're at."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a good cliche bomb just went off. Try to ignore how hackneyed and badly written that speech was. The state of education in this country clearly is in rapid decline. Nobody can read a decent paragraph anymore. Someday we're going to do a special on that. But for now, consider the substance of what you just heard, to the sense, if there was any. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack - that's what they're telling you. So what exactly are the basic rules of our democracy? Well, the most basic rule of all, is it the people rule. In a democracy, the big decisions are made by voters in elections. They are not made by left-wing talk show host or by \"The Washington Post,\" or even by high level C.I.A. employees acting anonymously as whistleblowers. No. In a democracy, the main decisions are made by citizens casting ballots - that, for example, is how you remove a President by beating him in an election. That's always the way we did it here in America. Not anymore. So yes, our democracy is under attack. They are right about that. And yet for all of his faults, Donald Trump is not the attacker. But wait a second, they're telling you, we understand how grave a decision impeachment is, in fact, we're praying over it -- people of faith that we are. But in this case, impeachment is another avoidable. Soliciting information from foreign countries is corrupt and evil. That's what they're telling you. Okay, fine. But let's at least acknowledge that this standard is a brand new standard, I mean, brand new standard, like 20 minutes ago, because it wasn't that long ago, less than a year, you'll remember this - that all of American politics revolved around information solicited from foreign countries. It was called the Steele dossier. And back then, the press corps strongly approved of it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Oh, the dossier. It was totally fine. In case you forgotten and you may have forgotten because, why would you remember? But Christopher Steele, who wrote the dossier was a foreign Intelligence operative. He gathered his material abroad in foreign countries, some of it clearly from foreign government officials. At the time, that was absolutely fine with Democrats. They weren't embarrassed to say so. Clinton campaign staffer, Brian Fallon tweeted this. We can give you many examples. Here's one, here's his tweet. \"I regret I didn't know about Christopher Steele's hiring pre-election. If I had, I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him.\" Oh, okay. And by the way, if foreign interference is such a concern, and by the way, it should be a concern, then why are we more worried about foreign companies sending de facto bribes to the family members of connected politicians? There are a lot of those. We're picking on Joe Biden's son because it's in the news, but it could be a lot of people's sons, trust me, but in the case of Biden's son, nobody thinks he's an expert on Ukrainian energy policy. He got the gig because of his dad. It was influenced peddling, obviously. In this case, that's okay, though, for some reason. So let's just be totally honest. Let's stop lying if we can, just for a second. I know it's hard in modern America where everyone is required to lie all the time. But let's just be honest, for this one moment. In Washington right now, there are no actual rules. Partisan simply invent standards for the purpose of destroying their political enemies. Just today, Hillary Clinton tweeted this, from the late Democratic member of Congress is this quote. \"If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the offenses charged here, then perhaps that 18th Century Constitution should be abandoned to a 20th Century paper shredder.\" That's Barbara Jordan, by the way In other words, if the process doesn't reach the outcome that Hillary Clinton wants it to reach, she thinks we ought to scrap the Constitution. Oh. Probably not a question that that concept appeals to Michigan, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. This week, Tlaib told her constituents that the Democratic Party is now considering ways to arrest members of Trump's Cabinet. Jailing them in Detroit would be a good option, she explained, watch this."

So I just want you to know, I will relay your message. I will tell them they can hold off those people right here in Detroit, we will take care of them. And make sure they show up to the committee hearing. We won't hurt them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Just going to arrest them. That's not Third World or anything. Arrest the cabinet. You've got to give Tlaib credit for honesty, anyway. She is not pretending to be prayerful, like Nancy Pelosi. She is just saying what she really thinks she speaks for, unfortunately, quite a few people in her party. What we're watching here, what you just watching that clip is politics itself breaking down. That's not politics, of course. That's not the effort to persuade people, bring them over to your side through reason. No. That's something different. Modern partisans on the left don't want to just win the next election. Electoral power is too transient. Voters might change their mind in the election after that. It happened by the way in 2016. Democrats don't want to take that risk again. So they moved on from the goal of winning votes to utterly destroying their opponents, their enemies. They want them imprisoned as you just heard there. They want their families intimidated. They want their supporters humiliated and demoralized. They want to vanquish rather than win over. That's not a good way to run a country. But it's an awfully effective way to maximize political power. Catherine Herridge is our Chief Intelligence Correspondent at Fox News.

Taylor writes, \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" And Sondland responds, quote, \"I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President's Zelensky promised during the campaign.

I don't want to re-litigate, you know, the years that we spent talking about this, but now that the standard in Washington is soliciting information for foreign governments is an impeachable offense, the Steele dossier, which was the basis of the Russia investigation, was that information in whole or in part from foreign governments?"

And we talked about it then. And I said to you then, this is clearly something concocted probably by Intelligence agencies around the world. And that's what it has turned out to be. Steele's premise, which got him attention was that he got all this from sources high in the Kremlin, correct? It was supposed to be Kremlin sources. But the story didn't make any sense because the dossier said Putin wanted to elect Trump. So why then we asked ourselves, would Putin's own agents, give Steele dirt on Trump to destroy his candidacy? The whole Steele document made very little sense. By the way, we now know that Steele was more of a composer than a writer. A lot of people contributed to it, including the wife of a very high- ranking American F.B.I. agent, Louise (sic) Ohr. She said she researched for Steele, so I assume that's what it means."

What we don't know is why -- and we need to know this -- they set out to destroy Trump as a candidate in 2016, and then as a President.

They wanted him out before he was actually sworn in. This is more of the same. It is very clear that there are people inside the government hell bent on destroying this President and taking him down. They try it every single day. You've seen that with the leaked calls from Australian Prime Minister that we had a conversation with. The President spoke to the President of Mexico also leaked.

She claims she'll break up the largest tech monopolies like Facebook and Amazon and Google. Well, we support that idea, of course. Everyone should support that idea. But can we believe that Elizabeth Warren really means it? Well, maybe not. A recent story in a business website profile the tech bigwigs who are donating to Warren's campaign and amazingly there are quite a few of them. One former Facebook executive Not a recent story in a business website profile the tech bigwigs who are donating to Warren's campaign and amazingly, they're quite a few of them. One former Facebook executive, for example has already donated more than five grand to Warren's presidential campaign. Uber and Twitter investor, Chris Sacca has donated as well. Even more investors and executives in the piece said they were backing Elizabeth Warren, but kept their names anonymous. By the way, employees at Alphabet -- that's the parent company of Google -- have donated almost $130,000.00 to Elizabeth Warren. That's the second most of any company or organization in the United States. If as long as we're ranking them, Amazon is number four on the list, Apple is fifth. So it turns out Big Tech loves Elizabeth Warren, almost as much as it loves Pete Buttigieg who has got no chance, and far more than it loves Joe Biden. So Elizabeth Warren may say that she plans to rein in Big Tech, but Silicon Valley is full of really smart people who got rich by making good bets, and they're betting she doesn't mean it. They don't believe her for a second. Why should we? Well, Seattle is one of the country's most progressive cities and that means that leaders there are treating their city as a test tube for radical ideology. The city has already ceded its public spaces to massive homeless encampments. Now, they're trying another experiment. Mass decriminalization. A report commissioned by Seattle Business Association found that city prosecutors refused to prosecute almost half of all non-traffic criminal cases referred to them by the city's police. For example, more than 1,800 robberies were referred by police over an 18- month period, but less than a thousand of them resulted in criminal charges.

But what you've seen is that it's essentially devolved into a situation where you have widespread addiction, you know, by the latest estimates, we have 6,000 homeless heroin and fentanyl addicts in the Seattle area. And we know that almost all of them don't work. And they have on average, according to Federal data, a $1,800.00 a month drug habits. So what happens? You get a huge increase in property crime. I live in Seattle, Washington, and even just within a few blocks on my house, you know, you've had a guy set a -- doused another guy with lighter fluid, light him on fire. You've had a number of robberies.

To give you some type of a benchmark, Asian students on average admitted into Harvard have SAT scores that are 218 points higher than the similarly situated black comparatives. White students have SAT scores that are 193 points higher than similarly situated white comparatives. The court says that, nonetheless, that's consistent with the Supreme Court's 2003 decision in Grutter that allows the elite universities, frankly, almost any university, to use race as one component among many to achieve the educational benefits that purportedly derive from having a diverse student body. That's, by the way, never been litigated that there are such true educational benefits. But that's neither here nor there."

The Asian population obviously, would increase dramatically, because on average, the Asian students that apply to Harvard have extremely high board scores, extremely high GPAs -- by the way that GPA and SAT differential is replicated in terms of the GPA differential of admitted students.

Luis Elizondo is Director of Special Programs at To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science. He also headed the Pentagon's office for investigating U.F.O. incidents. And it's the star of the History Channel's \"Unidentified.\" He joins us tonight. Luis, thanks so much for coming on."

      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "Sure, well, our company over the last year and a half has actually obtained quite a bit of material. And let me first preface by saying some of that material, its provenance is frankly hearsay, while other -- the provenance of some of this material has been substantiated. And ultimately, we're in the process of analyzing this material at three different levels. We're looking at its physical properties, its chemical, or if you will, molecular properties, and then ultimately, its atomic properties. And it's really at that point, we'll be able to make some sort of definitive conclusion, keeping in mind that we still have to follow the scientific process and methods and at the same time have peer review. So it's not just as simple as coming out and saying, hey, look, what we found. There's a lot of work that still needs to be done."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "Well, without getting to a lot of detail right now, because it's -- frankly, it's too speculative for me at this point to say why I think something. At the end of the day, it's going to be what the analysis tells us. And if you have, for example, interesting isotopic ratios that are not normally found, let's say on this planet, then you have to scratch your head and either A, it's been engineered that way, or B, it came from somewhere else. And ultimately, that's what we're trying to find out."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So these are materials brought to you by people who say this is at the site of a U.F.O. incident or a crash?"

    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "In some cases, yes. Again, unfortunately, I can't elaborate too much with some of these individuals. We do have non-disclosure agreements, but it's from various sources, both private and governmental."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It goes without saying, I hope that you'll come back as you get to the bottom of this. We remain skeptical, but open-minded on this and all things. Luis, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much."

Tune in every night starting Monday 8:00 p.m. on into the future indefinitely to the show that is the sworn and totally sincere and we hope, cheerful enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and group think. DVR it if you have advanced science degree or configure that out. Good luck. Good night from Washington. Have the best weekend with the ones you love. Enjoy it. You never know.
