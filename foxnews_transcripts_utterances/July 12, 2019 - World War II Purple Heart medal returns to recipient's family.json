So, let's bring in Michael Knowles of the Daily Wire, host of the Michael Knowles show, and Richard Fowler, nationally syndicated radio host and a Fox News contributor of course. Gentlemen, I imagine you grew up with this original animated classic. What do you think, Michael? Did you realize that it was all these things?",

It reads like a bad term paper freshman year. The trouble is this was written by a professor and that tells you all you need to know about higher education. \"The Lion King \"is a wonderful story, it is about redemption, it is about grace, it is endurance. It is based on Hamlet; it's based on the books of Genesis and Exodus. It is not about fascism but because the left right now has become so culturally illiterate, the only thing that they can ever referred to in their cultural criticism is Hitler. Everything they don't like is Hitlerian, or fascist, or Nazi. I should also point out, this is a very racist article. They are -- the author compares black people to hyenas. He even at one point implies that black skin is some sort of disability. Obviously, this is absurd. His main contention is that kingdoms in general are fascistic, so I guess this is news to the queen in the United Kingdom, this is news for every children's fairytale or for the books of the bible.",

Prior to colonialism, Africa was very tribal, and in that time, tribe had kings and they had, some of the tribes had queens. They were very -- there were some tribes were very matriarchal, right, and sometimes they're very patriarchal. So, it depends upon the time.

These are satellite images, they show the magnitude of the situation. Experts are calling it life-threatening for a lot of folks in Louisiana and Mississippi in the hours to come. Barry is expected to hit land early tomorrow morning. You can see the churn in the ocean in these live shots that we're seeing this evening. That's the Gulf of Mexico right now. The big concern is the rainfall that it will bring and what happens when that hits the already very high Mississippi River. Now, the big question tonight is can the New Orleans levees handle this? It is the first real test of this kind of influx of water since Hurricane Katrina back in August of 2005. Governor Bel Edwards of Louisiana will join me live in moments with the very latest that he has for us. Our team coverage begins tonight with Rick Leventhal who is standing by, watching all of this in New Orleans. Good evening, Rick."

But it's an unusual night here on Bourbon Street and here in the French Quarter, because a lot of restaurants and bars have already closed or will be closing very soon because they know conditions will deteriorate rapidly. And as you mentioned, it's not really about the wind on this storm. It's about the rain and about the potential flooding along that Mississippi River where they have closed more than 200 flood gates in and around the New Orleans area. This is the first time ever that the river was at flood stage when a hurricane was threatening to hit. The river near 17 feet now, the levees designed to hold back 20 to 25 feet in spots. We did speak to the Army Corps of Engineers the short time ago who tell us that the system has been tested for the past few months because of unusually high amounts of rain and snow over the winter and the spring. So, the rivers been a flood stage for a while and they say they're confident that the gates and the levees will hold."

This is what we're seeing now, but conditions can't change and residents need to stay alert and key and keep it aware of what is going to happen and what's projected to happen. Rain shouldn't be a huge impact on the elevation of the river itself. But rain is a factor in the interior of the city."

      "utterance": "Some 3,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard have been mobilized, they are staging in and around the city of New Orleans and beyond. They're also staging high water rescue vehicles along with food and water and emergency supplies at key locations. And evacuation orders have been issued and were issued for numerous parishes and low-lying areas and also for Grand Isle where the major roadway in and out. L.A. one, the only way in and out of Grand Isle is under water. So, not bad here now, Martha. But again, it's expected to get a whole lot worse over the overnight and into tomorrow where they could get 10-20 inches, perhaps, two feet or more in some areas."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. JOHN BEL EDWARDS, D-LA",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, it's a very serious situation. The storm will come ashore about 7:00 tomorrow morning and the coast of Central Louisiana around Morgan City and Franklin Parish, should be a Category 1 hurricane. My biggest concern is that we will have citizens who understand that it's a Category 1 and they may not take it as seriously as they should have, because this has always been a rain event predominantly. And we're going to have 15 to 20 inches of rain across most of Southern Louisiana for about 24 hours. That rain will fall in about 24 hours. And so, we need people to take every precaution to be patient, listen to their local elected officials. And we're doing everything that we can to posture ourselves with National Guard, State Police, with buses and shelters today, so they will be ready for that. And I will tell you I'm very thankful that President Trump yesterday signed off on a declaration request that I made so that federal assistance is available to us and we're able to coordinate with federal agencies and get movement sooner than would otherwise be the case of essential equipment and personnel for life-saving activities here in Louisiana, and also to protect property."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EDWARDS",
      "utterance": "That -- that's right. But, look, the -- I don't believe that Hurricane Katrina is particularly instructive as it relates to this hurricane. The levee system in New Orleans is the strongest that has ever been because of the generous support that we've received from folks all over the country, and billions of dollars have been invested. We don't believe and yes, I know you just had a report from the Corps of Engineers in New Orleans that the river will overtop the levees and so forth. Two days ago we had a test run in New Orleans with a very heavy downpour in a very short period of time. We know that the pumps are working we know that the electric -- electricity generation is in order. So, we feel relatively good about New Orleans for this particular storm. But there will be challenges across all of Southern Louisiana when the storm comes onshore tomorrow."

We actually have more experience than we would like with disasters. But this is going to be a tough one, and I worry an awful lot about the rain as it falls not as it relates to the Mississippi rivers but all the other rivers that we have across south Louisiana. They are going to fill and swell and cause some real problems over the next couple of days. Even when the rain leaves out tomorrow night or early on Sunday, the rivers are going to continue to track the water from all the tributaries and inner flood stage and pretty high -- highly elevated flood stages for some time to come."

And we're discussing deporting or sending back to their home countries, maybe a million. I doubt it would be that much or that many but only those who have already received a summons that they're in violation of federal law. If we were to do all of that, Martha, that would only be five percent of the people who are here currently living unlawfully and it wouldn't make a dent in the numbers because that many people, that exact number of people one million have already arrived illegally in the first six months of this year. As far as the hysteria, most of the protocols, not all but most of them that separate children from their parents who go on to court hearings were inaugurated during the Obama administration. And we still haven't deported 365,000 annually, that was the high point in the Obama administration. The Trump administration hasn't done that. If you look at the people who have tragically died, it's about 10 to 12 in the first two years of the Trump administration, unfortunately, about the same as Obama where 12 -- when 12 people died the last year of his office. So what is all this about? It's about demography, and politics and the 2020 campaign. But it's not about worrying about actual human beings. If they did, I could think of a lot of out-of-the-box solutions we could -- we could enact right now. There's 4,000 colleges and universities that have over a million dorm rooms that are open for the next 90 days. How original would that be if we had the American Southwest, the sanctuary community stand up and say please send us these families. We have legal and health resources on campus. We have empty rooms. It would be a fantastic way for a lot of cash-strapped universities to become contractors and be reimbursed by the federal government. We're not interested in that."

The five suspected drug smugglers were taken into custody. Nice work, coast guard. Remember all that? So, apparently, the new \"Lion King\" and the old \"Lion King\" are fascist, racist, and anti-Semitic. The highly anticipated new photo realistic version of the \"Lion King\" is likely to be one the hottest blockbuster movies of the summer. Every kid is going to want to go see this.

It reads like a bad term paper freshman year. The trouble is this was written by a professor and that tells you all you need to know about higher education. \"The Lion King \"is a wonderful story, it is about redemption, it is about grace, it is endurance. It is based on Hamlet; it's based on the books of Genesis and Exodus. It is not about fascism but because the left right now has become so culturally illiterate, the only thing that they can ever referred to in their cultural criticism is Hitler. Everything they don't like is Hitlerian, or fascist, or Nazi. I should also point out, this is a very racist article. They are -- the author compares black people to hyenas. He even at one point implies that black skin is some sort of disability. Obviously, this is absurd.

So, I think this, I guess, once again, I want to say I think it's disingenuous.

So I think one thing that's very interesting about the way I think this author is misguided, is if you take a look at -- if you understand Africa, right, and the history of the continent, and realize the reason why Africa right now is divided the way it is has to do with colonialism at the time. Prior to colonialism, Africa was very tribal, and in that time, tribe had kings and they had, some of the tribes had queens. They were very -- there were some tribes were very matriarchal, right, and sometimes they're very patriarchal. So, it depends upon the time. The reason Africa the way it is now has everything to do with western civilization and the fact it was colonialized. So, it's actually quite the opposite of what this author is talking about."

We have since been flooded with reaction to this story. One viewer taking the side of Foster -- many viewers did, I should point out saying this. \"Not only does he value his reputation, he also showed value in the female reporter's reputation. The Me Too movement has created an atmosphere of caution and you can't fault a man for wanting to respect his marriage vows.\" But a few others disagreed. \"If Foster is so concerned with his reputation, then what's to prevent a woman and the chaperone she's required to invite from concocting an accusation together. It's his responsibly to protect his reputation and not the woman. Foster's argument is simply flawed\" wrote that viewer.

You don't need 16 hours of unfettered access to do a profile piece on your boss. Her job was not hindered. And quite honestly, I think he made the right decision by not trusting this reporter, not wanting to give her the access. Because clearly, her motivations aren't good.
