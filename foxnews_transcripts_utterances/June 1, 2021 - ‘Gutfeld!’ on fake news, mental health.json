Anyway, if the findings showed the reverse, CNN would never have run the study. If the story doesn't match their assumptions, it'll vanish faster than Jeffrey Epstein's little black book. The study found that overconfident people are more likely to share false content taken from untrustworthy Web sites. o what's that sound like to you? At CNN anchor? If you remember, CNN put some of the most false stories ever. From collusion to obstruction. To Covington to Kavanaugh. These guys put out more fictional content than Stephen King. And now they say you can't tell the difference between real and fake news. I call it gaslighting. But only Pete Hegseth does that after eating a bowl of beans. CNN -- I just figured maybe. CNN is like the guy on the corner selling fake Rolexes laughing at you for buying one. And in both cases, you know, the product is fake because of where you got it. One guy's just selling it from a T.V. studio. The other is naked except for a trench coat standing in front of a Time Square peep show. And they're both Don Lemon. But this study is brought to you by the Trump era, by destroying legacy media. After four years of Trump, these guys were more exposed than Anthony Weiner on Snapchat at 2:00 a.m. Now we know the emperor has no clothes. I hope that doesn't include Brian Stelter. Sorry for the image. So it's not their fault for pushing fake news. It's your fault, they say, which leads me to another stranger study. Last year, Pew reported that conservatives were far less likely to be diagnosed with mental health issues than those who identified as either liberal or very liberal. The worst suffers white women aged 18 to 29, who were given a mental health diagnosis at a rate of 56.3 percent. That's more than double moderates and conservatives. The first thing you learn from their surveys, there's a lot of mental health issues out there. But you also can learn that from being on Tinder for a week. But it raises the question, do leftwing ideas cause mental health issues or do people with mental health issues gravitate towards left wing stuff? Another way to ask this is, was Pelosi back (BLEEP) crazy before she got into politics or after? Let's see what CNN thinks.",

      "sentences": "Hmm. Save it. So why so many liberals experiencing mental issues? I'm no doctor, but I'm not going to let that stop me. If you're always digesting content from a conveyor belt of grievances while thinking there's a bunch of evil people hell bent on making the world worse. What's that do to your brain? Well, you get angry, you go outside, you scream at cops. You're told the world is nothing but two groups, the oppressed and oppressor. But if you believe that people are irredeemably bad, and there's no justice, then how useful are you? If every day you're constantly monitoring stories of horrible inequality supplied by your media source, it's got to add up. And if your ideology demands, all of this behavior must be eradicated. What happens when you can't do that? You're helpless. You're just one person armed with only a woman study degree and a hat that looks like your privates. You become divorced from reality from your friends and your family. It's now a clash between an impossible utopian vision and a distorted reality designed by the media just to make you mad. No wonder so many people are agitated, especially women who generally care more about the world than pigs like me. My solution of course, there's always going to be skepticism to step back and see how the media manipulates you. And how that manipulation affects your mind and your moods. It's like being in a bad relationship, but you keep coming back for more, but it's not real. Seriously, by comparison, the Wizard of Oz is nonfiction. Then consider the lost opportunity cost of wallowing in oppression theater. Sometimes you use other people's problems to avoid your own. You display compassion for refugees, but you haven't spoken to your parents in years. Instead rebuilding your resilience to overcome life's problems. You fail. But at least it's not your fault. It's those damn sweatshops in Sri Lanka. It's prison lunches full of gluten. It's anywhere but here. It's anyone but you. Of course, mental issues exist independent of the media. I have been insane for decades. And I could be getting worse. But the media has no compassion for your current state and they use it to their advantage. Legacy media needs vulnerable people to watch the rage creating clickbait, but if you brought that up to CNN, they call it fake news.",

We could put it up here real quick, Tom, whoever, where they took automated prison where they kept using soldiers and slaves and most of them died of exposure, starvation, brutality. They buried all 600 to 800 bodies and skip town. Emancipation came and free men and women slaves and people in the community came dug them all up, gave them proper Bellary put flowers on it and then the most crazy thing happened. 10,000 people showed up, honoring the 54th, honoring Union soldiers and Confederate soldiers who died in the battle and it was the first recorded celebration of Memorial Day.

Anyway, if the findings showed the reverse, CNN would never have run the study. If the story doesn't match their assumptions, it'll vanish faster than Jeffrey Epstein's little black book. The study found that overconfident people are more likely to share false content taken from untrustworthy Web sites. o what's that sound like to you? At CNN anchor? If you remember, CNN put some of the most false stories ever. From collusion to obstruction. To Covington to Kavanaugh. These guys put out more fictional content than Stephen King. And now they say you can't tell the difference between real and fake news. I call it gaslighting. But only Pete Hegseth does that after eating a bowl of beans. CNN -- I just figured maybe. CNN is like the guy on the corner selling fake Rolexes laughing at you for buying one. And in both cases, you know, the product is fake because of where you got it. One guy's just selling it from a T.V. studio. The other is naked except for a trench coat standing in front of a Time Square peep show. And they're both Don Lemon. But this study is brought to you by the Trump era, by destroying legacy media. After four years of Trump, these guys were more exposed than Anthony Weiner on Snapchat at 2:00 a.m. Now we know the emperor has no clothes. I hope that doesn't include Brian Stelter. Sorry for the image. So it's not their fault for pushing fake news. It's your fault, they say, which leads me to another stranger study. Last year, Pew reported that conservatives were far less likely to be diagnosed with mental health issues than those who identified as either liberal or very liberal. The worst suffers white women aged 18 to 29, who were given a mental health diagnosis at a rate of 56.3 percent. That's more than double moderates and conservatives. The first thing you learn from their surveys, there's a lot of mental health issues out there. But you also can learn that from being on Tinder for a week. But it raises the question, do leftwing ideas cause mental health issues or do people with mental health issues gravitate towards left wing stuff? Another way to ask this is, was Pelosi back (BLEEP) crazy before she got into politics or after? Let's see what CNN thinks."

If you're always digesting content from a conveyor belt of grievances while thinking there's a bunch of evil people hell bent on making the world worse. What's that do to your brain? Well, you get angry, you go outside, you scream at cops. You're told the world is nothing but two groups, the oppressed and oppressor. But if you believe that people are irredeemably bad, and there's no justice, then how useful are you? If every day you're constantly monitoring stories of horrible inequality supplied by your media source, it's got to add up. And if your ideology demands, all of this behavior must be eradicated. What happens when you can't do that? You're helpless. You're just one person armed with only a woman study degree and a hat that looks like your privates. You become divorced from reality from your friends and your family. It's now a clash between an impossible utopian vision and a distorted reality designed by the media just to make you mad. No wonder so many people are agitated, especially women who generally care more about the world than pigs like me. My solution of course, there's always going to be skepticism to step back and see how the media manipulates you. And how that manipulation affects your mind and your moods. It's like being in a bad relationship, but you keep coming back for more, but it's not real. Seriously, by comparison, the Wizard of Oz is nonfiction. Then consider the lost opportunity cost of wallowing in oppression theater. Sometimes you use other people's problems to avoid your own. You display compassion for refugees, but you haven't spoken to your parents in years. Instead rebuilding your resilience to overcome life's problems. You fail. But at least it's not your fault. It's those damn sweatshops in Sri Lanka. It's prison lunches full of gluten. It's anywhere but here. It's anyone but you. Of course, mental issues exist independent of the media. I have been insane for decades. And I could be getting worse. But the media has no compassion for your current state and they use it to their advantage. Legacy media needs vulnerable people to watch the rage creating clickbait, but if you brought that up to CNN, they call it fake news."

Memorial Day, was actually started in 1865 when, during the Civil War, at the end, when the Confederates took over Charleston, they took over an old race track. I think I have a picture of it. We could put it up here real quick, Tom, whoever, where they took automated prison where they kept using soldiers and slaves and most of them died of exposure, starvation, brutality. They buried all 600 to 800 bodies and skip town. Emancipation came and free men and women slaves and people in the community came dug them all up, gave them proper Bellary put flowers on it and then the most crazy thing happened. 10,000 people showed up, honoring the 54th, honoring Union soldiers and Confederate soldiers who died in the battle and it was the first recorded celebration of Memorial Day.

When I was a kid, we go on our bikes to the movies and watch movies, and then we go and the conversation afterwards where she explained to me how (INAUDIBLE) didn't like Godzilla, because who would like somebody with one head when you have three? And I was like, you know what, that's brilliant. And whatever little mind was going it was just us, but that that part of I love that because as I'm sharing something with them. So, I hope they don't go away, but I realized that I'm getting old. I'm not quite in the, you know, commercial demographic what you are. But I could see in my lifetime the laziness of let's stay at home, and of course the numbers are down because you can see movies at home or in the theater.
