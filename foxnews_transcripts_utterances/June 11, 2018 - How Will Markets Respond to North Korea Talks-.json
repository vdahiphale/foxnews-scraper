Five hours from now, the president of the United States sits down with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, the first U.S. president to do so with a North Korean leader. And the stakes obviously couldn't be higher. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. Well, leading up to those talks, Kim Jong-un out and about visiting a Sands casino resort in Singapore. The guy, remember, doesn't get out that much. The North Korean also stopping to pose for a selfie. Former basketball star Dennis Rodman arriving on the scene, saying that he wants to cheer on both sides. And stocks, which were all over the map, ended up nominally to the upside today. But what is remarkable is, through trade wars and tiffs and alienating comments back and forth between ourselves and the Canadians, they have been up and continue to go up. So what do they see that maybe some worried pundits do not? Let's get the read from John Roberts in Singapore, at least for this summit. What happens next?

      "sentences": "Neil, good job morning to you from Singapore.And the latest that we're learning is, the reason why President Trump has moved up his departure to 7:00 p.m. tonight from tomorrow morning here in Singapore is that Kim Jong-un's people told the United States' delegation that said he was going to be leaving this afternoon.The president had reserved Wednesday morning for additional talks, if it was necessary. So, the president decided, well, if Kim's leaving, there is no reason for me to hang around. So he's scheduled to go out at 7:00 tonight, after a 4:00 p.m. press conference, which will be 4:00 in the morning, 12 hours from now New York time. So if you want to hear what the president has to say, set your alarm clocks, because that's when he will be speaking. The president with a lot to offer Kim Jong-un in their very first historic bilateral meeting today between the United States president and a North Korean leader. He's got to economic guarantees for Kim on the table. He's got security guarantees, a potential end to the Korean War, after it's just been under an armistice for all of these decades, and the potential for the normalization of relations between the United States and North Korea, if -- and this is a big if -- North Korea and Kim Jong-un are willing to give up their nuclear program.The president also changing up the paradigm here. This is not going to be incrementalism, as we have seen in the past, where the United States trades some economic benefits for something to curb North Korea's nuclear program. The president wants complete and irreversible and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What's really interesting is that the first meeting today is going to be simply between President Trump and Kim Jong-un one on one with only their translators present, unlike this big luncheon, bilateral meeting that you see here with Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong.

That Marina Bay Sands, the iconic structure now on the Singapore skyline, that there's three high-rise towers of hotel rooms, and then something spread across the top of it that looks like a cargo ship that somehow landed up there, it's owned, by the way, by Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and a big supporter of President Trump. So, Neil, perhaps Kim Jong-un getting a look there at what might be possible to get some new economic incentives from the United States in exchange for denuclearization. I should say one thing about the departure, though, Neil. While the president is set to go tonight at 7:00, we're told that the departure is still fluid.

But that's a chance for President Trump to say to Kim Jong-un, here are -- just in case Kim Jong-un has been misinformed by the lackeys and acolytes who surround him about the real nature of American military might, capability, and so on, look, we do have the ability to obliterate you.

And the problem is, what needs to happen for anything to be credible, for any complete, verifiable, irreversible, in the phrase of the day, right, is the end of that regime, a change in character so profound that it's effectively gone, that Kim presides as some titular head of a very different regime, which I think would bring his downfall, or that we simply get rid of them. It's -- unfortunately, Neil, that's where all my calculations end up, is, this regime has to go. And when that happens, we can talk about seriously decreasing the danger that is North Korea. But as long as Kim Jong-un has this power that he inherited and has greatly amplified by such things as assassinating his brother -- half-brother with V.X. nerve agent, executing his uncle, people who had ideas about liberalizing North Korea, by the way, he has had murdered, it really isn't going to change. We are likely to see more tinsel and promises and kicking the can down the road. So that that's the bottom line, Neil. The regime, one way or another, has to go.

This man, Mike Pompeo, is going to pick up the pieces. Whatever comes out of the meeting today, he's a full-time secretary of state. Everyone believes that he speaks for Trump. And his schedule reflects this confidence, that there's going to be at least thread that can be found after today's meeting that the U.S. can take to our allies, South Korea and Japan. Pompeo is departing for Seoul, South Korea, tomorrow. And he heads to Beijing on Friday, again, just sort of cementing this notion that this U.S.-North Korean diplomacy isn't operating in isolation. It's part of a bigger diplomatic process that involves our allies.

Five hours from now, the president of the United States sits down with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, the first U.S. president to do so with a North Korean leader.

The guy, remember, doesn't get out that much. The North Korean also stopping to pose for a selfie. Former basketball star Dennis Rodman arriving on the scene, saying that he wants to cheer on both sides. And stocks, which were all over the map, ended up nominally to the upside today. But what is remarkable is, through trade wars and tiffs and alienating comments back and forth between ourselves and the Canadians, they have been up and continue to go up. So what do they see that maybe some worried pundits do not? Let's get the read from John Roberts in Singapore, at least for this summit. What happens next? Hey, John."

      "utterance": "Neil, good job morning to you from Singapore.And the latest that we're learning is, the reason why President Trump has moved up his departure to 7:00 p.m. tonight from tomorrow morning here in Singapore is that Kim Jong-un's people told the United States' delegation that said he was going to be leaving this afternoon.The president had reserved Wednesday morning for additional talks, if it was necessary. So, the president decided, well, if Kim's leaving, there is no reason for me to hang around. So he's scheduled to go out at 7:00 tonight, after a 4:00 p.m. press conference, which will be 4:00 in the morning, 12 hours from now New York time. So if you want to hear what the president has to say, set your alarm clocks, because that's when he will be speaking. The president with a lot to offer Kim Jong-un in their very first historic bilateral meeting today between the United States president and a North Korean leader. He's got to economic guarantees for Kim on the table. He's got security guarantees, a potential end to the Korean War, after it's just been under an armistice for all of these decades, and the potential for the normalization of relations between the United States and North Korea, if -- and this is a big if -- North Korea and Kim Jong-un are willing to give up their nuclear program.The president also changing up the paradigm here. This is not going to be incrementalism, as we have seen in the past, where the United States trades some economic benefits for something to curb North Korea's nuclear program. The president wants complete and irreversible and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. What's really interesting is that the first meeting today is going to be simply between President Trump and Kim Jong-un one on one with only their translators present, unlike this big luncheon, bilateral meeting that you see here with Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. And there's the president together with Prime Minister Lee. Kellyanne Conway telling us this morning that that's the way the president likes to do things, mano a mano."

One of the places he visited, as you mentioned at the very top of this, Neil, was the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino. There you see Kim walking around. Really is extraordinary. This is the farthest that he's ever been outside of Pyongyang as the leader of North Korea. That Marina Bay Sands, the iconic structure now on the Singapore skyline, that there's three high-rise towers of hotel rooms, and then something spread across the top of it that looks like a cargo ship that somehow landed up there, it's owned, by the way, by Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and a big supporter of President Trump. So, Neil, perhaps Kim Jong-un getting a look there at what might be possible to get some new economic incentives from the United States in exchange for denuclearization. I should say one thing about the departure, though, Neil. While the president is set to go tonight at 7:00, we're told that the departure is still fluid.

So, out of that came the Cold War and our current problem. So it's true. You don't know -- you can't always -- you can't pick who you negotiate with or who you confront. But you can be keenly aware that everything points to Kim will want any benefits, but he's probably going to look for any way he can find to not deliver this denuclearization, whatever that actually means, basically to not give up his nuclear program. And, remember, he also has biological, chemical weapons, and the conventional weapons that have held Seoul hostage since the Korean War. So, that's the real scene."

That's why I am encouraged actually that President Trump wants this one-on- one meeting, where if I were North Korea's translator, I would be worried that I was going to be killed on the way out of Singapore, because these will be the witnesses. But that's a chance for President Trump to say to Kim Jong-un, here are -- just in case Kim Jong-un has been misinformed by the lackeys and acolytes who surround him about the real nature of American military might, capability, and so on, look, we do have the ability to obliterate you. And Trump needs some credible way to really make that threat. Now, I don't know if he will. But that's what might persuade Kim to do something. And the problem is, what needs to happen for anything to be credible, for any complete, verifiable, irreversible, in the phrase of the day, right, is the end of that regime, a change in character so profound that it's effectively gone, that Kim presides as some titular head of a very different regime, which I think would bring his downfall, or that we simply get rid of them. It's -- unfortunately, Neil, that's where all my calculations end up, is, this regime has to go. And when that happens, we can talk about seriously decreasing the danger that is North Korea. But as long as Kim Jong-un has this power that he inherited and has greatly amplified by such things as assassinating his brother -- half-brother with V.X. nerve agent, executing his uncle, people who had ideas about liberalizing North Korea, by the way, he has had murdered, it really isn't going to change. We are likely to see more tinsel and promises and kicking the can down the road. So that that's the bottom line, Neil. The regime, one way or another, has to go. What I would -- in my dreams, President Trump would say to Kim in this private session, there's one security guarantee we can offer you, and that is the Marcos residence on Hawaii, where he lived out his life in exile after he left the Philippines, because if -- I don't think, while the regime remains in place, we can pry away its nuclear program."

Senator, what do you think of that, that, in the end, this really comes down to recognizing we can't trust this -- this guy and the people around him, and that, ultimately, the only way to assure cooperation down the road is that he not be there? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD, R—OKLAHOMA: He has been the brutal dictator. And the people around him have answered yes to every single statement that he has made, because, if they don't, he has been executed publicly. And he is not afraid to be able to take military leaders, put them on a post, and kill them with an anti-aircraft gun for a public execution. So, he has been a ruthless dictator, despite all the pictures of him smiling and walking through the streets in Singapore. And we should be keenly aware of that as we're negotiating with him. Now, if he wants his people, and he has any compassion for the people and the millions of folks that live in squalor and poverty in North Korea, he will set aside his nuclear weapons, and so they have the opportunity to be able to have electricity and food and the opportunities that the rest of the world around them has."

So, our sanctions in place. We're continuing to apply pressure. But it's entirely reasonable to say, we're not applying pressure so we never talk. We're applying pressure to force us all to the table, so we actually talk and get to an agreement. So, if you're going to apply strict sanctions, the reason for those sanctions is to get to the table that they're headed to in about 12 hours from now, and so they can get to that table, get a resolution, come out of it out with a first step. And I have no optimism that everything gets resolved today. But I do have some optimism that they can at least lay the groundwork for the next meeting.

Their history is that they don't, that they lie and they cheat and they find ways around things, sometimes waiting years to not live up to those accords.You talk about the Ronald Reagan approach, trust but verify, but even when we were trying to verify, they were changing the rules midstream.

What is the benefit of trying to make sure it's short and sweet? It would still be short, but will the results still be sweet? The read from a guy who served our country, not only on the battlefield, but in the United States Congress, after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It's all in how they look, all in how they president themselves. The president says he can tell within the first minute how things are going to go. So does that mean he smiles, the North Korean leader smiles? Why these things matter more you know -- after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so what to expect when they first sit down. Donald Trump made some news over the weekend when he said, within the first minute or so, I have a pretty good idea how things could go. Don't laugh about it. A lot of people say, in business, as in just general life, we can size up someone almost that quickly. Retired us U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, former Republican Congressman Allen West, he served in Korea, by the way. And it's very good to have you. Thank you for taking the time, sir."

    {
      "speaker": "FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN ALLEN WEST",
      "utterance": "My pleasure, Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What do you make of that? You're a pretty good read of folks. That you can size them up that quickly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "Well, I can tell you, when I was a commanding officer, one of the things we would tell young lieutenants that were reporting in for the first time, that most of the good commanders can size you up and make an assessment of who you are by looking at you, your comportment, how your uniform looks, your haircut. And then, when you open your mouth, you either confirm or deny our initial assertions. So I think it is very important that President Trump does that. I think that he maintains the high ground and maintains a position of -- I want to say dominance, really, when you think about it. And I listened to your previous guest. I think it's important that we keep this meeting short, because the longer it goes on, it makes it seem like Kim Jong-un has a moral victory, has a propaganda victory. It's very simple. We lay down the markers. This is what has to happen. And then you allow the respective staffs from North Korea and the United States to continue on with this process."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You talk about a victory for the other side, I guess, for the North Korea leader here. But I understand like keep it to time. But a few hours is really tight, unless, as to your point -- I know we chatted before about this -- they have done a lot of legwork and sort of the groundwork for this in advance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "Well, if anyone thinks that we're going to solve what has been going on since 1953 in this meeting over Singapore, I mean, you're delusional. But I think the most important thing is that President Trump looks eyeball to eyeball with Kim Jong-un, who is a person that is economically destitute in his country, quite isolated internationally, and let him know that you have a chance. You have a chance to bring a brighter future to the people of North Korea, or you can continue down this path, and you will find yourself being the member of the Kim family that saw your family's rule come to an end."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Why do you think, Allen, that the North Koreans are doing this, that this -- this leader is doing this now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "It's very simple, Neil. The game of international extortion has come to an end. When I was stationed over in Korea in 1995, that was during the Bill Clinton administration. That was when Kim's father was in charge there. And what they would, they would rattle their sabers. They would make their threats. And we would give them the financial aid and the food aid that would keep them sustained. That has ended. When you look at these sanctions, they are the toughest that we have ever had. We have a mini-naval blockade, pretty much so, that is out there intercepting any ships that are coming and going from North Korea. And that has put a stranglehold on him. And, furthermore, we're putting a lot of pressure on China as well."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "The main thing I want to know is whether this process continue on. Where does it go from here? I didn't expect this to be the great end-all meeting, like your previous guest talked about. It is not going to be two weeks at Camp David or what have you. But what are going to be the initial markers that were laid down? And where do we continue on in this process? I would like to see what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo comes out and says. I would like to see what the national security adviser, John Bolton, comes out and says. I want to hear that the sanctions remain in place. I want to hear that we are giving them an opportunity over the next six months to a year to start the dismantling of their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program. I also think that Japan wants to hear that they're going to have their hostages released as well."

And traders that I talk to say, you know, we could see a positive surprise from North Korea later on tonight, because it's not just a two-way summit. It's not just North Korea and the U.S. China is involved as well. We know Kim Jong-un flew to Singapore on an Air China jet."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "utterance": "Well, listen, everything looked hunky-dory in late 2007 to early 2008. And I remember when it -- when the switch went on, and it wasn't. And I would just say this. If Donald Trump gets peace in our time with this, the markets will go up, OK? Got you. If he gets nothing, and he just doesn't do anything bad, markets will trade off other issues. But this trade stuff that he's worked -- that he's doing, the role of the dice, I think the market isn't -- right now, the markets are just saying..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "But there has been sort of unexpected stuff that comes -- that came in the past. It always does. And let me tell you something. You're going to have -- you have tax cuts, which are going to increase the size of the deficit, meaning we're going to get marginally higher interest rates anyway, because we have to sell more debt. If you got that..."

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "But if it doesn't initially -- and, usually, it takes a little while -- if it doesn't, if it doesn't pay for itself, you are going to have a trade war on top of much higher interest rates. Not good."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Sort of rallying around the leader, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "It's the big, bad U.S. bully coming in to tell us what to do. And if Justin Trudeau is standing up to him, well, hey, maybe he might not be a bad strong leader for Canada in the next elections, which he's behind in the polls in some..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But isn't that the expected response? I found it unfathomable, the comments that were made about Justin Trudeau, whatever you think of this trade deal. But you're going to rally around the leader, conservatives, liberals alike, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "Correct. And that's what happened both sides of the aisle. So, in some ways, I guess there's been a bipartisan effect in Canada thanks to Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right. Why do you think he did this, the president did this? Or Peter Navarro said there's a special place in hell for..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "In what way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Well, to show that we're not going to take anybody's garbage, and we're going to fight you. And -- but -- but, that said, words do matter. And if you spit in the eye of the G7, which -- who are nominally -- at least -- at least in name -- people we can use to blunt the growth of China as an economic superpower looking to take over the world -- that's a real problem. Like I said, right now, the markets aren't recognizing that trade is an issue. They have grown comfortable with Trump. They like his -- most of his fiscal policies. They like his deregulatory agenda. They don't think he's going to press the button on trade. However, markets are often wrong. And if he does press the button, if there is a wide-ranging trade war, if China doesn't kick in what they're supposed to kick in after we let ZTE survive, if there's a problem with trade, and we got a trade problem, when we have higher interest rates, that could be a problem for these markets."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "If there's rotation to small caps, what does that say about political risk? It says that people don't know -- they're going to smaller companies, not large ones, that might be more impacted by trade regulations."

    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "They're also looking for yield and for growth, right?"
    },

      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "And yields below 3 percent still on a week..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, so far, they're looking the other way, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "I'm saying, you increase your risk profiles right before the markets usually blow up. Just -- that always -- that always happens."

      "utterance": "That doesn't mean they will blow up."
    },

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we will see what happens here. All right, in the meantime here, obviously, the summit, and that's getting a lot of attention here, but the other issue has to be whether this has gotten a little ahead of itself, and that some sort of a correction, some sort of a pullback is in order. I'm not talking about the markets. I'm talking about the expectations -- after this. FORMER GOVERNOR BILL RICHARDSON, D—NEW MEXICO: The North Koreans will use that picture of the spy chief smiling, the jocular nature of that meeting, for their domestic political propaganda, because they -- the number one thing the North Koreans want, Neil, is to show that they're on the par. Two leaders, their leader and the president of United States, are in the same par."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so, does that mean that no one can smile? I don't know. Tara Maller is with us now, former CIA analyst, Counter terrorism -- Extremism Project senior policy adviser. Tara, what do you think, that you got to be very careful how much emotion you show one way or the other?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARA MALLER, SPOKESPERSON, COUNTER EXTREMISM PROJECT",
      "utterance": "You do have to be careful. But, at the end of the day, the North Koreans are going to use this for propaganda no matter what happens. They're going to use the photo-op, the symbolic nature of this. And you know what? That's fine. I'm sort of less concerned about some of these softer variables. They're all important, the body language, the photo-op. But what's really going to be important here at the end of the day, are there zones of agreement that President Trump and the North Koreans -- the U.S. and the North Koreans can reach through these, I think it's three meetings, really? It's a one-on-one with President Trump. And there's a more expanded bilateral, which I think Secretary Pompeo will sit in on, as well as General Kelly and perhaps a few others. And then I think there is perhaps a lunch following. At least, that's what been reported. So there's been a few opportunities here, but I don't think we want to set expectations too high. It's a good first step. There's going to need to be a long road map ahead to reach any sort of real outcome."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, to your point, Tara -- and we have discussed this before -- the fact that they're meeting, we can get in the weeds and say, oh, what do they to have agree to or not. This is unprecedented. This is historic. Whether you're a Trump lover or hater, calm down. It is historic, in and of itself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Having said all of that, though, some are wondering, given the president's language and harsh response to G7 leaders, and particularly the leader of Canada, I'm wondering what that was about and what it might portend for this meeting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MALLER",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I did hear remarks coming out of the administration that that was sort of to lay the lead-up to North Korea, to show that Trump is strong and he's not going to back down by criticizing Trudeau. I think that was sort of fixing it after the fact. Really, what we need to see here going into this meeting in a well-prepared, clearly articulated strategy. I agree with you. This is a historical summit. Praise where praise is due to the administration for lining it up and getting it have to happen rather quickly. I am a little bit concerned about this first portion of the meeting, this one-on-one, where there's nobody else in the room but translators. I just think that leaves open a lot of room for potential volatility. And what I mean by that is, after that happens, you're just going to have both individuals' declarations of what actually transpired. And you could see some disputes after the meeting about what actually was said. I mean, we have seen that before with the Trump administration, and not in a situation that is this high-caliber, this high-pressure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But they will have other meetings. They're starting out mano a mano with their translators, right? I mean, it's not as if they're going to -- the whole thing is that way. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MALLER",
      "utterance": "Agree. It's not as if the whole thing is that way, but that is supposedly the first meeting that is going to set the tone. We have heard President Trump himself say that, if he doesn't think things are going welcome, he might not even go forth with the meeting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I hear you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MALLER",
      "utterance": "It could go quite well and set a very positive tone for the rest of this day. So, as President Trump likes to say, we will see what happens. But I do think that that one-on-one, I'm sort of surprised that Secretary Pompeo or somebody else didn't push to have perhaps one other person, to protect the president as well, right? The North Koreans can come out of that claiming that President Trump said things that he didn't say."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "VARGAS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, we're just hours away, the city here starting to wake up to probably one of the most historic days in diplomacy, for a city that has hosted a lot of big meetings in the past. I have to say, myself and a lot of other journalists were in that press briefing yesterday with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. And I think we're starting to be pretty confident. This man, Mike Pompeo, is going to pick up the pieces. Whatever comes out of the meeting today, he's a full-time secretary of state. Everyone believes that he speaks for Trump. And his schedule reflects this confidence, that there's going to be at least thread that can be found after today's meeting that the U.S. can take to our allies, South Korea and Japan. Pompeo is departing for Seoul, South Korea, tomorrow. And he heads to Beijing on Friday, again, just sort of cementing this notion that this U.S.-North Korean diplomacy isn't operating in isolation. It's part of a bigger diplomatic process that involves our allies. And, again, unlike Rex Tillerson before him, I think everyone believes here Mike Pompeo is willing to dedicate all of his energy to continuing whatever comes out of the Singapore process. Once again, you want to leave these talks in trusted hands. And I think Pompeo is giving off all the right signals."

Others are confirming as well that they expect something to come of these talks, brief though they might be. We're going to be monitoring, of course, on FOX Business 9:00 p.m. When the talks begin, we will begin. And we will be on throughout the night, as long as it takes, to get you the latest, with concurrent foreign market reaction, particularly Chinese market reaction, Asian community market reaction, as that will extend overnight to futures trading and rest. Altogether, to put this in perspective, people will be betting money. We will be on it throughout the night. END <Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.
