So these numbers show that early voting among Democrats appears to be twice the rate of Republican who tend to wait until Election Day, they want to drop that ballot into the box in person or pull the lever or whatever they do in each state. So there are the voters stretched out in Florida today where they just began early voting. Long lines, masked, social distance, all in place. They want to place their ballot in person so at this stage of the game watching where the two candidates are, where President Trump is and where the former vice president Joe Biden is, our key to mapping out how each side sees their path to victory. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Today, we have President Trump with back to back events in Arizona.

That's why it's past time that we revoke the immunity for these big tech giants.

Two weeks from tomorrow is Election Day in the United States of America but in a really astounding turn of events, we have nearly 30 million Americans who have already voted. Now keep in mind in all of 2016, 136 million was the total number of votes when all was said and done on Election Day. So these numbers show that early voting among Democrats appears to be twice the rate of Republican who tend to wait until Election Day, they want to drop that ballot into the box in person or pull the lever or whatever they do in each state. So there are the voters stretched out in Florida today where they just began early voting. Long lines, masked, social distance, all in place. They want to place their ballot in person so at this stage of the game watching where the two candidates are, where President Trump is and where the former vice president Joe Biden is, our key to mapping out how each side sees their path to victory. Today, we have President Trump with back to back events in Arizona. A lot of focus for him in Arizona which I believe he won by about 3 last time. He wants to hold on to that state 3.5 points back in 2016. Joe Biden is in deep preparation apparently for Thursday night's debate. He has a lid on his campaign events for the next two days until we get to Nashville for the big debate on Thursday night. Here's the DNC Chair Tom Perez on Face the Nation. Watch."

Thanks so much. I appreciate the time so these numbers that Tom Perez is talking about 350,000 new voters. Obviously there's a big effort on both sides because we know that people who register to vote for the first time or the first time in a long time, they said - they tend to turn out. What's your operation seeing in those numbers?"

      "speaker": "HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Well look, a couple things I think important to note here, the Democrats put pretty much everything they had in their early voting. They tried to scare Americans to say they couldn't get out and safely do, it that social distancing wouldn't work, that masks wouldn't work, that they need to vote from home and Democrats seem to be doing that in bigger numbers than Republicans. But that's something we expected to happen because that's something that usually happens in presidential politics. The problem is it's not happening at the rate they thought it would. Michigan is a great example. We expected about 80-20 swing. Democrats voting early to 20 percent of Republicans but in fact it's closer to 50-50 right now. That tells you that the enthusiasm the excitement of course is for this president and Donald Trump and we've seen that gap widen over the last several weeks because people understand this president has actually delivered on promises he made whereas Joe Biden has a 47-year career of failure."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, it's interesting because you know when you look at Michigan, it's a very tight race once again so we're seeing that the president is spending a lot of time shoring up the places that he won last time. I remember a moment several months ago when there was $1 billion and the campaign - from the Trump side and the discussion was we're going to win Minnesota, we're going to new Hampshire. We're going to play in New Mexico, all these other states that the president was going to be spending time in to try to pick up those states. We see some defense right now."
    },

      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "That's not defense. I mean look if the president keeps all the states he won in 2016, he's going to be re-elected obviously but the fact is this president fundamentally changed the electoral college map for Republicans moving forward. Winning states that Republicans hadn't won in decades. We absolutely think we have a good shot at picking up Minnesota, possibly New Hampshire but we still have to make sure we defend all of the states we won the first time around and the people want to hear from the president. They want to hear what he was able to accomplish on their behalf in the first four years and what he's going to do in the next four years. It matters to people. That's why we have decided to go out and do these rallies again, get in front of the American people, without the filter the mainstream media. Joe Biden is still counting on that basement strategy and trying to buy advertisements in these states and he thinks that is what is going to bring it home for him. Our campaign apparatus, our turnout models, our methods, it's the envy of the political universe. We've been building this out for the last three years and I was looking 130 million voter contacts in this cycle to date. That's incredible. No one's seen anything like it and we expect that's one of the things that's going to help drive home this election for a victory for this president."

Even Dr. Fauci said that and look, I was working closely with Dr. Fauci, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Birx, Dr. Redfield when I was at the White House when this first initially reared its ugly head in this country. And the president listened to Dr. Fauci, no question. In fact it was Dr. Fauci who said the present took all of his advice except for one piece. Dr. Fauci said he would not have shut down those flights from China and from Europe and now we know thanks to the health experts and the medical experts that that one decision saved countless lives."

And Wisconsin is one of those states so they thought they were out of the woods but now they're seeing what we saw here, not in the numbers I should point out that we saw in New York and New Jersey, not even close but the hospitalization rates are increasing around those people as they get ready to vote."

Dr. Fauci isn't the only doctor out there and there's competing you know science on various things. It was Dr. Fauci early on said we shouldn't wear masks at all and then came around and said no, we should wear masks after the science changed. So that's all fair and that's fine but science is meant to be tested and these conversations should be had but regardless, while we see some of these cases increase in the states as you just mentioned, there's still a way to move about our lives in a responsible safe way. We cannot shut things down again. I mean losing millions of jobs, spending trillions of dollars to keep people just to float, not to allow them to succeed by the way or thrive but just to survive, that's not a tenable position for this country. We know that we can do things safely. If we wear a mask, if we socially distance, if we use hand sanitizer and all the guidelines that the CDC talks about, we can begin to open up this country and we should. The American people need to be back to work and the livelihoods that have been lost, many aren't going to come back. It's going to take someone who understands the economy, who will rebuild the economy once, who is doing it again, that's Donald Trump. Shutting down the country is not a strategy and that's what Joe Biden wants to do."

It's what they did to the world, it's what they did you know with an unforeseen, unprecedented, global pandemic. They unleashed it on the world but this president's leadership prevented the spread to the numbers of 2.5 million people dying. It's his leadership that protected us against that."

Now what do you know? It looks like the president secured a lot of peace deals in the Middle East, securing the region, making the world a safer place. Information now comes out showing Joe Biden knew about the deals hunter Biden was making with Ukraine, a corrupt country and communist China, also corrupt.

When you're the Commander-in-Chief and you have to deal with these nations in real time like North Korea for example, like Japan, like Russia, like China, you have to understand the global - the global implications and in the global set up if you will and Joe Biden just simply doesn't do that.

We already have known for a long time that Hunter Biden has been selling access based on his father's public office for years just like Joe Biden's brother and his sister have done too. What I've heard as I've campaigned across the country for the last week or so for Senate candidates in places like Michigan and Georgia and New Hampshire is that they were a little bit more about their families than about Joe Biden's family. They know about Joe Biden's family but they are very worried about their families, about their family's ability to say voice an opinion on social media without being censored. That's why it's past time that we revoke the immunity for these big tech giants. They worry about their family's ability to make ends meet if Joe Biden and the Democrats raise taxes on them or if they packed the Supreme court as they seem to want to do to worship their God in a way they choose or to own a gun or to speak their mind. Those are the kind of concerns I've heard from families across the country, campaigning over the last of couple of weeks and although they're aware of what Joe Biden family's been up to, they're really focused on their families and what the Democratic agenda means for them."

So there's a question of how it gets into the public sphere and then there's a question of whether or not the underlying documents and you know 10 percent goes to the big guy is a real document and if it is, it obviously raises questions but one of the things that it raises most in my mind is the FBI had this for a year and we just saw the documents that the FBI was sending back and forth to the guy who they acquired a laptop from.

And that's Hunter Biden and the Biden campaign still not coming out and saying these emails are fake, I did not send them, I did not receive them. If they really were Russian disinformation as Adam Schiff and the other Democrats are running around screaming without any evidence, you would think that the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden be saying that. The fact that they're not really is the dog didn't bark in this controversy and most Americans can use their common sense to say what that means."

I mean when you compare that to you know 10 percent or whatever the 10 refers to for the big guy and a deal that they are working to close, whether it be offices that would be provided, you know where it came from and if somebody dropped it for a reason nefariously 15 days before an election is significant but whether or not the emails are real is probably the most important part underlying it.

And that -- if that's not only problematic, but they also said that if the postmark was illegible or there was no postmark, then the ballot would be presumed to have been mailed in time unless, quote, \"the preponderance of evidence suggests otherwise,\" which is an open invitation in close election to litigate every one of those ballots that may have a missing postmark or an illegible postmark, so we have hanging chads in 2000, we may have smeared postmark's in 2016."

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I saw this in the National Review, the interview with Rich Lowry, and what struck me was he simply doesn't believe the overwhelming majority of polls. He thinks that a lot of conservative voters -- but specifically Trump voters -- are not honest with pollsters, that they feel it's not socially acceptable to say that they are planning to vote for Donald Trump. And I think that you have to assume therefore that every other pollster hasn't thought about this, hasn't tried to guard against it, hasn't worked at it, but it's a persistent thought among Trump voters that, gee, we are down in the polls, maybe people aren't playing ball with all these pollsters and some of them coming from what they perceive to be antagonistic political positions."

So, look, I do think that there is -- in Britain they call it the shy tory. I do think there is a shy Trump order. We saw in in 2000. Take a look at all of those polls the last week that conducted and they show that Hillary Clinton was going to win the nationwide popular vote by almost 3.5 percent and she won by just over 2 percent. So, they were off by a third on her margin and they could conceivably be off this time around.

Instead, what you see is an increasing focus on the president's behavior, the divisive nature of his rhetoric, and we've seen that even over this weekend when you think he might be talking about the economy to drive home a message in the last two weeks he's been off attacking Dr. Fauci, the New York Times, I could go on, but the idea is that if it was simply about the economy, you might have a different result in these polls."

      "utterance": "The murders of Officers Piagentini and Jones were among the most despicable ever. Bottom is getting out I guess within the week. Bell got out two years ago. I was talking to a commissioner who was on the parole board several years ago when they were denied parole and she voted against him getting parole because to this day they show no remorse. They said they were freedom fighters and they have the right and the obligation to kill New York City police officers."

      "utterance": "That was Congressman Peter King with us a couple of weeks ago expressing outrage ahead of the release of convicted police killer Anthony Bottom, who is now out on parole. Back in 1971, Bottom and his accomplice, Herman Bell, members of the Black Liberation Army lured Officers Joseph Piagentini and Waverley Jones into a public housing project in Harlem with if only 911 call and then they turned on them and murdered them in cold blood. Bell was paroled two years ago and now Bottom is also free as of October the 7th. Here now with reaction is Diane Piagentini, the wife of Officer Joseph Piagentini. Thank you so much. It is good to have you with us, Mrs. Piagentini and we are so sorry for your loss all those years ago and I'm sure it burns just as much as it did then. So, this is one of the most heinous crimes in police killing in New York City, can you just -- he used your husband's own gun to shoot him, is that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIAGENTINI",
      "utterance": "Yes, he did. He removed his revolver from the holster, my husband's revolver was in his holster. He was trying to reach for it to defend himself. Was also begging for his life asking them not to kill him, that he had a wife and children to come home to."

I called the corrections department and it was on a Monday and I said I haven't heard anything and it was at that point that they called us back in the afternoon and told me that he was going to be paroled. I -- there needs to be a reform with the parole board as to what is happening now. These two cop killers, they are three-time cop killers heinously killed my husband and Waverley Jones. And they should never, ever have been let out of prison."

You have 17 murderers of police officers that have been released since 2017 to now, 2020. This should never happen if you take the life of a police officer. You should never be allowed to get out of prison."

That's from Jose Saldana. What do you say to that, Mrs. Piagentini?"

He is not remorseful for what he has done and he is not remorseful for belonging to the Black Liberation Army. Their mission was to kill police officers. That has not changed in his thinking."

But that is -- and why did they have those -- and did they have it -- did they have that laptop for a long time and not do anything with it? And that's the question the Washington Times is going to have to look into. But certainly, the FBI should be investigating it."
    },

Joining me now, former House oversight committee chairman Trey Gowdy, now a Fox News contributor and author of the new book \"Doesn't Hurt to Ask.\" So, I'm going to ask him some questions right now. Hi, Trey. Good to have you with us."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, what is the situation with the FBI? I mean, if it's true that they had this for a year, a, do we know if they had it for a year, and b, did they corroborate whether or not any of this information is authentic on here? I mean, this seem like pretty basic questions that would've come up during the whole impeachment cycle for example."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "I think you've put your finger on the most important word, Martha, which is authentic. If the underlying information is authentic, it's definitely relevant. It could be relevant from a criminal standpoint. You have Lobbying Registration Act, you have tax implications. Their job is to investigate counterintelligence and criminality. It's most definitely relevant from a political standpoint in 2016 notwithstanding, the FBI is not supposed to investigate political crimes. That's what the media is supposed to do. So, I would encourage Republicans to redirect -- I mean, Bill Barr and Chris Wray, if there's criminality, that is their job. They're not supposed to confirm an investigation is ongoing, they're not allowed to do so and they should not do so. The media has a different oversight role and it doesn't have to be a crime to be relevant for the media to cover it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But if it was being covered correctly, you would think that if they had looked into it, we could learn the answer, yes or no, are these e- mails authentic? If they had that laptop and they looked at the metadata on it, they would know if the caller on one side of the e-mail and all of these things that go over those kinds of lines is who it appears to be in this and they could put some of that to rest or they could say hey, back down, this isn't what it looks like, it's all junk, it's all garbage and they're not saying that. And then on the other side of the equation, the Bidens are not denying that these are their e-mails either, so it makes it pretty tough to, you know, sort of push it off the plate and say it's all garbage."
    },
    {

      "utterance": "Yes."

    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "I mean, is he the big guy? John Ratcliffe, who I am biased towards, but nonetheless he is in a unique situation to access information. He's concluded it is not Russian disinformation, contrary to what Adam Schiff has said. So, if it's not Russian disinformation and its authentic, then there are two different avenues that make this relevant. There's the criminal and there's the political -- the reality is I don't think there's enough time between now and the election, if it is criminal, I don't think you're going to see an indictment between now and then."

New debate rule according to this A.P. reporting is that each side will get two minutes uninterrupted to answer the questions and if the other side tries to pipe up during that time, there will be a mute on their microphone. So, we'll see how that's going to work out. More details as we get them. In the meantime, Twitter is sending a clear message to White House adviser Dr. Scott Atlas that his opinions on mask wearing are not welcome on their platform.

No. Saying that widespread use of masks is simply not supported by science. Now the tweet according to Twitter violated the policy that prohibits sharing, quote, \"false and misleading information about COVID-19 that could lead to harm\" according to a company spokesperson that policy claims to ban statements that have been, quote, \"confirmed to be false or misleading by experts such as public health authorities.\" Dr. Atlas saying in an e-mail I don't understand why the tweets were deleted. Calling Twitter's action censorship. He also said his tweet was intended to show that general population mask and mask mandates do not work. Now you recalled his conversation with Atlas previously in which he cited the World Health Organization's own recommendation on the subject."
