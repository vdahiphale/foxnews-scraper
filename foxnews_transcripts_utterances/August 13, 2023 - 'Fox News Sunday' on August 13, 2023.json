Back here in Washington a criminal trial now appears likely for Hunter Biden after a plea deal involving tax and gun-related charges has fallen apart. This week, a special counsel, a familiar face many conservatives do not trust was tapped to lead the ongoing investigation. It's an unprecedented time in American politics ahead of 2024 with three active special counsels whose investigation all have ties to the leading candidates from both parties. Jack Smith heading both of Donald Trump's cases into his handling of classified documents and his alleged efforts to overturn 2020 election results. Then, there is Robert Herr investigating President Biden's classified documents case. And now, the appointment of David Weiss overseeing the charges facing the son of a sitting president.

Merrick Garland still pulls the strings, but he has a little more power. All that said, I think it's important to understand that just because the special counsel has more power doesn't necessarily mean he's going to exercise that power. It wouldn't surprise me if this is just a way for the Biden administration to cool the flames a little bit on the spotlight that's been put on Hunter Biden.

There's aspects of the current order that I find troubling. You know, they say that he can't take any notes, that his lawyers have to watch him at all times when he looks at evidence. This is evidence that's supposedly eventually is going to end up in a trial. And I'm more concerned with the definition of sensitive material, that as the judge said, I'm going to go with a definition of sensitive material. It's a very ambiguous term. So it does -- right now, this does not look good in terms of the chances of a confrontation and the potential of a gag order.

These drone images out of west Maui show the intense flames as they quickly spread across the island. And this is just some of the utter destruction left behind devastating damage in multiple areas and homes and communities reduced to just ashes. Residents now wondering where to turn. Take a look at this before and after satellite imagery of the historic town of Lahaina. It was nearly burned to the ground. A spot beloved by locals and tourists alike, decimated.

Back here in Washington a criminal trial now appears likely for Hunter Biden after a plea deal involving tax and gun-related charges has fallen apart. This week, a special counsel, a familiar face many conservatives do not trust was tapped to lead the ongoing investigation. It's an unprecedented time in American politics ahead of 2024 with three active special counsels whose investigation all have ties to the leading candidates from both parties. Jack Smith heading both of Donald Trump's cases into his handling of classified documents and his alleged efforts to overturn 2020 election results. Then, there is Robert Herr investigating President Biden's classified documents case. And now, the appointment of David Weiss overseeing the charges facing the son of a sitting president. We're going to break all of this down in just a minute with our legal panel. But, first, Lucas Tomlinson joins us live from the White House with the status of all these ongoing investigations. Hello, Lucas."

      "utterance": "Lucas Tomlinson, reporting live at the White House, thank you, Lucas. Now to our legal panel. George Washington University law professor Jonathon Turley, and Thomas Dupree, former principal deputy assistant attorney general. Welcome back to both of you. This is becoming a regular thing. I -- there's plenty of legal wrangling going on in D.C. and beyond, so let's talk about this. Abbie Lowell, who is -- one of Hunter Biden's attorneys, spoke about this appointment of David Weiss and whether it confers any new powers. Here's what he said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Once again, people need to understand that the attorney general and he -- that he, Mr. Weiss -- has said for a longtime, that he had all the authority he needed to bring any charge that was appropriate in any place. So what does the special counsel do that he couldn't do? The answer should be nothing different."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. So that begs a lot of questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here's what House Judiciary Committee chair, Republican Jim Jordan, tweeted",
      "utterance": "First, David Weiss said he didn't have the power he needed and wanted special counsel status. Then, he said he had all the power he needs. And now, he gets special counsel status because he didn't really have the power he needs? Something's not right. Tom, what do you make of the timing in this selection?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THOMAS DUPREE, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Well, sure. First, I would say the special counsel does have greater power now than he did a week ago before he got this appointment. He has the power to bring charges in new different jurisdictions. And he also has a little bit more of insulation from the political fray. He's not 100 percent independent. Merrick Garland still pulls the strings, but he has a little more power. All that said, I think it's important to understand that just because the special counsel has more power doesn't necessarily mean he's going to exercise that power. It wouldn't surprise me if this is just a way for the Biden administration to cool the flames a little bit on the spotlight that's been put on Hunter Biden. It does allow the special counsel to bring Hunter Biden to trial by bringing charges in new jurisdictions. But I think the jury is still out, literally, on whether the special counsel is actually going to bring more serious charges against Hunter Biden or potentially name additional defendants as a result of this probe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, and our justice producer Jake Gibson (ph) asked specifically to the DOJ, is it possible that those other people may include investigating the current sitting president? He said that they declined to comment on that. Here's what the IRS whistleblower Gary Shapley said about whether the president should be worried."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARY SHAPLEY, IRS WHISTLEBLOWER",

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Jonathon, what do you think are the odds the Justice Department would actually be investigating the head of the executive branch, the sitting president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, the question is why wouldn't you answer that question? I mean, you just gave great detail as to the scope of the investigation of Hunter Biden and you won't tell the public whether the president is subject to the mandate? There's no reason for that. I mean, this is a point of clarity, because otherwise, you're telling the rank-and-file, we aren't necessarily going to investigate the president. There's still that a sense of reluctance. And, you know, God help us when we have another special counsel. I mean, you're talking to the only two D.C. lawyers who are not currently serving as special counsels, right, yes."
    },

      "speaker": "BREAM",

      "utterance": "We're busy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. We're busy. So, the question is, you know, why wouldn't you expand the mandate? Why would you select this individual? I mean, the fact is, he violated the statute by going outside the Department of Justice. That's happened before. But then he selected the person who was just accused by members of his own investigation team of a fixed investigation. And going back to Abbe Lowell, it's like solving the Mutiny on the Bounty by making Captain Bligh admiral. It doesn't resolve the underlying concerns about your leadership. And I think that this is going to make it worse and it's likely the fuel calls on the Hill to move forward with an impeachment inquiry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And there are questions about that. We're going to talk about that with the panel a little bit later. Does it throw fuel on that fire? As Senator Graham said, you're are actually making things worse. What about the congressional investigations? Because let me read something from the \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board. They said that the special status is politically convenient for Weiss and Garland, because it means both men can use the excuse of an ongoing investigation to refuse to answer questions from Congress. Justices is also likely to wall off FBI agents and others who worked on the cases and forget members of the Biden family. Congress' probe may have hit a dead end. Tom, this comes at the same time that Comer, chairing the Oversight Committee, says we are going to subpoena members of the Biden family."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And, look, before all of this happened, Weiss was going to go to Congress and testify. And Attorney General Garland had given him authorization to go do that and to talk about it. I have absolutely no doubt that now the administration is doing a 180 on this. I strongly suspect Weiss is going to say, wait a minute. This is an ongoing investigation, the world has changed, I can no longer come and testify. I'll take a rain check and I'll see in a year. That said, I think it's --"

      "utterance": "For three (ph)?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "At least. I think it's critical for Congress to keep its foot on the accelerator here. They have done a masterful job right now in getting information, getting documents, testimony, the whistleblower testimony and bringing this attention -- this information to the attention of the American people. I don't think they need to let up at this point. To the contrary, I think they need to keep pushing forward as the special counsel's investigation whatever form and shape it takes unfolds."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So we have this protective order now and the D.C.-based case from the feds that essentially accuses the president of, you know, all kinds of things related to the 2020 election, January 6th. So, they went to court deciding what information that the former president would be able to release and talk about publicly. Judge Chutkan in that case in the Friday hearing said this, the fact that he is running a political campaign currently has to yield to the administration of justice. And if that means he can't say what he wants to say in a political speech, that is just how it's going to have to be. The president -- former president and his legal team have talked about his First Amendment rights. You know he likes to talk about this, the prosecutors, the judge, everybody else involved. I mean, how much does he risk here in potentially violating that order or getting himself a gag order?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge Chutkan gave the ultimate straight line without breaking a smile and saying, the court expects you to show restraint on social media. And that's -- that's not likely to happen. And so, Donald Trump could trip the wire, and he could try -- he could force an issue of a gag order. That would go very quickly to the Supreme Court. There's aspects of the current order that I find troubling. You know, they say that he can't take any notes, that his lawyers have to watch him at all times when he looks at evidence. This is evidence that's supposedly eventually is going to end up in a trial. And I'm more concerned with the definition of sensitive material, that as the judge said, I'm going to go with a definition of sensitive material. It's a very ambiguous term. So it does -- right now, this does not look good in terms of the chances of a confrontation and the potential of a gag order. I hope she doesn't go in that direction, because I think it would be reversed. He is running for the presidency of United States, part of this campaign will be the merits of this case. And about 80 million jurors are going to vote on those merits."

You remember this, people trying to evacuate the country in a chaotic and deadly exit. Now, despite assurances it wouldn't happen, the Taliban did quickly regain power in a matter of about 10 days. Since the exit from America's longest war House Republicans have demanded answers about the administration's handling of that situation. Now, with control of the House, the GOP has ramped up investigations into the White House response in the final days leading up to the U.S. departure. This week, lawmakers heard emotional testimony for the first time directly from family members of some of the 13 service members killed in a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport. In a moment we will bring in Michael McCaul, Chair of House Foreign Affairs Committee and Adam Smith, the top Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee. But joining us first in studio, Fox News Congressional Correspondent Aishah Hasnie with more those emotional testimonies from the Gold Star families."

We had the testimony of Tyler Vargas-Andrews, who said, \"I had the suicide bomber in my sights, but I was not given permission to engage him.\" And after that, the bomb went off killing 170 people, 13 servicemen and women. And Shannon, this is sort of news breaking. We just have reported today a member of my staff Jerry Dunleavy with his book, \"Kabul\", that U.S. intelligence had ISIS-K in their sights, knowing they were plotting to take out Abbey Gate on the very same day that it was taken down when the suicide bomber went off. They asked the Taliban to go in, our U.S. military, the Taliban denied. U.S. intelligence requested an airstrike. Guess what, that airstrike was denied, was denied to go in and take out the very forces that then killed our 13 servicemen and women. This story gets worse by the day.

We've been denied access to these witnesses. And we're prepared to go forward with subpoenas to get to the bottom, because these Gold Star families that you just showed deserve the truth as to what happened to make sure this never happens again. But this was not a clean operation, this was not a successful evacuation by any stretch of the imagination. And the Taliban was put in charge. And in my judgment, that was the worst mistake of all, was to put them in charge and not our U.S. military to evacuate U.S. citizens and our partners that fought so bravely with us."

There's a new report out from the Special Inspector General overseeing Afghanistan reconstruction, Washington Free Beacon has this headline from the report. They say, the Biden administration has given $2.35 billion to Taliban controlled Afghanistan. So what do you tell American taxpayers about their dollars flowing to that group, as you said, that was critical in what happened at Abbey Gate, and now is clearly, you know, disrespectful is the nicest way that I can say it, to women, to girls, to religious minorities -- those are U.S. tax dollars."

Women can even be hired by these NGO, these charitable organizations in Afghanistan, and we're paying the money. The U.S. taxpayers funding this, we need some assurance that this is going to go to the right hands, and it's going to help the women in Afghanistan, and if the Taliban cannot assure us that, I think we need to be prepared to cut that funding off as a stick, rather than giving them just a carrot."

I -- look, these are like accounts in South Korea frozen assets going to Switzerland and to Doha, Qatar, to then go into Iran, the idea that the Ayatollah is not going to have any control over this money -- and by the way, we're talking about $6 billion, right? $6 billion under Obama, it was $400 million of cash and airplanes that went into Iran. Look, I want to get these Americans home more than anybody. And one of them is a critical asset. I agree with that. But we have to go in eyes wide open. $6 billion that now is going to go into Iran and prop up their proxy war, terror operations, and their nuclear bomb aspirations. They are now starting to talk about the JCPOA all over again, which in my judgment, will lead us down a course to a legal nuclear bomb in Iran. Prime Minister Netanyahu came out strongly against this. I think we're going back to the mistakes of the past. And finally, Shannon, get this, our special envoy to Iran to negotiate the JCPOA is under investigation for mishandling classified information. He has the most sensitive information as our top negotiator to Iran, and to the Ayatollah, now under investigation for mishandling classified information, very troubling story."

So I want to start with the Iran Deal there again, as you heard the Chairman just talking about, we've been told that there will be guardrails on this money $6 billion that would flow through the Qataris. And so here's what Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, Friday, a warning us that they still have controlled these people, they're still in custody and adding this, \"The decision on how to utilize these unfrozen resources and financial assets lies with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\" Telegraphing that they plan to do what they plan to do with the money. Money is obviously fungible. A lot of this re-invokes for people, which you've heard the Chairman referenced there, the $400 million in cash that was then followed up by $1.7 billion -- or excuse me, $1.3 additional billion in cash that went in a prisoner swap back in 2015 under President Obama. Some of the people were now trying to get out. They were kidnapped or wrongfully in prison since we paid that money. I mean, are you -- do you believe the Iranians can actually change their behavior?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "There's a fundamental misunderstanding about what's going on here. The money that's going from Korea to Iran is money from oil that Iran sold to Korea and Korea did not pay for that -- South Korea, sorry, because the sanctions that were imposed on the Trump administration. And there were about a half dozen countries in that situation. Italy, India, a few others, all of those other countries under the Trump administration have already given Iran that money with no strings attached under a special payment system that was set up under the Trump administration. South Korea didn't pay that money for complicated reasons. And they're valid, they want to transfer it. So money of this kind has already been transferred. This is money to pay for oil that was given to South Korea. This isn't some sort of frozen assets situation. So this type of money has already been transferred. Second, the deal has not been finalized. Qatar will control the money. So whatever the Mullah in Iran has to say about it, it will be controlled by Qatar, not by Iran. So that aspect of it makes sense. We're still waiting to see what the prisoner swap looks like and to finalize the deal. But there's a lot more detail here that I think isn't being understood."

The U.N. says that the Taliban, \"shows no signs of bending to pressure for reform or compromise. They are unchecked by any meaningful political opposition.\" So I'll ask you the same question I asked the Chairman, what do you say to American taxpayers about us giving billions of dollars to that organization?"

I know there were a lot of again, frozen assets that we had in control that were actually Afghan money. I'm not sure about the actual U.S. taxpayer money going in. I'm extraordinarily reluctant to send that money. There is one caveat to that. Afghan is -- Afghanistan is also going to humanitarian disaster right now. People are starving to death. They can't get access to health care. We're getting a lot of pressure internationally. What can the international community to do to stop that humanitarian disaster? And I suppose one answer is, you got the government, you got you got the Taliban leading you. This is where you're at. We can't help. But it is such a huge humanitarian disaster that I'd say it's worth at least looking at options, even though I don't think there are any particularly good options in this situation."

There's new polling showing up at a majority of Americans think we've done enough. They don't want to see any more appropriations of money going to Ukraine. This particular appropriations request, the supplemental is tied up also, excuse me, with domestic emergency relief funding and also some funding for the border. Senator Marco Rubio said this, \"President Biden is holding Americans hostage by tying critical domestic disaster relief to foreign military aid. He calls it cynical, political manipulation.

The polling data I've seen, by the way is that well over 60% of people still think we should be doing what we should do, everything we can to help the Ukrainian people. Look, Russia has engaged in a brutal invasion of Ukraine, you can see the pictures of how they're destroying cities, killing civilians. I think defending Ukraine is something that is in our interest and overwhelming majority of American people seem to agree with that. As far as the other pieces are concerned, every supplemental that I've ever dealt with in my 27 years in Congress has been tied with one thing to another. But this is an opening negotiation. We'll see. I think there are critical needs. We'll see what the final package looks like. But I want to make it clear. I still support Ukraine. I think there's a bipartisan people. I wish you to ask Congressman McCaul this question, because I'm certain he would agree with me that this is something that we should be supporting.

There was a New York Times/Siena College poll that came out a few weeks ago and nationally, it shows Trump with a lead in the 50s. However, when it comes to Iowa, his lead is in the 40s and DeSantis' lead is a few points up. So they feel confident, and Trump is very much trying to sort of nudge DeSantis or maybe jab at DeSantis in a way by bringing that Florida -- those members of the Florida congressional delegation, it was very notable this week that Steve Deace endorsed Ron DeSantis. He's a conservative commentator and radio host in Iowa, his team very much making a big deal about that. But the question is, what happens after Iowa for Ron DeSantis?

We have more pressure on the Biden family to answer for all of Hunter's activities. And all the Vice President Biden's activities when he worked for President Obama. For me this brings it more into the mainstream and allows more pressure to go on to the Biden family.

Any contenders that seem to be gathering much steam. With that being said, I think you have to decouple the two. I think if you talk to the folks in the Biden White House they'll tell you we're running a campaign and they'll also tell you that while the president loves his son, his son is a private citizen and his son should be able to do what he son wants to do. And his son is not above the law. I think the - the good news here in this special counsel announcement, that you haven't heard a lot of people talk about, is this. Once the special counsel is over, they will issue a report. It's very likely that Merick Garland will make that report public to the American people. And if the - if the facts in the report are demonstrably different than the facts that we see on Capitol Hill, that we heard Senate -- House and Senate Republicans talk about, this creates a big problem for them because for the past -- since 2018 they've been saying that there is bribery here, there's wrongdoing here. And if that doesn't work out after a five-year Justice Department investigation by a Trump-appointed justice - by a Trump- appointed attorney, that speaks to big problems for them."

      "utterance": "Well, I have real doubts that the special counsel would be done with this report before the election. But stranger things have happened and do every day right now in Washington. In the meantime, we're watching Georgia to see whether President Trump will potentially face another indictment there. \"The New York Times\" reporting this, if Mr. Trump were to be convicted in a federal prosecution, he could theoretically pardon himself if he were elected re-elected president. But presidents do not hold such weight in state matters. Moreover, Georgia law makes pardons possible only five years after the completion of a sentence. Getting a sentence committed requires the approval of a state panel. So, Katie, a lot of people think these state issues are more fraught for former President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, it also becomes politically a resource management problem for the president. So, politically, it's helped President Donald Trump in a primary, but he has had to spend tens of millions of campaign dollars in fighting these indictments, federally and at the state level. At the state level it is a problem for him if he can't pardon himself, if he were to be convicted. Now, we're far off from that. You know, when a grand jury returns an indictment it's 12 out of 28 people doing it. It's not beyond a reasonable doubt."

      "utterance": "The district attorney in Georgia is very confident that she has the work done, that she will get two indictments that she thinks that she can then go and prove. But it's to be seen. You know, we had a lot of these things come out against President Trump in the past, federally and at the state level, and they have fallen apart."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, from a grand jury to a real jury where you'll have opposing arguments, you will have different evidence. There will be an opposition there. And innocent unless proven otherwise in this country. Meanwhile, Senator Joe Manchin is making news again because he was asked on a radio show this week whether he would consider leaving the party and becoming independent. Here's what he said."

    {
      "speaker": "SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV)",
      "utterance": "I would think very seriously about that. I've been thinking about that for quite some time. I haven't made any decisions whatsoever on any of my political directions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Richard, I've heard a lot of angst from Democrats who do not want to see this man turn independent or see him mount a third party change - or challenge under No Labels."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Look, I don't think there's going to be a third party challenge. But I will say, I do think, if you look at the map, this electoral map, which is where this matters, Joe Manchin has a really tough re-election coming up. And so this ideal of him posturing in this moment speaks to the fact that West Virginia is a red state. And I have to win in my state. So, he's going to posture. He's going to say, I don't like the president. He's going to say the president's terrible. That will hopefully garner him enough votes to possibly win re-election. I don't see him mounting a third party campaign and No Labels have said very clearly that they don't want to be a spoiler in this election."

And - and not just my family members, but other people, part of that community who actually cared enough to lay down their lives so that I could learn, so that they could pour into me.
