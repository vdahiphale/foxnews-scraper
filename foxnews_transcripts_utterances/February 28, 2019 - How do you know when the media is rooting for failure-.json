And I don't know about you but I feel safer than I did a year ago because of talking. Remember Hawaii? If you still believe that we conceded a lot with just a meeting, then you are a relic, preferring to settle things through the currency of corpses, meaning war, old people throwing bodies at each other.

It's long-term effort with short-term pain. The long-term benefit will bring peace. The short-term pain is the media who screws the world over by making any deal look like a concession.

You have to be prepared to walk. You know, there was a potential we could've signed something today. I could've 100 percent signed something today. We actually have papers ready to be signed but it just wasn't appropriate. I want to do it right. I much rather do it right than do it fast. They wanted to denuke certain areas and I wanted everything. The sanctions are there. I didn't want to give up the sanctions unless we had a real program. They are not ready for that and I understand that fully. I really do. I mean, they spent a lot of time building it and that doesn't mean the world has to be happy. But I want them to denuke."

The fact is walking away is part of the process which is slow and odd. Sometimes it's better to appear going backwards or making nice even when it looks really bad. But the lines of communication exist even when they are crossed. So by walking away a part of negotiating, we actually move ahead. Trump went there, told the guy, hey, the sanctions stay. That's the first and that's progress. And it could be that North Korea is unsolvable. But if there's a solution, it involves talking. And I don't know about you but I feel safer than I did a year ago because of talking. Remember Hawaii? If you still believe that we conceded a lot with just a meeting, then you are a relic, preferring to settle things through the currency of corpses, meaning war, old people throwing bodies at each other. For you, blood is an endless commodity. But for the more peaceful types, we will see what happens. It was a daring alternative to the status quo which is having bureaucrats in Hawaiian shirts telling your family to seek shelter. So this is going to take a while. It's long-term effort with short-term pain. The long-term benefit will bring peace. The short-term pain is the media who screws the world over by making any deal look like a concession. In short, Trump has a long game which is better than the media which has no game at all. Jesse, the media is gloating even though they make the world less safe."

They wanted to destroy their main nuclear plant in exchange for dropping all sanctions. That's crazy. It's an obvious phrase. No deal is better than a bad deal. It's very easy to do a deal. And I think the media likes the idea of a deal and they don't care what's in it. It was easy to make the Iran deal. Just give them a bunch of cash and let them keep all their missiles.

That would be a great story and I think there are a lot of people who would be snapping up bargains. But I don't think Kim Jong-un would be the leader in such a climate. He knows this, that if he gives up his nukes, he gives up his power. He really has nothing else to offer his country because once they realize that that free-market barn door can swing open, those horses are going to leave in search of economic mobility and opportunity.

Instead, Trump says, I don't believe our intelligence agencies. I don't believe Dan Coats. I don't believe Gina Haspel. They are wrong. I believe Kim Jong-un. That destabilizes us and then we give him a platform. Dana was picking up on this. We have elevated Kim Jong-un in this process. Jesse says, hey, well, maybe it's about China and the tariff deal in China is putting pressure on them. But again, who put themselves in that position?
