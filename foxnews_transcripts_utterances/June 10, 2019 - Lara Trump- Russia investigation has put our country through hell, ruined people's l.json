The president wins, Mexico agreed to stay on the flow of migration with tough new border policies and 6,000 National Guard troops. And President Trump, yeah, he had Mexico buckled to their knees, and without the help of any Republicans and the mainstream media. Oh, what happens? We're going to have a trade war. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK, the president won, the president stood strong, and we are better off for it.

In a letter obtained by Fox News, the Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd explains that John Durham's investigation into the origins of this Russia witch hunt is, quote, broad in scope go up and will cover, quote, activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services, as well as nongovernmental investigations and individuals. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is significant confirmation that our mission to investigate the investigators is not and has never been in vain. Facts, truth, justice, as we have been telling you, about to cascade down on all of these deep state bad actors, those that abuse power. We will have a lot more in the course of the hour and more in a moment. But while we focus on holding the government accountable on Capitol Hill -- well, you got Jerry Nadler circus and clown show is in full gear. And today, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, literally, jumped the shark. Instead of passing laws or performing responsible oversight, Nadler instead, well, he invited the felon, the known perjurer, liar, John Dean to testify. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's right, the John Dean, the convicted-felon-turned-partisan-hack- turned-fake-news-CNN-conspiracy-theorist, he was a big star witness today. But you might remember, John Dean was once the White House counsel under Richard Nixon where he was known as the master manipulator of the Watergate cover-up. He was accused of lying a whopping 19 times to federal prosecutors. I think that he forgot that there were tapes, and, of course, obstructing justice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } John Dean is a convicted felon.

And because of his seedy track record and penchant for lying, well, he fits right in there. So, naturally, of course, Jerry Nadler was more than happy to give this known liar, convicted felon another platform. Let's take a look at the circus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Didn't exert it once. The president encouraged every person in the White House, in his administration to participate fully, and they did. They handed over 1.5 million documents to the special counsel and the White House attorney, even Don McGahn was interviewed by Mueller for 30 hours which to me is insanity.  The president answered Mueller's questions himself. Now, it's all over. There was no collusion, and the president will not allow Democrats to literally drag Americans through this process yet again for what would be a fifth investigation. And that's why the president is now rightly saying enough is enough. Exerting executive privilege. House Democrats, they are not going to have the ability to relitigate the Russia probe for a fifth time. It's now abuse of power, and outright harassment of a duly elected president, more importantly, all the people that work for the president trying to serve their country should not again have to shell out tens and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees answering the same questions over and over and over again, and literally sit for a perjury trap. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Witnesses and documents, forget it.

And by the way, President Trump is not the first president to invoke executive privilege, although he did not do it with Mueller. Former President Clinton did it a whopping 14 times. And meanwhile, Obama successfully utilized executive privilege blocking the request of document surrounding -- remember Fast and Furious, the gunrunning scandal? Well, an American died as a result of that stupid policy, and, of course, the horrific Fast and Furious program. Obama also tried to withhold document surrounding the failed Solyndra project, and even Benghazi in the attack there. Ultimately, he tried, but he turned them over.

That's right, the John Dean, the convicted-felon-turned-partisan-hack- turned-fake-news-CNN-conspiracy-theorist, he was a big star witness today. But you might remember, John Dean was once the White House counsel under Richard Nixon where he was known as the master manipulator of the Watergate cover-up. He was accused of lying a whopping 19 times to federal prosecutors. I think that he forgot that there were tapes, and, of course, obstructing justice. John Dean is a convicted felon. He was disbarred many times ago for, quote, being guilty of unethical, unprofessional, and unwarranted conduct.  Oh, disbarred too, perfect guy for fake news CNN -- liar, fake news. Anyway, now, the felon rakes in a lot of cash, trashing Donald Trump daily for the mainstream lying media mob. And because of his seedy track record and penchant for lying, well, he fits right in there. So, naturally, of course, Jerry Nadler was more than happy to give this known liar, convicted felon another platform. Let's take a look at the circus."

The attorney general, deputy attorney general, office of legal counsel presented no indictments and said he had nothing to do with Department of Justice policy or any constitutional issue as -- oh, even Mueller said. Compare that to the independent counsel Ken Starr who will join us in a moment. Following his 1998 investigation into then-President Bill Clinton, well, Ken Starr detailed 11 specific felonies, real crimes for which Clinton could be impeached. Clinton lost his law license and later, in fact, was impeached. But get this -- back then, Jerry Nadler and his fellow Democrats, they pushed hard.

      "utterance": "So, it's Nadler's circus, no shame, nothing but a political hack wasting your money, and what has to be one -- becoming one of the most epic flip-flops in American political history. Only a few weeks ago, Nadler is actually threatening the attorney general of the United States, Attorney General Barr, with attempt by Congress. Well, not for declassifying, just two full and seven partial lines of the Mueller report. Everything was released on obstruction. Well, the section that was redacted was because the law demands it. It had grand jury material. He was asking the attorney general to commit a crime and reveal grand jury material. He literally wanted America's top law enforcement official to break the law or hold him in contempt -- this from a guy who desperately tried to keep the Starr report hidden from you, we, the American people. Without a doubt that is his hypocrisy on steroids and human growth hormone. Congressman Nadler is now reportedly putting his contempt plans on hold.  Gee, I wonder how long this is going to last. But the Trump administration, they are done. They are not going to participate in his political circus which is the right decision. Why? For years, the White House cooperated fully with multiple investigations. We had the FBI 9-month investigation -- no collusion. House Intel Committee investigation, no collusion. Bipartisan probe in the Senate, no collusion. Mueller's 22-month witch hunt, no collusion, no obstruction. And during the year's long process, not one time, not a single moment did the Trump White House ever exert executive privilege. Didn't exert it once. The president encouraged every person in the White House, in his administration to participate fully, and they did. They handed over 1.5 million documents to the special counsel and the White House attorney, even Don McGahn was interviewed by Mueller for 30 hours which to me is insanity.  The president answered Mueller's questions himself. Now, it's all over. There was no collusion, and the president will not allow Democrats to literally drag Americans through this process yet again for what would be a fifth investigation. And that's why the president is now rightly saying enough is enough. Exerting executive privilege. House Democrats, they are not going to have the ability to relitigate the Russia probe for a fifth time. It's now abuse of power, and outright harassment of a duly elected president, more importantly, all the people that work for the president trying to serve their country should not again have to shell out tens and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees answering the same questions over and over and over again, and literally sit for a perjury trap. Witnesses and documents, forget it. It's done. That will not be made available. This is the right decision from the president. The vast powers of our government should never be used two oppressed Americans and harass a sitting president, and cost the American taxpayers what is now a fifth investigation into the same topic. And by the way, President Trump is not the first president to invoke executive privilege, although he did not do it with Mueller. Former President Clinton did it a whopping 14 times. And meanwhile, Obama successfully utilized executive privilege blocking the request of document surrounding -- remember Fast and Furious, the gunrunning scandal? Well, an American died as a result of that stupid policy, and, of course, the horrific Fast and Furious program. Obama also tried to withhold document surrounding the failed Solyndra project, and even Benghazi in the attack there. Ultimately, he tried, but he turned them over. He was forced to. I have some advice for Nadler, Schiff and all the radical, extreme Democrats that are weaponizing and abusing their power in their committees against the president of the United States. The American people are smart.  They're not going to support your impeachment. And by the way, they are sick and tired of your lives, your conspiracy theories and your phony Russia hoax. If you continue down this road, which I highly encourage you to do, well, you'll pay at the ballot box and you'll guarantee a Trump landslide in 2020. Joining us now, former independent counsel, Fox News contributor Ken Starr, and we will get back to the monologue in a moment. Gregg Jarrett, good to see you too. Ken Starr, you are under a different statute, that was the independent counsel statute."

And he got the help of the attorney general, frankly, who I think threw him a lifeline. But putting that aside for a minute, how many more times did they get to investigate the president over one issue? How many more people that work in the White House will have to pay $800 or $1,000 an hour to be asked the same question over and over again? This is now the fifth investigation and the topic. Am I wrong on that?"

And in large part because Mueller decided he wasn't going to do his job on the issue of obstruction. There is nothing about the OLC opinion that would have prevented him from rendering as Judge Starr said, and opinion of offense is committed. The OLC opinion only talks about prosecution and charging, but Mueller wouldn't do it. And also, he managed to write around the circumvents, the two U.S. Supreme Court decisions that say that statutes do not apply to a president exercising their constitutional authority and obstruction is a general statute, unless the statute says so. Look at the obstruction statutes.  They don't say so. And Mueller knew that, but he could not bring himself to say that the law does not support obstruction of justice. So he tried to write this road map for impeachment hoping that the Democrats and the media would pick up the mantle, and of course they have."

This letter from Stephen Boyd to Jerry Nadler, responding to his request for information related to a review underway by the Department of Justice and the certain activities involving the campaign. And it goes on to say the review is broad in scope. It is multifaceted. It is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services, as well as nongovernment organizations and individuals. I take this letter to be a wide-open notice to everybody that all abuse of power, any corruption that has taken place in the course of these events is going to be discovered and every rock is going to be looked under, and they will get to the truth, whether or not people abused power.

So, there is not some outsider, Bob Mueller being brought in, you are now counsel. What Bill Barr has wisely done is that we are using the resources of the Justice Department and he has also made a very clear that he is getting cooperation from the intelligence agencies, by the way, including it appears foreign agencies.

Now, the good news is that we are inching closer and closer to holding those that abuse their power accountable. The I.G. report, the Durham review, tonight's letter, Gang of Eight material, exculpatory materials that were withheld. That is the avalanche of truth that will come cascading down.

Sara, I want to get to you on this letter, but first Carter Page, the use of tracking devices. The intensity just before the first FISA application, and we must remind people, before that first FISA application to spy on you, and hence you were the backdoor into all things Trump campaign, Trump transition, Trump presidency.

And I was really -- you know, when all of these fake news stories started, I was pushing to try to get the -- you know, restart of my life, et cetera.  And he was one of the few people that would talk to me.

That means Hillary Clinton's campaign, the Democratic National Committee, all of the people that were involved, including Stefan Halper, Joseph Mifsud, the Italian government.

LARA TRUMP, SENIOR ADVISOR FOR TRUMP 2020: Listen, well apparently, it was best friends day, but it's interesting that Joe Biden would tweet this because didn't he say he didn't want Barack Obama's endorsement for his Presidential run and then the best friend?"

We have to get to the bottom of how this all started and the players within this crazy mess that set it all up and the people that gave them the go- ahead on so many things that have put our country, quite frankly, through hell for over two years with this investigation, have ruined people's lives. Listen, not everybody can afford to get a great lawyer and defend yourself against something that you didn't do.

Even people that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 didn't think that he would get so much accomplished in two-and-a-half years. They know he's going to be nearly impossible to beat at the campaign. We think he will be impossible to beat in 2020. So, the only hand they have to play is to try and find something somewhere that maybe they missed the first four times to your point and they're not going to find it because Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong.

Meanwhile the L.A. Times is reporting, \"16,000 people in LA now live in cars and vans and RVs\" and all of this as the President takes matters of the immigration and humanitarian crisis in the border into his own hands, inking a deal with Mexico to tackle the issue with no help from Congress for the most part. Joining us now with reaction California Congressman Kevin McCarthy. What is it about Republicans? You know, the President didn't want a trade war, doesn't want tariffs on Mexico, but he rightly is saying, \"Do your job and stop allowing these caravans to come through, or else there is going to be consequences.\" All Republicans needed to do is say we support the President.

We are rampant when it comes to homelessness because the unaffordability throughout California. But now, what is California doing? They're going to tax American citizens that can't afford healthcare or refuse to pay for it, tax them to pay for illegals to have healthcare. It's going to drive more illegals across the border and just last month, there was 144,000 people apprehended. Those are just the individuals we caught. We'll have more than a million people this year illegally crossing this border. That's twice the size of the population of the capital of California, Sacramento. This is what is going wrong.
