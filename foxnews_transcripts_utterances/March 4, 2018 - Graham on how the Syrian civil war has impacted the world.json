We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn. Kim, why does the president keep picking on Jeff Sessions, and is it smart politics?",

They have a jungle primary. Dianne Feinstein is still leading some 30 points in the polls. Everyone in California, obviously, gets to vote. So I mean, does she actually lose? Possibly not. But the bigger question is, where the future direction of this party is in races that are not involving someone that's already run and won statewide, like Dianne Feinstein has, and has such name -- brand identity in the state.

The NRA's top lobbyist pushed back on some of those proposals Thursday night following a meeting with the president and vice president, tweeting, quote, \"We all want safe schools, mental health reform, and to keep guns away from dangerous people. POTUS and V-POTUS support the Second Amendment, support strong due process, and don't want gun control.\" Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and Columnists Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn.

That, after a long time, maybe there is something that has to get done, if only because Republicans need to vote for something. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, that's right. I think the Republicans are under a lot of pressure. And whether he's breaking the gridlock or not, I mean, let's say no one would ever mistake Donald Trump with Lyndon Baines Johnson in terms of being a political animal. I mean, when the president sits there and says, we've got this, we've got that, why don't we just all get this done, you just cannot wave your hand and change the politics of an entire country. And Bill just described some of the political pressures that weigh in against merely transforming the gun control debate. So I think it's possible that, yes, he's broken the gridlock, and I think that the public pressure is breaking a lot of gridlock, but that doesn't mean that the political realities around this issue in Congress won't reform once these bills get into the House and then try to get through the Senate. You're going to find the same problems."

Look, I have some respect for their position in that what they are focused on is in fact what we should be focused on. The question is, how do you keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people? Now the tricky thing is that involves a discussion of mental health. It involves state laws like commitment. It involves due process. That's a place that not a lot of Republicans want to go. And so they have defaulted, led, unfortunately, by the president, back to a meandering discussion on gun control, which, you know, he started out all right talking about fixing the background check system. That is something that needs to be done. But raising age limits and assault weapons ban, if that's what people want to call it, it is not going to go through the House.

As we know, Paul, politicians respond to public pressure. And the pressure that's being brought to bear on the members of Congress right now is enormous.

They have a celebrity P.R. firm. I think it is quite likely that the other side overplays its hand, because a lot of the gun owners -- and I'm not talking about just the NRA. I'm not a gun owner.

All kidding aside, the biggest concern about allowing North Korea more capability is that they share their capability or sell it. So the idea of allowing them to build an ICBM with a nuclear weapon on top to hit America is a nonstarter because they are likely to take that technology and share it or sell it. So that's why I think President Trump is right to deny them the capability to hit the homeland. This is just another example of how they share their technology with bad actors."

Now is the time to tell them to stop. So the president's made a decision, I'm going to deny them the capability to hit the homeland with a nuclear weapon through an ICBM. And the main reason that we want to do that is if you allow them one hydrogen bomb, they will get 50 over time, and they will sell it or give it away, just like you see with this episode in Syria. So I don't think containment works. I think they are likely to sell anything they build. That's a nightmare for the world at large."

The environment along the Syrian/Israeli border, the Golan Heights border, is turning bad for Israel at a pretty rapid pace. But southern Lebanon is a nightmare. It makes Gaza looks stable. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, said there are over 100,000 rockets and missiles in the hands of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. As you recall, Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon years ago. The United Nations was supposed to police the area. The United Nations Interim Force-Lebanon has sat on the sidelines and watched Hezbollah dominate southern Lebanon with missile technology that now threatens every part of Israel. So it's a matter of time until Israel strikes southern Lebanon."

General Votel, who is the CENTCOM commander in charge of Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, said this Tuesday, 'Make no mistake, while we continue to confront the scourge of terrorism, Iran's maligned activities across the region pose the long-term threat to stability in this part of the world.\" And he said the following, \"Countering Iran is not one of the coalition missions in Syria.' So I see no strategy to deal with the Russian/Iranian connection that is dominating Syria. Syrian Democratic Forces are falling. Iran now is in de facto control of Damascus and that will throw the entire region into further chaos."

But I agree with the president in this regard, we need a special counsel to look at the FISA abuses here. They are real. I don't think the I.G. is capable of doing it. He's a good man, an honest man. He institutionally doesn't have the tools of a special counsel. But as far as Jeff Sessions goes, I think he's doing a good job.

And with that, you've got Senators, members of the House, they all go, whatever, it's Donald Trump, he will change his mind. It is conceivable that before the announcement is due next week, he will change his mind. Kind of like a prison warden saying, I will withdraw rations, and then saying a day later, no, it's OK guys.

That, because there are continuing problems with his FBI clearance. You mentioned the large loans. We also have had the revelation that at least four foreign governments, including at least some adversaries of the United States, talked among themselves about how could they use Jared Kushner's family business difficulties as a way to gain influence in the new administration.

Maybe that was good because that made -- the response to the markets on this may cause the administration to back off and say, OK, it is not going to be every country.

      "utterance": "Yes. Blurted it out. Yes. Not only that, but put it on the basis that I think is not defensible, which is the 232. Our steel tariffs were on 201, a part of the law that refers to dumping and illicit trade practices. And 232 is aimed to make this more durable, but I think it is less supportive, particularly, when you are penalizing your neighbors and friends, who, at a moment of international crisis, you want as your suppliers."

    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right. You and I have talked about those back then. I didn't like the tariffs either. But that's a different subject for another time. When we come back, Dianne Feinstein fails to secure her state party's endorsement for her reelection. So could California's senior Senator be the latest casualty in the Democratic civil war?"
    },

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Is Dianne Feinstein the latest victim of a growing civil war on the left? The California senior Senator failed to secure the endorsements of the state's Democratic Party at their convention last weekend, receiving just 37 percent of the ballot compared to 54 percent for her challenger, state Senate leader, Kevin de Leon, who has mocked Feinstein for saying last summer that she believed Trump can be a good president if he had the ability to learn and change. We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Jillian Melchior. Jillian, you looked at the convention in California. Where are the Democrats headed in the age of Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JILLIAN MELCHIOR, EDITORIAL PAGE WRITER",
      "utterance": "I think there's a real division here. Part of the question they are asking is, do we focus on the economic issues. Do we try to steal Trump's thunder by playing up income inequality, going to the blue-collar voter, or do we double down on our focus on identity politics? I think that one it actually the one that carries the more political liability. One of the risks of identity politics is it breaks the party into smaller groups, smaller factions that will inevitably war with each other, but I think that's where we're at."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Exactly. I think that's one of the ones. Also, there's a generational divide here. You saw de Leon saying that it is time to make room for a younger generation. I think that's emblematic, too, of some of the divides in the Democratic Party, the anti-establishment viewpoint."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Kim, the opposition, total resistance to Trump seems to be almost a necessity now as a kind of Democratic litmus test, number one, and in California, single payer really is becoming a litmus test. Gavin Newsom, the candidate for governor, got the most support among the Democrats. He's for single payer. Antonio Villaraigosa, who has only got 9 percent, and I think he's against single payer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, this has become the litmus test in what is an ongoing civil war in the Democratic Party, and it doesn't get as much attention. But it's going to matter because what you see going on out in California and these litmus tests are also going to be applied to the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. And so far, those that seem to have the most momentum are those that fall in this progressive wing. Now, how that actually plays out in California is a little bit more complicated. They have a jungle primary. Dianne Feinstein is still leading some 30 points in the polls. Everyone in California, obviously, gets to vote. So I mean, does she actually lose? Possibly not. But the bigger question is, where the future direction of this party is in races that are not involving someone that's already run and won statewide, like Dianne Feinstein has, and has such name -- brand identity in the state. And that gives her an advantage. But it's the other coming races where it's looks as though the progressive movement is becoming ascendant."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Dan, if Feinstein loses, that's an earthquake. Even if de Leon comes close, that will have a big effect on the mentality of Democrats in Washington, and certainly in the presidential race."

    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right. Though, as we have been discussing here, the division seems to be between what you might call heartland Democrats, middle of the country, which are economic populists, versus the coastland Democrats, coastal Democrats, which I'm going to start calling Google Democrats, I think, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York --"
    },

      "speaker": "HENNINGER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "And if you don't know what intersectionality is, start reading the New York Times Arts and Culture pages. It's in there every single day. But the fact is that in the national election, this is what the heartland or economic populists are afraid of, in the national election they are leaving a lot of blue-collar voters on the table, the coastal Democrats are, and they are begging them to pay attention to them. I think the coastal Democrats will sell them out because the blue-collar workers are basically tied with unions, and that's a declining movement in the United States. So it's going to be very difficult for the Democrats to close this circle."

      "utterance": "Yes, he may. Maria is giving him a run for his money there. But, again, I think we are seeing this play out across the country. There's this progressive challenge. I think it is going to function a lot like the Tea Party. It's going to be a big problem for the Democratic unity."

But also to Republican Governor Jim Justice who caved to their demands for greater pay. The media's all obsessed about how teachers are paid in West Virginia relative to the rest of the country. What they also missed though is how West Virginia performs, and so dismally next to the other states in terms of education scores. So taking a hostage of our students never great and rewarding hostage takers also not good."

Well, the judge's name was Gonzalo Curiel. He gets a hit this week because he backed President Trump's right to waive certain environmental regulations to build his wall. Some federal judges have allowed their bias to go against Donald Trump but that's because they are liberal. And this judge gets credit for showing, you know, what a good and honest judge does."

But in the last week, we have seen Levi Sanders, Bernie Sanders' son, launch a congressional bid in New Hampshire. And then his step-daughter, Carina Driscoll, is running for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, a position that Bernie Sanders had at some point. She's an interesting one, because she has nepotism tied up with the Burlington College scandal."

This one, from Lacoste, the sports clothing manufacturer, which was founded by Rene Lacoste in 1933 with the legendary tennis player known as the crocodile. They put that on their shirt. Now the designers there are putting 10 endangered species on the shirt instead of the crocodile. And, you know, it's going to accomplish nothing whatsoever for those animals other than to let Lacoste express another virtuous and empty culture gesture."
