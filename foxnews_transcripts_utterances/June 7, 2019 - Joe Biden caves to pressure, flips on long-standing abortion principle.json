When you look at again historical unemployment, you see progress on various fronts. I mean, obviously, you can talk about terror, you can talk about trade, you can talk about jobs, you can talk about the economy. All of these deeds as opposed to words. But the Times can't look at that because that destroys their entire narrative. Can I talk about Nervous Nancy? It is a great nickname because you can use it on anybody.

But in terms of working with Nancy Pelosi on big things like infrastructure or immigration, I think Democrats are missing a big opportunity here. Because when President Trump went into the Oval Office, he wasn't a hard partisan. In fact, he was an independent run on Republican ticket. And he donated to Democrats and Republicans for all kinds of causes. He's been open about the fact that he wanted to do infrastructure during the campaign. There are things Democrats could work with President Trump on to regain a lot of the blue-collar workers that people like Joe Biden are trying to regain. And yet, because of this constant feud, that's not happening. I think Democrats are really missing their chance to get a lot of this done or at least talk about why it's important. But one more thing on Nancy Pelosi, look, she made this comment, the President was asked about it, is he not allowed to respond to because he's overseas when the comment was made. Well, he's overseas. I still don't understand this dynamic of he's accused of something. And when he responds, he's the one who's in the wrong. He's not allowed to respond to allegations or accusations anymore?"

And he has tried to do that several times. And he's met with them and he has tried to bring them on board on bipartisan issues like renegotiating NAFTA or fixing the immigration crisis. But time and time again, he's been sabotaged by Nancy and then she says dirty, nasty things just to assuage her caucus because she's lost control. And I think it looks like he's had it."
