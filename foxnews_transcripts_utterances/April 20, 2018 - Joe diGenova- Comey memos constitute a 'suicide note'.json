And this is huge, according to Comey's memos; the president actually encouraged the FBIs investigation into Russian medaling and possible collusion. Based on a conversation that Comey had with Trump on March 30th of last year, Comey writes in his own memos that President Trump told him if there's some satellite, I took this to mean some associate of his or his campaign, that did something, it would be good to find that out, but that he, personally he hadn't done anything.

And the president immediately said, do what you have to do to prove that they're untrue. Call an investigation on me. And it was Comey who said I don't know if that's a good idea, Mr. President. But the president immediately says do what you have to to prove that these aren't true. Do whatever you -- I mean, and that just shows you that anyone accused of something, if they are actually guilty of it, they would say hey, can we -- can we kind of sweep this under the rug? Can we cover it up a little? You are not going to say anything, are you? But in fact, the president had quite the opposite. He got out there and said we need to clear this up. We need to get it out there. I don't like any of this. This is concerning. What do you have to do? And that really shows you. They don't want to cover that part of it.",

The president-elect who has never served in government before, sit down with those four intelligence chiefs. Comey as the FBI director says, Mr. President, can we clear the room and I can speak to you alone privately, OK, we get that. Then fast forward a little bit later. The president says to James Comey, hey, can we clear the room? I'd like to talk to you. And suddenly the accusation is, how dare the president clear the room to talk to James Comey. But, if we think about it, of course he thinks that that's standard operating procedure. Comey was the one who engaged first in that relationship by saying when we need to talk, we get to clear room.

      "utterance": "And welcome to the special edition of Hannity, deep state under siege. Now tonight the private Comey memos are out. And the disgraced former FBI Director along with his deep state friends, they are being completely exposed. Now, in just moments, we're going to show you some of James Comey's blatant lies and contradictions brought to light by these memos. We'll also break down how Comey may tonight be in serious legal jeopardy. And we'll also explain how these revelations are just one more layer of proof that President Trump never colluded with Russia in any way, shape, manner or form. Or did he ever attempt to obstruct justice in any way. Also tonight, after President Trump's significant diplomatic progress aboard and huge economic successes right here at home. The Democratic Party is desperate to keep this false Trump-Russia narrative collusion alive by turning to their favorite weapon. Let's start a frivolous lawsuit. What a sham. It's time for the democrats to face the music. These insane conspiracy theories are now falling apart right before their eyes. Sit tight, we are covering all of this, plus there is yet another pathetic moment from Hillary Clinton all in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. Alright so being threatened with a subpoena finally Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein released James Comey's memos to congress. And the former FBI Director is now in serious trouble tonight, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the justice department is now currently probing the documents over classified information. And they are, quote \"at least two of the memos that the former FBI Director James Comey gave to a friend outside of the government contained information that officials now consider classified.\" Now, just remember, a few days ago, on Sunday night. James Comey, he assured all of us that those memos were all unclassified. Take a look."

It may be seven. It may be eight. I don't remember. I think some of them -- I know when I created some of them they were classified. But I don't know how many of that group."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, of course, another damning sign that Comey unlawfully leaked classified information comes from the actual memos. For example, note how the Justice Department released only the redacted version to Congress, blackening out the dozens of section and words here. Now why redact information if it's not classified? And perhaps the most obvious sign that Comey leaked secret classified information comes from his own words and I'm quoting directly here \"I am not sure of the proper classification here so I have chosen secret.\" Now, according to reporting from Catherine Herridge, we are now learning that the Justice Department's probe of these memos is just part of a broader review of Comey's communications outside of the bureau, including his conduct with media organizations. Now, remember, this all comes after what might be the most unbelievable line in the memos when Comey actually writes that President Trump, \"Said I said I don't do sneaky things. I don't leak. I don't do weasel moves.\" Okay, just a few moments after writing those words Comey would leak those very memos, to a friend, who then leaked them to the New York Times. Setting in wheels the motion for Comey's best friend Robert Mueller to be appointed as Special Counsel, which was his goal. In a moment Alan Dershowitz and Joe diGenova will join us to weigh in on the legal jeopardy that James Comey is perhaps facing. But first we have yet another glaring Comey contradiction to bring you. In an interview with the The New Yorker, James Comey actually agreed Christopher Steele, the author of that discredited phony, unverified Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda dossier is \"credible and reliable\". But they also fired him. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVID REMNICK, THE NEW YORKER",
      "utterance": "Jane Mayer wrote a very comprehensive piece in the New Yorker about Christopher Steele's dossier and about Christopher Steele. Is he considered reliable, according to your sources as an intelligence agent?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. As it was described to me when it came in, it was raw intelligence, so a series of reports from a credible person, with a reliable track record, and a known experienced and sourced network in Russia. And so it was something to be taken seriously. Didn't mean it was all true but it was to be taken seriously. And its core assertion was corroborated by other intelligence. Its core assertion being the Russians have a campaign going on to interfere with the American election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. So why did they fire Christopher Steele? By the way I want a question answered. Did Comey also pay Christopher Steele? Now he praises the former British spy, but, still, to this day, he can't verify any of the information found in the dossier, including the totally untrue Russian lie about Trump, Ritz Carlton, Moscow, hookers urinating on a bed, which the media is obsessed with. And this is huge, according to Comey's memos; the president actually encouraged the FBIs investigation into Russian medaling and possible collusion. Based on a conversation that Comey had with Trump on March 30th of last year, Comey writes in his own memos that President Trump told him if there's some satellite, I took this to mean some associate of his or his campaign, that did something, it would be good to find that out, but that he, personally he hadn't done anything. So, not only did the president want to fully investigate everything related to Russia, it also clearly contradicts any claims that President Trump wanted to obstruct this investigation. Now, the president is reacting to the release of Comey's memos. He wrote on twitter, \"James Comey memos just out and show clearly there was no collusion, no obstruction. Also he leaked classified information. Wow. Will the witch-hunt continue?\" Now, we are now in day 338 of the run-away Mueller probe and it there is still zero evidence of collusion. Now, this proves that this investigation has gone way off the rails. It has turned into a total witch-hunt and we're also learning another interesting revelation about James Comey from his ongoing self-aggrandizing book tour. Despite claims from the mainstream media, many democrats, well we now know that James Comey is not a republican, hasn't been for a long time. Gee, thanks for telling us."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Wow, really? Now this shouldn't come as a surprise after the special treatment Clinton received from Comey during the criminal investigation into her private email server. We know she committed crimes and we also know that Comey put the fix in. We all know about the exoneration starting in May before the investigation in July, with Comey agreeing to call the investigation a matter when it was an investigation. And of course the FBI looking the other way while Hillary Clinton destroyed 33,000 e-mails that were subpoenaed, acid washed the hard drive with bleach bit and then had an aide beat up her devices with a hammer. But, all of this white glove treatment didn't stop Hillary Clinton from victimizing herself following the 2016 election results. Now, according to experts from a brand new book titled \"Chasing Hillary\", ten years, two presidential campaigns, and one intact glass ceiling. Clinton is bemoaning that, \"they were never going to let me be president\". Really, Hillary? You have her. You have the media, the deep state. All the political elites were actively working to help make you president. And despite your criminal history, and the complete and utter failure of secretary of state, that's a pretty big line of support. Of course, Hillary Clinton is not the only person having a hard time coping with the 2016 election results. Now, after months, over a year of investigations zero evidence of collusion, now the Democratic Party is so upset that it's all coming to an end and now grasping at straws. And the DNC, crybabies that they are, have today officially filed what is a laughable, completely frivolous lawsuit alleging that Russia, the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks, all conspired to interfere with the 2016 election. So have you sore loser democrats now actively trying to use the court system to malign the president further, distract Americans from progress that we're actually seeing every day in this country. And abroad, including a what, booming economy, record low unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, tax cuts that are putting more money in people's pockets. And along with some very significant diplomatic progress in North Korea and elsewhere around the world, which is, of course, a clear forceful, and successful response that we saw in the case of Syria, and the use of chemical weapons, and biological weapons. So don't be fooled by democrat's politically motivated lawsuit here. It's a joke. It's meant to create distractions. They can't let go. And they can't admit they were wrong and that they pushed the phony conspiracy theory. This country is on the right track right now and the left's wild theories, their conspiracy black helicopter theories are falling apart before their eyes. Just as we have predicted on this show over and over again. So we have been saying 2018 is the year of the boomerang. Joining us now, is the author of the new personal revelation, RNC spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany is with us. Fox News national security strategist Dr. Sebastian Gorka, and Fox News contributor Doug Schoen. Kayleigh, start with you. I think -- you know - the -- James Comey's own memo, if there's some satellite, he took it to mean associate of his campaign did something, it would be good to find that out. Okay. That sounds like he wants the investigation to be thorough, complete, and even if it's people around him. He wants to know who did what, and after a year plus, we have nothing."

      "speaker": "KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESPERSON",

That sounds like president fully cooperating with the investigation and to echo that James Comey says in his book that none of his conversations with the president rose to the level of illegality. There is no there, there to quote Peter Strzok. There is no there, there with collusion. There is no there, there with obstruction. He's been cleared by the intel committee. Robert Mueller has said you are not a target of this investigation. Rod Rosenstein has said it and in Comey's memo he says to the president three times you are not under investigation. This president has cooperated. He should be absolved and Robert Mueller needs to pack up, go home, move on."

Then you have the criminal referral by the IG as it relates to Andrew McCabe. Now today we have James Comey himself. He is under investigation. Everything-- you were part of predicting as I was that this is all going to back fire on them because the very thing they were accusing the President of they themselves are guilty of. What a week it's been."

Well, guess what, he is one 6'7\" slimy weasel. That's what he did. If you read, this what do we now know, Sean? We know he told the President you're not the target. We know the president told him I want a clean bill of health for my whole campaign, get to the bottom of it. James Comey refused to make a public statement to the affect that the president is not the target and that he wants a clean bill of health but what did he do? He leaked the fallacious Russian propaganda accusations that he told congress later were unverified and salacious. That's what he gave to the press. How is that not biased, Sean?"

Said what I believe, that this is trying to overtly politicize an investigation that has not yet been completed. Your right, as of now we have no evidence of collusion. But for the democrats to try to turn it into a political football in the midst of an election campaign runs the risk of a back fire and is over reaching. We saw that once before in 1998 in the mid-term elections when arguably the republicans overreached. And I would urge my fellow democrats not to make the same mistake."

If you look at all of them, the idea that Hillary Clinton, we know she committed felonies and we know there was an exoneration before and investigation. We also know that they used the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier created by a foreign agent, using Russia, Russia government sources and then used that as a basis of FISA warrant to spy on Americans. It seems these things now; this is what America is going to focus on. Americans believe in the right of privacy and they don't believe in frivolous warrants based on political opponents paying foreign sources that use Russian sources to lie to courts to get warrants to spy on people."

From tattle futures to server gate this is a woman we know has committed felonies. What felonies has Donald Trump committed in the last 71 years? Zero, Sean. This is how deep the corruption is in the swamp and the fact that these people go on book tours when they should be in the dark tells how bigger a job the President has before him."

But the democrats, Sean, gave us a big indication of what their playbook is for 2018 today when they filed this frivolous publicity stunt of a lawsuit. That is Russia, Russia, Russia. They will scream it from the rooftops. There is no basis in truth. These are conspiracy theories that they're pedaling, by the way the DNC is bankrupt. They had a -- $6 million in debt. So I don't know how they are funding this multi-million-dollar lawsuit. But they ought to be careful. Because Brad Parscale from the Trump Campaign said I'm going to expose this DNC corruption through discovery. We're going to look at why he partnered with Fusion GPS. We are going to use this lawsuit to find out why you didn't turn over your server. The DNC we're coming after you and your narrative for 2018 is not working."

They came with me to Boston Celtics basketball games. And I really got to just love these two guys. They gave me their home numbers. No matter what, 24/7 I could call them. They protected me. They protected my family. You know, I was brought up to love law enforcement. I was a member of the police athletic league as a kid. I represent policemen, any law enforcement people free of charge because we owe them so much. But I have to agree with you and it started in Boston a long, long time ago when the Whitey Bulger matter came up. And we saw how people at every level covered for him and allowed innocent people to remain in prison. It's so important to ferrite out father the bad guys. One of them is now in prison, John Connolly. I have to tell you I helped put him in prison. I consulted pro bono with the prosecutors to help keep that guy in prison because he was such a bad egg. He was telling Whitey Bulger who to kill. He was telling Whitey Bulger to escape. And he managed to escape for 16 years. And for 16 years the FBI couldn't find Whitey Bulger. He was in plain view in Santa Monica, California. Reportedly going to a Red Sox bar to watch baseball games and the FBI couldn't find him. Finally a person from the Federal Marshall Program found him. So, look, I think we have to commend FBI agents, CIA agents and focus on the problems and where they occur."

Then Andrew McCabe and the IG criminal referral, now we have an investigation, James Comey, I said this before he went on his book tour, Joe diGenova, this is a bad idea. I don't think any competent lawyer would have advised him, writing that book and doing this tour. In any way, but now he is under an Inspector General investigation here about releasing classified materials, 18 U.S.C. 793, both of you are very familiar with it."

The leaking of the unmasked information to newspapers which were felonies and the other things that involve the misuse of the intelligence and FISA warrants. There is going to be a series of grand juries and he there are going to be charges. I don't know who is going to be charged but it's very important that this be done the right way.

And if she lost, then the plan was to frame Donald Trump with crimes. And every single thing that we have seen over the last few months certifies through fact and reasonable inferences from facts that that is exactly what occurred.

Because, well, think about it, on Wednesday Ron DeSantis, I mean, a powerful letter with every law written down that is applicable to people like Hillary and Comey and McCabe and Strzok and Page and Lynch and all these other deep state actors, then yesterday it's the criminal referral as it relates to Andrew McCabe.

And then it says classification secret which is the second level. The moment Comey took this out of the FBI building and took it home with him, is he arguably committing a crime mishandling of classified information. If he gave this document to somebody else unauthorized, Daniel Richmond, and one other person that I'm aware of, and that will be coming out, he committed yet another crime.

I mean, they even found evidence that he had thrown other FBI executives under the bus. There was nothing else that the I.G. could do had he not gone forward with this criminal referral, we would have had to have questioned Michael Horowitz. Now, with Comey, I think this is fascinating. And especially Gregg brought up several good points. They're going to have to move forward with this. Because if they walk this back, they're going to have a lot of trouble. Because they are going to have a lot of the explaining to do, right? And Comey can't use a similar defense. I mean, look at what already happened with Hillary Clinton. Remember the I.G. report on the handling of the Hillary Clinton private server and her use of classified -- using it to send classified e-mails, that's coming out in May. And how the FBI handled it. So, Michael Horowitz is going to be very diligent. I think he is going to issue a report on Hillary and then I think what we're going to see follow that is a report on former FBI director Comey."

And he was having a conversation with the president. And he memorialized it in a document under privacy act of federal records act. And the document Comey signed called a nondisclosure agreement, it specifically says anything you do in the course and scope of your employment at the FBI is government property. It is not yours.

You got an upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the threat that it potentially poses to not just to our allies but potentially to our own citizens, and this is what they are talking about? You know, when it comes to the priorities of what the media is talking about, what is -- what are the concerns of the American people? I think there is complete mismatch.

I think the funny thing about this is what they didn't report in any of the clips that you played is that what did Comey actually say? That, when he presented this to the president in that room after that briefing, he asked the president to see him alone privately to share with him these unverified allegations. And the president immediately said, do what you have to do to prove that they're untrue. Call an investigation on me. And it was Comey who said I don't know if that's a good idea, Mr. President. But the president immediately says do what you have to to prove that these aren't true. Do whatever you -- I mean, and that just shows you that anyone accused of something, if they are actually guilty of it, they would say hey, can we -- can we kind of sweep this under the rug? Can we cover it up a little? You are not going to say anything, are you? But in fact, the president had quite the opposite. He got out there and said we need to clear this up. We need to get it out there. I don't like any of this. This is concerning. What do you have to do? And that really shows you. They don't want to cover that part of it."

The president-elect who has never served in government before, sit down with those four intelligence chiefs. Comey as the FBI director says, Mr. President, can we clear the room and I can speak to you alone privately, OK, we get that. Then fast forward a little bit later. The president says to James Comey, hey, can we clear the room? I'd like to talk to you. And suddenly the accusation is, how dare the president clear the room to talk to James Comey. But, if we think about it, of course he thinks that that's standard operating procedure. Comey was the one who engaged first in that relationship by saying when we need to talk, we get to clear room.
