Now in addition to the dozens of missed warning signs, and reports of four deputies not entering the school, FOX News tonight is reporting that there were delays even allowing EMTs to go inside the school.

Tonight, we are asking, when will Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, take responsibility? When will he release the cam footage so that you, the American people, can see how the deputies acted during the shooting?

      "sentences": "Finally, we've been unpeeling this story for over a year while, of course, the liberal media, they've been lying to you, obsessing over so- called Trump-Russia conclusion, which is nothing more than to this point a conspiracy theory that they've created out of thin air. There is no evidence. And, by the way, as for the extensive, unprecedented Obama-era FISA abuses, we now have a mountain of incontrovertible and corroborated facts and evidence. Liberal Congressman Adam Schiff's counter memo on FISA abuses has actually confirmed everything that we've been reporting on, and everything that is also in the two Republican memos on the scandal. That's why the mainstream media have been ignoring what is inside the Schiff memo, doesn't fit their narrative, and more importantly, it doesn't damage President Trump, which, of course, is their ultimate goal. Here's everything that the Schiff memo corroborates from the Nunes and Grassley-Graham memos, this completely unverified Clinton bought and paid for dossier that used Russian government sources made up, in fact, a large part of that FISA application to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Adam Schiff actually writes that a section of the FISA application references parts of the phony dossier about Carter Page meeting with Russians in Moscow in June of 2016. Page, by the way, is denying these lies and that they've never been proven true. I think Mueller would have arrested him by now or at least charged him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, the Grassley and Graham memo said the Russian dossier made up the bulk of this FISA application. Schiff didn't say that, but, yes, he admits the dossier was used, and the Schiff memo also corroborates that, in fact, the FBI and the DOJ lied, and purposely and maliciously misled a FISA judge about Clinton and the DNC paying over $12 million for the Russian dossier of unverified lies and propaganda. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Can you believe this is happening in our country? Schiff's memo actually quotes a part of the FISA application about the dossier having political motivations. But here's the thing. The application never bothered to mention that it was Hillary or the DNC that paid for that dossier. The FBI knew this, but they purposely hid it from the FISA judge. Not rank and file FBI, that higher echelon that we talk about. They used it to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's another key point that the Schiff memo confirms. The FISA application did mention a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff that he wrote about Carter Page. Schiff however lied about the fact that the judge was never made aware that the source for the Yahoo article was Christopher Steele. The Republican memo actually details how this is a major problem because that means that the information was never verified by two independent sources since Steele was the only source. So, those are points that the Schiff memo actually confirms. And here are the key facts that the Schiff memo flat out lies about. The congressman claims that the Trump campaign was never spied on. That is a lie, 100 percent false, and here's why. When the federal government granted a FISA warrant, that gives them access to every one of Carter Page's old emails, old text messages, and they know every phone call he made which could date back to when he was with the Trump campaign. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Schiff claims former deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe that he never testified that without the dossier there never would have been a FISA warrant application. But the Schiff memo never offers any proof, which likely means it doesn't exist, and my sources confirm that, in fact, McCabe said that. And Schiff does admit that Steele was fired by the FBI for these media leaks. But what Schiff doesn't say is that Steele lied to the FBI about his media contacts. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the Schiff memo tries to play up Christopher Steele's credibility by saying, well, he's worked with the FBI in the past. Yes, they just fired him. Here's the problem: Schiff never mentioned that Steele was using Russian government sources, and that the information was never verified independently by the FBI or the DOJ or by anybody. So, it should never have been used for any FISA warrant application at all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, finally, Schiff omits this critical piece of evidence, according to our reporting, the dossier put the FISA application over the top. In other words, we've been telling you that the first time they tried, it failed. The FISA application was denied. Then the dossier, well, they added that to get the help that was needed so they could, quote, get it approved. And then they lied to the judge. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What it all means is we have three congressional memos that prove a key fact. The FBI lied to a FISA judge about the Clinton and DNC financing the dossier, which was filled with uncorroborated Russian lies, and they did it to spy on the Trump campaign. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, I'm glad he's moving. He needs to move quickly. Everybody involved needs to be held accountable. We need to restore the rule of law. Also breaking tonight, we have more news about Broward County and the sheriff's department missing countless warning signs about the Florida school shooter, and utterly failing to properly respond to this deadly rampage. This is one huge, massive, giant, bureaucratic failure after another in this case. And Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, well, he's flat out refusing to take any responsibility. Instead, he's blaming pretty much everybody else. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to reports, this is almost unconscionable, four of sheriff Israel's deputies did not enter the building while the shooting was happening. One deputy, a school resource officer on the scene, his name is Scot Peterson, was armed with a gun and bullet proof vest. He took up a position outside the building while the shooting was taking place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One student described Peterson as standing still after he heard shot after shot being fired. Peterson's defending his actions and ended up resigning. What we're now learning is that the first members of law enforcement to enter the school, they were actually from the Coral Springs police department. Those officers rushed right in. Broward County deputies, they took up a defensive posture and position outside. And also new tonight, Fox News reporting that Broward County sheriff's department also prevented the EMTs from entering the school. And there were questions about, well, you know, would it be proper protocol? Students and teachers were shot and dying and bleeding. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Sources are telling our own Laura Ingraham that Broward County sheriff deputies, they were told not to go into the school unless their body cameras were turned on, even though those deputies apparently didn't have them. Sara Carter breaking news tonight, reporting that under Sheriff Scott Israel's leadership, apparently, there have been at least 40 investigations into that department of misconduct. We did reach out to the sheriff's office for comment on Sara's story. We haven't heard back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is all one, huge, massive, giant blunder after another while students and teachers were being slaughtered inside the school. And sadly, that's just part of the story. We know the FBI was alerted not once but twice about Nikolas Cruz and his sinister intentions including weeks before the massacre. One unidentified woman told authorities that she feared Cruz would, get into a school and shoot the place up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } 'The Naples Daily News' reported that Broward County Sheriff's Office received 18 specific warning calls about Nikolas Cruz since 2008, and law enforcement, imagine this, visited this kid's home a whopping 39 times in a seven-year period. And we also know Cruz raised all kinds of red flags at school. He wasn't allowed to wear a backpack because of security concerns, and he was ultimately expelled because of his behavior. And, of course, he posted all these disturbing images on social media. Warning signs missed at every single level here. People did the right thing. They saw something. They said something. They alerted authorities. These authorities dropped the ball on a level I can't even comprehend. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They didn't do their jobs. They failed this community in Florida. And these officials need to be owning up to their mistakes so it never happens again, and we can fix the problems in the system. Prevent future massacres. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But that's not the case. You've heard people like Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, he's refusing to own up to his failures. He won't answer key questions. He pats himself on the back, and as a general overall lack of sympathy. Watch this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

First, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions is now saying the Department of Justice will investigate the severe Obama era FISA abuses against the Trump campaign. Now, this comes after Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff's counter memo confirms that the FBI lied to the FISA court judge about the Clinton bought and paid for dossier filled with Russian lies and propaganda in order to get the warrant to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. And also breaking right now, more damning evidence of the massive bureaucratic failure by the Broward County sheriff's department surrounding that horrific Florida school shooting. Now in addition to the dozens of missed warning signs, and reports of four deputies not entering the school, FOX News tonight is reporting that there were delays even allowing EMTs to go inside the school. Sources are telling FOX that the Broward County sheriff's office denied requests by the EMTs to enter the crime scene. And also breaking this hour, our own Sara Carter reporting that under Sheriff Scott Israel's leadership there have been at least 40 investigations into department misconduct. Tonight, we are asking, when will Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, take responsibility? When will he release the cam footage so that you, the American people, can see how the deputies acted during the shooting? We have so much breaking news in our opening monologue."

We are getting one step closer to holding top level Obama, FBI, DOJ, deep state officials accountable for what is a severe constitutional abuse. They've completely shredded the Fourth Amendment rights of the American people, and people could and should end up behind bars. The Attorney General Jeff Sessions thankfully is saying tonight the Department of Justice will be investigating these FISA abuses. Let's watch."

      "utterance": "Finally, we've been unpeeling this story for over a year while, of course, the liberal media, they've been lying to you, obsessing over so- called Trump-Russia conclusion, which is nothing more than to this point a conspiracy theory that they've created out of thin air. There is no evidence. And, by the way, as for the extensive, unprecedented Obama-era FISA abuses, we now have a mountain of incontrovertible and corroborated facts and evidence. Liberal Congressman Adam Schiff's counter memo on FISA abuses has actually confirmed everything that we've been reporting on, and everything that is also in the two Republican memos on the scandal. That's why the mainstream media have been ignoring what is inside the Schiff memo, doesn't fit their narrative, and more importantly, it doesn't damage President Trump, which, of course, is their ultimate goal. Here's everything that the Schiff memo corroborates from the Nunes and Grassley-Graham memos, this completely unverified Clinton bought and paid for dossier that used Russian government sources made up, in fact, a large part of that FISA application to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Adam Schiff actually writes that a section of the FISA application references parts of the phony dossier about Carter Page meeting with Russians in Moscow in June of 2016. Page, by the way, is denying these lies and that they've never been proven true. I think Mueller would have arrested him by now or at least charged him. Remember, the Grassley and Graham memo said the Russian dossier made up the bulk of this FISA application. Schiff didn't say that, but, yes, he admits the dossier was used, and the Schiff memo also corroborates that, in fact, the FBI and the DOJ lied, and purposely and maliciously misled a FISA judge about Clinton and the DNC paying over $12 million for the Russian dossier of unverified lies and propaganda. Can you believe this is happening in our country? Schiff's memo actually quotes a part of the FISA application about the dossier having political motivations. But here's the thing. The application never bothered to mention that it was Hillary or the DNC that paid for that dossier. The FBI knew this, but they purposely hid it from the FISA judge. Not rank and file FBI, that higher echelon that we talk about. They used it to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. Here's another key point that the Schiff memo confirms. The FISA application did mention a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff that he wrote about Carter Page. Schiff however lied about the fact that the judge was never made aware that the source for the Yahoo article was Christopher Steele. The Republican memo actually details how this is a major problem because that means that the information was never verified by two independent sources since Steele was the only source. So, those are points that the Schiff memo actually confirms. And here are the key facts that the Schiff memo flat out lies about. The congressman claims that the Trump campaign was never spied on. That is a lie, 100 percent false, and here's why. When the federal government granted a FISA warrant, that gives them access to every one of Carter Page's old emails, old text messages, and they know every phone call he made which could date back to when he was with the Trump campaign. Schiff claims former deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe that he never testified that without the dossier there never would have been a FISA warrant application. But the Schiff memo never offers any proof, which likely means it doesn't exist, and my sources confirm that, in fact, McCabe said that. And Schiff does admit that Steele was fired by the FBI for these media leaks. But what Schiff doesn't say is that Steele lied to the FBI about his media contacts. And the Schiff memo tries to play up Christopher Steele's credibility by saying, well, he's worked with the FBI in the past. Yes, they just fired him."

      "speaker": "Here's the problem",
      "utterance": "Schiff never mentioned that Steele was using Russian government sources, and that the information was never verified independently by the FBI or the DOJ or by anybody. So, it should never have been used for any FISA warrant application at all. And, finally, Schiff omits this critical piece of evidence, according to our reporting, the dossier put the FISA application over the top. In other words, we've been telling you that the first time they tried, it failed. The FISA application was denied. Then the dossier, well, they added that to get the help that was needed so they could, quote, get it approved. And then they lied to the judge. What it all means is we have three congressional memos that prove a key fact. The FBI lied to a FISA judge about the Clinton and DNC financing the dossier, which was filled with uncorroborated Russian lies, and they did it to spy on the Trump campaign. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, I'm glad he's moving. He needs to move quickly. Everybody involved needs to be held accountable. We need to restore the rule of law. Also breaking tonight, we have more news about Broward County and the sheriff's department missing countless warning signs about the Florida school shooter, and utterly failing to properly respond to this deadly rampage. This is one huge, massive, giant, bureaucratic failure after another in this case. And Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, well, he's flat out refusing to take any responsibility. Instead, he's blaming pretty much everybody else. According to reports, this is almost unconscionable, four of sheriff Israel's deputies did not enter the building while the shooting was happening. One deputy, a school resource officer on the scene, his name is Scot Peterson, was armed with a gun and bullet proof vest. He took up a position outside the building while the shooting was taking place. One student described Peterson as standing still after he heard shot after shot being fired. Peterson's defending his actions and ended up resigning. What we're now learning is that the first members of law enforcement to enter the school, they were actually from the Coral Springs police department. Those officers rushed right in. Broward County deputies, they took up a defensive posture and position outside. And also new tonight, Fox News reporting that Broward County sheriff's department also prevented the EMTs from entering the school. And there were questions about, well, you know, would it be proper protocol? Students and teachers were shot and dying and bleeding. Sources are telling our own Laura Ingraham that Broward County sheriff deputies, they were told not to go into the school unless their body cameras were turned on, even though those deputies apparently didn't have them. Sara Carter breaking news tonight, reporting that under Sheriff Scott Israel's leadership, apparently, there have been at least 40 investigations into that department of misconduct. We did reach out to the sheriff's office for comment on Sara's story. We haven't heard back. This is all one, huge, massive, giant blunder after another while students and teachers were being slaughtered inside the school. And sadly, that's just part of the story. We know the FBI was alerted not once but twice about Nikolas Cruz and his sinister intentions including weeks before the massacre. One unidentified woman told authorities that she feared Cruz would, get into a school and shoot the place up. 'The Naples Daily News' reported that Broward County Sheriff's Office received 18 specific warning calls about Nikolas Cruz since 2008, and law enforcement, imagine this, visited this kid's home a whopping 39 times in a seven-year period. And we also know Cruz raised all kinds of red flags at school. He wasn't allowed to wear a backpack because of security concerns, and he was ultimately expelled because of his behavior. And, of course, he posted all these disturbing images on social media. Warning signs missed at every single level here. People did the right thing. They saw something. They said something. They alerted authorities. These authorities dropped the ball on a level I can't even comprehend. They didn't do their jobs. They failed this community in Florida. And these officials need to be owning up to their mistakes so it never happens again, and we can fix the problems in the system. Prevent future massacres. But that's not the case. You've heard people like Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, he's refusing to own up to his failures. He won't answer key questions. He pats himself on the back, and as a general overall lack of sympathy. Watch this."

Joining us now with reaction to her article and breaking news, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, civil rights and criminal defense attorney David Schoen is with us. Sara, I'm looking at your article, and I'm blown away. At least 66 cases of criminal misconduct being investigated into Sheriff Israel's department? What is going on down there?"

    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right. And 66, 40 of which were all under Sheriff Israel, which is so significant. What's going on over there is that somebody needs to look at the leadership quality Sheriff Israel is bringing to Broward County here, to the sheriff's department. And there are a number of people concerned. I mean, these cases, this is not just slight misconduct. These are criminal misconduct cases that range from kidnapping. I mean, I was stunned. From kidnapping to drug trafficking, these are sheriff's deputies. Even in some cases killings. So, there is something going on in Broward County sheriff's department office, and Sheriff Israel is the leader, and it appears that someone needs to be asking some very serious questions about what's going on there."

I love, respect law enforcement. We saw it on 9/11. Everyone coming down, and they're going up. That's the people that I know. I never heard of one, never mind four. Cops are trained. This is why they become officers because they've put themselves in harm's way. They're ready to do that. I've never in my entire life ever heard of an officer that has acted this way. And for all the other police officers, FBI guys, we are not talking about them. They do their job every day. How did this happen here and it's all in one county under one sheriff? I don't understand."

As you have said and say night after night, as a law enforcement guy, these police officers, and deputies and firefighters are our heroes. And there are many fine ones that serve in the Broward sheriff's office. However, we have to consider a fundamental lack of leadership. We have a lawsuit going right now, a federal civil rights case going against Sheriff Israel and other deputies there for a cold-blooded killing of an African-American man named Jermaine McBean in 2013. Department of Justice has an open investigation in their civil rights division about it. And we alleged in that case, as the complaint shows that ultimately the sheriff ratified the policy that happened. It's a matter of not acknowledging mistakes. You know, Ben Franklin said once a man who is good at making mistakes is seldom good at anything else. I'm making excuses, rather, seldom good of anything else."

But once the reports started to come out that multiple deputies responded and still didn't go in, I just want to be clear on this, there is no response to school violence I know of out there that requires them not to go in, set up a perimeter and wait.

It's not just Columbine. After the Pulse Nightclub, after San Bernardino, all police departments around the globe are reassessing their protocols. You don't wait for the hostage negotiator.

His Justice Department obtaining two months' worth of phone records from the A.P, something the AP called a massive, unprecedented intrusion. 2014, the administration ridiculed over excessive weight times at V.A. Hospitals that led to the death of dozens of veterans. The month's long scandal surrounding the prisoner swap, Bo Bergdaal, and then the thing called Benghazi, that scandal where four Americans actually died in Libya. But I guess at this point what difference does it make, right, Hillary? And don't forget the Fast and Furious scandal, they actually put guns in the hands of violent Mexican gangs and of course people died. By the way, we actually interviewed family members. Also, the time the IRS, oh, yeah, they apologized recently in the Trump administration they were targeting conservatives and tea Party groups. And of course, the disastrous Obamacare rollout, and of course the money for Solyndra, that was a disaster. And of course we're still dealing with the ramifications of the ongoing uranium one scandal, and we could go on to help spark President Obama's memory, the co-host of the five, and the host of Watters ' World Jesse Watters and Fox News contributor, it's actually her world tonight."
