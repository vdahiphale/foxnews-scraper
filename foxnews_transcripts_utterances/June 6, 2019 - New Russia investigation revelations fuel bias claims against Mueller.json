      "sentences": "Busy news night. Welcome to “Hannity.” At this hour, we are tracking huge multiple breaking stories on multiple fronts. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We start tonight with the massive development out of the Mueller partisan witch hunt. Tonight, more evidence has emerged that Bob Mueller's 448-page report was nothing but pure political garbage, full of errors put there purposefully. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to a brand new breaking story of John Solomon, some of the very keys of Mueller's assertions are totally and provably false. For example, the Mueller report describes Paul Manafort's Ukrainian business partner as a shady individual with ties to Russian intelligence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Mueller wanted us all to believe that the Trump campaign was essentially in bed with the Russian spy. But tonight, thanks to Solomon, well, we know that is total B.S. And, yes, you might want to call it even Mueller fake news. Now, Manafort's business partner was a sensitive intelligence source for the U.S. State Department. That's a big difference. So, how and why did Mueller and his team purposely deceive you, we, the American people? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, in fact, he visited the U.S. twice in 2016 to meet with State Department officials and for years he met with the chief political officer inside the U.S. embassy in Kiev. Now, Mueller had all access to all this information, which means that he and his merry band of all Democratic donors, no Republican donors, all Trump haters, that means they lied in the report. And get this -- Mueller cast a dark shadow on this individual's request to present a Ukrainian peace plan to the Trump campaign in 2016. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But guess what John Solomon discovered? Well, he discovered that the very same plan was presented to the Obama administration, the very same year, and Mueller's team knew it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Mueller, why would he print that? Solomon is not the first reporter now to raise concerns. He will not be the last. Now, what this ends up being is outright deception, outright lying from Mueller and, of course, his Democratic donor friends that he appointed. Now, it's just the latest of what is a very disturbing pattern of lies, misinformation, character assassination, because remember on Monday, we first reported that Mueller editing a transcript from a former Trump attorney John Dowd who was on this program and called that report a fraud. And during a privileged routine call between attorneys, remember, they originally had a joint defense agreement. While Mueller conveniently omitted Dowd's statement and his request for communication was, quote, not only for the president but for the country, and he was not asking for any confidential information. That exculpatory evidence was totally ripped out. That is a classic Andrew Weissmann, Mueller's pit bull, his tactic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You may remember, Sidney Powell's book \"Licensed to Lie\" -- Weissmann on multiple occasions had withheld exculpatory evidence in the past. Why was he ever appointed? And that's not all. Let's not forget Mueller's 9-minute-long diatribe just last week, when the media got all ginned up and they were full of hope and anticipation that they finally got the president. Well, that ended up being debunked a few hours later, because in fact, the DOJ policy indicting a city the president was never a consideration. And Mueller has said that numerous times. So, his press conference was an absolute contradiction of everything he had said. And remember, in a joint statement hours later, the DOJ, that means Attorney General Barr, the special counsel office -- they were forced to totally walk back and clarify the 9-1/2 minutes that Mueller was commenting and they ended up reaffirming, quote, that the special counsel's report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime. It had nothing to do with Justice Department policy with whether you can or cannot indict a president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, everything Mueller in 9-1/2 minutes was false. It was phony. It was fake. It was innuendo. And Attorney General Barr pretty much bailed them out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in that press conference, he really was begging Nadler not to testify or be subpoenaed because he knows he has to answer questions from Jim Jordan, and Mark Meadows and Devin Nunes who will join us in a few minutes. He doesn't want to answer questions like, well, Mr. Mueller, when did you know there was no collusion? And when you found out, why didn't you end this witch hunt? By the way, why did you only hire hard-core Democratic donors, including a former Hillary Clinton attorney for the Clinton Foundation? Why would ever hire a guy like Andrew Weissmann who got tens of thousands of Enron accounting execs fired and then lost in the Supreme Court 9-0, and then had four Merrill executives put in jail for a year, and that was overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals? Why appoint somebody like Weissmann known for atrocious conduct, actually attended Hillary Clinton's so-called victory party on election night? It didn't work out well. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, the pattern is clear. What we see now time and time again, the special counsel manipulates information to unjustly impugn a duly elected president of the United States. And by the way, if Mueller had time for taxi medallions and loan applications and FARA violations and so forth, why didn't he have time for the dirty Russian dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for that's full of Russian lies and disinformation that actually was used to influence the American people? No excuse for that. There's no collusion. There was no obstruction on the Trump campaign's part. There's no conspiracy. All the Trump haters on Mueller's team, well, they just reverted to plan-B. That's a 448-page smear campaign. They created a document intended to fuel even more lies and conspiracy theories from Democrats and, of course, their allies in the abusively biased and corrupt media mob. It was a political hit job from the beginning through and through. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the president was right. It always was a witch. And as far as Mueller is concerned, mission accomplished. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We're going to have more monologue in just a moment. But, first, joining us now with his huge big breaking news report from \"The Hill\", we have John Solomon. Basically, they knew certain facts. They had exculpatory evidence. They selectively chose what to put in and what to omit. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } JOHN SOLOMON, \"THE HILL\" EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And you now find out that in his possession were FBI 302 interview reports and more than 200 pages of emails and cables in which the State Department referred to Kilimnik as one of their most sensitive intelligence sources, as someone who is their one of the most reliable intelligence sources on what was going on inside the Ukrainian government, someone who they were so concerned about protecting that they didn't put him in cables because they were afraid WikiLeaks, when they would get him and his identity would get out.

We didn't go with the 99.9 percent of the mob and everything we've been reporting up to now has been proven true, which brings us to some other breaking news from Mueller's top targets, and that is Lt. General Michael Flynn. He is now in the sentencing phase of his guilty plea, as we speak. And lieutenant general is desperately trying to fire his legal team and hours ago, a federal judge actually blocked that request, only on a procedural grounds measure. But it is a sign the retired war hero is preparing to withdraw his guilty plea. Now, keep in mind this -- Flynn's plea was the result of a perjury trap. It was laid by Comey. It was laid by McCabe and Mueller. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, during his initial interview with the FBI at the White House, remember, he called the deputy director of the FBI and said, do I need a lawyer? Andrew McCabe said, no, no, no. You don't need a lawyer. No, it's not like that at all. OK, I just wanted to know. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And James Comey, well, he bragged about how he would do something he would never do in the Obama administration or the Bush administration. And he is boasting about setting up a man who served this country for 33 years and put his life on the line in wartime. And he's saying, we took full advantage of the chaos. We told them not to get a lawyer. They had already illegally unmasked him and they illegally leaked raw intelligence. They knew exactly what was said in the conversation. They set a perjury trap from the get go if, in fact, the Lt. General Flynn didn't say the exact thing they expected.

That is a national, despicable, disgusting disgrace what they did to him. No collusion, no conspiracy from Trump or anyone on his campaign.

So the bar is so low all he has to do is show up on time, Sean, not blow his nose on his tie and he has met their expectations. The third reason is just as you pointed out. Ratings. How many meetings do you think CNN and MSNBC all have had since the Mueller report came down and their ratings have sunk like a stone? They know they've got to reposition themselves to be slightly more fair, maybe just maybe, we ought not treat Donald Trump as the combination of Hitler, Stalin and Mao.

      "utterance": "Busy news night. Welcome to “Hannity.” At this hour, we are tracking huge multiple breaking stories on multiple fronts. We start tonight with the massive development out of the Mueller partisan witch hunt. Tonight, more evidence has emerged that Bob Mueller's 448-page report was nothing but pure political garbage, full of errors put there purposefully. According to a brand new breaking story of John Solomon, some of the very keys of Mueller's assertions are totally and provably false. For example, the Mueller report describes Paul Manafort's Ukrainian business partner as a shady individual with ties to Russian intelligence. Now, Mueller wanted us all to believe that the Trump campaign was essentially in bed with the Russian spy. But tonight, thanks to Solomon, well, we know that is total B.S. And, yes, you might want to call it even Mueller fake news. Now, Manafort's business partner was a sensitive intelligence source for the U.S. State Department. That's a big difference. So, how and why did Mueller and his team purposely deceive you, we, the American people? Now, in fact, he visited the U.S. twice in 2016 to meet with State Department officials and for years he met with the chief political officer inside the U.S. embassy in Kiev. Now, Mueller had all access to all this information, which means that he and his merry band of all Democratic donors, no Republican donors, all Trump haters, that means they lied in the report. And get this -- Mueller cast a dark shadow on this individual's request to present a Ukrainian peace plan to the Trump campaign in 2016. But guess what John Solomon discovered? Well, he discovered that the very same plan was presented to the Obama administration, the very same year, and Mueller's team knew it. Now, Mueller, why would he print that? Solomon is not the first reporter now to raise concerns. He will not be the last. Now, what this ends up being is outright deception, outright lying from Mueller and, of course, his Democratic donor friends that he appointed. Now, it's just the latest of what is a very disturbing pattern of lies, misinformation, character assassination, because remember on Monday, we first reported that Mueller editing a transcript from a former Trump attorney John Dowd who was on this program and called that report a fraud. And during a privileged routine call between attorneys, remember, they originally had a joint defense agreement. While Mueller conveniently omitted Dowd's statement and his request for communication was, quote, not only for the president but for the country, and he was not asking for any confidential information. That exculpatory evidence was totally ripped out. That is a classic Andrew Weissmann, Mueller's pit bull, his tactic. You may remember, Sidney Powell's book \"Licensed to Lie\" -- Weissmann on multiple occasions had withheld exculpatory evidence in the past. Why was he ever appointed? And that's not all. Let's not forget Mueller's 9-minute-long diatribe just last week, when the media got all ginned up and they were full of hope and anticipation that they finally got the president. Well, that ended up being debunked a few hours later, because in fact, the DOJ policy indicting a city the president was never a consideration. And Mueller has said that numerous times. So, his press conference was an absolute contradiction of everything he had said. And remember, in a joint statement hours later, the DOJ, that means Attorney General Barr, the special counsel office -- they were forced to totally walk back and clarify the 9-1/2 minutes that Mueller was commenting and they ended up reaffirming, quote, that the special counsel's report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime. It had nothing to do with Justice Department policy with whether you can or cannot indict a president. In other words, everything Mueller in 9-1/2 minutes was false. It was phony. It was fake. It was innuendo. And Attorney General Barr pretty much bailed them out. And in that press conference, he really was begging Nadler not to testify or be subpoenaed because he knows he has to answer questions from Jim Jordan, and Mark Meadows and Devin Nunes who will join us in a few minutes. He doesn't want to answer questions like, well, Mr. Mueller, when did you know there was no collusion? And when you found out, why didn't you end this witch hunt? By the way, why did you only hire hard-core Democratic donors, including a former Hillary Clinton attorney for the Clinton Foundation? Why would ever hire a guy like Andrew Weissmann who got tens of thousands of Enron accounting execs fired and then lost in the Supreme Court 9-0, and then had four Merrill executives put in jail for a year, and that was overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals? Why appoint somebody like Weissmann known for atrocious conduct, actually attended Hillary Clinton's so-called victory party on election night? It didn't work out well. So, the pattern is clear. What we see now time and time again, the special counsel manipulates information to unjustly impugn a duly elected president of the United States. And by the way, if Mueller had time for taxi medallions and loan applications and FARA violations and so forth, why didn't he have time for the dirty Russian dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for that's full of Russian lies and disinformation that actually was used to influence the American people? No excuse for that. There's no collusion. There was no obstruction on the Trump campaign's part. There's no conspiracy. All the Trump haters on Mueller's team, well, they just reverted to plan-B. That's a 448-page smear campaign. They created a document intended to fuel even more lies and conspiracy theories from Democrats and, of course, their allies in the abusively biased and corrupt media mob. It was a political hit job from the beginning through and through. And the president was right. It always was a witch. And as far as Mueller is concerned, mission accomplished. We're going to have more monologue in just a moment. But, first, joining us now with his huge big breaking news report from \"The Hill\", we have John Solomon. Basically, they knew certain facts. They had exculpatory evidence. They selectively chose what to put in and what to omit. JOHN SOLOMON, \"THE HILL\" EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right."

      "utterance": "Yes. Listen, what is certain tonight, Sean, is that this is a significant and, quite frankly, inexplicable omission from Robert Mueller's report. He goes out of his way to try to paint Konstantin Kilimnik as somehow Russian and therefore every contact that Paul Manafort had with him had to have a sinister twist to it. And you now find out that in his possession were FBI 302 interview reports and more than 200 pages of emails and cables in which the State Department referred to Kilimnik as one of their most sensitive intelligence sources, as someone who is their one of the most reliable intelligence sources on what was going on inside the Ukrainian government, someone who they were so concerned about protecting that they didn't put him in cables because they were afraid WikiLeaks, when they would get him and his identity would get out. This was a sensitive U.S. intelligence source and Bob Mueller did not take the time to tell the American people that side of the story. I don't know how to explain why he omitted it. He is not giving us an answer tonight. But this is going to raise some serious questions about the credibility of the report and it's not the only omission or factual error that's starting to surface."

And in that effort at transparency, we only get a half truth, at least on Konstantin Kilimnik and I fear on several other people that are identified in the report. When you go through what I have, these several hundred pages and you look at what was really being said about Kilimnik, and you look at the way he's portrayed, every slight, every omission is designed to make him look more nefarious than he is. If this guy was a Russian asset, he doesn't get into the United States in 2016. He would not have this level of access to the senior officials at the State Department. He wouldn't be presenting Obama State Department peace plan long before he gives it to Donald Trump if he was not trusted. Somebody didn't do their job or somebody made a conscious decision to ignore this. Neither one of those are a good alternative to the American people."

They are just hell bent on one thing, and one thing only, and that's impeaching the president. They don't have a reason, they don't state a reason. But, of course, they get the assistance of the psychotic media mobs, conspiracy theorists, liars. And tonight, this is no longer a Democratic Party like of Scoop Jackson, even Joe Lieberman. Instead, it is now the party of anti-Trump rage and psychosis, and for some reason, even impeaching Trump apparently is not enough. Speaker Pelosi now apparently telling senior Democrats she'd like to see Trump behind bars based on no actual crime. She wants a political opponent locked up in prison. That happens in banana republics, beyond despicable behavior. And by the way, they would literally turn in many ways the USA into a country we would no longer recognize, constitutional republic, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. But, of course Pelosi -- I have been telling you -- she is only speaker of the House in name only. She knows the real speaker is Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez. She is calling the shots. Pelosi is desperately trying to appease this extreme base of the party, as if she's not extreme enough. And make no mistakes, this new socialist Democratic Party, they are out for revenge. It's not been solutions, making the country safer, more secure, more prosperous, more employment, raising the standard of living for you, we the American people. They don't care about that. They focus on one thing and one thing only, and that is their rage, their obsession. Donald Trump, the president, lives in their heads 24/7, every second, every minute, every hour of every day.

I plead the Fifth, I've answered that question, because it means dozens of private citizens shelling out of thousands for these expensive Washington attorneys, answering the same questions over and over again. This has now become a government abuse of power, plain and simple. They're now stealing from government workers who end up paying more than they make to play for the legal fees that they accrued during this time. And naturally, the mainstream media doesn't care. It's not their money. They are now working overtime to bolster the Democrats' smear campaign. Look at \"The New York Times\" editorial page. They're so objective, they just featured a draft articles of impeachment against Trump over no charges, including multiple scenarios for how the Democrats can achieve their fantasy, their dream. This for them would be like manna from heaven, living heavenly waters in their soul and their soul reflexes. But it's not going to happen. And ironically today, we also had simultaneously a top editor for the fake news \"New York Times\" saying that his paper is no way anti-Trump. Oh, yes, everyone just raises from the dead articles of impeachment over nothing. I told you in 2007, journalism in America, it is dead. It is buried. And look at the Pew Research report that we've said to you, reported last night. Lies, deception, conspiracy theories, this is now representing news? Tom Brokaw, are you really proud of that nut Rachel Maddow? \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\" and fake news CNN, two and a half years of non-stop lying, conspiracy theories and a hoax all based on anonymous sources. The so-called mainstream media, they are nothing but an extension, the propaganda arm, if you will, of the Democratic Party. Nothing more. They are never to be trusted. And, by the way, the American people now get it. On this program, we focused on truth and justice. We went in a direction totally different. We didn't go with the 99.9 percent of the mob and everything we've been reporting up to now has been proven true, which brings us to some other breaking news from Mueller's top targets, and that is Lt. General Michael Flynn. He is now in the sentencing phase of his guilty plea, as we speak. And lieutenant general is desperately trying to fire his legal team and hours ago, a federal judge actually blocked that request, only on a procedural grounds measure. But it is a sign the retired war hero is preparing to withdraw his guilty plea. Now, keep in mind this -- Flynn's plea was the result of a perjury trap. It was laid by Comey. It was laid by McCabe and Mueller. Remember, during his initial interview with the FBI at the White House, remember, he called the deputy director of the FBI and said, do I need a lawyer? Andrew McCabe said, no, no, no. You don't need a lawyer. No, it's not like that at all. OK, I just wanted to know. And James Comey, well, he bragged about how he would do something he would never do in the Obama administration or the Bush administration. And he is boasting about setting up a man who served this country for 33 years and put his life on the line in wartime. And he's saying, we took full advantage of the chaos. We told them not to get a lawyer. They had already illegally unmasked him and they illegally leaked raw intelligence. They knew exactly what was said in the conversation. They set a perjury trap from the get go if, in fact, the Lt. General Flynn didn't say the exact thing they expected. Look at this."

That's how we threat American heroes? We set them up and tell them not to have lawyers. We pretty much say it's not an investigation and brag about it? FBI investigators already knew the answer of the questions. They already heard the tapes. And Flynn was surveilled and unmasked by our own federal government, which was illegal. And McCabe and Comey both testified that Flynn still didn't appear to be lying but he had to sign on because he was losing his house, he was out of money and they were threatening to go after his own family, his son in particular. Because Flynn failed to perfectly recount the details of a- year-old phone call. Mueller turns the screws on him in the hopes he'll sing or compose, and Lt. General Flynn's life has been in ruins ever since. His finances have been wrecked. His home had been sold because of legal fees and he's facing real jail time for purportedly lying to investigators who didn't think he was lying."

An American's hero's reputation should not be destroyed by people with power bragging about abusing that power on tape. It's a disgusting display of abuse of power. Here now, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Devin Nunes, and FOX News contributor Sara Carter. You know, Congressman, I listen to Comey and what McCabe said to him, knowing he was illegally unmasked, knowing they leaked raw intelligence, and I'm saying if America treats our heroes this way, we do not have a democratic republic.

But it is absolutely despicable with the head of the FBI would think it's funny and cute to send over these FBI agents to go and interview the national security advisor for the president of the United States, and then they walk out of there and say, look, we don't think the guy is lying, but instead what do you do, you double down.

I hope he will be subpoenaed if necessary. Bob Mueller said I'm paying tribute to the integrity of the people who worked for me. He has put, by his own words, the integrity in play. Twenty years ago, the integrity of the investigation I was charged with was put in play and so what happened? I was summoned to testify. They didn't have to subpoena me. I was requested to testify and I did. And that's what we need. There's so many questions. Congressman Meadows has mentioned them. John Solomon has mentioned them.

It's a raw intelligence. Maybe 50/50.\" But it became the bulk of information to apply for a FISA warrant, which says at the top \"verified.\" And he's saying to us it's an unverifiable document.

Because after two-plus years of lying and conspiracy theories, their ratings are in the sewer and with all due respect, they're probably trying to just get them up. I honestly -- you can't trust a word they say. Anyway joining us now, we have former Secret Service agent and of course friend of the program, Dan Bongino with us; nationally syndicated radio talk shows Larry Elder. Larry, I see you laughing. I'm sorry, there's nothing they say even a compliment at this point that makes up for the lies and conspiracies of two years -- two plus years."

      "utterance": "You're absolutely right and I think, Sean, the reason they praise Trump -- well, three reasons. The first is obviously, it was a great speech. Well-delivered, sincere, passionately delivered and respectfully delivered. The second reason is they've defined him so low they think of him as a caricature, as a moron, as a boot. So the bar is so low all he has to do is show up on time, Sean, not blow his nose on his tie and he has met their expectations. The third reason is just as you pointed out. Ratings. How many meetings do you think CNN and MSNBC all have had since the Mueller report came down and their ratings have sunk like a stone? They know they've got to reposition themselves to be slightly more fair, maybe just maybe, we ought not treat Donald Trump as the combination of Hitler, Stalin and Mao. Maybe we ought to treat him as less than a combination of those three gentlemen and that's what they're doing right now."

      "utterance": "No, they do, but to think about this speech and I think you kind of addressed it in your mini monologue there, Sean, was it was a pretty flawless speech. In a situation where there's obvious bipartisan agreement that these are -- that this was our greatest generation, so there's really nothing political. Because remember Acosta and Scarborough, they are political figures. These are not media figures. If you believe that, seek professional help. I'm sorry. You've misinterpreted the situation. They're politicians. But there's no political victory for them, Sean. None to be had. In a relatively flawless speech in a situation everybody agrees is recognizing the greatest among us, so what's the harm in it? They just say, \"Oh yes, Trump did a nice job,\" and then tomorrow, they'll be back to promoting the collusion hoax like they usually do."

Tell your audience, \"You know, we screwed up and we're going to fix things and we're going to really try and do the news now.\" They just double down on the next thing. You know, \"Oh let's just -- let's go for a fifth investigation. Let's look into Trump's taxes now. Let's change focus and start a new conspiracy.\""

They're going to go on to something else, but they're watching the same polls you and I are watching and they're saying that the majority of the American people do not want him impeached. The majority of the American people want to move on and want to deal with things that concern their lives and they've got to reposition themselves, otherwise, the ratings will still continue to fall."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Sean, these attacks were designed to cripple the U.S. economy and a captured ISIS fighter who is a Canadian citizen says leaders of the terror group chose him because he was not known by his government to be an ISIS fighter, which gave him a better chance to get on board an airplane. The terror suspect says the plan was for him to use false passports and ID's to get on a flight from Syria to Puerto Rico and then on to Mexico where a New Jersey man would smuggle him across the border into the United States and up to New York. He was then to get a job at a bank or financial institution, get behind the company's firewall and sabotage it. The International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism which spoke to the captured ISIS fighter says quote, \"We often hear about terrorists trying to enter the southern border in political debate, but I rarely have come across a real case. It surprised me to hear this was a real plot by ISIS to exploit our southern border.\" Experts add that it's scary to think what an insider can do to a company because there are very few limits on the damage a rogue employee can cause -- Sean."

You know, when there is such an attack, God forbid, or when other people are killed, one of the people that call walls immoral and people like Bozo Robert Francis who want to tear down the wall, when do they get blamed for what happens? Now as today marks the 75th anniversary of D-Day, well, the activist news media naturally, well, they're using the event as an opportunity to push climate change and their agenda. Take a look."

The danger I see and I say this as a parent, all of us have kids at this table, is our kids learn more about climate change than they do about American history and Bill Nye is actually really popular with kids. My kids actually ran into him in D.C. They saw him in the Capitol and they knew exactly who he was. So he has a lot more influence than you think and especially because our education system doesn't teach American history, they actually think he has some power."
