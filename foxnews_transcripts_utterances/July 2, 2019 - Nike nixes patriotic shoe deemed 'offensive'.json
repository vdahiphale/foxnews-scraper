The Trump campaign is launching a digital campaign an app that manager Brad Parscale, who's joining me exclusively in just a moment, says will create an army of 2 million volunteers to get out the vote. They also have spent more than $14 million on Facebook ads. That is more than the campaigns of Harris, and Warren, and Gillibrand, and Sanders, and Biden, and Klobuchar, and Buttigieg by some estimates even if you combine them. All of this from a president who according to his campaign manager, one last time utilizing just a plain, a cell phone, and Twitter.

And then, we can determine where they are, we can -- nothing's stronger for President Trump, to know it's a voter than a donation today. So, we can model off that we know where they are. And so, that's how they are. We don't look at them like this is how this person, that type of person. We model off that data, and then we find them later.

Tens of millions of people that will vote for President Trump. You know, only about 70 percent or so the population turns out to vote. We need to find those people, we need to get them to show up and get them to vote. It's not about trying to -- you know, go out there and try to -- you know, to find some voter and change his mind, it's about getting the ones that support the president now, and get them to show up to the polls and vote. And I think they're doing that right now by donating."

It was difficult sometimes to get all of them mobilized and to get the army of Trump as we call them, moving into households like to door-knocking and doing things. When 2020 at the opportunity of the money now, we have -- we can build out tools and like an app that we've gone their phone. Now, we're looking at 1.7 to 2 million volunteers. Now, we can get them as data mining crews. Get them as they get in events. Check it in like almost like you're checking in for a flight. Get them to talk about, you know, neighborhood watch parties. We can mobilize these people now to help us be the army that helps turn out the vote, and nothing's stronger than your next-door neighbor coming over knock and saying, hey, I know you're Trump supporters, go a vote."

It wasn't for him and the changes have been made the cost to be skyrocketing drug prices would be skyrocketing. He -- with all that he wants the help of Congress through his own administration, he's able to stabilize this market. This president understands what the American people need.

I have a -- I have a daughter in college myself, and it's a -- it's an expensive thing. And we're going to have to deal with that issue.

But let's make no mistake, nobody on either side, no Democrat, no Republican should think all the energy lies on their side. We have seen both in fundraising and in polling that this electorate is as energized today as it was in -- on Election Day 2016. On both sides of the aisle. Collectively, Democrats are raising a ton of money and they're spending a ton of money. Collectively, there -- they're right there with the president. But they've got a very competitive primary they've got to get through first. The one thing that was really interesting to me. And I always look not just at what they raised, but how they spend it. What Brad said there that I found really interesting was head mitted they are not interested in persuasion. They are not out there looking to spend any of these resources on trying to win over people who are undecided. They are interested in just turning out the Trump base. And that gives Democrats an opportunity. If the president's campaign is only going to be focused on the base --"

The Democrats have a nominee or are going into a convention with a likely nominee or come out of a convention finally with a nominee because if the Trump campaign continues to raise money at this base and save the money, they will have a very large war chest to fight the general election campaign. I think Mo puts his finger on something. I'm not certain I necessarily agree with it. If the Trump campaign's attitude is all we've got to do is out of 100 million people, who are likely to vote for Trump, all we got to do is do mechanical things to get them to get out to vote. Then I would agree with Mo that Democrats have got an opening. But I got a little bit more out of what Brad said. What I heard was, we got to go out there and convince these people that it's who are inclined to vote for Trump, who sort of leaning his direction. We've got to come -- we got to get them committed to turning out to vote for him. That -- he may not like the word persuasion, but that necessarily involves persuading them to and on two fronts. First of all, persuading them that they've got to turn out and vote. And second of all, persuading them to act on their instincts that they want to go for Donald Trump. He did that in 2016. At the end of the campaign, the people who broke at the last minute in the 2016 campaign broke for Donald Trump, and that was because they were running whether they admitted it or not, a campaign of persuasion."

The most serious of those charges was the murder of a wounded ISIS prisoner in Iraq in 2017, not guilty on that charge, the jury said. Two other charges of attempted murder, firing at Iraqi civilians, an elderly man, and a young Iraqi woman from a sniper position, not guilty on both of those charges. In fact, the only charge on which Chief Edward Gallagher was found guilty was the charge of posing for a picture with that wounded ISIS fighter.

They fought us for months on this. They said there was no crisis. We asked for a vote in the House 17 times, they refused to do it. You know, and it's funny. Castro puts this video about it, AOC talks about these things. I don't see them offering up any other space in their own homes, right? They're not offering a better solution. They're not saying, hey, why don't we put them all up at a hotel. They don't say that. What they really want is no enforcement. This is -- this is the crux of it. They don't talk about what the actual problem is which is tens of thousands of people coming across and overwhelming our system, OK. And then they have to answer the question should we have a system at all, and they say no. Well then, what is the point of even having a border? Why even have customs agents at airports, any kind of management over who comes in and out of our country. They don't want to answer these tough questions because in the end, they want open borders."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "That's the -- that is the core issue because there is a lot of loud voices attacking each other. The thing is she signed this contract when she was so young. And she is beholden to it. But it must be really unsettling for her to realize that somebody she doesn't even like now controls her legacy and all of her music. So she is using this sort of as an opportunity to encourage young artists to better protect themselves while negotiating. But this is really common because labels take a chance on young celebrities, young talent. They don't know if they're going to be successful or not. So, they ask for a lot in the beginning."

      "utterance": "Yes. And we've seen this with The Beatles. We saw it with Michael Jackson owned the Beatles catalog. We've seen it with Prince who changed his name basically to get out of this coming. But she is -- is she becoming more increasingly activists, you know, she come out in terms -- politically recently. You know, are we watching sort of a change in her?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",

    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "So, I did kind of notice that as well. She is sort of taking the feminist stance on this. And I kind of sympathize with her here. Because it is unfair that she could -- she did say that she could have bought back her music. But I thought that the deal was totally wrong. She would have to re-sign with her old record label and sort of give them one album for every album that she wanted back. So, I sympathize with her but she is certainly taking a more activist tone."

Coming up next, Nike faces a mountain of criticism for pulling a patriotic shoe after pressure from some who find the flag offensive. Jesse Watters doesn't find the flag offensive and he joins me now for a special Tuesday cameo of Tuesdays with Watters. Hey, Jesse."

After endorser and former NFL player Colin Kaepernick picked up the phone and complained that the original Ross flag was offensive because of its connections with the era of slavery in the United States. The company wants retailers to send the shoes back saying in a statement, quote, \"Nike made a decision to halt distribution of the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July based on concerns that it would unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday.\" Now a special edition, Tuesday edition of Wednesdays with Watters, we can't wait so we had him in on Tuesday.

      "utterance": "Too much power if you ask me. I mean, Nike is now anti-American company. They -- the only reason they make money, though, is because of America because of equality and justice and the American way. And maybe they think there can be profitable by being like this. But I just think it's dangerous. Because Colin Kaepernick comes in, makes a phone call, is offended, the majority of the country doesn't believe that. Yes, slavery was a stain. Yes, America was flawed. I have tons of flaws. You are flawless, Martha. But most people have flaws."

      "utterance": "Right. And they have the right to do that as a company. But now they are multinational conglomerate. They are less American. There is a line though between social justice and anti-Americanism. And I think they are crossing that line. A lot of people are really upset about this. This is our founding.

People start to think about smaller things like the military parade and being offended by that. But I think in general this country is very patriotic. Maybe people have different belief of what is patriotism is. But you know, the first thing that happens when this country suffers in any way from a disease, from an attack, and anything that we can rally around, that will go right back up to the healthy 70 percent."
