Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene will be here a little later on in the show to discuss it. Also, what can be taking the place of the tedious entertainment industry award shows this season? Raymond Arroyo has the big reveal and Seen and Unseen. But first, the monsters they created. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, in 1994, after getting wiped out in the midterms, Bill Clinton knew that the only way to guarantee a Democrat win again was to move to the middle. BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I also called the leaders of the next Congress, Senator Dole and Congressman Gingrich, to tell them after this hard fought campaign that we are ready to work together, to serve all the American people in a non-partisan manner.",

Of course, when Obama then followed Bush, he did some pretty liberal stuff as we know, like Obamacare. But he was actually a talented politician at least. Obama couldn't do everything the hard left wanted, but they believed he would lay the groundwork for a massive expansion of federal power. And then after Democrats lost in 2016 with Hillary, they just went totally bananas. By 2020, the party could not resist throwing in with its most radical elements. They worked with the press and corrupt forces inside our own government to hound Trump with relentless and baseless investigations. And, of course, leveling all these ridiculous accusations. The left salivated the prospect of impeachment and conviction. They were committed to winning by any means necessary. When it became obvious in 2020 that Joe Biden, their hologram candidate, couldn't inspire any political excitement or energy himself, they had to find that energy somewhere else. And find it, they did, in BLM, the teachers unions, the Greta Thunberg climate crowd, COVID fear mongers, the squad. You know, the Graeme. Suddenly Democrats who campaigned as moderates, were spouting the lingo of diversity, equity and inclusion, vaccine mandates, build back better in the elimination of the filibuster. They're now stuck with these crazy hard-left policies and toxic people issuing unrealistic demands. And then when moderates like Joe Manchin don't play along, they're torn to shreds by the squad.",

Americans don't care what he says, his own party doesn't really care what he says; other countries, they certainly don't care what he says.

And so you're right, that Biden can't really do anything, because he is beholden to some of these extremist groups. I mean, he may want to divorce from these teachers unions, because of the problems they've caused in Virginia. They were responsible for a Republican sweep of all three statewide offices, which is amazing for Virginia. But they also give like $700 million a year to the Democratic Party in political funding and activism. They are the primary constituent group that are delegates to the Democratic Convention. They are the Democratic Party. So even though they're making it hard to get votes from normal Americans, there's not that much he can do.

Now, the reports coming out of the city of 13 million people are horrific, and should have every U.S. elected official questioning this decision to send our athletes to the upcoming Beijing Games. Now, for starters, some Xi'an residents aren't allowed to leave their homes. No one is allowed to leave the city without special permission. And one resident wrote on Chinese social media, \"Can't leave the building, and it's getting more and more difficult to buy food online.\" Another lockdown victim ominously wrote, \"To be honest, I don't think COVID is scary. I think having no food to eat is my biggest threat.\" But what's really disturbing are reports of critically ill people being turned away from hospitals. Sky News is reporting that, \"one woman put in a call for help out online after her father suffered a heart attack, but was initially refused care as he came from a medium-risk location despite having a negative PCR result.\" But this next account shared by the AP is perhaps the most distressing. It's about a pregnant woman who felt pains in her stomach on New Year's Day, but was not allowed into a hospital. She waited outside the hospital on a pink plastic stool until she started bleeding. She was finally led into the hospital after medical workers saw the blood, but the fetus was already dead. Why would we prop up a regime that operates this way that treats its own citizens this way? Why would we give them cover and the benefit of our presence? Moreover, how can we trust the CCP to care for and protect our athletes? The answer is, we can't. We shouldn't. Joining me now is Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State, Fox News contributor. Mr. Secretary, these Olympics are poised to be a massive PR coup for President Xi.

This whole thing is absolutely ridiculous. I'm here in Washington D.C., Laura, and the reason why I'm here is because I think January 6th is an important day. And I'm willing to talk about the real things that happened that day because I think the American people deserve the truth.",

Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene will be here a little later on in the show to discuss it. Also, what can be taking the place of the tedious entertainment industry award shows this season? Raymond Arroyo has the big reveal and Seen and Unseen. But first, the monsters they created. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, in 1994, after getting wiped out in the midterms, Bill Clinton knew that the only way to guarantee a Democrat win again was to move to the middle. BILL CLINTON, 42ND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I also called the leaders of the next Congress, Senator Dole and Congressman Gingrich, to tell them after this hard fought campaign that we are ready to work together, to serve all the American people in a non-partisan manner."

Of course, when Obama then followed Bush, he did some pretty liberal stuff as we know, like Obamacare. But he was actually a talented politician at least. Obama couldn't do everything the hard left wanted, but they believed he would lay the groundwork for a massive expansion of federal power. And then after Democrats lost in 2016 with Hillary, they just went totally bananas. By 2020, the party could not resist throwing in with its most radical elements. They worked with the press and corrupt forces inside our own government to hound Trump with relentless and baseless investigations. And, of course, leveling all these ridiculous accusations. The left salivated the prospect of impeachment and conviction. They were committed to winning by any means necessary. When it became obvious in 2020 that Joe Biden, their hologram candidate, couldn't inspire any political excitement or energy himself, they had to find that energy somewhere else. And find it, they did, in BLM, the teachers unions, the Greta Thunberg climate crowd, COVID fear mongers, the squad. You know, the Graeme. Suddenly Democrats who campaigned as moderates, were spouting the lingo of diversity, equity and inclusion, vaccine mandates, build back better in the elimination of the filibuster. They're now stuck with these crazy hard-left policies and toxic people issuing unrealistic demands. And then when moderates like Joe Manchin don't play along, they're torn to shreds by the squad."

So the monsters nourished by his enfeebled administration are devouring everything around them and doing enormous damage in the process. Now, take the teachers unions, for example.

This isn't a hard-left country. They're not going to be able to convince voters to dump the Electoral College, make DC a state, get rid of capitalism, or eliminate prisons, not going to happen. This isn't the Biden administration, though. Is it really? It's the MSNBC administration. As right now, for all intents and purposes, Biden is a lame duck president. Americans don't care what he says, his own party doesn't really care what he says; other countries, they certainly don't care what he says. And can anyone in good faith really say, he's going to get better with age? If he can't remember the current date or the names of his own cabinet members now, how the heck is he going to sound in 2024? And here's my prediction. A GOP win in November will not force any Democrat introspection (inaudible) Bill Clinton in 1994. It's just going to harden their opposition, and deepen their commitment to rules changes, to ensure they never lose power again. The monsters are too strong now. It will take an Electoral tsunami in 2024 to wipe them out. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, Fox News contributor and senior editor at The Federalist; and Phil Kerpen, president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. Mollie, the left unleashed a series of Frankensteins on the country. They needed that energy and the passion going into 2020. And now, they've completely lost control of them."

The problem for the Democratic Party is that a lot of these radical policies are more and more alienating for normal Americans. And so you're right, that Biden can't really do anything, because he is beholden to some of these extremist groups. I mean, he may want to divorce from these teachers unions, because of the problems they've caused in Virginia. They were responsible for a Republican sweep of all three statewide offices, which is amazing for Virginia. But they also give like $700 million a year to the Democratic Party in political funding and activism. They are the primary constituent group that are delegates to the Democratic Convention. They are the Democratic Party. So even though they're making it hard to get votes from normal Americans, there's not that much he can do. They've been beholden to identity politics, that is - that kind of racism of identity politics is very noxious to most Americans, but not in the Democratic Party.

They said that when you close schools, you approximately double the risk that a child would contract COVID, because they're in totally unstructured environment. They act like, when you close a school, the children go and they disappear into a closet and interact with no one, rather than being out in the community and interacting with lots of people, which is what actually happens. So this is contrary to all of the science. Even if the only thing you care about is COVID, which is still some elements that are left in this country.

He supposedly wrote a piece in The New York Times saying, \"The spread of disinformation, especially on social media must be addressed. We must reform these platforms, corporate America and religious community should encourage efforts to counter disinformation.

But how come it is that you can be - if you're a Democrat, you can push these lies, you can use - you can undermine the country, you can say that the people don't get to elect a president if it's Republican. And that's fine. Nobody has a problem with it, no matter how damaging it is to the country. And yet, we're all supposed to drop everything in response to just one of the many riots that struck the country in the last - you know, in the year preceding the last year. The left rioted at the White House, at federal courthouses. They burned cities down, they destroyed buildings, Police precincts. They refused to accept the 2016 election for years. And now, they want to make hay out of this. I think, because the Democratic Party is struggling so much, even though it controls the Senate, the House, the presidency. It's not - its policies are so awful, that they're going to war using this as an excuse. And they're even saying, that if a Republican is elected in the years to come, that that will not be legitimate.

Now, the reports coming out of the city of 13 million people are horrific, and should have every U.S. elected official questioning this decision to send our athletes to the upcoming Beijing Games. Now, for starters, some Xi'an residents aren't allowed to leave their homes. No one is allowed to leave the city without special permission. And one resident wrote on Chinese social media, \"Can't leave the building, and it's getting more and more difficult to buy food online.\" Another lockdown victim ominously wrote, \"To be honest, I don't think COVID is scary. I think having no food to eat is my biggest threat.\" But what's really disturbing are reports of critically ill people being turned away from hospitals. Sky News is reporting that, \"one woman put in a call for help out online after her father suffered a heart attack, but was initially refused care as he came from a medium-risk location despite having a negative PCR result.\" But this next account shared by the AP is perhaps the most distressing. It's about a pregnant woman who felt pains in her stomach on New Year's Day, but was not allowed into a hospital. She waited outside the hospital on a pink plastic stool until she started bleeding. She was finally led into the hospital after medical workers saw the blood, but the fetus was already dead. Why would we prop up a regime that operates this way that treats its own citizens this way? Why would we give them cover and the benefit of our presence? Moreover, how can we trust the CCP to care for and protect our athletes? The answer is, we can't. We shouldn't. Joining me now is Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State, Fox News contributor. Mr. Secretary, these Olympics are poised to be a massive PR coup for President Xi. And yet, we're plowing right ahead."

We were sitting in some really high up seats at the LA Coliseum. I love this event. But your point's well taken. We shouldn't prop up Xi Jinping. This will become known as the genocide Olympics, what's taking place in western China is nothing short of genocide. We shouldn't forget too, this virus that you were talking about the beginning your show came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, almost certainly that is this virus was foisted on the world. And then second, not only we're propping up one of the greatest human rights violating leaders in all of recorded history. But we're putting our athletes in a very difficult place. Imagine one of them wants to say something about Tiananmen Square, or they want to talk about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, I promise you the chance of them getting their exit visa will be low. And those athletes should all know too that Beijing is the most surveilled city in the world, whether it's their cell phones, or their iPads, or whatever it is. It's something they're saying to someone else, you can bet that the Chinese Communist Party will be able to track everything they do, every place they go, and everything they say and they will record it.

This all came from the Chinese Communist Party They should be held accountable for each of these things, and they should not be permitted to benefit from the glory of the Olympic movement."

And he's going to be sitting there in all his splendor in the stadium bragging that they were able to control COVID in their country, of course, by welding people into their apartments. And we're not sending diplomats there, though, Mr. Secretary. That'll show them. Does that make a difference in the end, that we're not sending diplomats there?"

The Hollywood Press Association has announced that they will have no celebrities accepting their Golden Globes, no press, and they have no celebrity presenters. Oh, and NBC is not broadcasting the ceremony, which I guess is a good thing since at this point it's likely to be the staff of the Beverly Hilton attending. The Grammys are also postponing their ceremony, citing COVID worries. But fear not, Laura. The January 6th Committee is ready to fill the primetime void."

Barnum than Warren Commission to my eye. And they need a lot of stars, so stay tuned for those subpoenas. We'll see what happens. In advance of any TV spectacular, Laura, or special event, the media often does puff pieces to whet the appetite. Remember, Barbara Walters used to interview celebs before the Oscars. Now, CNN is doing its own January 6th preshow, \"The Children of January 6th.\""

And Laura, as you have long reported -- and we've got to get to this, it's so important, and the CDC admits most masks afford no protection against COVID. Now \"USA Today\" is reporting that health officials warn that cloth masks have no effect against Omicron. NBC still wants your kids masked and ready."

You really want to make sure you have one that fits your child's face, and you want to layer the cloth mask over that mask. So the surgical mask goes on first, and then the cloth mask."

Laura, I read an interview with a researcher at children's hospital in Philly today. He said when kids get Omicron, the symptoms of the disease are so reduced, and the disease is not at all severe. So why do they want to multi-mask kids like this?"

And when you don't have a face shield and you're sitting next to them on an airplane, boy, the look they give you. Do you notice that, Raymond? How do you -- oh, great, I'm not sitting next to a fellow traveler with a face shield. It is all theater. None of it makes a difference unless you're wearing a real N95, and you can imagine how children would be able to deal with that."

She didn't want to run afoul of the store's mask mandate, so she created a mask using her dress. I hope the dress was multi-ply. Her chances of contracting COVID dropped, Laura, but her chances of catching a cold or an unwanted advance just doubled. They denied her service, by the way, but I think she'll have no problems getting ice cream if she really wants it."

OK, well, they should have just listened to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE in May of 2020. Raymond, great see you, as always. And democracy isn't imperiled because of what transpired on January 6th, but rather what the left is doing in response. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is here to explain in moments."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What do you think he meant by \"at any level,\" or \"otherwise criminally responsible\"? We can certainly speculate, but what's really important here is that Attorney General Merrick Garland is defending the mass surveillance state created by the government to monitor and punish political opponents. I don't care how much he said on the contrary today. This time it's being used against anyone who was anywhere near the Capitol building on January 6th, but next time, it could easily be you and your friends who are targeted. Joining me now is Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. Congresswoman, this is the most significant aftershock of January 6th, this expansion of government surveillance to punish political opponents."

      "speaker": "REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, (R-GA)",
      "utterance": "When I was listening to his statement just then, I was wondering does that apply to Antifa and BLM rioters? Most of their charges have been dropped. And all of those riots happened to the American people in their communities where they live, where private businesses were looted, police officers were attacked, federal courthouses were attacked. And I can't understand for the life of me why no one cares about communities in American cities, but yet they care so much about the riot at the capitol? I was there that day, Laura. I was in the chamber. I was very much what you would call a victim of that riot. It upset me greatly. I couldn't believe it happened. But what they're trying to do with the January 6th narrative should terrify all Americans because it is a true two-tiered justice system, and it shouldn't be happening in America."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, as we've said many times on this show, those who committed crimes should be punished, but something much more sinister is going on here at the prosecutorial investigative level. And to that point, it seems, Congresswoman, that Ray Epps isn't the only January 6th suspect who kind of mysteriously disappeared from the FBI's most-wanted list. \"The Washington Examiner\" is reporting tonight that an unidentified man wore an earpiece during the riot, and he was filmed carrying what appeared to be a concealed handgun on his left hip. He was pictured on the FBI's most-wanted list for over five months until he was removed without explanation on the same day \"The New York Times\" reported that an FBI informant was, indeed, at the Capitol on January 6th. Congresswoman, that's an interesting coincidence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, and I greatly appreciate your willingness to talk about these things. There's so many people in the media that are just following the January 6th committee narrative. I think there's a lot more that happened that day on January 6th, and it is appalling. Anyone that committed a crime, they deserve their day in court, and they should -- they've been charged, and they should be charged. But what you're talking about, like Ray Epps, why did I not see him in the D.C. jail when I went in and went on that tour that day, but I saw many people being held in there that have been held months on end, haven't seen their families, pretrial defendants held in solitary confinement, completely denied rights like haircuts and shaving, chapel, and medical services when they have issues, health issues that greatly need treatment? There's a lot of questions that need to be answered, and the January 6th committee is unwilling to ask the right questions. The FBI put people on their wanted list like Ray Epps, I think he was in the top 20, and then took him off. John Sullivan, who recorded Ashli Babbitt's death and then sold his videos to media companies, he has been charged. But he had a knife on him inside the Capitol, but yet at the same time, he's not being held in jail. There are so many issues here, like the man that was on the scaffolding ordering people to go into the Capitol. Where is that man? Who is he? And why hasn't he been charged? And then there are reports of people wearing earpieces, but not just one. I've seen reports of many people wearing earpieces. Who are they? And why were they wearing earpieces? And what exactly -- what was going on? Why wasn't the National Guard there? That's what I really want to know. I was a brand-new member of Congress, and the National Guard wasn't even called in, and Nancy Pelosi didn't give permission for them to be there that day."

But I'll tell you, if you put everybody on truth serum, they'd agree with us. The problem is the base voters are not having anybody tell them the truth, and they're the ones that are going to be misled and abused as they have been for so long."

    {
      "speaker": "GREENE",
      "utterance": "Of course he does, and Adam Schiff lied and lied to the American people with his Russian collusion witch-hunt. It's a complete scam. If Adam Kinzinger wants to be on truth serum, he needs to subpoena Ray Epps and call him before the January 6th committee. Why don't they subpoena his phone records and his banking records instead of worrying about innocent people that worked in Trump's administration or people that got a rally permit, legally got a rally permit for January 6th to use their First Amendment right. Adam Kinzinger is a complete joke and totally irrelevant to the GOP. He's completely serving the Democrats and hoping that he gets some kind of contract from MSNBC or CNN. This whole thing is absolutely ridiculous. I'm here in Washington D.C., Laura, and the reason why I'm here is because I think January 6th is an important day. And I'm willing to talk about the real things that happened that day because I think the American people deserve the truth."
