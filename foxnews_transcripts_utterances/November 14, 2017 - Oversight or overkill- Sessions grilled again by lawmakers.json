I made no response to him. Didn't acknowledge it, and you're accusing me of lying about that? I'd say that's not fair, Mr. Jeffries. I don't think it's right to accuse me of doing something wrong.

It's like putting into a trance listening to it. And you're thinking there's other really big news and investigations that we should be focusing on and talking about, and right now I don't think they made any leeway whatsoever in terms of Sessions. I mean, I don't see that they've scored any points or really got anything out of him. I think he had a certain sense of -- kind of moral outrage, a little bit of indignity, a little bit of OK, I know what you guys are trying to say, but what do you have against me.

But, I mean, the fact is that, you know, especially as attorney generals, the chief law enforcement officer of the country, his credibility is very important. And he had come before the senate earlier and indicated he had not had discussions with Russians of any kind. And then, subsequently we learned that he did have contact with Russians. And subsequently we learned that there were aides within the campaign who said they spoke to him about their contacts with Russians. So here he comes back, and I think the important thing today was to restore his own credibility. You know what? OK. Some of this did happen, but I didn't lie to you. I wasn't lying. OK, I know now that some of this has been found out in terms of court documents, testimony, or reveals, presentations to the congressional investigative committees, but it just not that critical in terms of saying that I lied to you. But, you know, so it's important for us as Americans to have faith -- sufficient faith in our public officials that they're not liars. That would be good. But the other thing that's going on here and I think it's really important to understand is the back story. That, yeah, the Russia investigation goes on and President Trump remains angry at Jeff Sessions, and that one of the theories out there right now is that Sessions could end up being the next senator from Alabama again."

To accuse him of being a traitor is preposterous. I think what's happening is the country is so bored by this, no one can even pay attention anymore. Papadopoulos was wet behind the ears.

This is just what we're doing. We're not saying that we were going -- there is no quid pro quo here for the Clinton Foundation if she were to become president that she's going to return the favor by reducing sanctions or whatever. I don't think there's ever been anything like that. Now I guess that there are enough people that believe that Uranium One and this decision that was decided by nine different departments, that which was one that perhaps maybe there's something there. And what Jeff Sessions is saying is that he asked the prosecution team at the justice department to look at the merits of the case. If the merits of the case warrant a special prosecutor, then he won't stand in the way of that. He is saying the president didn't push him into it. The calls upon him have been coming not just from the president but from Capitol Hill. You saw Jim Jordan his question is what it's going to take to get a special counsel. And Sessions is being very careful. He talked about literally doing it by the book because his answer is it's in the manual of the Department of Justice.

That he's going to follow it and go by the book. He is discussing the specifics in terms of how an investigation should take place, and also not ruling out a special counsel and future investigation. I think that's what Americans want to hear. To me he's not presenting like somebody who is a partisan person in terms of -- like we've seen, very politicized the office of, you know, the U.S. attorney that -- it's problem. It's really is when you see people like this and you say, OK, this guy actually wants to do a good job, and he wants to not be influence one way or the other. He wants to call it like he sees it.

We're hearing reports about him even signing high school girls' yearbooks when he's in his 30s. He allegedly banned from malls because he was trying to pick up teenagers. It just gets more and more gory and disgusting. And I feel terrible for the victims, if it's true, which it looks like -- these are very credible allegations as the house speaker said. Now, I think if you're someone on the far right or the right, you have to pick your battles. Is Roy Moore the hill you're ready to die on? I don't think so. I think there's a lot of other places you want to fight. I think sometimes you've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, and this might be one of those times. So I think everybody just kind of use your common sense here. This guy who's been convicted in the court of public opinion, do you want this guy representing Alabama in the Senate and representing your party?

But the bigger issue for the Republican Party overall is, given their experience in recent cycles with candidates who say things like legitimate rape and all the rest, it becomes toxic for the party. It suddenly becomes associated with the Republican brand. And from McConnell's point of view as the Senate majority leader, that's not good for Republicans. And I think that's what we're seeing now.

You want to spend 100 trillion to capture a fraction of a degree Celsius? Research shows that less than half that cash could rid the world of poverty, hunger, disease and pollution. Using that cash carelessly is homicidal, which could be why the U.N. is in love with it. By the way, Syria just joined the Paris Accords, and by the U.N.'s logic, that country is far more compassionate than us. So what if you gas your own people? At least that drives down the carbon footprint."
