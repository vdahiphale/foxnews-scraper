The 600 people that showed up aren't happy with economy.  But the numbers are so overwhelmingly strong from wages to the different types of people, the different classes that seem to be prospering to the amount of jobs, to the people who are no longer unemployed. I think it's 357,000 no longer among those who are -- not even unemployment, don't even show up at the unemployment ranks, but don't show up -- didn't show up, they've just showed up on those -- that weren't working at all. So things seem to be going in the right direction. I just think Democrats have so much more credibility if they say listen, things are going well in the economy, but here's my problem with the president. So if you don't acknowledge what we all see, we're not going to acknowledge what you think is legitimately wrong. And I get somewhat confused, if I'm Trump, though, I focus on independents.  He's got his base. He's never going to get the liberals, but those people in between. He's still under 40 percent approval with them and barely over that with the economy. He's got to convince them."

But it's obviously the case that people have strong objections to him and whereas the economy previously was a good measure of how a political candidate, especially a president seeking a second term was about to do.  In this case, it looks like it's nothing."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

The wage growth right now has been accelerated for the bottom half of workers, Emily.  You're seeing a lot of the wages rising for blue-collar workers, for middle-class workers. The wage acceleration is not as strong for the upper class."

      "utterance": "Which is why it's so difficult to reconcile that lack of consistent messaging of -- if the thriving economy was begun under President Obama, why did he then leave behind the middle class or how does he then not deserve blame for that? And that doesn't bode with the lowest -- the lowest middle class and having rising wages. To touch on what you said, too, you know, if I was President Trump, the reality is the economy is thriving. And therefore, I would not capitulate no matter how persuasive the Democrats might try to be on funding the infrastructure bill with raising any type of tax, including the gas tax. There's a bill right now in Congress, the gain act, which recognizes our $2 trillion in debt and lease assets among government agencies, and specifically the Department of Agriculture has $155 billion in non- guaranteed debt. So basically, we sell all of that off just like Congress did in 1986, and if Trump uses that savvy to fund this bipartisan bill that we've already agreed to, then there's no spinning the Democrats can do no matter how hard they try."

He has a lot of unforced digital errors. But what's going to happen is you have to measure how people feel about where they are right now versus how they feel about the president. And a lot of people, including people in the middle class, including some low income earners, they feel a lot better than where they were at in 2016.  And they don't like the president, but they can probably stomach four more years if that means four more years of economic growth if the Trump administration can make that argument. And it's really tough selling, you know, a whole basket of deplorable socialist policies that are going to cost American workers $60,000 per household if they implement any of these when people are enjoying increased wages, increased consumer confidence and much more --"

      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Right, and a couple of things going on with the tax plan in particular. This is where you're right, Juan. So the tax plan shows and the numbers don't argue and the Washington Post proves that about 80 percent of the country in all different levels has gotten some type of tax break, but the administration has done a good job getting the word out. With direct deposit, the advent of technology, we're not really getting our check, cashing it in, and go in. I mean, 596 last week, I'm not making 620. We kind of just let it all blend in. So we don't even know the tax cut we're getting and all those people saying said we weren't getting the returns we were. It turns out at the end of the day the returns were almost exactly the same after the early hesitation. I bring this in, if the Republicans are smart and truly want to get to a different era, and the president really feels two years were stolen from him because of this whole Mueller investigation, this is what I do, give Barack Obama credit. When he was Senator Obama and he kept his composure and he met with Paulson, and he met with Bernanke and he said, what's going on with the economy? How do we fix this? We've been here before. That's how he won the presidency, where McCain lost his temper, Obama kicked in to gear. But the make work project, making the most of the 800 billion is where the Republicans and Democrats separated. The Solyndras, the giving the money to the state and saying do your best. No shovel-ready projects where they broke. And the release of regulations of 22 a day or 22 a week have really lived up to expectation --"

He wrote a letter and, Jesse, and in the letter he said, look, not only am I'm not -- I appreciate the offer to come back and I'll come back if you go by the old rules, and you want to see an un-redacted version.

If they have an issue with what was redacted and the percentage compared to the length of the full report, that's the person that they need to take this up with.

Phil Knight, 70 something years old, with all the great moments he's witnessed and been a part of, he says he's never seen anything better than this. I think at 43 years old Wood has been through, and Trump cites the fact that he stayed with him the entire time. From the time he was 12 to 18 to 21 to its 30 to 40s. He says hang in there Tiger and Tiger appreciates loyalty through it. He doesn't mind saying, he is his friend. 43-year-old Medal of Freedom, I have no problem with that. People say it's too early, not really. A 43-year-old elite athlete, doing something that he's done, he's already had five lifetimes of play that we've all saw up front and center.

They did this with Kanye West, now they're trying to do this with Tiger Woods.
