      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We start tonight with a Fox News alert. Today, massive and great news. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped a whopping 1,290 points, and as the Dow, the S&P, and the Nasdaq all saw record high, highest single day point gains in American history. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, after a week of corona-related panic, lies, propaganda, misinformation, thankfully, the market is roaring back and in a big way. We have a full report coming up on the program tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, in 246 days, it's going to go like that, you are the ultimate jury. You will have a chance to once again shock the world and send President Trump back to the White House for four more years. But it needs to be very clear to every American and we will try to make it clear every night on this program and the Democrats, the media mob, they will stop at nothing. They will do anything. And I mean anything, to stop Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Their rage, hate Trump psychosis is even far worse than I thought, the level of derangement is off the charts and now, tonight, especially, I want you to pay very close attention as we prove our point because they are now using the natural fear of a virus as a political weapon. And we have all the evidence to prove it, a shameful politicizing, weaponizing of, yes, the coronavirus. Remember, first, Russia, Russia, Russia. Impeach, impeach, impeach. Obstruction, obstruction, whatever. Now, the left, the Democrats, the media mob, they are smearing the president and his administration over the spread of the coronavirus in beyond egregious ways. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The double standard and hypocrisy of the mob and the Democrats has never been worse. So, tonight, we ask you to pay very close attention as we prove this point to you. Now, the information we are giving you is not information you're going to find anywhere else, and it will expose yet again the absolute corruption, dishonesty, fraud and the political agenda of Democrats and the media mob - - well, their state run TV. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We start with smear number one. For days, the left has been claiming the president is not prepared to handle the disease effectively. Well, as a matter of fact, Biden, Bloomberg, the entire mob and the media, others said President Trump cut the funding to NIH and CDC. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That is 100 percent false. The exact opposite happened, funding actually went up. In fact, a recent study from Johns Hopkins University ranked the United States number one -- we're number one -- in the world at pandemic preparedness. And we are by far the most prepared. The next lie of the media mob and Democrats is the claim the president did not act quickly enough. That is a bald-faced lie. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's look at the truth that nobody else will report, and we have an actual timeline and you can follow along at home. It's like follow the bouncing ball. Now, this officially started believe it or not on December 30th, 2019. Not that long ago. We had a cluster of patients with pneumonia and this unknown province that was observed in Wuhan, China. Now, that was reported to the World Health Organization. It wasn't until January 7th that the virus, the coronavirus, was actually identified and isolated in these patients. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then, just three weeks later, on January 31st of this year, the president declared a public health emergency. That meant Americans returning from areas most impacted, they were subject to mandatory quarantine, two weeks of military bases. That's when the travel ban began. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Two days later, temporary travel ban went into effect for all non-U.S. citizens who recently visited China and my sources were actually in the room with the president made this decision on January 31, said, well, there are about 25 people in the room, no one agreed with the president to implement the travel ban, said that there'd be political consequences if he did but he did it anyway. And he did it in record time. Everyone else said maybe it's too early. He made the call. And my sources confirm to me tonight you can stop right there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This one early bold decision of this president likely prevented thousands and thousands of Americans from contracting this virus. Has anyone in the media mob told you do that? And meanwhile, it wasn't until February 11th that the World Health Organization officially named the virus. The president was way ahead of them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, a task force led by Trump's number two, Vice President Pence, is underway. It is filled with America's top scientists. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So far, thankfully, less than ten people in the country have died from this virus. Now, we need to put that in perspective. Let us compare this to H1N1, swine flu virus, as it's known. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this hit the U.S. in April of 2009. It wasn't until six months later, in October of 2009, after more than 20,000 Americans were hospitalized, more than 1,000 of our fellow citizens died, only then did President Obama and yes, quid pro quo Joe declared a national emergency -- after 20,000 of our fellow citizens hospitalized, more than 1,000 dead Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now do you remember at that time anybody in the media stirring up the type of hysteria as they are doing now? Do you remember the end of days predictions? Did the stock market take because of all the reckless lying and fearmongering? That did not happen in 2009. In fact, the market went up, as swine flu cases mounted. Pretty interesting. A tale of two presidents. On the one side, Obama-Biden, they get the white glove treatment from their willing accomplices and fellow radical stream socialist the Democratic Party. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On the other side, the mob in three weeks bludgeons President Trump, weaponizing this virus, to destroy him politically. One person at Yahoo! News even suggesting this could be Trump's Katrina. The Washington Post also openly wondering if it would become Trumps Katrina. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } New York Times hack Paul Krugman actually cheered. How do you cheer when we are losing money when the stock market fell? Twenty-five thousand. New York Times editorial, New York Times said this is the term virus, writing, if you're feeling awful, you know who to blame. By the way, as President Trump was literally reacting in record time, what were the Democrats doing to repair this country for the pandemic at the end of January and early February? Oh, they couldn't be bothered. Why question right they were consumed with their impeachment conspiracy theories hoax and witch hunt. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the final vote didn't take place on impeachment until February 12th, nearly two weeks after President Trump acted decisively with an aggressive plan frankly unprecedented to stop the spread of the coronavirus when he had his travel ban put in place. He did all this while he was being impeached. And when the president put in place travel ban, at that time, that guy, quid pro quo Joe called the president's travel ban and quarantine efforts, quote, part of a record of xenophobia and fearmongering. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Oh, so many more thousands of people -- how many more would've contracted the virus? We didn't quarantine people that came in from China, or citizens, for two weeks and we didn't have a travel ban. Sorry. You're part of the world sick. You can't get in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He did that three weeks. Biden, Obama, they waited six months in 1,000 people died, in 2009 and '10. Fake news CNN, what where they saying at the time with the travel ban? Well, they were promoting the potential stigma and fear that the travel ban would cause. And fake news CNN would have also been responsible if, in fact, the van wasn't in place and thousands and thousands of our fellow Americans contracted this disease. And they would be critical of Trump for doing that. And now, the Democrats and the mob, they are just outright lying. You got NBC News, fake news CNN, MSDNC, others, Cher, Hollywood, actually claiming that the president is calling the coronavirus a hoax. No, that's another complete lie. Instead the president called the weaponization and politicizing of the virus a hoax. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we have the tape to prove it. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They looked at what was going on with China. They didn't know how long those factories were going to be closed. Guess what we learned on Friday and over the weekend. The factories in China are opening back up. People are going back to work. So, you have a sense of how long a virus is going to cause a supply shock. We also see that stocks weren't massively -- they can only go down for so long before people go to the world is going to recover from this virus in my goodness, I missed the last run up in Apple, I missed the last run of over here. I'm going to get in on it. There's another important story that hasn't really been covered and that's -- we have this really complicated supply chains where we're dependent on these other countries like China, who's been trying to get us off those complicated supply chains? Who's been trying to wean us from China and has been ridiculed for it through this trade work? President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now we see why we may be don't want to be totally dependent on them because a virus that's under control in our country where we only have people dying for now, thank God, who were already vulnerable in their health for one reason or another. You have these other countries where it's running rampant and, you know, more healthy people are actually dying from this. Maybe you don't want to be dependent on the country for your supply chain, or for your medications. I mean, that's another huge story that the president has been on and that we've been covering. Why is China making our medication? Why aren't we in control of that anymore? These are things to follow up on. What do you think, Sean?",

The only person is actually putting physicians and scientists to lead this outbreak is the Trump administration.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We start tonight with a Fox News alert. Today, massive and great news. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped a whopping 1,290 points, and as the Dow, the S&P, and the Nasdaq all saw record high, highest single day point gains in American history. Now, after a week of corona-related panic, lies, propaganda, misinformation, thankfully, the market is roaring back and in a big way. We have a full report coming up on the program tonight. But, first, in 246 days, it's going to go like that, you are the ultimate jury. You will have a chance to once again shock the world and send President Trump back to the White House for four more years. But it needs to be very clear to every American and we will try to make it clear every night on this program and the Democrats, the media mob, they will stop at nothing. They will do anything. And I mean anything, to stop Donald Trump. Their rage, hate Trump psychosis is even far worse than I thought, the level of derangement is off the charts and now, tonight, especially, I want you to pay very close attention as we prove our point because they are now using the natural fear of a virus as a political weapon. And we have all the evidence to prove it, a shameful politicizing, weaponizing of, yes, the coronavirus. Remember, first, Russia, Russia, Russia. Impeach, impeach, impeach. Obstruction, obstruction, whatever. Now, the left, the Democrats, the media mob, they are smearing the president and his administration over the spread of the coronavirus in beyond egregious ways. The double standard and hypocrisy of the mob and the Democrats has never been worse. So, tonight, we ask you to pay very close attention as we prove this point to you. Now, the information we are giving you is not information you're going to find anywhere else, and it will expose yet again the absolute corruption, dishonesty, fraud and the political agenda of Democrats and the media mob - - well, their state run TV. We start with smear number one. For days, the left has been claiming the president is not prepared to handle the disease effectively. Well, as a matter of fact, Biden, Bloomberg, the entire mob and the media, others said President Trump cut the funding to NIH and CDC. That is 100 percent false. The exact opposite happened, funding actually went up. In fact, a recent study from Johns Hopkins University ranked the United States number one -- we're number one -- in the world at pandemic preparedness. And we are by far the most prepared. The next lie of the media mob and Democrats is the claim the president did not act quickly enough. That is a bald-faced lie. Let's look at the truth that nobody else will report, and we have an actual timeline and you can follow along at home. It's like follow the bouncing ball. Now, this officially started believe it or not on December 30th, 2019. Not that long ago. We had a cluster of patients with pneumonia and this unknown province that was observed in Wuhan, China. Now, that was reported to the World Health Organization. It wasn't until January 7th that the virus, the coronavirus, was actually identified and isolated in these patients. Then, just three weeks later, on January 31st of this year, the president declared a public health emergency. That meant Americans returning from areas most impacted, they were subject to mandatory quarantine, two weeks of military bases. That's when the travel ban began. Two days later, temporary travel ban went into effect for all non-U.S. citizens who recently visited China and my sources were actually in the room with the president made this decision on January 31, said, well, there are about 25 people in the room, no one agreed with the president to implement the travel ban, said that there'd be political consequences if he did but he did it anyway. And he did it in record time. Everyone else said maybe it's too early. He made the call. And my sources confirm to me tonight you can stop right there. This one early bold decision of this president likely prevented thousands and thousands of Americans from contracting this virus. Has anyone in the media mob told you do that? And meanwhile, it wasn't until February 11th that the World Health Organization officially named the virus. The president was way ahead of them. Now, a task force led by Trump's number two, Vice President Pence, is underway. It is filled with America's top scientists. So far, thankfully, less than ten people in the country have died from this virus. Now, we need to put that in perspective. Let us compare this to H1N1, swine flu virus, as it's known. Now, this hit the U.S. in April of 2009. It wasn't until six months later, in October of 2009, after more than 20,000 Americans were hospitalized, more than 1,000 of our fellow citizens died, only then did President Obama and yes, quid pro quo Joe declared a national emergency -- after 20,000 of our fellow citizens hospitalized, more than 1,000 dead Americans. Now do you remember at that time anybody in the media stirring up the type of hysteria as they are doing now? Do you remember the end of days predictions? Did the stock market take because of all the reckless lying and fearmongering? That did not happen in 2009. In fact, the market went up, as swine flu cases mounted. Pretty interesting. A tale of two presidents. On the one side, Obama-Biden, they get the white glove treatment from their willing accomplices and fellow radical stream socialist the Democratic Party. On the other side, the mob in three weeks bludgeons President Trump, weaponizing this virus, to destroy him politically. One person at Yahoo! News even suggesting this could be Trump's Katrina. The Washington Post also openly wondering if it would become Trumps Katrina. New York Times hack Paul Krugman actually cheered. How do you cheer when we are losing money when the stock market fell? Twenty-five thousand. New York Times editorial, New York Times said this is the term virus, writing, if you're feeling awful, you know who to blame. By the way, as President Trump was literally reacting in record time, what were the Democrats doing to repair this country for the pandemic at the end of January and early February? Oh, they couldn't be bothered. Why question right they were consumed with their impeachment conspiracy theories hoax and witch hunt. Now, the final vote didn't take place on impeachment until February 12th, nearly two weeks after President Trump acted decisively with an aggressive plan frankly unprecedented to stop the spread of the coronavirus when he had his travel ban put in place. He did all this while he was being impeached. And when the president put in place travel ban, at that time, that guy, quid pro quo Joe called the president's travel ban and quarantine efforts, quote, part of a record of xenophobia and fearmongering. Oh, so many more thousands of people -- how many more would've contracted the virus? We didn't quarantine people that came in from China, or citizens, for two weeks and we didn't have a travel ban. Sorry. You're part of the world sick. You can't get in. He did that three weeks. Biden, Obama, they waited six months in 1,000 people died, in 2009 and '10. Fake news CNN, what where they saying at the time with the travel ban? Well, they were promoting the potential stigma and fear that the travel ban would cause. And fake news CNN would have also been responsible if, in fact, the van wasn't in place and thousands and thousands of our fellow Americans contracted this disease. And they would be critical of Trump for doing that. And now, the Democrats and the mob, they are just outright lying. You got NBC News, fake news CNN, MSDNC, others, Cher, Hollywood, actually claiming that the president is calling the coronavirus a hoax. No, that's another complete lie. Instead the president called the weaponization and politicizing of the virus a hoax. And we have the tape to prove it. Take a look."

You may say different things about different candidates but when it comes time to put your money on the line, and we saw that, Paul Krugman, you mentioned him. He's the one who said the market was never going to recover on the night that President Trump was elected and lo and behold, much as we predicted overnight, it bounced back right away the next morning. And in fact it is all those records that we had seen since the president has been an office that drove the market lower at least in part last week. And what I'm saying is I actually talk to traders every day, I actually talked to people who are putting money on the line, unlike all of these other pundits on these other sites that sit there and, oh, the market is crashing. No. This is what traders are actually saying. The market can't go up, up, up. We had run up 17 percent without pulling back. So we were due for a pullback. They looked at what was going on with China. They didn't know how long those factories were going to be closed. Guess what we learned on Friday and over the weekend. The factories in China are opening back up. People are going back to work. So, you have a sense of how long a virus is going to cause a supply shock. We also see that stocks weren't massively -- they can only go down for so long before people go to the world is going to recover from this virus in my goodness, I missed the last run up in Apple, I missed the last run of over here. I'm going to get in on it. There's another important story that hasn't really been covered and that's -- we have this really complicated supply chains where we're dependent on these other countries like China, who's been trying to get us off those complicated supply chains? Who's been trying to wean us from China and has been ridiculed for it through this trade work? President Trump. Now we see why we may be don't want to be totally dependent on them because a virus that's under control in our country where we only have people dying for now, thank God, who were already vulnerable in their health for one reason or another. You have these other countries where it's running rampant and, you know, more healthy people are actually dying from this. Maybe you don't want to be dependent on the country for your supply chain, or for your medications. I mean, that's another huge story that the president has been on and that we've been covering. Why is China making our medication? Why aren't we in control of that anymore? These are things to follow up on. What do you think, Sean?"

You had a 78-year-old, Soviet style radical socialist who praises every murdering communist dictatorship around the world. And, of course, a line, pandering nanny state mayor who wants to take your guns, fly his plane but lecture us on global warming. Let all people get sick and I'm not give them coverage, and is actually talking about how he put the cops in only minority neighborhoods, only arrested minorities because that's where all the crime is. Then you've got Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren. Lied about her heritage, decline the academic letter for decades and get a cushy, high-paying job, then lying about the cost of her radical plan to take away your private health insurance. And let's be honest. Warren, she's probably done. She has no path denomination. She's hitching a wagon to Bernie and that'll be as clear as ever tomorrow. So guess what that?

Trump, he did it in three weeks. Here with reaction, Donald Trump Jr. Imagine that. It took them 20,000 Americans contracting the swine flu virus. Then, of course, 1,000 died.

I mean, this has been Trump's agenda from day one. So, unfortunately, the left is suffering from Trump derangement syndrome much more than they are from anything else that they can't even get these things out. They don't realize he acted decisively. They actually criticized him for his actions. You saw -- oh, he's being xenophobic. No, he just didn't want disease coming to America. Not xenophobia. OK? There's a big difference.

He was ahead of this and no matter what his response, there's going to be criticism.

He got NAFTA done and renegotiated. He got a trade deal done with China. We got unemployment at the lowest levels in recorded history for literally every demographic in this country. But they want to change that. We're not dealing with rational people. We're dealing with people who can't reset the Declaration of Independence. We are dealing with a candidate, leader probably Joe Biden who doesn't know what state he's in 50 percent of the time. Bloomberg spent $600 million trying to buy this election but he found out when he got on the debate stage two weeks ago, you know what? It's not so easy to do what Trump did.

I can get that done on health care by building on Obamacare with a Biden Medicare option in it. I can do this in terms of Ebola -- excuse me."

The president quarantined Americans within three weeks of actually identifying this as corona. We have identified it on January 7th. We've only first heard about it December 30th of last year, and within 3 weeks, we had a travel ban. He was criticized. We also put in place the other measures that he did. To me, record reaction. Do you believe as I do that thousands likely -- that prevented thousands from contracting this?"

      "utterance": "You know, I do believe, Sean, that the swift efforts by the Trump administration by containing the virus not allowing people coming into the United States is part of the reason why our numbers are so low in the United States as of now. I find it very interesting when I hear Vice President Biden say that you need scientists leading these efforts but less let's also not forget President Obama, his Ebola czar was actually a lawyer. And Obama also gave the quest to cure cancer to Biden, also both lawyers, not medical doctors. The only person is actually putting physicians and scientists to lead this outbreak is the Trump administration. They just announced today that they are having an Ambassador Birx joint, who is actually appointed by President Obama because she's an incredible scientist and physician and she's also joining Fauci. She is joining Redfield and now, Seema Verma is on and -- I mean, it's just incredible. He's put together this A-team. So, he is the one listening to scientists, listening to physicians and it's frustrating when I hear Biden say, you know, that the Trump administration has slashed cuts to the CDC. He did decrease some fundings to the CDC. What he did not decrease funding to was the infectious disease portion of the CDC. He cut administrative and wasteful programs. What he did do was actually increased funding for infectious diseases by 3 percent for 2021. So, all of this -- I think is just --"

Just when I thought we reached a new low after impeachment, their activities during the coronavirus, whether it is Michael Bloomberg or Joe Biden, two leading candidates for president, perpetuating myths on national television about CDC funding, perpetuating the myth that President Trump called the virus hoax, in fact a falsehood.

And, by the way, in the quest to expose Democratic corruption does not stop there. Republican Senator Ron Johnson has now officially notified the Senate Homeland Security Committee of his plans to seek a subpoena against a Hunter Biden-linked public affairs firm, yes, relating to zero experience Hunter making millions, Burisma Holdings. By the way, there's an official investigation that was announced in Ukraine. Here with reaction, author of the number one bestseller \"Witch Hunt\", FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, FOX News investigative reporter, Sara Carter, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist, investigative reporter, Kimberley Strassel. Sara, we start with you in the news. This is big, this judge's ruling. It's also big what's happening in Ukraine for I guess the leading candidate of the Democratic Party, Mr. Quid pro quo himself."

So, this is huge news. Secondly, as far as Hillary Clinton is concerned, this is the biggest news we've heard of yet. This is probably the biggest win for Judicial Watch, because Judge Royce Lambert, basically granted Judicial Watch the right to depose Hillary Clinton, Cheryl Mills, or close closest aide, and Paul Combetta. Remember, he was the I.T. specialist who worked on her private server. So, they're going to have a lot of questions that they will have to answer. And Judge Royce Lambert said we are not quite a let it slide by. You're not going to have it in written answer format. It's going to be in person question and answer. He wants all the answers as well."

During the course of her email scandal, she told lie after lie, five in all. Every time she got caught in a lie, she'd invent a brand-new one. Finally when it came time for FBI interview which was, the outcome was preordained and it was all choreographed and scripting, she said I don't recall 39 times. So, when she sits down for her deposition, Sean, I'm not optimistic she will feign amnesia, she will have a total memory loss akin to acute dementia. And I fear that will all simply be a waste of time."
