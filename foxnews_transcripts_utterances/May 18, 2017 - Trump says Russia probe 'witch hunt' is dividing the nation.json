You can see its effect not just in Fox News' wild success but among those to which there were no opposition to their views. Those outside the news may not have liked FNC, but their lives have also been improved by smarter analysis created by healthy competition. Roger created a more informed public by making our competition work for it, which probably that drove them nuts. The mark of an achievement is that you can't imagine the world before it. What was news like before Fox News? I remember it was a place where diverse opinion was scarce, were millions of patriotic Americans were ignored by a mainstream media that dominated by a world of frightened, dull witted conformity. That era died when Fox News was born. Personally, I wouldn't be sitting here if it weren't for Roger. He gave me a show in the dead of night called \"Red Eye\" even though he had actually met me first. What was he thinking? I'm just one of hundreds of stories like that. He was a man who saw something in all of us -- potential, talent, edge -- things that other people didn't see. We will always be grateful for that, but we saw something in him too, something will likely never see again. I'm going to start with you Dana, your thoughts?",

If you're interested and communications or television or you want to improve your own presentation style, Roger Ailes wrote a book called you are the message and it really is the one that you should, if you haven't read it yet, put it on your list or reread it, because it really gives you the best insight in how to be a good communicator.

I was so excited I bought my book and it was all marked up and I was so happy to have him sign it. To meet somebody that had such an incredible, form of impact on so many people's lives. I came over here and he took a chance on me and developed me from a prosecutor into a talent, he saw something in all of us, each of us has a unique story. What I really loved most about him as he was such a loyal person. He was very devoted to his employees whether you were on camera, off-camera, we all mattered. He cared about our families, what my father was dying he was there for me. He became a second father to me and I hope people understand that, because we all have different unique experience. This is a complicated life I think that he lived. He made me a better person. Certainly a better co-host and on-air talent, very good to my son, we share Sunday's -- it was all part of the family even though my parents have passed away and I have no family here.

But the advice is useless, because he's going to do what he's going to do. So, when you decided the comment this morning by Twitter, and again here, I mean, it's a new way to deal with a Special Counsel, I don't think that they realize how serious this actually is. They'd like to just say, oh, this is all fake. It might be. It could very well turn out to be that there is absolutely nothing there.

Instead of it being the right step, it will just be the first step. It won't be enough. We need more investigations. We needed more independents. But the thing is, you know, how many times a week counted this guy out, I counted him out. I don't know. Six hundred and 37 times during the campaign, I get a sense that Donald Trump is the opposite of like Bill Clinton. He is a creature that drives on the antagonism on the fight which is why you can't count them out. Cat has nine lives. He's like three cats. He has 27 lives. And that's why when I see him up there, I don't see somebody that really gives a damn which is I think kind of refreshing and refreshing to me and scary to his critics. That makes sense?"

So, that is one thing. In contacts and I hate to do this to Juan, but I want to just put this into perspective in terms of the other Obama scandals, you had people lying and dying and being bribed on countless occasions from IRS, to Benghazi to the Iran deal, to the Bergdahl trade, Hillary smashed blackberries with a hammer and deleted 30,000 emails that were under subpoena. And even on domestic terrorist attacks, the FBI could have prevented those things and then the President comes out and makes it about guns and Islamaphobia. So, in all those things, there was no Special Counsel and the media had no appetite. Here, I guess whatever you called this, so- called Trump, Comey, Russia scandal, no one died, no one lied, no one destroyed hard drives and there is a special counsel all of a sudden and the media is bloodthirsty for impeachment. So, until I see a scandal, I think right now it just looks like an investigation."

He's there. He's very smart as relates to foreign policy and National Security. I think he's a patriot. You know, very hardworking. So, I don't think he would be a bad choice.

I mean, the three amigos, McCain, Lindsey Graham, as Senator Lieberman on so many issues. So, he backed McCain against Obama that didn't sit well of course with the hardline politics and the Democratic Party.

Do you remember that first press conference when President Obama as to what enchants you about the White House? There was actual news happening that day. I do think President Trump is much more accessible to the press even though he gets frustrated with them, he punches them and they punch back.

If you think back to 2006 when Republicans lost all the seats in the midterm election during President Bush's second term, who led the Democratic effort for all those seats to be one? It was Rahm Emanuel. I think he absolutely understands politics and messaging very well. He is in the Midwest is not on one of the coastal states where he is cocooned. If the daily stories out of the White House weren't digging up all the oxygen in the room, I think the bigger story would be the Democrats six months, seven months after the election are still completely in disarray, they do not have a strong leader. They do not have a plan. They are running in all directions. They benefit from all of this Trump coverage so they can escape under the radar."

Because they are not resonating and speaking to their values come out to their pocketbook, to their dinner table at night to the gas in their car, to the job security that they hope and pray for, to be able to educate their children and they need to wake up, because this should have been an easy layup for them and it's not, instead Trump got it on a three-pointer shot."

He comes off as the pc police, they don't understand us, and he is like an anthropologist of studying some ancient tribe in order to gain their trust and trick them to sell them his land or something like that.

      "utterance": "Welcome back, so Roger Ailes passed away today. Roger had a huge effect on this country, on the news, on all of us around the table. In every building where a Fox News employee has worked or works today. But it wasn't just Fox News and its millions of viewers that benefited from Roger. All other news outlets were improved by him for he pushed them to rethink all of their biased views, he called them on it. Then sought to fight it with a profound idea that became a Fox News. You can see its effect not just in Fox News' wild success but among those to which there were no opposition to their views. Those outside the news may not have liked FNC, but their lives have also been improved by smarter analysis created by healthy competition. Roger created a more informed public by making our competition work for it, which probably that drove them nuts. The mark of an achievement is that you can't imagine the world before it. What was news like before Fox News? I remember it was a place where diverse opinion was scarce, were millions of patriotic Americans were ignored by a mainstream media that dominated by a world of frightened, dull witted conformity. That era died when Fox News was born. Personally, I wouldn't be sitting here if it weren't for Roger. He gave me a show in the dead of night called \"Red Eye\" even though he had actually met me first. What was he thinking? I'm just one of hundreds of stories like that. He was a man who saw something in all of us -- potential, talent, edge -- things that other people didn't see. We will always be grateful for that, but we saw something in him too, something will likely never see again. I'm going to start with you Dana, your thoughts?"

For me, I had never expressed my own opinion in public before I came here. I had been on television before. I was speaking on somebody else's behalf. I don't know what he saw inmate that I thought I could do this, I remember when we first started \"The Five\" six years ago, were talked about legalization of drugs, what do you think? I don't know. With some time and space to develop your career is actually developed here for me. I saw this George W. Bush doesn't think he would've been president if it hasn't been for Roger Ailes and the political consultancy that he provided for him and the humor. I would say this so I don't take up all the time. If you're interested and communications or television or you want to improve your own presentation style, Roger Ailes wrote a book called you are the message and it really is the one that you should, if you haven't read it yet, put it on your list or reread it, because it really gives you the best insight in how to be a good communicator. Its technology agnostic, it is about how to actually be the best communicator as you, my sympathies for his family."

Like \"the wizard of oz\".\" I want to tell you I think you're doing a great job on television, interested in coming to the Fox News channel. I was so excited I bought my book and it was all marked up and I was so happy to have him sign it. To meet somebody that had such an incredible, form of impact on so many people's lives. I came over here and he took a chance on me and developed me from a prosecutor into a talent, he saw something in all of us, each of us has a unique story. What I really loved most about him as he was such a loyal person. He was very devoted to his employees whether you were on camera, off-camera, we all mattered. He cared about our families, what my father was dying he was there for me. He became a second father to me and I hope people understand that, because we all have different unique experience. This is a complicated life I think that he lived. He made me a better person. Certainly a better co-host and on-air talent, very good to my son, we share Sunday's -- it was all part of the family even though my parents have passed away and I have no family here. My heart goes out to Beth and Zachary who was a lovely young man who's been raised incredibly well, bless him and his commitment to not only the channel and all of our lives and to this country."

He not only created the top cable news channel in America, but he also put powerful people in office I'm just as her talk about Mitch McConnell, he wouldn't be there without Roger Ailes the senate majority leader. His influence and power is so incredible, I do think you've got to discuss, he left here and very troubled circumstances. Terrible charges against him, it's just not the Roger I knew, not the Roger I loved. He was so great to me and my family and he persuaded my wife that I should come here back in 1996, 97 when I first signed a contract, just a great guy all around."

Fox has been my whole life and career the last couple years and it is unfortunate that he left here in conjunction with some of the charges, inappropriate behavior. I just want to say he is been a great father, great husband, I feel terrible for them and I wish them all the best and he is a very influential American."

He was the most generous open hearted man who prided himself on loyalty and that is exactly how I will remember him. Roger saw something in each and every one of us who work here at the Fox News channel. His camaraderie and positive attitude made this place thrive.

Immediately people began capturing this photo. Who tweeted, holy molly, it looks like Schumer and I are smoking reefer outside of wedding.
