If you just take it from the beginning, Hillary paid for the fake dossier filled with Russian lies. Then you have a Hillary donor who was the one that sent the FBI the tip about Papadopoulos.

Harry Reid then turns around and writes a letter to James Comey urging him to open investigation into the Trump campaign. At the same time, the Obama chief of staff at the White House, Dennis McCullough, had been talking and had been briefed by the counter intelligence division of the FBI about the Trump campaign investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And from what we believe, he was urging it to move forward. So the briefing from Brennan to Reid was then leaked and wound up in the Isicoff article. The Isicoff article was used as a justification for the one on our list (ph) spying on Carter Paige. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's funny because Carter Paige has never been charged with a crime and was an FBI informant for many, many years. So James Comey takes this information and brings it to the FISA court judge. It's all unverified and unsubstantiated, the dossier as we've been over, and uses the Isicoff article as well. And as this is all happening, the FBI agents text and they say here we go. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So the allegation is that -- that they have, through all of these people, laid the ground work and laid the legitimacy for the surveillance on the Trump campaign. So, after Trump's elected, James Comey then briefs the president on the salacious dossier, and that same day CIA Director under Obama, Brennan leaks the information to CNN. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So when all these congressional investigators start asking questions and asking for documentation, they get stonewalled by the FBI and the DOJ, I mean, the coordination's amazing, if only Republicans could coordinate as effectively as the Democrats.",

But I got one beef, he claims he was fired because he opposed privatizing the bureaucracy, claiming the private sector couldn't handle these types of patients. But how do we know that? The difference between public and private is what enabled the V.A. tragedy in the first place. The difference was accountability. In the free market, there are consequences to actions. If you suck, you suffer. You go out of business. In the public sector, there's often no real costs to your blunders, which is why when things are bad, it takes years to fix them like the V.A. But where there is accountability, there are standards. If you want evidence, look around you. You live in the greatest country the world's ever seen and it's one built on competition, which rewards the competent and punishes it's opposite. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The market works faster in eradicating problems, because it can't put up with them.

By bashing privatization without any proof, Shulkin defends a system that's not as good as he is. So maybe let's try a new approach. If it doesn't work, at least the free market won't try to hide it. So Dana, I think Shulkin did do a good job, but he was starting at less than zero at the V.A. which means it's like taking -- like let's say you become coach of an 0 and 16 (ph) NFL team and you get it to three and 13.",

And that the V.A. had developed specializations and even innovations in how you handle these issues.

And by the Dana, in regard to people who live in rural areas distant from V.A. hospitals, they already give out vouchers and so forth.

He doesn't want to hear about the argument, he doesn't want to hear about the debate. So Shulkin writes in his op-ed, hey, this is not an honest conversation, this is about pursuing a political agenda.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" New developments on the Republican push for an investigation of allege FISA abuses by the FBI and DOJ in the Russia probes. The internal watch dog of the Justice Department will examine accusations of misconduct in the process to obtain a warrant to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Paige. Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation comes as a request of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and congressional Republicans. Judge Napolitano thinks he will find wrongdoing."

But he will find a treasure trove of abuses going to FISA, getting warrants when the law did not justify it. All right Kimberly, so nobody has actually read -- I think even Nunez admitted, congressman from California on the Intel Committee, he hasn't actually read the underlying documents. Michael Horowitz is the Inspector General at the DOJ, now says that he is going to look into this as well. He's got a lot on his plate to investigate, but has the confidence of Attorney General Sessions as well as members on (ph) the Hill on the Republican and Democratic side.

But I'm always interested in who is proffering the evidence, where they're getting it from, from what sources, because we've seen some of these abuses in the past in terms of information that was proffered that really wasn't accurate, that wasn't prohibitive (ph), that wasn't verified.

This is (ph) during the Obama administration."

If you just take it from the beginning, Hillary paid for the fake dossier filled with Russian lies. Then you have a Hillary donor who was the one that sent the FBI the tip about Papadopoulos. So these Trump hating FBI agents opened up the counter intelligence investigation. Then all of a sudden John Brennan, the CIA Director under President Obama comes along and briefs Harry Reid about the dossier. Harry Reid then turns around and writes a letter to James Comey urging him to open investigation into the Trump campaign. At the same time, the Obama chief of staff at the White House, Dennis McCullough, had been talking and had been briefed by the counter intelligence division of the FBI about the Trump campaign investigation. And from what we believe, he was urging it to move forward. So the briefing from Brennan to Reid was then leaked and wound up in the Isicoff article. The Isicoff article was used as a justification for the one on our list (ph) spying on Carter Paige. It's funny because Carter Paige has never been charged with a crime and was an FBI informant for many, many years. So James Comey takes this information and brings it to the FISA court judge. It's all unverified and unsubstantiated, the dossier as we've been over, and uses the Isicoff article as well. And as this is all happening, the FBI agents text and they say here we go. So the allegation is that -- that they have, through all of these people, laid the ground work and laid the legitimacy for the surveillance on the Trump campaign. So, after Trump's elected, James Comey then briefs the president on the salacious dossier, and that same day CIA Director under Obama, Brennan leaks the information to CNN. So when all these congressional investigators start asking questions and asking for documentation, they get stonewalled by the FBI and the DOJ, I mean, the coordination's amazing, if only Republicans could coordinate as effectively as the Democrats."

But I got one beef, he claims he was fired because he opposed privatizing the bureaucracy, claiming the private sector couldn't handle these types of patients. But how do we know that? The difference between public and private is what enabled the V.A. tragedy in the first place. The difference was accountability. In the free market, there are consequences to actions. If you suck, you suffer. You go out of business. In the public sector, there's often no real costs to your blunders, which is why when things are bad, it takes years to fix them like the V.A. But where there is accountability, there are standards. If you want evidence, look around you. You live in the greatest country the world's ever seen and it's one built on competition, which rewards the competent and punishes it's opposite. The market works faster in eradicating problems, because it can't put up with them. Shulkin did a good job, but he did a good job after a really bad job by a bureaucracy immune to competitive pressure. By bashing privatization without any proof, Shulkin defends a system that's not as good as he is. So maybe let's try a new approach. If it doesn't work, at least the free market won't try to hide it. So Dana, I think Shulkin did do a good job, but he was starting at less than zero at the V.A. which means it's like taking -- like let's say you become coach of an 0 and 16 (ph) NFL team and you get it to three and 13."

Privatization's been a long term discussion with regard to how we treat our veterans in terms of their medical needs. And what's come up in the debate, and believe (ph) me, it's been a full throated debate, is that gee, you know, often times veterans are suffering from things like post traumatic stress and trauma, combat trauma, or they're having brain injuries of a type that are only suffered on the battlefield and the like. And that the V.A. had developed specializations and even innovations in how you handle these issues. And that the private sector did not have it and did not have an incentive because there's how many such (ph) situations do you see in ordinary life? And by the Dana, in regard to people who live in rural areas distant from V.A. hospitals, they already give out vouchers and so forth. So what you have now, though, is a situation, according to Shulkin and some of the reporting that I've seen this morning, that where President Trump is of a mind that there needs to be privatization. He doesn't want to hear about the argument, he doesn't want to hear about the debate. So Shulkin writes in his op-ed, hey, this is not an honest conversation, this is about pursuing a political agenda. And he notes, by the way, Greg, high levels of -- right now -- approval from veterans for the V.A. I think he said 70 percent."

And, you know, the Admiral taking it over now is really going to have, you know, a tough time because there are so many abuses there, there's corruption, it's very difficult to terminate anybody for lack of competence and whatnot. And so he's going to be stuck with sort of trying to rebuild and rehabilitate the culture at the V.A. but with, you know, an -- an earnest heart and a firm hand, he should be able to do that. And if he wins the confidence of the people there, hopefully they will be emboldened and passionate about it to help the veterans, because they really do deserve our very best."

So you have a lot of good things that happened, where they have the Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act so you can fire and discipline bad apples within the V.A. And then also, as Juan said, they expanded the mental health care for veterans returning overseas that were predisposed to suicide, but the ethical lapses were troubling. I mean, he's taking his wife on a European sightseeing and shopping tour then lied about it, had to reimburse six figures? The privatization thing, yes, of course, that's an argument, but I look at this. Last year, last March, the inspector general found that the V.A. was still lying about wait times, that they were saying there's actually a 36 percent rate that veterans had to wait longer than a month. They lied and said it was only 10 percent. And then, so about 13,000 in Virginia got the Choice Program. As you said, you get to go to a private hospital. And they never let them go to the private hospital. And they had to wait three months to go to the private hospital. So that's last March. This March, same thing. The audit found the same thing. They're funding the numbers on the wait lines. I think that had a lot to do with it too."
