No. Well, get ready, because of the progressive Dems have their way, socialism will be as alive and well here in America as it is in Venezuela, a place once sitting on more oil than any other country in the world, which after years of government overspending and welfare programs with open borders, is now a perfect example of how socialism can ruin a nation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now the rise of socialism has never been clearer.

Once you strip away that Trojan horse he rode in on. Now, the bill includes free community college for illegal immigrants. So, in addition to medication, housing, healthcare, and education in grades K through 12, illegals will have a free two-year college education. $79 billion for enhanced I.R.S. enforcement to conduct more audits. Biden argues it will close the tax gap for the amount of uncollected revenue and raise funds for the White House's sweeping spending plan. $12 billion for government electric cars. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now this should make Hunter Biden and the Chinese happy because we purchase lithium batteries from China. And there's $3 billion for tree equity. Your guess is as good as mine on that one. $25 million for bias training, as if political correctness and cancel culture haven't taught us enough about what is tolerated in this woke country. There's $4 billion for distance learning. Isn't that special? The schools have gotten billions, money over and over again for the purchase of equipment and the improvement of classes. Does someone in the Biden crime family have a contract with a computer company? And by the way, has anyone seen Hunter? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then there's $2 billion to support a Civilian Climate Corps who will probably have more police power than police officers in your town, village, or city. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now don't forget, a little known socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders would have been the Democratic candidate for President in 2016, but for Hillary Clinton's corruption of the Democratic National Committee, and he would have been in 2020, were it not for James Clyburn pushing Joe Biden. Socialists have been winning elections at the state and national level, defeating even long term incumbents since 2016. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, even Obama's cradle to grave fictional ad called \"The Life of Julia\" suggests an anti-capitalist socialist framework.

Today, only 49 percent of young adults have a positive view of capitalism. Socialism is not only accepted, socialism wants whispered about is now being promoted from the highest levels of our government. So back to Venezuela. You probably won't like it there. For those of you who need reminding, socialism doesn't work. The crushing poverty and violence in Venezuela is the latest example. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } People go through garbage bags full of rubbish to take whatever they can and then try to sell the empty bags.

We work hard, pay taxes, and believe in capitalism. None of us is planning to move to a socialist state. And if you're even thinking of socialism, and you want to visit Venezuela ahead of time, be aware that the risk of mugging, carjacking, kidnapping, and torture is commonplace. And that's my open. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter #JudgeJeanine.

What we're seeing now is we have the highest inflation in 30 years. We have these left-wing radicals who are holding up the improvement of our roads and bridges and waterways and ports, because of this so-called $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill, which is for anything but infrastructure. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I'll start with you, Congressman Waltz, what's your take on this?",

Ever been there? Ever wanted to vacation there? No. Well, get ready, because of the progressive Dems have their way, socialism will be as alive and well here in America as it is in Venezuela, a place once sitting on more oil than any other country in the world, which after years of government overspending and welfare programs with open borders, is now a perfect example of how socialism can ruin a nation. Now the rise of socialism has never been clearer. Right now in America, there are forces dug in, organized and well-funded to do whatever necessary to make socialism happen. You've seen the slow crawl yourself. In 2016, Bernie Sanders ran as a Democrat socialist, we all went, \"No.\" But four years later, we found ourselves in a country inundated with DAs and prosecutors funded by the Democrat socialists of America, the George Soros types who are more concerned with the criminal than the victim. AOC made a name for herself with the Green New Deal, pushing hard for the socialist agenda contained in the $3.5 trillion human infrastructure bill, human added to emotionally tie you in and hide the fact that not all the money is going for roads and bridges. This $3.5 trillion alleged Build Back Better bill, when added to the trillions already been spent on the pandemic will literally put us at the highest level of debt America has ever reached and break our bank. No worries though, Joe Biden says, it will cost zero."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "For the first time, Biden is telling the truth. It is not radical, because in his mind and in any socialist's mind, these proposals are key elements of the socialist gospel. Joe Biden, who ran as a moderate is really a socialist. Once you strip away that Trojan horse he rode in on. Now, the bill includes free community college for illegal immigrants. So, in addition to medication, housing, healthcare, and education in grades K through 12, illegals will have a free two-year college education. $79 billion for enhanced I.R.S. enforcement to conduct more audits. Biden argues it will close the tax gap for the amount of uncollected revenue and raise funds for the White House's sweeping spending plan. $12 billion for government electric cars. Now this should make Hunter Biden and the Chinese happy because we purchase lithium batteries from China. And there's $3 billion for tree equity. Your guess is as good as mine on that one. $25 million for bias training, as if political correctness and cancel culture haven't taught us enough about what is tolerated in this woke country. There's $4 billion for distance learning. Isn't that special? The schools have gotten billions, money over and over again for the purchase of equipment and the improvement of classes. Does someone in the Biden crime family have a contract with a computer company? And by the way, has anyone seen Hunter? Then there's $2 billion to support a Civilian Climate Corps who will probably have more police power than police officers in your town, village, or city. Now don't forget, a little known socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders would have been the Democratic candidate for President in 2016, but for Hillary Clinton's corruption of the Democratic National Committee, and he would have been in 2020, were it not for James Clyburn pushing Joe Biden. Socialists have been winning elections at the state and national level, defeating even long term incumbents since 2016. Now, even Obama's cradle to grave fictional ad called \"The Life of Julia\" suggests an anti-capitalist socialist framework. A growing number of young adults in the United States actually hold a negative view of capitalism. Two years ago, 58 percent of young adults had a positive view of capitalism. Today, only 49 percent of young adults have a positive view of capitalism. Socialism is not only accepted, socialism wants whispered about is now being promoted from the highest levels of our government. So back to Venezuela. You probably won't like it there. For those of you who need reminding, socialism doesn't work. The crushing poverty and violence in Venezuela is the latest example. People go through garbage bags full of rubbish to take whatever they can and then try to sell the empty bags. We don't need women giving birth in the streets or dying because the hospitals are overcrowded, or non- existent. Socialists want what you and I have. We work hard, pay taxes, and believe in capitalism. None of us is planning to move to a socialist state. And if you're even thinking of socialism, and you want to visit Venezuela ahead of time, be aware that the risk of mugging, carjacking, kidnapping, and torture is commonplace. And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter #JudgeJeanine. Here with reaction to by open and much more, Congressmen Mike Waltz and Mark Green, both Afghanistan veterans. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being with us this evening. Now you both fought for America in Afghanistan, and you're fighting for America right now in the Halls of Congress. What we're seeing now is we have the highest inflation in 30 years. We have these left-wing radicals who are holding up the improvement of our roads and bridges and waterways and ports, because of this so-called $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill, which is for anything but infrastructure. I'll start with you, Congressman Waltz, what's your take on this?"

And what I think you're going to see play out over the next month, is that they're going to go for the policies, because they know if they can get these programs in place, you know, Ronald Reagan said, the fastest way to eternal life on Earth is through a government program. They'll shave down the years that it's going to last. So you know, that free everything may end in 2025 versus 2028, and that will allow them to take the price tag down a little bit. But they know if they get the programs in place, and they can redefine the country, for example, you know, the child tax care credit, in this bill, it no longer has to be your child. So they already tripled it, and then it can just be any child that anybody is taking care of. What could go wrong with that? But at the end of the day, Judge, as you said, the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money."

It is concentrating power into the hands of fewer and fewer people until you get like Nicolas Maduro, as you have alluded to in your opening statement. I mean, that's what they want. They want a socialist country. And so, they're going to tie all of this together and basically attempt to create that socialist country. But I had the unique fortune to interview Saddam Hussein the night we caught him. When you concentrate power into the hands of fewer and fewer people, you get tyranny. You get a Saddam Hussein, you get a Nicolas Maduro. And you look at what's happening in Venezuela, an average of 24 pounds lost by each Venezuelan. They have to wait eight hours in line for food. They had a 75 percent decrease in their agricultural production over the past couple of decades. These people are starving. Thirty three percent of the population has like basically fled the country.

That's how desperate these people are to get away from this just devastating program because, you know, at the end of the day, in order to take from one group of people to give to another, the bureaucrats and the dictators are making all the calls on the winners and losers, and that's what we're seeing in that migration of power towards Washington, D.C. But the progressives are in charge, Judge, the President is a Trojan horse. Kamala Harris is the most liberal senator in the Senate left of Bernie that is standing right behind him calling the shots, along with Nancy Pelosi and the Progressive Caucus, and you know, we are blocking and tackling the best we can. And fortunately, as Manchin well said, you know, we can't even afford the programs as they stand.

So that's why they're basically opening the Southern border. When it was Cubans rioting in July, and you know, they basically said no Cubans come, and why? Because Cubans vote Republican. Well, we have to stop these guys. And of course, that means pushing back, winning elections, and we're going to take the House back in '22. There's no doubt about it. Nancy Pelosi will not be the Speaker in the next Congress. That's what we have to do. And of course here, you've got Manchin and Sinema pushing back. Hopefully, they'll stay the course.

But more than that, what we're seeing is when the President lies, people die. So when he lied, and I'll go to Congressman Waltz, when he lied, people died, whether it was at the airport in Kabul, our servicemen, or even with the over the horizon capability where he killed seven children.

Hell no. And should they then be categorized as not wanting to leave, Judge? There was just a plane that landed in Chicago yesterday -- thank God for these veterans that went in and got them out -- that had 116 Americans, green card holders and legal permanent residents. We got another seven across the border in Tajikistan yesterday. So, they're lying about the numbers.

This is something that has a very disturbing pattern to totalitarian governments that we've seen before, and now we see in multiple examples, as you wonderfully detail, Judge, the left and even members of our government saying, yes, the parents, I guess, they could be part of a committee, but it's not as if they have the final say. This is wrong and it's immoral.

And good for the parents who are standing up. I think the answer, Judge, parents have to be more involved. You need to run for your local School Board. You need to be part of your community. You have to stay involved. You have to stay on top of this. And quite frankly, I think it's the reason we've seen so many parents turn to homeschooling, I think that is going to increase, that is going to be on the rise because then at least you know what is happening, you know, in your children's education.

Look, they have the right to express himself as American. They have the right to raise their children. Look what the Biden administration is doing. They are trying to ram down critical race theory down every child in America. And these Americans, Jason and Brittney are basically expressing their right as Americans to express themselves. You know what? It is true. Biden is a disaster. In six months, look at Afghanistan. Look at our Southern border. Look at inflation. So all they're doing is telling the truth and they're expressing their right to tell the truth with a t-shirt. Again, Brittany, Jason, give me one of those t-shirts. I want to wear it proudly with you."

Therefore, if your children do not show up at school a week from Monday, you will be fined $1,000.00 a day for the first two weeks. Thereafter, you will be charged with contempt of court. Meaning you will be incarcerated, during which time the court will appoint temporary custody of your children to someone who will abide by the court's decision. Perhaps the good Reverend can explain further the ramifications of contempt in this court room. So ordered."

But, David, look, this movie is very much in the news in terms of what we talk about in the movie, and that is homeschooling, parents trying to protect their kids. We see it in the headlines every day. Why don't you tell the viewers what you tried to prove here?"

      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, it's interesting. You know, I reprise my role as Reverend Dave, and our pastor, or our church basically has this homeschooling co-op, and we get visited by the county and told that if we don't hundred percent comply to the regulations of their educational standards, then we will be fined every week until we do. And so we head to Washington, D.C. to basically fight for these freedoms because ultimately, they just want to pull God out of the education."

The state decides what your children are going to learn and that's really the essence of the movie that's out on October 4th, 5th, 6th, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, ultimately, it's like where does the government -- how far can they reach into our lives? And at what point do we stop that? And you know, in this movie, you know, the \"God's not Dead\" franchise is all about basically bringing up conversations of God in different ways from, you know, where it started? It was it in the universities and into the high schools and then you know, in the community and here we are, we want to bring it up in Washington, D.C. and basically talk about you know, how much are we going to you know - - the government works for the people, we, the people, so, are we going to allow them -- how much, you know -- are they -- how much can they come into our lives and tell us what we can and cannot do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, and the amazing part of it is that the arguments and the -- you know, when the state can call in caseworkers and supervise what's being taught at home? It's even more outrageous. So, when parents decide they want to homeschool, they come in and say no, we are not homeschooling the way we think you should be homeschooling. You know, and now, whether it's critical race theory or any one of the other issues that are that are so controversial today, they even want to come into the home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is just insanity in a way. And obviously, I didn't -- I actually didn't know that much about homeschooling until last year. If you had kids, obviously, you learned about homeschooling, you know. But kids need to be taught in different ways. And for those -- the other thing that I learned about this in this movie was that the fact that it's not just Christians that are homeschooling, like different people of different faiths are homeschooling. But it's a freedom that we -- you know, Ronald Reagan has this great quote at the beginning of this movie that talks about, you know, don't forget about the freedoms and the sacrifice that was paid for our freedoms. And when that gets erased for generations, they never see that freedom again. And I think that's where we're at right now as a country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, and certainly, we are in trouble. And that, you know, freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. If we don't pass it to our children, you know, through the blood, through DNA. Anyway, David, the franchise is a wonderful franchise. I feel very honored to have been part of it, to be in the movie and I thank you very much. And we've got to mention also Antonio Banderas was in the movie as well. So I look forward to seeing you soon, and maybe we can celebrate the movie when it comes out, October 4th, 5th, and 6th in movie theaters near you, and then it'll be streaming."
