The economy is doing great. It's a pretty easy argument. The president has gone more for the jugular with immigration and the caravan, he's betting that that's going to help some folks along the way, and probably he's betting that's ultimately it's going to help him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So what you see is that this picks up on something that we're seeing right now in the polls which is the plurality of voters. I think it's 40 percent say they want to send a message with their vote tomorrow to oppose Donald Trump, 41 percent say they want their vote to put more Democrats in positions to be a check on President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think, also, a lot of people looking at the kind of advertising that President Trump's campaign has utilized, the one about the caravan in particular, the one that had a man who been accused of killing people as a centerpiece and somehow representative of everyone in the caravan. You've seen Fox, CNN, and others pull that ad off the air as a racist ad. So I think that this is interesting to me because for the most part, Democrats have run on the issues, especially health care.

They're the party of hate. And they don't just hate Trump. They hate everybody who supports Trump, and that's what you have to remember when you go to the polls that they actually despise you.

Here's what I think, we've dividing the country up into regions. Let's consider the Mid-south here. If you've been watching TV for the last three days, in all likelihood if you're paying attention to selection, you've heard about Kentucky Sixth, a congressional district right in the city of Lexington, suburbs out to the rural areas. Andy Barr is the Republican. He's getting pretty good challenge by Amy McGrath, the Democrat, first-time candidate. Why is this considered a toss-up? Well, based on all the indications we're getting right now, McGrath is running a pretty good campaign. But we should get an idea, a little bit after 7 o'clock as to how the folks in Lexington, Kentucky, are feeling. And if Andy Barr does well -- well, I'll show you a few other districts where if you go 4 for 4 on the Republican side, it's going to be a long night for sure. And it's going to be a really close battle here for control of the House of Representatives. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The second one I want to show you, in addition to Kentucky Sixth, is North Carolina two. Now, you probably may have not heard a lot about this and there's a reason for that because it's lean Republicans. In fact, it might be likely Republican. But let me give you a little analysis here and you can make up your own mind. George Holding is the incumbent, he's getting a pretty good challenge here in Raleigh, the suburbs in Raleigh, out to the rural areas. Well, and a new tool we have this year, who are these voters, who lives there? Who votes there? The census data gives us a pretty good indication. They're fairly wealthy, about $8,000 above the median average of the country. About 70 percent have a college degree or better. And the racial breakdown, two-thirds white, 20 percent black, about 10 percent Hispanic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So we're going to watch this race throughout the evening. Again, if Republicans hold that would portend good things for the GOP. The third area that I want to show you here is down here in Georgia, specifically Georgia 6 and Georgia 7. Karen Handel just won a special election a couple months back. Suburbs of Atlanta now, over here -- county, Georgia 7 as well. If Republicans go 4 for 4, early in the night, between 7-8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, again, I think, Dana, we're going to have a very interesting race in the house, and in all likelihood, a very close one for control of that chamber. So those are the four that I'm looking at early in the evening.",

In fact, she won the district but the Republican won the house seat there.

He's still turning out great numbers too. In fact, this and how we ended up in 2016, red is Trump, blue is Hillary Clinton. You think about where he went today. In Ohio, he was a winner in that state by almost eight points. Two years ago, he's also in Indiana, northern part of the state, Fort Wayne. He was the easy winter by 20 points over Hillary Clinton two years ago in the Hoosier state. And later tonight in Missouri, again, same margin about 19, 20 points in the end. And then, Jesse, he concludes his night here in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, a county that, easily, he won with 76 percent of the vote in that county. Why is he doing this?

We have a jam- packed hour ahead. But first, Fox News alert, in the final hours before voters head to the polls, President Trump is hitting the campaign trail harder than ever as he tries to tip key toss abrasives with a flurry of rallies in three states. Hours ago in Cleveland, the president fired up the crowd by drilling down on what's at stake for our country."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, we're seeing the polls narrow, surely. It's now just plus three for the Democrats in the latest read of how this is going to go. And, you know, I think we've learned a lot about polling in recent years, so I think it's going to be very interesting to see how this whole thing shakes out. But in terms of those messages, I can't help but feel that they kind of scrambled to them in the final weeks, you know? I think that the Democrats were lacking a cohesive message other than resistance, which clearly has been their main mojo for the past couple of years. And I think Republicans have been having this, you know, sort of schizophrenic reaction to where they should be. A lot of folks like Paul Ryan feel that they should be very focused on the economy. The economy is doing great. It's a pretty easy argument. The president has gone more for the jugular with immigration and the caravan, he's betting that that's going to help some folks along the way, and probably he's betting that's ultimately it's going to help him."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's good news for the Democrats, especially, I think, Bloomberg is a former Republican. I think people have a clear sense something is wrong if you get Bloomberg absolutely saying, you know, the message that comes from this White House is one of division, hatefulness, finger-pointing, as you saw in the ad, Jesse. So what you see is that this picks up on something that we're seeing right now in the polls which is the plurality of voters. I think it's 40 percent say they want to send a message with their vote tomorrow to oppose Donald Trump, 41 percent say they want their vote to put more Democrats in positions to be a check on President Trump. And I think, also, a lot of people looking at the kind of advertising that President Trump's campaign has utilized, the one about the caravan in particular, the one that had a man who been accused of killing people as a centerpiece and somehow representative of everyone in the caravan. You've seen Fox, CNN, and others pull that ad off the air as a racist ad. So I think that this is interesting to me because for the most part, Democrats have run on the issues, especially health care. But what you're seeing now is that more and more people are saying, you know what, it's about who we are, as you heard President Obama -- former President Obama say, it's about who we are as Americans, who do we want to be? Our character."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, they've definitely bringing up character in the late hours of the campaign, Dana. And Juan said, you know, you can really get a read on what people are going to think. I'm not so sure. I think we have some sound of Nate Silver, famous political prognosticator, giving a very, very wide stretch of possibilities about what could happen Tuesday. Let's listen to him."

      "speaker": "NATE SILVER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT",
      "utterance": "Our range which covers 80 percent of outcomes goes from, on the low end, about 15 Democratic pickups all the way up to the low-to-mid 50's, 52 or 53. Most of those are above 23 which is how many seats they would need to take the house, but like -- but no one should be surprised if they only win 19 seats, and no one should be surprised if they win 51 seats. Those are both extremely possible based on how accurate polls are in the real world."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "It's like the weatherman. He's saying, you know, tomorrow is going to be 80 and sunny, but it's a possibility it could be cold and rainy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "I think it's actually easier to predict the weather than predict election outcomes. Even if the extremes what he's talking about, like the Republicans hold the house or the Democrats sweep it with like 50 seats, both of those -- there's a chance, there's smaller chances, there's probably going to be something in between. I do think also that the gubernatorial races are super important. The Republicans have dominated in the states for so long, like maybe 12 years and politics cycle. And so it looks like the Republicans are going to lose several of those governorships, and the ones to really watch, I think, if you're thinking about President Trump's reelection, Florida and Ohio because 2020 do the census, you do redistricting, that will have a big impact."

      "utterance": "I am thrilled, thrilled, and cold. I want to go back to what Martha said, I do feel like the Democrats are cramming for a final. They're all hopped up on Ritalin and coffee because they don't have a message. This is what the Democrats are faced with, an economic boom, GDP, wages, jobs, foreign policy, almost the destruction of ISIS, it will take some time. Progress with North Korea. We're seeing progress on trade. We're seeing Supreme Court, two justices. Keystone, we've forgotten about Keystone. We're rebuilding the military. There's consumer confidence, there's optimism. There's worker productivity. Any one of these singularly as an achievement is something you can run on. The problem with Trump is he's got too many good things. And so all the Dems have is hate. They're the party of hate. And they don't just hate Trump. They hate everybody who supports Trump, and that's what you have to remember when you go to the polls that they actually despise you. You know, it's kind of sad. In a weird way, it's a tribute to Trump. He's like a super villain and he's bringing out Bloomberg, Obama, Biden, celebrities. They're like the super friends. They have to get together to fight this one guy. He's basically -- he's basically, I don't know, like Lex Luther and they're all Robins."

And so, I think what you're seeing is a number of top Democrats willing to step out in an unorthodox fashion because they see this as a critical moment.

      "utterance": "Here's what I want to do. I'm going to break this down. We'll go house first and then we go to senate, then we'll go to the president's travels. We can do all that over the next couple of minutes here. Here's -- let's start with the house and try and give viewers a sense of what we can look for early in the night, say 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock east coast time, about 26 hours from now. Here's what I think, we've dividing the country up into regions. Let's consider the Mid-south here. If you've been watching TV for the last three days, in all likelihood if you're paying attention to selection, you've heard about Kentucky Sixth, a congressional district right in the city of Lexington, suburbs out to the rural areas. Andy Barr is the Republican. He's getting pretty good challenge by Amy McGrath, the Democrat, first-time candidate. Why is this considered a toss-up? Well, based on all the indications we're getting right now, McGrath is running a pretty good campaign. But we should get an idea, a little bit after 7 o'clock as to how the folks in Lexington, Kentucky, are feeling. And if Andy Barr does well -- well, I'll show you a few other districts where if you go 4 for 4 on the Republican side, it's going to be a long night for sure. And it's going to be a really close battle here for control of the House of Representatives. The second one I want to show you, in addition to Kentucky Sixth, is North Carolina two. Now, you probably may have not heard a lot about this and there's a reason for that because it's lean Republicans. In fact, it might be likely Republican. But let me give you a little analysis here and you can make up your own mind. George Holding is the incumbent, he's getting a pretty good challenge here in Raleigh, the suburbs in Raleigh, out to the rural areas. Well, and a new tool we have this year, who are these voters, who lives there? Who votes there? The census data gives us a pretty good indication. They're fairly wealthy, about $8,000 above the median average of the country. About 70 percent have a college degree or better. And the racial breakdown, two-thirds white, 20 percent black, about 10 percent Hispanic. So we're going to watch this race throughout the evening. Again, if Republicans hold that would portend good things for the GOP. The third area that I want to show you here is down here in Georgia, specifically Georgia 6 and Georgia 7. Karen Handel just won a special election a couple months back. Suburbs of Atlanta now, over here -- county, Georgia 7 as well. If Republicans go 4 for 4, early in the night, between 7-8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, again, I think, Dana, we're going to have a very interesting race in the house, and in all likelihood, a very close one for control of that chamber. So those are the four that I'm looking at early in the evening."

And, you know, Mississippi could go into a runoff, right?"

    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Very good question. I'll show you the poll closings may be gives us a better idea about how we can analyze that. At 7 o'clock, I mentioned Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia as well, come forward through the night, 7:30, I mentioned North Carolina. But also you've got good races in Ohio and West Virginia as well. And I'll just fast forward to the map, 8 o'clock, a lot of data is going to come pouring in, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Florida. Nine o'clock, a little more further west, 10 o'clock is still interesting. It's Nevada. It's Montana. It's Iowa. And 11 o'clock is California. Martha, there are at least eight races on the house side we're watching in California, seven of which are in areas where Hillary Clinton did very well two years ago. In fact, she won the district but the Republican won the house seat there. And talking with our decision desk today, Stirewalt and all the other smart brains around here, if the house is not closed will be able to make a call much earlier in the night. Again, if it's close, that California thing could keep us up very late tomorrow night. So we'll have to see how that turns out there."

The people that really shocked the world in 2016, don't really talk to pollsters, are those Trump voters8 going to materialize when Trump's name personally is not on the ballot? And I don't think the pollsters know either and that's why see such large spreads. You see CNN has plus Dems 13. Rasmussen has plus 1. And that's why people are hedging because they don't know. Your instincts as you see the landscape right now, is there anything that you see tomorrow that can give you a sense of which way those hidden Trump voters could go."

But I'll tell you, as we cover these stories, these campaigns that go on for as long as they do, data points stick in your brain. The president is still traveling. He's still turning out great numbers too. In fact, this and how we ended up in 2016, red is Trump, blue is Hillary Clinton. You think about where he went today. In Ohio, he was a winner in that state by almost eight points. Two years ago, he's also in Indiana, northern part of the state, Fort Wayne. He was the easy winter by 20 points over Hillary Clinton two years ago in the Hoosier state. And later tonight in Missouri, again, same margin about 19, 20 points in the end. And then, Jesse, he concludes his night here in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, a county that, easily, he won with 76 percent of the vote in that county. Why is he doing this? He has said for weeks now that midterms are base elections and that's what he's banking on for tomorrow, on Tuesday. Great question. Don't have an answer. But just think about some of these data points as we get some of the information throughout the night, tomorrow night."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

But if you look at candidate recruitment, Phil Bredesen, to be willing to come back and run statewide again in Tennessee, an experienced governor, well-liked, but in a Trump -- in a state where President Trump won by 19, 20 points, it's going to be very difficult for Democrats to win in any of these senate races going forward. Now, President Trump has played this very well. He trusts his instincts. He's going to continue to follow them. And you looked at that map as Bill Hemmer showed us where the president is going, these last few days are in the states where senate Democrats are endangered. The difference is -- to see what happens in 2020 because there is no senate Democrat that is up for reelection in 2020 in a state where President Trump won. So, the travel at that point and the message might look a little different."

I think it would be healthy for the Democrats -- what happened to the Republicans which is a challenge to their orthodoxy. And maybe that will happen in 2020. The fact is, what is the Democratic orthodoxy? It's identity politics. It's grievance theater. It's who is more aggrieved than the other person. Ultimately, these people will eat themselves alive. That's why they need a new message, and they need a new message of unity of like bringing America back together again. The Kavanaugh -- what happened with Kavanaugh is a perfect example of the Stalinist end game, right? This is where identity politics will take you and the individual becomes subservient to the political party. Because, as Nancy Pelosi said, you know, to achieve a political aim, collateral damage is collateral damage. And the collateral damage is the individual. Kavanaugh was the innocent individual that was thrown to the fire to achieve a political aim. So, if the Democrats actually confront that problem, they might actually have the White House, but I don't know if they have the guts."

And here is a guy saying we don't need to play hardball with President Trump."

And when they talk about things like inclusion and fairness, when they get into trouble is when they start demonizing people and dividing. You know, is it possible for the Democratic Party to be pro-worker and still be pro-capitalist? Can they pull that off? Can the Democratic Party be pro-#MeToo movement and also for due process? Can the Democratic Party be for diversity but also be against open borders and not be so anti-white? So far they haven't been able to strike that balance. Right now the president comes out with an extreme position, and they automatically go to the other extreme. Abolish ICE, impeachment, socialism. I don't think that brand plays, because right now, and it always has been a center right country in America. And when you look at the polls right now, the president and his party, the American people agree when it comes to the military, when it comes to jobs, when it comes to the economy, when it comes to Kavanaugh, and even, Juan, when it comes to the caravan. A new poll outs, 51 percent of Hispanics support sending troops to stop the caravan. Sixty-five percent of all Americans want to send troops to stop the caravan. The president knows where the center of the country is. The Democrats just have to be disciplined enough emotionally to create a contrast position which is not in Venezuela."

And she put Cheerios in her hair, and she's carrying Starbucks. And she has not one but two babies attached. One is up here, and the other one -- show the other one hanging onto her leg. And the best part of this is that Jillian is 1 of 9 children, so she knows whereof she dresses and speaks. Her mom says she's like the little mommy in the family. She helps them take care of the youngest five, so Jillian, nice job."
