      "utterance": "Well, there are a lot of good reasons. Not only that, you know, to make this moment the moment to do it. Not only that but also, you know, the fact that Hillary Clinton did make those comments, whatever, last week about directly blaming Comey for her loss. You know, there is a saying certainly in newspapers that if everybody is mad at you then obviously you are doing your job right. That was not the case here. Everybody at some point in time was mad at Comey but it was because he kept screwing things up."

      "utterance": "Well, that is using a hammer to get a gnat. I mean this is like a bomb to go after, you know, a guerilla band. You've got to ask yourself, the tone of this, you know, the swiftness -- you are terminated immediately. You've got this image of him being perp-walked out of the FBI building in handcuffs which is what prosecutors do. It's not done to them. Look, again, how implausible this is. If she complains -- Hillary Clinton complains that Comey cost her the election, then here you have Trump firing Comey for costing Hillary the election. This doesn't make any sense. It's clear that this has been prepared for days, but again, why this way? And why was it done with malice? I mean there would have been so many ways of having Comey sort of step aside, say he was in an untenable position. And I must say in his defense, and I am somewhat sympathetic to him, I wouldn't have done what he did. But he was in a position that was utterly impossible. We have never had a presidential candidate running for the presidency while under FBI investigation."
