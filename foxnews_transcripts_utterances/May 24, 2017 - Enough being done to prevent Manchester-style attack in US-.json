Retaining a skilled legal representative is always a good idea, because it's better to be safe than to be sorry. I maintain that position under all circumstances, and therefore, the news that President Trump is reportedly \"lawyering up\" by hiring Marc Kasowitz to advise him, pending the Russia probe, doesn't bother me one bit. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is imperative, and all Americans should feel free to exercise it at any time without presumptions of guilt or wrongdoing. President Trump is being very smart to bring Kasowitz in at this point, because as the investigation continues, the White House counsel, well, they represent the office of the presidency but not Donald J. Trump, the man. So as the investigation plays out and the campaign or Mr. Trump himself becomes a potential target, things could get complicated. What's protected? What's not? What's privileged? Whose interests are really being represented? The government has smartly brought in independent counsel, so it's only fitting and appropriate that President Trump has done the same thing.

His intentionality was not to impede or to abort any proceeding or investigation.\" That will be certainly -- certainly that argument. But here's another legal story for you guys on \"The Docket.\" In a memo out on Monday, A.G. Jeff Sessions tried to clarify the administration's sanctuary city injunction. Now, it's clear from the president's original order and from Sessions's new memo that the attempt is to incentivize local cooperation with federal immigration efforts by cutting funding to what the White House was calling a few small grants. But the question remains, is this effort legal? Mo, I'm going to come to you on this. Lots of controversy around the notion of sanctuary cities and this issue of funding. Now, traditionally, constitutionally, it's Congress that delegates how money is spent with our government. Do you take issue at all with this executive order?",

So all day long before -- you know, while this was being mashed out on TV, the left was saying this can't happen. This budget doesn't do what it says it's going to do, because you'll never get 3 percent growth. And they're hung up on 3 percent growth. Let me tell you a little bit about growth. From 1947 until this year, the United States has had over 3 percent growth. We've had 3.21 percent growth, and we've had as high as 16.9 percent growth. So when you give people more of their own money, when you spend wisely, that brings growth. When you reform taxes, 3 percent is not unattainable.

That's the key to getting this done. And so I approach it that way. But the other thing that's missing in this budget is there's nothing on Social Security reform and nothing on Medicaid reform. And those are the entitlements that are driving much of the excessive costs. And when you don't touch those, you do have to go harder after the rest of the programs.

Meanwhile, in Libya, officials have arrested Abedi's father and younger brother on suspicious of links to ISIS. Yeah, that's obviously not good. In Europe, they seem to have problems with communication when it comes to their different agencies communicating with each other when it comes to spotting terrorism."

Yesterday, we ran a sound bite on Katty Kay on my friend's, Morning Joe -- Morning Joe, Scarborough show. And she said this, Europe is getting used to attacks like this, Mika -- she's talking to Mika Brzezinski, we have to because we are never going to be able to totally wipe this out. Now, Katty Kay is a reporter for the BBC in London in Europe. That's disturbing enough, but today, maybe yesterday or this morning, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester came out and said this, we're grieving today but we're strong. Today will be business as usual as far as possible in our great city. No, no, no, it's not business as usual. You don't get used to it. It's terror. It's killing children. You get outraged and you go after it. And you have to do it in a way that you don't worry about offending certain groups. And you say, we're going to wipe this out, we're going to take care. But to say it's business as usual, boy, I have a real problem with the way the Europeans, especially the Brits are framing this."

Or is it to your point, Kat, it is a spirit of resiliency and saying, you know what, they're not going to win, we're going to continue to live our best life, so to speak, in spite of their efforts to destroy us. I think that both have to be considered here."

    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Obviously agree with that. All right. Let's meet today's specialist. He's a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, and a bestselling author for his book, taking heat. He's also the founder of Fleischer Communications, and he specializes in being a huge New York Yankees and Miami Dolphins fan, Ari Fleischer is here. And he was a senior spokesman and traveling press secretary for Hillary Clinton, he's a Fox News contributor, and he's the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, but he specializes in campaign trail karaoke bars, Mo Elleithee is here. All right. So, Mo, I'm going to start with you. How do you see this? People are trying to draw comparisons between the U.K. and could this happen here? The way I see it, there's a lot of things we do better when it comes to fighting terrorism. Communication, Muslim immigrants assimilating better that they don't do over there. How fair do you think those comparisons are?"

    {
      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, SENIOR SPOKESMAN FOR HILLARY CLINTON",
      "utterance": "Look, I mean, just listening to the conversation you and Eric just had, I mean, I don't think these are mutually exclusive arguments. I don't think they should be mutually exclusive arguments. We should be outraged. I'm outraged. We all are outraged by what happened. And we should go after the bad guys. But that doesn't mean we should slow down our way of life. That's what they want to do. They want to disrupt us. Ari will remember this, I remember President Bush in the days following 9/11, taking a very strong tac in talking about going after the terrorist, but also saying they are not going to slow us down as Americans. We're going to continue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "But Mo, he stood on a pile of rubble and I was there. I was there for that. He stood with the megaphone and, Ari, correct me if I'm wrong, he said we're coming after you. We're going to get you. Yeah, I understand you're not going to take us down, but that's a far cry from the mayor of the very next day of Manchester saying, oh, you know what, business as usual. Or Katty Kay, a prominent BBC reporter saying we need to get used to this in Europe? No way, not here, not in New York, not in the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, the other part of the narrative I think is missing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, FLEISCHER COMMUNICATION FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "There's a crucial bifurcation you have to make here. It is fully appropriate for the public to say we want to get on with our lives. We want to have business as usual. But the job of government is to destroy these people. And that is what elected officials have to say, convey, and it has to be the emotions that they pass on. You want the public to feel that they can delegate this to the government and it can be destroyed, it can be stopped. It was when we say we're going to do it with communism and we did. It was when you remember the Red Brigade and the Irish Republican Army, those were stop. People thought we can't stop it, there's going to be bombs in the streets, you can stop it. You have to stop it by playing permanent offense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So to stopping it -- let's talk about the fact that this suicide bomber here was in Libya just three weeks prior to, and then returned to England after that. That strikes me because it's my understanding, Eric, I'm going to go to you on this, that President Trump is doing a new strategy, to annihilate this type of terrorism. Specifically, Defense Secretary Mattis is saying that he's doing a different tactical approach, instead of waiting for them to come out, he's going in, going directly in being more aggressive, giving them more leeway to be more aggressive in their ability to go in. Just so that these type of being doesn't happen, so that people are not returning home either sharing intelligence or becoming more radicalized and then going back. Do you think."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Very important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "So Trump outlines in that big terror speech that he gave a couple days ago. He said -- the war on terror is a fight of good versus evil. That's a far cry from what we're hearing from the European officials. I'd also like to point out -- you're very accurately point out that this guy, Salman Abedi, went to Libya, he came back. He's been in Syria -- allegedly in Syria as well. The whole family is a network of ISIS trained fighters. Hang on. But this is very important. One of Trump's travel moratorium countries is Libya. So when he says let's hold before we just indiscriminately let people come in from Libya, let's make sure, let's extreme vet them so we don't have Abedi's coming to New York instead of Manchester."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I've certainly have no problem with extreme vetting, but it's important to give ourselves credit, our leaders credit for the fact that this hasn't happened here. That since 9/11, every single deadly Islamic terrorist attack is been by someone who's here legally or was a citizen. We do seem to be doing a good job of communicating our state, our federal, our local government communicate with each other about these sort of things, the way they're simply aren't in Europe. So that has a lot to do with it as well as assimilation. And another part of preserving our way of life to me is to make sure that we don't do things that could destroy our own civil liberties in trying to destroy ISIS. They won't take away our way of life. I want to be very careful that we don't want emotions run high and just do it for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "We don't need to be reactive, I agree with you, Kat. This is where we need to be smart. We need to have emotional and pragmatic intelligence here. To your point, using the strength we have. Look, this was the place I was contiguously criticizing President Obama where I think there's enough aggression on this issue of terror for sure. So for all of the criticisms I have for President Trump, this is a place where I commend him. I commend him for saying, you know what."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Can I point something out, though? And Ari, correct me if I'm wrong, President Obama was looking to substantially increase the acceptance of refugees, the program. He went from -- I think it was 116,000 in his last year. Hillary Clinton was looking for 400,000 or 500,000 refugees to take on. Do we not see the danger of doing things like this? This family was a refugee family from Libya."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "I'm not with you on this one, no. He was born in the United Kingdom. The Manchester terrorist was born in the United Kingdom."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Well, my mother was born abroad. I was born here. So, I'm not sure the solution is to say because people's parents were born somewhere else, you can't be here. I am not with President Trump on the Muslim ban. Never have been -- the so-called Muslim ban."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "It's not a Muslim ban."

    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "From the seven countries -- the issue here, if you have people coming in from a place that's lawless like Syria where you cannot verify anybody's identify because there is no town hall to check with. It's a bunch of ruble. You know, people can assume alternative identification and no one can catch them. That's legitimate to stop people from coming from lawless places. But places where there is a rule of law, even it's a Muslim country -- if it's a Muslim country, that in and of itself is not a basis to ban people."

    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",

      "utterance": "I want to get Mo in here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "Look, I think part of the problem is what we're not talking about is what happens in these refugee camps when we're not pulling people out. Now, I'm not saying open the doors wide open, come one, come all, right. We have a very strong vetting system for the refugees that the United States brings in, and we've got to give our law enforcement, our immigration folks, and homeland security all the credit that they deserve for that. But these refugee camps are prime recruiting territory for ISIS, for terrorists. If we can -- through vetting, help people get out of that and get back on their feet, and what we have seen is that they have become productive members of our society. They're not out there causing trouble. They're not out there creating terror attacks. There's got to be a middle ground here rather than all or nothing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Or molder a stronger defense and that is intelligence. The issue is not going to be solved through refugee vetting or through not allowing some countries in or not to come in. The issue is how aggressive are we with our intelligence gathering and operations. And this is where Edward Snowden has done irreparable damage to the United States, and the critics the NSA have. These are the programs that you had to have in an open, tolerant, welcoming, exclusive country which is what the United States is, and it has to be married to a tough intelligence operation to gather information on the people take advantage of our generosity and will do us harm."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "and I think what you just said is important. They have to be married to one another, right. Too much of the conversation right now is either or. It's this or it's this. The reality is if we're going to take on terrorism, we have to have it all. We have to able to use intelligence. We have to be open and compassionate where it makes sense. We have to have the vetting. We have to have strong military, strong diplomatic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Here's the problem with what you're saying. Europe has historically open borders within the countries. We've talked about that. There're also countries within Europe or willing to be more aggressive taking on refugees, and as Ari astutely points out, you don't know where the vast majority of these people come from. They don't have educational records, they don't have work records, they don't have prison records, they just show up and they're able to come in. Some of our leaders, Hillary Clinton was looking to quadruple or multiplied by five the number of refugees we were willing to take. That becomes very dangerous because there is no way to vet who these people are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "But we don't want to equate all refugees though, Eric, with that type of risk because we know that's not true. Not all refugees represent the type of risk -- this is where we need to be smart and target those that we do. Again, going back to accurate criminal profiling, not religious or racial profiling."

      "utterance": "We will work together on various problems. Number one right now is terrorism, and we are fighting very hard, doing very well under our generals, and making tremendous progress. But when you see something like happened two days ago, you realize how important it is to win this fight. And we will win this fight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "All right. How comforting do you think that type of language coming out of the president is for those who were nervous and skeptical? When early on, we saw then candidate Trump talking about his skepticism around how beneficial NATO was to America at this point. And how some people weren't carrying their weight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not really interested in being comforting to our western European allies. I'm interested in getting things done. And Donald Trump in the campaign was on to a very important issue and that is 23 of 28 nations in NATO don't pay their fair share."
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",

There're only five nations in NATO that pay, it's the United States, United Kingdom, as always, we're the excessive two percent, U.K. is, Estonia, Poland, and Greece. The rest not a single other western European nation, it's not France, It's not Germany, none of those economic behemoths. Nobody is doing what they're supposed to do. So we have the burden on us. So I actually think Donald Trump threw the towel in a little too early by accommodating NATO and saying I'm with you now. I'd like to keep the pressure on NATO to get them to do more."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

To have the United States raising questions about whether or not it will be there for our allies when you've got terrorism coming in one direction and Russia coming in from the other direction, it's something that is going to raise a lot of concerns.

Retaining a skilled legal representative is always a good idea, because it's better to be safe than to be sorry. I maintain that position under all circumstances, and therefore, the news that President Trump is reportedly \"lawyering up\" by hiring Marc Kasowitz to advise him, pending the Russia probe, doesn't bother me one bit. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is imperative, and all Americans should feel free to exercise it at any time without presumptions of guilt or wrongdoing. President Trump is being very smart to bring Kasowitz in at this point, because as the investigation continues, the White House counsel, well, they represent the office of the presidency but not Donald J. Trump, the man. So as the investigation plays out and the campaign or Mr. Trump himself becomes a potential target, things could get complicated. What's protected? What's not? What's privileged? Whose interests are really being represented? The government has smartly brought in independent counsel, so it's only fitting and appropriate that President Trump has done the same thing.

I don't have the right to pick and choose what laws I decide are morally right for me to obey and disobey. Mayors don't have that right. Governors don't have that right. This is the glue that holds us together as a country. And when the city decides unilaterally, \"We will be a sanctuary city because we want to be. We will violate a federal law because we choose to do so, because we think morally we know better and we're wiser,\" it is an unraveling of what this country stands for. No. If you don't like a law, change the law, but obey the law until then. That's my problem with sanctuary cities."

And get this: the EPA is gutted, a 30 percent drop in spending; Labor, 20 percent drop; State Department, 29 percent. Conservatives like this. So all day long before -- you know, while this was being mashed out on TV, the left was saying this can't happen. This budget doesn't do what it says it's going to do, because you'll never get 3 percent growth. And they're hung up on 3 percent growth. Let me tell you a little bit about growth. From 1947 until this year, the United States has had over 3 percent growth. We've had 3.21 percent growth, and we've had as high as 16.9 percent growth. So when you give people more of their own money, when you spend wisely, that brings growth. When you reform taxes, 3 percent is not unattainable. Hell, we had 2 percent growth under Obama, and it was a disaster."

      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "You know, and Eric what you just said is the key to balancing budgets. And that's why the last budget got balanced. I was in the room when they were having the negotiations in '97 about what they called the balanced budget legislation. And one day, the budget numbers came in, a budget cruncher came in and said, \"We have a couple hundred billion more in anticipated revenue, because the money is flooding in,\" because economic growth was so great in the mid-'90s. That's the key to getting this done. And so I approach it that way. But the other thing that's missing in this budget is there's nothing on Social Security reform and nothing on Medicaid reform. And those are the entitlements that are driving much of the excessive costs. And when you don't touch those, you do have to go harder after the rest of the programs. That's a lesson about leaving entitlements alone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "And I think the reason that those are never touched, Ari, is -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- I think that politically, the consequence is still very high. When someone goes out and they touch those programs, people get deep into their feelings. I am someone that believes in incentive based policy, but these cuts, Eric, they actually don't bother me. I will tell you, though, you show me somebody's budget, and I'll tell you what their values are. So my only critique is why so much inflated spending around some of the Border Patrol?"
