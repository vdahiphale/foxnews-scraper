It's a fact, at Trump rally is really fun unlike those socialist infomercials that induce vomiting.

But how can the Dems have 20 candidates but not a single clue? They're meeting the Donald with the dull. Here's what to consider watching tonight's rally. Would any of the energy and humor make any sense if America wasn't doing great? Would any of Trump's words feel bizarrely off if we were in deep trouble? Of course, but they won't because we're not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If there were big wars, unemployment, high crime, a dead economy, there'd be no place for this at all. Sure, if you're obsessively furious at Trump you'll say it's the worst of times. But measure his performance using practical evidence and not his tweets or his behavior, it might be the best. So the rally will be fun and loud and unpredictable because the mitigation of other bigger problems make it so. In fact, all the stuff from impeachment blather to media meltdowns are products of an age when big problems are being tackled in new ways. Of course, millions will love the rally. Millions will hate it. And millions won't care. But their ability to happily decide is brought to you by one sturdy fact.

This is madness. Because, in fact, to my mind, at least I'm talking to people, I'm expressing my views. I think Lawrence is expressing his views. Now, Lawrence and I don't agree on everything. But Lawrence has a legitimate right to speak his truth, why don't you want to hear? So to me that's intolerance coming from the Left. I can't agree with you on the young man from Harvard, by the way. I just think to me, I mean in the Ralph Northam situation, as Dana says, we got to be equal. I think Democrats - the two Democratic Senators in the state called for him to resign. I think lots of people have been highly critical. But he was elected Governor, and under the law of our country, he gets to stay if he doesn't resign.",

It was a kind of a private thing that he has disowned when he was 16. And I do think that as awful as the things were - that were said, you should accept the apology, especially Harvard. I mean, if Harvard gets found guilty of discrimination against Asian- Americans should you cancel the whole institution? Should it closed down because they were they were racist against Asians? If our civil civilization eliminates forgiveness or reject apologies and you're in favor of just canceling people, you're going to see more violence and more suicide. Because if you can't let people have a second chance in life, they're going to kill themselves and we've seen that already. I think the racism is ignored on the Left, because it's the media's team, so they carve out exceptions for people, they carve out exceptions for racism, they carve out exceptions for sexism.

Well Joseph Allen (ph) was vacationing in the Dominican Republic when last Wednesday night he told his friends he was going back to his hotel room, because he felt like he had a fever. The next day the 55-year-old was found dead in his hotel room. This happened in the Terra Linda Resort in Sosua. Joseph's brother Jason says, Joseph just had a physical. He was in \"Very good shape\" and he had no issues. They now want his body checked by a forensic pathologist here in the U.S. There have been nine mysterious deaths on the island over the last year. The Dominican Republic listed the cause of death, for most of these cases, as heart attacks or pulmonary edema - lungs filling up with fluid. But the families say their loved ones were healthy before vacationing. We know at least three had alcohol from minibars. We don't know if the other six did. Meanwhile Will Cox, whose mother Leyla Cox died suddenly in Punta Cana says he is waiting for the Dominican Attorney General to give final approval to get a sample of his mother's blood sent to the U.S. for toxicology tests. We are learning 54 members, by the way, of a Jimmy Buffett fan club also got sick while traveling to Punta Cana in April. The members swam or had a drink in the same resort swim-up bar pool. And earlier this month, at least five high school seniors on a trip from Oklahoma, became ill after eating at a Japanese restaurant at the Hard Rock Hotel in Punta Cana where two Americans died. The State Department, Dana, has not issued a new travel warning for the Dominican Republic.

      "utterance": "Yikes. It's a roller coaster versus the little pony carousel. Santa elves versus the big orange rhino. It's a fact, at Trump rally is really fun unlike those socialist infomercials that induce vomiting. That's because Trump's a phenomenon that combines the powers of persuasion, pro-wrestling, reality TV, and celebrity roast into one giant fireball. It's a historical and hysterical first. But it's also early. So who knows who can match Trump for thrills and chills? But how can the Dems have 20 candidates but not a single clue? They're meeting the Donald with the dull. Here's what to consider watching tonight's rally. Would any of the energy and humor make any sense if America wasn't doing great? Would any of Trump's words feel bizarrely off if we were in deep trouble? Of course, but they won't because we're not. If there were big wars, unemployment, high crime, a dead economy, there'd be no place for this at all. Sure, if you're obsessively furious at Trump you'll say it's the worst of times. But measure his performance using practical evidence and not his tweets or his behavior, it might be the best. So the rally will be fun and loud and unpredictable because the mitigation of other bigger problems make it so. In fact, all the stuff from impeachment blather to media meltdowns are products of an age when big problems are being tackled in new ways. Of course, millions will love the rally. Millions will hate it. And millions won't care. But their ability to happily decide is brought to you by one sturdy fact. America is better off now than it's been in years. All right. So, Juan, maybe I pose this question to you, energy isn't what America wants after four years. Maybe they want a comfy sweater. Maybe the Democrats are right to come at this and maybe a more muted way."

So he's got -- you know, Democrats have to say here's someone who's stable, someone who is rational, who doesn't tweet off crazy stuff, someone that you can trust in critical moments. And I think that's why Joe Biden right now has the lead. And I think last night I read he said he had 20 million bucks in the bank. So he's really raised more money than any other Democrat. So that -- those are all the reasons. I think the only strategy left for Trump, and I think we'll see it tonight at the rally, Greg, is for him to attack and smear his opponent. So he'll talk about the socialist. He's going to talk about nasty women. He's going to talk about tired, Sleepy Joe. That's what he has to do because if it's just about Donald Trump, he loses. So he's got to, you know, nasty up his opponent to the point where people would say, you know what? I'll go with Trump. By the way, in response to your things, you always say things are so great. If things are so great, Greg, why did Democrats capture 40 seats in the midterms? Why are we sending troops to the Middle East? Why do you think that it's farmers are complaining about the lack of a trade deal and the tariffs are driving up prices at Walmart and Costco? I mean, there's a reason people are saying this guy is not a good president."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "-- they're going to fire you if you keep on disrespecting the audience. Listen, the polls right now mean nothing. The polls said Hillary was going to beat Trump. Polls said Hillary was going to beat Trump in Florida, OK? And he won by 100,000 votes in Florida after being outspent 53 to 1 down the stretch. He's got, in Florida, two Republican senators. He's got a Republican governor. And the Quinnipiac poll actually said both of those guys, Desantis and Scott were going to lose by seven in the midterms and they won. So, the fact that that polls show from Quinnipiac, Biden beating Trump by 7, in Florida, doesn't really mean much right now. The media knows there's no one that can compete against Donald Trump at these rallies. They see a line. They see people in tents camping out. They see the raucous connection he makes, and the crowd goes wild. And they'll do anything they can to denigrate him because they know a Democrat can't pull it off, so they'll go after his supporters. You'll see tonight reporters on the ground. They won't interview Hispanic or black Trump supporters. They'll look for the craziest people with the most radical signs and they'll actually debate them. But the ironic thing is the more they attack the president and his supporters, the stronger that connection gets."

And if I were them, I would down play all comparisons to 2015, because now he has a record to defend, and as you say, you know, the record is all these amazing great things. So he can talk about those things. Before, he was the insurgent. He was the I am going to come in there, I'm going to shake things up, I'm going to be the outsider, and he has done all of those things. But now he also is an incumbent, and incumbency gives you so many tools to use. It is so hard to beat an incumbent president. Very, very difficult. If you think it only happened twice since World War II. So I think the polling right now it doesn't really matter. It matters for Biden because he can figure out a way like raise more money. But for the polls right now that doesn't really matter. You're going to see a lot more after the debates. I would say that his biggest strength right now, the war chest is huge, it's got all of this money, didn't have it the first time, the RNC firmly behind him from the jump. He's got a huge amount of organization, so they've got all these get-out the vote pieces, the numbers of people that they can talk to. People getting their cell phones with their pictures on it so that they could send it to their friends. All that stuff they didn't have a way to capture it before and they do now. That said, it's still going to be a big race. And there's all of these states that they're going to have to pay a lot of attention to."

How would you dress up DHS's mass separation of thousands of children at the border from their parents? Dana, I just think it was a poor choice, a poor framing by Ocasio-Cortez that allowed -- and she said the shrieking Republicans to blow back at her. But, do you think that she has a point?"

And then later, she tries -- well, no, that's actually not what I meant. That can work for some people. And some people will defend you when you do that. But there's no -- there's like three Democrats who are defending her. So I think that's when you know that you are out there on a limb, and then you're like Bugs Bunny sawing off the end. I think that Pelosi, as a speaker, has a choice to make. Remember, they've had this several times. Are they going to try to get these younger members in check? I don't think so. I mean, because AOC's -- she's her own phenomenon. And I don't think she minds at all the controversy. She just let's it roll right off her back. She doesn't mind what she's saying is a false equivalence. She doesn't care. It actually fuels her."

Who is a biggest expert on anti-Semitism, AOC or Israel? Because right now she's criticizing Trump, right? Basically, that's what she's doing. Israel just named a town after Trump, right?"

Trump is a bomb thrower. She's got a talent. But the fact is, the talent has to be how to do it correctly. And she's got to own up to her mistakes. She made a mistake. Unless she thinks like concentration and concentration camp means thinking really hard, it doesn't mean that. And by the way, buried in all of this is she has no solution for these temporary encampments. Which, by the way, Obama had as well and used the same place, which is -- if you don't have a place to put these people then they just come right in. So you're basically saying you're for no borders, if you're against -- just these -- the temporary holding. And it's so mean to the people who work with these -- work with the people, the agents. I mean, are they concentration camp guards? Is that what you're inferring? I'd like to see her apologize. She should person up."

Apparently, ICE was surprised by. We know that Kirstjen Nielsen and Ron Vitiello, with the former ICE director, both were reluctant to do this. That's why they were forced out.

Then change that policy because my tax dollars are paying your salary and you should earn that dollar. The policy of ICE after final order of deportation is such that within 90 days they institute removal proceedings. And, unless the subject voluntarily, basically, leaves on their own, they actually have no duty to do so. It is ICE's duty to come within 90 days and institute those removals. And you basically get a letter in the mail and it says meet here at this time, and it's kind of like a self-surrender. So if she has an issue with that too, then why don't you change it? Why don't you garner some type of collective cogent agreement on the hill rather than loving your livestreaming and not knowing what you're talking about and making inflammatory false equivalency that are horrendously offensive?"

Only thing she's offered, she wants to abolish ICE, she says global warming is pushing the migrants north, and she says we're running concentration camps. She a member of Congress, we forget sometimes because she sounds like a bomb thrower on cable. She can do something. She hasn't sponsored one piece of legislation at all. And now she's backpedaling and trying to distinguish between it's a concentration camp versus a death camp. She's really losing this issue. She's dragged her party so far to the left on impeachment, on global warming and on the border. Some of these positions nationally that she's taken to are unelectable. And she's been sparring with Pelosi. Her best friend has been accused of anti-Semitism. Yes, on the whole, maybe she offers a lot of youth enthusiasm, fund raising, fresh glamour, perhaps, but on balance, I don't think she's been beneficial to the Democrat party."

And then, you have liberal actor John Cusack who shared an anti-Semitic cartoon on twitter. The cartoon showing a giant hand with a Star of David pushing down a group of people with the words to learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize. Cusack added his own sentiment writing, quote, follow the money. Cusack eventually deleting the tweet and blaming it on a bot. I don't know, Dana. Where do you want to begin there?"

They would maybe have a small group of friends and they hung out together and they, you know, were subscribers to the National Review and then fast forward. There's the Reagan revolution, OK? You can see a little bit more. There's television. You've got Fox News. Social media, however, has been the great equalizer, I believe, for conservatives. So, you now have exposure of this kind of thing and an ability to talk about it and it gets out there and it makes -- I think it makes people pretty uncomfortable -- that's unfair, that's unfair. But there can't be two sets of rules for people that are conservatives or liberal. Like we're all put on this planet. Life is hard. We should all treat each other really well. But when conservatives do something that is considered out of bounds, they just get pummeled. The left kind of runs the culture and they protect one another from any sort of criticism."

They say, you know, hey, you legitimize Fox, or you're covering up, you know, for some of the things that they object to hearing from Fox News. But I think racism on all sides has to be called out. And that kind of attitude towards Lawrence is just - - it's not acceptable. That to me, it is so damning that they feel the need to go to that extent. You know, so they're mad at Fox News. They're mad at Lawrence, maybe for working here. I think if you go to the root of what they're talking about is similar to what the candidates who refuse to appear on Fox News say, which is that, you know, if you appear on Fox News again, you give some legitimacy to Fox News. This is madness. Because, in fact, to my mind, at least I'm talking to people, I'm expressing my views. I think Lawrence is expressing his views. Now, Lawrence and I don't agree on everything. But Lawrence has a legitimate right to speak his truth, why don't you want to hear? So to me that's intolerance coming from the Left. I can't agree with you on the young man from Harvard, by the way. I just think to me, I mean in the Ralph Northam situation, as Dana says, we got to be equal. I think Democrats - the two Democratic Senators in the state called for him to resign. I think lots of people have been highly critical. But he was elected Governor, and under the law of our country, he gets to stay if he doesn't resign."

And it feels horrible to be told that and to be pushed into a box and for them to assume that they know better than you, because that's the greatest form of those bonds that they tell everyone else to kind of free themselves with from. And you mentioned earlier, I think it's a larger picture. They're not just representing a network, but because they're mad at Trump, they're not mad at this. They're mad at him. They blame everything for it. That footage made me sick to my stomach and I feel so horrible for Lawrence in that moment. And remember, we talked about after the terrible shooting at the country music festival when Jason Aldean is performing, and I had a close friend say to my face, \"I'm glad it happened at a Country Music Festival, because now maybe they'll be gun laws\".

But I accepted her apology, I defended Joy Behar, when she had gotten in trouble, I think, over anti-Christian remarks. I can't remember. But I - and I do that and I accept their apologies knowing they will never return that favor to us. The Kyle thing is also different in that. It was a kind of a private thing that he has disowned when he was 16. And I do think that as awful as the things were - that were said, you should accept the apology, especially Harvard. I mean, if Harvard gets found guilty of discrimination against Asian- Americans should you cancel the whole institution? Should it closed down because they were they were racist against Asians? If our civil civilization eliminates forgiveness or reject apologies and you're in favor of just canceling people, you're going to see more violence and more suicide. Because if you can't let people have a second chance in life, they're going to kill themselves and we've seen that already. I think the racism is ignored on the Left, because it's the media's team, so they carve out exceptions for people, they carve out exceptions for racism, they carve out exceptions for sexism. I mean, Weinstein got away with everything until like he couldn't get away with it. Homophobia, obviously, with Joy Reid. Violence against women, I mean Teddy Kennedy made it a long way after Chappaquiddick. So there's always been a double standard.

The next day the 55-year-old was found dead in his hotel room. This happened in the Terra Linda Resort in Sosua. Joseph's brother Jason says, Joseph just had a physical. He was in \"Very good shape\" and he had no issues. They now want his body checked by a forensic pathologist here in the U.S. There have been nine mysterious deaths on the island over the last year. The Dominican Republic listed the cause of death, for most of these cases, as heart attacks or pulmonary edema - lungs filling up with fluid. But the families say their loved ones were healthy before vacationing. We know at least three had alcohol from minibars. We don't know if the other six did. Meanwhile Will Cox, whose mother Leyla Cox died suddenly in Punta Cana says he is waiting for the Dominican Attorney General to give final approval to get a sample of his mother's blood sent to the U.S. for toxicology tests. We are learning 54 members, by the way, of a Jimmy Buffett fan club also got sick while traveling to Punta Cana in April. The members swam or had a drink in the same resort swim-up bar pool. And earlier this month, at least five high school seniors on a trip from Oklahoma, became ill after eating at a Japanese restaurant at the Hard Rock Hotel in Punta Cana where two Americans died. The State Department, Dana, has not issued a new travel warning for the Dominican Republic.
