For two years, this city, the city of Washington has been utterly consumed by the far-reaching investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. The business of running the government and improving the lives of the people who live here - those have been a distant second for two years. Tonight the Mueller era is ending. At 5:00 p.m. this afternoon, Robert Mueller delivered the report to the Attorney General of the United States, William Barr. Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Mueller report has not been released yet, but there are some things we know about its contents.

      "sentences": "Well, we really went know yet what is in the report. There are a lot of calls for people to be transparent about it. But one of the interesting things we found out today is that there are no new indictments that are coming from the Special Counsel. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the reason why that is significant if you take a step back and you think about what brought us here, several years ago political operation that was secretly bought and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and The Democratic National Committee to claim that Donald Trump was an agent of Russia. This was fed to the media, who largely took it uncritically and they accepted it and they pushed it right back out. And then it was weaponized by some of the highest levels of our Federal government and was used to justify wiretaps against the Trump campaign affiliates, the placing of the human informants against the campaign, and all sorts of actions that were pretty extreme. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Eventually, it led to this Special Counsel, and for years we've had the slow drip of stories claiming that when it all came out, we'd find that that Donald Trump was definitely, the evidence showed, an agent of Russia. Learning that there are no more indictments coming down, if that were true, if it were that he was an agent of Russia, you wouldn't just be seeing one indictment, you'd be seeing dozens, if not hundreds of indictments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Because every time he would go and contemplate a certain action, they would say, you can't do that. You are obstructing the Mueller probe. That is now removed and that will change the dynamic in D.C. So that is one. Two, no indictments. And obviously, Mollie Hemingway went through why that is important. Three, I think another thing that has been overlooked, you know, Attorney General, Bill Barr sent a letter to Congress and he pointed out as he required to do under the Special Counsel guidelines that he had no cause at any point to overrule any of Mueller's decisions in the end. So that puts to paid the other vast conspiracy theory going around the last couple of years that somehow Mueller was never going to be able to complete the work, that obviously there would be political interference -- somebody -- Remember everyone was saying we needed to have the legislation in Congress to protect the Special Counsel?

Yes. We have seen that whether it was Papadopoulos and others. But he ended up spending what? A week and a few days in jail? Nothing to be trifled with. But his life was essentially destroyed. Carter Page who had James Comey and all of these other people. When you talk about the weapons of mass destruction, what I think about is, how many people in the government did we trust, that they know, that there were weapons of mass destruction? Well, how many people in this FBI and Justice Department did we all think we could trust that if they are going to get a FISA warrant and they are going to surveil an American citizen, boy, they are going to have the facts, Tucker.",

What also has been happening here at the Justice Department has been parallel series of investigations run by the Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz and they have been looking at allegations that the surveillance warrant program with the courts was potentially abused during the 2016 election, also the leaking of classified information by the senior individuals including James Comey at the FBI and also allegations that senior FBI officials took gifts from reporters in violation of the ethics rules. Finally, what I will say is that when we have the benefit of hindsight and additional information, many of it - much of it coming from court transcripts now and lawsuits is that in the fall of 2016, there was this fever pitch about Russia collusion in the media and it was really billed as an intelligence product.

Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity is next. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "utterance": "This is a Fox News Alert. For close to two years, American politics has been stuck in a state of suspended animation. For two years, this city, the city of Washington has been utterly consumed by the far-reaching investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. The business of running the government and improving the lives of the people who live here - those have been a distant second for two years. Tonight the Mueller era is ending. At 5:00 p.m. this afternoon, Robert Mueller delivered the report to the Attorney General of the United States, William Barr. Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” The Mueller report has not been released yet, but there are some things we know about its contents. Since we wanted to start tonight, our special coverage with Mollie Hemingway who is a senior editor of \"The Federalist\" and is following every twist and turn of this story since the first day. Mollie, thanks a lot for coming on. What strikes you about what we know now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Well, we really went know yet what is in the report. There are a lot of calls for people to be transparent about it. But one of the interesting things we found out today is that there are no new indictments that are coming from the Special Counsel. And the reason why that is significant if you take a step back and you think about what brought us here, several years ago political operation that was secretly bought and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and The Democratic National Committee to claim that Donald Trump was an agent of Russia. This was fed to the media, who largely took it uncritically and they accepted it and they pushed it right back out. And then it was weaponized by some of the highest levels of our Federal government and was used to justify wiretaps against the Trump campaign affiliates, the placing of the human informants against the campaign, and all sorts of actions that were pretty extreme. Eventually, it led to this Special Counsel, and for years we've had the slow drip of stories claiming that when it all came out, we'd find that that Donald Trump was definitely, the evidence showed, an agent of Russia. Learning that there are no more indictments coming down, if that were true, if it were that he was an agent of Russia, you wouldn't just be seeing one indictment, you'd be seeing dozens, if not hundreds of indictments."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "And justified indictments, by the way. If the President of the United States was an agent of a foreign power, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yes, hopefully, we would be taking that very seriously."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, we would be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "And we had been promised this largely. We've been promised that there is evidence. You've had members -- high-ranking Member of Congress claiming that there was evidence and to find out that in fact, there no evidence to support such an indictment against anyone closely affiliated with the President. We have had all sorts of other people caught up in this probe, but not for the treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election. That is significant. No matter comes out of this now, and there should be people who are held accountable for having uncritically spread this theory without evidence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I agree with you completely. Of the many threads in this, maybe the most significant is the fact, not the speculation, the fact that a presidential campaign was spied upon by the government of a rival party. Barack Obama's administration spied on Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and the pretext was Russian collusion, but they did it. Why isn't the press more curious about this? Why has former President Obama not testified about why this was allowed? Why don't we know more?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, part of the reason why I don't think we have had more answers from President Obama is because of that first issue. The press had been remarkably incurious about this. Normally, this would be the story that reporters would wait a lifetime for, finding out that the FBI was so politicized that they were actually running informants or spying on a presidential campaign that they had successfully secured a wiretap against an individual who -- it's worth noting, we've just found out today -- there are no further charges coming. That means, that wiretap was run against the individual, and there might have actually been several wiretaps against individuals with no indictments coming. That means they were harassed by their Federal government and that they were not what the Federal government had claimed and I think that's important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, wait, I mean, that is kind of it right there. So the proof is in the indictment and look thereof. If I violate your civil liberties, if I make it impossible for you to make a living. If I destroy your reputation, such that you can't have a job again -- and they have done it to a number of people. And then I don't indict you for the crimes everyone is accusing you of, doesn't that mean that I was wrong and you were right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly the evidence does not suggest that they were right to have secured wiretaps against these people and they behaved poorly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "It's also interesting because you hear people saying, \"Oh, okay, well, I guess, Mueller is wrapping up, let's just move on from this.\" Good to know that President Trump is not an agent of Putin. As if there weren't real harm or damage caused by people weaponizing this information operation that was a Hillary Clinton campaign operation. As if the country weren't harmed by it, as if our Attorney General weren't completely kneecapped, as if they didn't have people having to pay a lot of money to defend themselves against this investigation and as if you didn't have people really undermining an administration for several years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "People need to be held accountable for what they did to spread this theory and that's true both inside the government and outside the government. And the media want to just quickly move on and quickly find a way to justify their behavior. But I don't think people forget what they were subjected to for the last several years, and how people who were skeptical of this crazy collusion conspiracy theory were treated when now we see, no more indictments."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "They injected poison into the bloodstream of the country, and by the way, you are absolutely right to note, the former Attorney General, Jeff Sessions whose reputation was completely destroyed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Because he was supposedly an agent of Putin. I think people have forgotten --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right, and he was attacked by the President and he faithfully served because of this investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, he should have not recused himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I agree, but I mean, he was an honorable man and he has really been hurt by this. There are so many victims of this and I hope that we take time -- somebody takes time to apologize to each one of them and try to make it right. Mollie Hemingway, it's great to see you tonight. Thank you for starting off the show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Great to be here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, as you just heard, the Mueller report has arrived with no further indictments according to a senior DOJ official. That is it. No one else will be indicted in this investigation for collusion or anything else, so to repeat, after all of these -- years of it -- not a single American citizen has been charged with anything related to Russian collusion. Not one person. Not Michael Flynn, not Roger Stone, not George Papadopoulos, not Paul Manafort, not Carter Page and not Donald Trump. Many of these people have had lives ruined by the Mueller investigation. Some could die in prison. Not one of them colluded with Russia. The people on TV have been lying to you. They will deny it now. They will tell you it was always about Trump's taxes or some foreign real estate deal or hush money he paid to a girlfriend. That is a crock. This investigation was always from day one about collusion with Russia, about betraying this country. They told us that for years and we have the tape."

      "speaker": "CHRIS MATTHEWS, ANCHOR, MSBNC",

      "speaker": "JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRENNAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it was, in terms of looking at what was going on with the Russians and whether or not U.S. persons were actively collaborating, colluding, cooperating and involved in a conspiracy with them or not, but also if there is going to be any member of --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATTHEWS",
      "utterance": "Did you see enough at that stage to believe that there would now -- that that would result in indictments once investigated?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRENNAN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So that was the former CIA Director, one of countless retired intel officials you see parading across your screen every night. All of them paid by the MSNBC or CNN to tow the party line. All of them know better. They are lying -- it is a habit many of them picked up years ago. Members of Congress did the same. To pick one among a thousand examples. Here is Tennessee Steve Cohen telling us most of the Trump family is bound for prison."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. STEVE COHEN, D-TENN.",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they are getting closer to knowing that the truth is going to come out and that there was activities with the Trump campaign and Russia and releasing the hacks and guiding them to the states and the localities where they came from. Some of that was Jared Kushner's responsibilities. Some of it was Donald, Jr. I think you're going to probably see indictments of both of those people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That man is a sitting Member of Congress. He is wearing necktie. He is on television. People believed him and why wouldn't they? He is an authority figure in this country and he was lying. So was Senator Richard Blumenthal who has spent years bringing shame to the state of Connecticut. He embarrassed himself further with his mock certainty on this and many, many other occasions."
    },

      "speaker": "SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D-CONN.",
      "utterance": "There are indictments in this President's future. They're coming. Whether they are after his presidency or during it, obviously the Department of Justice said, they cannot indict a sitting President."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "And of course, there was Howard Dean, he is the former Governor of Vermont. Dean was also, if you can remember that far back to 2004, a presidential candidate. At one point, it looked like he was going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. He went on to run the DNC. He is on television constantly. People have long whispered that Howard Dean is not all there. They say he yells so much because he can't think very well. They claim he is so slow it takes him hour and a half to watch \"60 Minutes.\" You don't want to believe any of that is true, it sounds cruel, on the other hand, they might be right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWARD DEAN, FORMER DNC CHAIRMAN",
      "utterance": "We believe we may well have a criminal in the White House and the next step is going to be the Trump family itself. I expect that there is a good likelihood that Jared Kushner will be indicted for money laundering and then we are going to have to see how far the Russian involvement goes. This is serious business. These people are undermining our democracy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It was never serious business. Another lie. It was ludicrous. It was always ludicrous. But no matter how much evidence you muster, you will never convince Congressman Eric Swalwell of that. Swalwell is the original collusion truther. There is no element of the Russia conspiracy that Swallwell -- who has been on this show many times -- isn't eager to believe and magnify. He really ought to have an overnight show on AM radio, he'd be able to tell us how Putin seriously secretly runs Bilderberg. CNN, of course, loves Eric Swalwell. For years, that channel has broadcast uncritically, virtually every lunatic claim Swalwell ever made. Here is one example."

      "speaker": "REP. ERIC SWALWELL, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "It's looking more and more, Wolf, that Donald Trump was a part of a criminal campaign, a criminal transition and now presides over a criminal presidency."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "A criminal presidency. What is criminal is what just happened. We have lived through three separate investigations in to Russia collusion; not just Mueller, but a Committee in the House and a Committee in the Senate, and they spent years looking in this. And in the end, they found nothing. But during that time, this country, the country they are supposed to be running has become obviously and measurably worse. Suicide, drug ODs are up. Life expectancy is falling. The borders are a mess. We have no clue who lives in this country to the tune of millions of people. Maybe tens of millions. We have no idea. The schools are a joke. You wouldn't send your kids to them if you had a choice. Infrastructure is crumbling. Hundreds of thousands of Americans sleep outside every night. So what do our leaders talking about? What do they spend their time obsessing over? What do they get TV bookings to rant about? Some irrelevant meeting with a minor Russian lawyer in Trump Tower three years ago. The New York City Subway barely works. The largest city in the United States smells like garbage. People are fleeing it. What does Bill de Blasio, the mayor, talk about? He is ranting about Putin. This has been a disaster. How can we let people who are responsible for it continue as if it never happened? How can Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff keep their seats in the House of Representatives? They should resign. How can Jeff Zucker remain at CNN after we now know much of what his network told us for two years is a total lie? And it is a total lie. And what about the victims of this monstrosity? There are many. Roger Stone is facing life in prison. He was indicted by an investigation designed to find collusion -- indicted on minor charges. He was dragged from his own home in a morning FBI raid. They put an amphibious vehicle outside his house and pointed an automatic weapon in his -- all face to find collusion. But there was no collusion. Stone is still looking at life in prison. Where is Roger Stone's pardon? His pardon from the President? Let's hope it comes very soon. The Mueller investigation is over as of tonight, but the wreckage remains. For the sake of this country, let's clean it up quickly and move on. Chris Hahn is a radio host and former staffer to Senator Chuck Schumer and he joins us tonight. Chris, I want to congratulate you, you have been one of the people from the very beginning who said I'm very concerned that there was criminal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and I think that's a fair concern. Whenever our leaders sell us out to another country, we ought to be upset about it. Tonight, we know that's not true. No one was indicted for it, unequivocally, no one indicted, how are you celebrating this great news?"

I don't care on the border and I don't care if they are Russian agents. I care about American citizens. The point of our government is to protect them.

They would suffer some kind of reputational consequence. But not so for the media elite who have been leading the charge of the story, who had a lot of influence on the security state officials like Andrew McCabe who launched one of the investigations in to Trump at the FBI. You know, listen to Andrew McCabe on his recent book tour. It almost sounds like he is a devoted reader of David Frum at \"The Atlantic,\" whose - - Frum, you know, he worked from George W. Bush.

The one exception and the candidate that I am covering this week is Tulsi Gabbard who just last week said something to the effect of, the people who have been calling Trump Russia's puppet have actually distracted from the reality that Trump has actually contradicted much of his campaign rhetoric and taken aggressive actions toward Russia. And that is what the Democrats should have been emphasizing this entire time rather than going down this global -- this conspiracy rabbit hole."

      "utterance": "So a couple of things that the prior guests have pointed. One, the important thing is -- it is done -- two years on. And that matters for a couple of reasons because it is not just the fact that it removes this cloud hanging over Washington, but it also enables the President to do a lot of things that he has been constrained from doing, right? Because every time he would go and contemplate a certain action, they would say, you can't do that. You are obstructing the Mueller probe. That is now removed and that will change the dynamic in D.C. So that is one. Two, no indictments. And obviously, Mollie Hemingway went through why that is important. Three, I think another thing that has been overlooked, you know, Attorney General, Bill Barr sent a letter to Congress and he pointed out as he required to do under the Special Counsel guidelines that he had no cause at any point to overrule any of Mueller's decisions in the end. So that puts to paid the other vast conspiracy theory going around the last couple of years that somehow Mueller was never going to be able to complete the work, that obviously there would be political interference -- somebody -- Remember everyone was saying we needed to have the legislation in Congress to protect the Special Counsel? He was never in any risk of that. And basically the Barr transmission proves it. It also suggests reading the tea leaves that perhaps the Mueller report is pretty straight up if Bill Barr didn't feel that there was anything he had to intervene on."

      "speaker": "STRASSEL",

We should have finished all of this and had a conclusion more than a year ago when our Congressional committees after months and months of diligent work admitted that they could have find no evidence to support any of the claims that people have made on the other side. And if you just step back from that -- and we also should have known from the work that Robert Mueller was doing himself. Look, court case after court case dealing with the central figures here. None of which in any of the filings, any of the court documents had any reference to any of the main collusion conspiracy theories that have been out there. And if anyone had taken a deep breath, this would have all been very obvious some time ago. But there is an entire industry and you mention some Congressmen, you mention the media that have an interest in riling this up every day as the way to delegitimize this presidency and not just this presidency, but his agenda as well, too, which is a very clever way of doing it. You say the guy at the very top is corrupt, and therefore everything he is doing is corrupt. So there is a political advantage for them having done this all these years."

The Mueller report has been delivered. The investigation is over. The report now sits with the Attorney General. There are no indictment for collusion or anything else coming next.

And maybe to his credit, we need to see the details of the report. Maybe Robert Mueller actually followed the facts, and this is an important point. You and I were on together in about mid-January, and remember the night that Robert Mueller to his great credit came forward and said the BuzzFeed story was wrong, that claimed that President Trump had directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. That was critical because A. CNN and others ran with that BuzzFeed report and said if true, this could lead to impeachment. Robert Mueller was saying it's not true. Secondly, I think it exposed, not just as you played that clip from Adam Schiff and other Democrats who got ahead of the facts. There are an awful lot of people in our business who got way ahead of the facts."

And maybe now, they are going to do some soul searching to say okay, that worked for them politically, but Robert Mueller's report now essentially clears the President. Again, if, if, if they are going to all of a sudden say, \"Hey, we actually like Bob Mueller. We like this report. He followed the facts.\" I think all sides here have been jumping ahead of this, Tucker, when in fact maybe everybody should have taken a breath and you have been urging this for a long time that there was this hysteria about everything associated with Russia and were there contacts between Trump officials and Russia? Yes. We have seen that whether it was Papadopoulos and others. But he ended up spending what? A week and a few days in jail? Nothing to be trifled with. But his life was essentially destroyed. Carter Page who had James Comey and all of these other people. When you talk about the weapons of mass destruction, what I think about is, how many people in the government did we trust, that they know, that there were weapons of mass destruction? Well, how many people in this FBI and Justice Department did we all think we could trust that if they are going to get a FISA warrant and they are going to surveil an American citizen, boy, they are going to have the facts, Tucker."

It will be the second version of the Saturday Night Massacre. None of that happened. Yes, did the President tweet, did he say it was a witch hunt? Did he get in there and fight back? Yes, he did.

And are there two separate systems of justice in this country? One for the elite and one for everybody else. And it looks like there is two systems of justice and it is very distressing to me as someone who fought hard, alone most of the time, with very little resources for women and children and others who had been victimized to see that the justice system has been so misused.

As you've noted earlier in the show, the report was delivered to the Attorney General here at the Justice Department, and more specifically, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicated that he is recommending against further indictments in this case and that is effectively the end of the Russia prosecution. What also has been happening here at the Justice Department has been parallel series of investigations run by the Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz and they have been looking at allegations that the surveillance warrant program with the courts was potentially abused during the 2016 election, also the leaking of classified information by the senior individuals including James Comey at the FBI and also allegations that senior FBI officials took gifts from reporters in violation of the ethics rules. Finally, what I will say is that when we have the benefit of hindsight and additional information, many of it - much of it coming from court transcripts now and lawsuits is that in the fall of 2016, there was this fever pitch about Russia collusion in the media and it was really billed as an intelligence product. But what I know now from my reporting is that it was not intelligence.

But you have asked the operative question. What do we do now? My expectation is that we have to have a thorough review of how we got here? How we allowed political opposition research to fuel an investigation that was never found in any fact or reality. And then I think we need to seek apology from the Democrats in Congress who said there was stone cold evidence of collusion, that they had demonstrable proof that these things were happening, and if you look at all the work the President has tried to do around the world to end wars, resolve conflicts and reduce nuclear proliferation, a lot of that work has been hindered by the lies being told in this country that can be traced right back to the DNC and the Clinton campaign."

We need Senate confirmation of FISA judges and then ultimately, we need to make the opinions published. You know who filed that bill, Tucker? Adam Schiff. But now he won't cosponsor his own legislation to reform the FISA process because he doesn't want the same rules that applied to President Obama to apply to President Trump. It's a double standard. It's hypocrisy. And it doesn't allow us to move past this moment. The country never wants to have to go through 22 months like this again where we are torn apart based on a lie, political dirt and then we have the blessing of our intelligence community and FISA courts over something that never should have begun."

But that doesn't mean it was harmless. Plenty of people had their careers and names destroyed by Federal investigators desperate to do the bidding of who knows who? But it happened.

There were 34 people and three companies that were either indicted or pled guilty including 26 Russian nationals, three Russian companies and six former Trump advisers. Five of the six former advisers pleaded guilty. But as you say, not a single allegation related to collusion with Russia to impact the 2016 election. Former Trump campaign Foreign Policy adviser, George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October of 2017 of making false statements to the FBI. He was sentenced to 14 days in jail. Paul Manafort, Trump's former Campaign Chair was indicted on 25 counts of faking documents to obtain loans and financial crimes in connection to his work for Ukrainian politicians. Manafort will serve about six and a half years in prison. Former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates was named alongside Manafort accused of finance crimes. Former National Security adviser, Michael Flynn pleaded guilty in December of 2017 to making false statements to the FBI. Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former lawyer pleaded guilty to tax and bank fraud and campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Donald Trump, and finally Roger Stone, a long-time Trump adviser was indicted for obstruction making false statements and witness tampering. Former Trump aide, Michael Caputo condemned the Russia probe for forcing his family out of their home and crushing his children with the immense legal costs associated with defending himself and themselves -- Tucker."

You watch the other coverage, and really, it is just they are reading every hour -- they are reading from the same -- Maddow clearly says what she wants to say, everybody else seems to be reading from some script that Jeff Zucker wrote. How implicated are these channels in the travesty that we just saw."

They cheered this whole thing on. They shell out the money for all of these conferences for people like John Meacham, who is -- I mean, I like John Meacham, he is a really talented writer, but when someone like John Meacham got caught up in this at MSNBC, I was looking this. He said, this is the very definition basically of treason, what Donald Trump did. He is a historian. This guy is like a Pulitzer Prize winning writer. When someone like that can get caught and ensnared in this frothy frenzy to get Trump, we have a big problem on our hands. And I am so glad. I watched every minute of your show tonight, Tucker, as I do every night, but what you said about the need for consequences and repercussions, it's just like things like Jussie Smollett or the UVAS rape case or what happened with the Kavanaugh leaks. There needs to be repercussions either the public needs to decide maybe we should watch something else or there needs to be a criminal investigation by Bill Barr into how this all went down. The FISA warrants, the leaks that happen -- all of this stuff has to be looked at. This cannot happen to another President of the United States."

But I wonder how can Jeff Zucker continue to run that channel after what we just saw? So they brought in newly released people from the government who had run our agencies, who clearly were getting information about this investigation, and putting it on the air as propaganda. It turned out to be lies. How can you do that?"

And the colluding and the state run TV, it's like, they are working for the deep state or the elite state or whatever you want to call it. So they are colluding and Trump is like, wait a second, I'm just a guy from New York. I came in and I actually want to make this country better. I'm like my own man and I know I'm going to tick you off, but I actually want America to thrive and be prosperous. And really, well thought of people who are smart people are throwing the word \"treason,\" \"traitor.\" The guy should be in handcuffs. He should be let out of the Oval Office -- all these people tonight should look at themselves in the mirror and think, \"Maybe I need to re-examine how I speak on these issues in the future.\" Not that we don't all make mistakes.

Why did he Putin dash -- whatever the criticism. Maybe it's because he realized he had an obligation to the American people to look past Mueller as hard as it was and actually try to do the right thing in the moment for the country. They never gave him that benefit of the doubt and he deserved that benefit of the doubt, and he never got it from them."

But I think now, it is going to turn to, \"Oh, it's not transparent.\" \"Barr was brought in to be the clean-up man here.\" \"This isn't a serious review.\" So I think again, like we are seeing on the socialism lurch, they are lurching towards socialism, slouching towards socialism. I think, in this case they are going to be in a very precarious position with the internal anger from the activist who thought, you know, we finally got the Road Runner. We finally caught Wile E. Coyote. It's like the Acme TNT. We finally go it and it's like, beep, beep. He is gone again. So I think they are going to freak. I mean, I think they are going to freak and I don't think much is going to change, but it is going to mean they are going to move more radical on the policy front and try to whip up more enthusiasm that way. I don't see what else they do. I mean, to put all their hope in the Southern District? Are we going back to that now? Southern District of New York?"

I will be interested to see what 2020 Democrat would be willing to pivot away from this and say, \"Okay, we have always said that Bob Mueller should be allowed to do his work.\" He was allowed to do his work. Let's let the work stand. Let's now turn to how we could better govern the country. Like, which Democrat is going to do that? Is there any of them that would do that? And if they can't do that? They are going to miss out on all of these people saying, \"Wait, you just said that Mueller was supposed to finish his investigation.\" Now, he has. So let's wait, let's see what Bill Barr does. I do think it could take some time, Tucker, they have to redact anything that is executive privilege, anything that is grand jury, anything that is classified or intelligence.
