Now that seems to be a little bit stuck, some would say a bit of a mess. But actually, when you contrast that with how he's handling foreign policy, international relations, America security, there's a real contrast there. He's really showing very strong and consistent leadership, not just on this trip but as you go back to the response to Syria's use of chemical weapons, there's a sense of confidence and assurance about how he's handling foreign relations that I think is really striking. And what you saw in this trip I think is a really consistent message coming out, which is number one, is America's security. You went to the Middle East and said, right, let's get together and fight ISIS. He put that in the top of the agenda. He then goes to Europe and says the same thing to NATO. Now, the difference is in how those different audiences has responded. The allies that we have, the traditional allies and the Gulf and the Arab states and all that -- remember the 15 Muslim leaders that he spoke to, they really responded to that new American leadership or as in NATO, this is actually a different message and they weren't too keen on hearing it. But actually from the President's point of view, it was the same story which is putting American security first and America leading an effort to fight terrorism around the world, I thought it was great.",

You've got the first part, where you have these allies of America who for a long time now during the Obama years thought that basically America had abandoned them, was actually much more interested in forging ties with Iran and had really changed fundamentally the position that they had come accustomed to, which is America by their side in fighting their threats. And so there was a huge sense of relief that President Trump was going back to the previous strong alliance with those nations and actually enhancing it and saying we're going to go further. But the second part of the trip in Europe, I thought the audience that didn't particularly like what they heard and there was some rocky moments there. But you know, honestly, I thought what President Trump said there, particularly in relation to NATO country stepping up to the mark and putting their money behind the commitment to common defense in Europe. I thought that's perfectly reasonable. Now, they may not like hearing it and they may not like hearing it very directly from the President, but it's a fit perfectly fair point.

U.K. police have released the images now, the surveillance images from the arena the night of the attack. We're getting a closer look at this man, 22-year-old Salman Abedi, who is dead, he killed 22 in the arena that night, wounded 120 others.

And of course, it's true that the overwhelming part of our anger of what happened should be directed at the person responsible and the movement responsible. The militant Islamist movement that caused this, of course, we should be mainly angry with them but I think that British people can actually be -- can save some of their anger if you like for their own authorities. Because the truth is, that in this case, just as we've seen with some of the other attacks we've seen, it turns out that this person was known to the authorities. In fact, it's been reported that his activities were reported to an anti-terror hotline years ago. He was traveling back and forth, it's been reported to Libya and Syria. You know, there were multiple warnings about this person and still, he slipped through the net. Now, the British Security Services kind of unbelievably in my view, in the last few days, in response to some of the criticism that has been building have actually leaked the information that right now in the U.K. there are 23,000 militant Islamist Jihadist in the U.K. and that they are only able to keep track of about 3 thousand. They've actually put that information out there. I just think that is not good enough.

And so, I think, that puts America in a stronger position. But also, you've got an administration now that seems to me to be really focused on this threat and what you've got is a couple of things. You've got the President putting in place a really strong professional team around him on homeland security and seeing his role not to micromanage them and direct them what to do to achieve political ends but to let them get on with the job and his role is basically to give them support and most importantly, to get them resources. You saw that in the president's budget, more of resources so that more of these threats can be tracked and stopped before they actually end up killing people. So I think that they're on -- they're on the right track with that. There's one further advantage I think that we have in America compared to Europe is that sense of social integration and social cohesion. One really striking thing that you saw highlighted again with this Manchester attack. But there's a report on it that was published a few months ago in the U.K., that's a huge problem with a lack of integration in many parts of the U.K. and rest of Europe and that is not nearly as bad here in America, thankfully.",

And so far, the only criminal acts that have taken place as a lawyer that I see is the leakers who are leaking classified information.",

Hello everyone and thanks for joining us on this Memorial Day Weekend. I'm Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiromo and this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" President Trump fresh off his 9-day tour of the Middle East and Europe, calling the trip a home run but how did it go over with our allies? Steve Hilton join us live. Also, the CBO scores the House GOP Healthcare Bill. So what's next for the ObamaCare overhaul and what does it mean for tax reform? I'll talk to the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Kevin Brady. And new development in the investigation into alleged connections between Russia and the Trump campaign. We will hear from a Republican member of the House Intel Committee to find out where things go from here, that and more as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" President Trump returning to White House yesterday, follows his nine-day overseas trip, his first as Commander in Chief.

      "utterance": "All right, Steve, let's get right to the President touting this trip as a success. Many of even his biggest critics looking at this trip as a success, he called it a home run. Was it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "I think that was pretty much a fair assessment. If you cut -- you opened the show by focusing quite right yet I think in terms the real priorities for our viewers of you know, the domestic agenda, what's going to happen with the economy and the legislative agenda and healthcare and all that stuff? Now that seems to be a little bit stuck, some would say a bit of a mess. But actually, when you contrast that with how he's handling foreign policy, international relations, America security, there's a real contrast there. He's really showing very strong and consistent leadership, not just on this trip but as you go back to the response to Syria's use of chemical weapons, there's a sense of confidence and assurance about how he's handling foreign relations that I think is really striking. And what you saw in this trip I think is a really consistent message coming out, which is number one, is America's security. You went to the Middle East and said, right, let's get together and fight ISIS. He put that in the top of the agenda. He then goes to Europe and says the same thing to NATO. Now, the difference is in how those different audiences has responded. The allies that we have, the traditional allies and the Gulf and the Arab states and all that -- remember the 15 Muslim leaders that he spoke to, they really responded to that new American leadership or as in NATO, this is actually a different message and they weren't too keen on hearing it. But actually from the President's point of view, it was the same story which is putting American security first and America leading an effort to fight terrorism around the world, I thought it was great."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "It's such a great point, he really did start off the trip with a very strong tough stance on terror. As you mentioned telling those 50 Gulf leaders quote, \"terrorism is a threat, a bad threat to all humanity and together we will overcome that threat.\" So are you suggesting that was -- that message was received mixed as far as how that message was received abroad and here at home?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "It's -- I think the mix was not necessarily broad and home, it's actually the two parts of the trip abroad, if you -- if you see it that way. You've got the first part, where you have these allies of America who for a long time now during the Obama years thought that basically America had abandoned them, was actually much more interested in forging ties with Iran and had really changed fundamentally the position that they had come accustomed to, which is America by their side in fighting their threats. And so there was a huge sense of relief that President Trump was going back to the previous strong alliance with those nations and actually enhancing it and saying we're going to go further. But the second part of the trip in Europe, I thought the audience that didn't particularly like what they heard and there was some rocky moments there. But you know, honestly, I thought what President Trump said there, particularly in relation to NATO country stepping up to the mark and putting their money behind the commitment to common defense in Europe. I thought that's perfectly reasonable. Now, they may not like hearing it and they may not like hearing it very directly from the President, but it's a fit perfectly fair point. And I thought that you know, you could have predicted that they wouldn't like hearing it, but on the other hand that doesn't mean that President should not say it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Yes, and the big question now is that the President has returned to Washington, he's back to work, he's already tweeting this morning, Steve, is that whether that momentum will translate and come back here as he gets back to work in Washington. I want to turn back to terror this Manchester attack because we continue to learn more about that -- the attack and the terrorist. U.K. police have released the images now, the surveillance images from the arena the night of the attack. We're getting a closer look at this man, 22-year-old Salman Abedi, who is dead, he killed 22 in the arena that night, wounded 120 others. Prime Minister Theresa May urging Britons to remain vigilant in the wake of all this as we learn more about how this attack was played out and the attacker himself. What is the broader message that we begin to take away in aftermath of that brutal attack, Steve?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "I'm afraid to say, I don't think it is particularly reassuring one. Look, the wounds of Manchester -- you know, literarily is still very present and the pain and grief in the U.K. is still there. And of course, it's true that the overwhelming part of our anger of what happened should be directed at the person responsible and the movement responsible. The militant Islamist movement that caused this, of course, we should be mainly angry with them but I think that British people can actually be -- can save some of their anger if you like for their own authorities. Because the truth is, that in this case, just as we've seen with some of the other attacks we've seen, it turns out that this person was known to the authorities. In fact, it's been reported that his activities were reported to an anti-terror hotline years ago. He was traveling back and forth, it's been reported to Libya and Syria. You know, there were multiple warnings about this person and still, he slipped through the net. Now, the British Security Services kind of unbelievably in my view, in the last few days, in response to some of the criticism that has been building have actually leaked the information that right now in the U.K. there are 23,000 militant Islamist Jihadist in the U.K. and that they are only able to keep track of about 3 thousand. They've actually put that information out there. I just think that is not good enough. I think that what this whole thing is telling us is that when we hear politicians say we're doing everything we can to fight terrorism, that is simply not true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "And we continue to be concerned about what the risk is that we face here at home. And when you raise that point, Steve, about the fact that Abedi of known to authorities there, we heard this story before with attacks right here at home. How does this change the way we approach our security, and how do we prevent this from happening again? I know that's the big question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "I think that -- I think here in America, it seems that this whole issue has been taken much more seriously for longer -- I think particularly in the light of 9/11, where there's a thorough re-examination of now we handle these threats. And so, I think, that puts America in a stronger position. But also, you've got an administration now that seems to me to be really focused on this threat and what you've got is a couple of things. You've got the President putting in place a really strong professional team around him on homeland security and seeing his role not to micromanage them and direct them what to do to achieve political ends but to let them get on with the job and his role is basically to give them support and most importantly, to get them resources. You saw that in the president's budget, more of resources so that more of these threats can be tracked and stopped before they actually end up killing people. So I think that they're on -- they're on the right track with that. There's one further advantage I think that we have in America compared to Europe is that sense of social integration and social cohesion. One really striking thing that you saw highlighted again with this Manchester attack. But there's a report on it that was published a few months ago in the U.K., that's a huge problem with a lack of integration in many parts of the U.K. and rest of Europe and that is not nearly as bad here in America, thankfully."

Mr. Chairman, the CBO score making a lot of headband -- lot of headlines, I should say negative headlines. Is this another setback in the case of healthcare reform?"

They naturally have ObamaCare coverage, so just puzzles average people. What I think if you look close at what it says is that the House plan continues to lower premiums provide more immediate relief for people who were stuck in ObamaCare right now and will start to return control of health care out of Washington to the states back to the local communities. And at the end of the day, the important thing is that it allows House to bring this bill to the Senate, where we hope they'll continue to make improvements."

But just having wonder a few genomes didn't make any difference. So I was waiting until the technology changed. So, that first genome cost $100 million, now we're doing them for less than $1,000.

So we're going to inside map but we're finding correlation with all these diseases that we're discovering in healthy people in our clinic. So every day the information gets better.

We look at the body as a whole not just one tissue or one organ. We look at the integration of everything so from the MRI, we can measure the amount of organ fat that you have and that gives you a hint of how healthy you are and how healthy your organs are. You know, most people are just unaware how do we get aware of things. Medicine is based on you get symptoms, you get sick, and then you go to seek medical care."

And the hippocampus is the first one to start to -- to start to show signs of change with Alzheimer's disease, so we can measure your hippocampal volume very precisely and if it's below norms that's a hint that you might be starting down the road for Alzheimer's.

I know there's a lot of tension in Washington on the CBO numbers but look, health care is about people, it's about their lives, the numbers they care about is you know, do I have choices same plans, one to zero? You know, how much is this going to cost and can I afford to use it? And will I be able to see my local doctor and go to my local hospitals or do I have to drive hundreds of miles to get just basic care? And that's what House Republicans addressed in our plan, because ObamaCare is just collapsing in all those areas. I'm confident that Senate will continue to make improvement. They've good, smart people over there. They've learned a lot from the key changes and improvements we made, and I'm just optimistic at the end of the day, they'll get it done."

I hope that choices and decisions are made not from Washington but by the states, the local communities. I'm very hopeful that Americans who need healthcare, who don't get it at work and don't get it through a government program, the people we're trying to help actually have choices of plans, the premiums are affordable, but more importantly, out- of-pocket cost, you know, or something that works for them rather than Washington. So, look, I think considering Obamacare is imploding and we're just seeing prices skyrocket, and insurers flee the market. Look, status quo doing nothing isn't an option. Senate Republicans I'm confident are going to move forward on this."

In fact, we were sending them an additional $90 billion to continue to make improvements in certain age groups as well. And so, look, they've got all the tools and resources they need to deliver. And they know the urgency of it as well, I' m convinced."

First, I'm convinced the Senate is going to put their plan together and do it in a way that we can get it to the President's desk together. So, I actually think we're unified in the goal of delivering on that this summer. Secondly, I think it's important to get that $1 trillion of tax hikes out of the U.S. economy that's in the health care bill. That's critically important as well. But more important, I don't think people realize that the President, his team, the House and Senate, we're laser focused on tax form. We meet weekly as a larger group; our tax teams are meeting almost daily on this. We are focused on the timeline for delivering pro-growth, bold, permanent tax reform this year. Clearly, there is a lot of work to do --"

Look, we know -- we know tax reform is the biggest challenge of any generation. It is politically difficult, it is policy-wise a tough challenge as well. But look, the American public, they're just sick of the tax code we have today, and they're tired of watching all our jobs and companies move overseas, they want us to go bold and they want us to go now on tax reforms.

You know, and the public has seen a lot of these issues being talked about online and on T.V. and everywhere else, but in Washington, we are continuing to be just focused on delivering tax reform, we have to."

Every day there's another leak, another thing that we hear about, and many times we find out that they're not true. Which is why, if I could speak kind of broadly, why I'm so glad we appointed a special counsel to this? I mean, it takes it out to such a partisan arena. It takes it out where we don't have these accusations, many of them which are unfounded, puts it in professional hands, that someone that I think has bipartisan trust. I think that's a good thing. I'm glad we've done that."

Before I answer that question, it does dominate the headlines, and for those of us on the Intelligence Committee, there's still a lot of work to do. Oh, my heavens, we still live in a dangerous and a chaotic world. And I think to (INAUDIBLE) the verdict from some of these other important work, but to answer your question now, what happens next, once again, the special counsel is going to move forward. I think he'll do it in a way where it's not as partisan, probably doesn't attract as much attention, probably isn't being leaked on a regular basis, on a daily basis. And that's good for us, that's good for the American people. We want people to understand what happened there. And by the way, there is no evidence of collusion at this point. And yet, the narrative is that it was pervasive. And I think when he finds that, that's a good thing for us to show the American people, but it needs to be done in a professional way, not in just this hodgepodge of daily leaks and daily news stories."

I mean, he just does with some of his tweets or some of the things that he says. You know, the reason that people liked him, I think the reason that he endeared himself to voters was he does speak off the top of his head, he does speak with emotion. And that's a great thing on the campaign trail, but it's a little bit different once you're in office, and sometimes, it can make it more difficult, like you said, to keep on message that many of us and the goals that many of us are trying to achieve."

Any failure to preserve records exposes Trump aides to criminal charges down the line. I asked you before, where this probe goes, but what does the future look like, considering they're asking for these documents? This is -- this is something the White House faces today."

      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, anyone associated with this probe, I think they recognize they have a responsibility to preserve any documents or anything that may be relevant. The problem is -- and we saw this in the past with Fitzgerald in a previous special prosecutor. Oh my heavens, we knew within, what, a couple of days after he started investigation that the original crime never occurred. There was nothing to investigate. And yet, it went on for months and months, and then -- and the charges came from the process, not from the original crime. And I think that's what many people need to be concerned with now, this responsibility to preserve these documents. No question they have that. But hopefully, that doesn't become the only issue."

The critical thing here as I think as Brad said, he now comes back having had this euphoric trip and he comes to the same, old, drumbeat of boom, boom, boom, with his son-in-law, the rest of this stuff, and the key thing for him is to basically say, \"Listen, I accomplished this in the world stage, I'm now going to get focused on the tax bill, going to get focused on the healthcare bill, I'm not going to weigh him now, the special counsel, I'm not going to deal with that stuff. We'll just going to let the special counsel deal with all of this stuff and move forward.

But let's make one thing clear, domestically, deals are made on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington but they're sold on main street USA. The President needs to get out. He needs to get out of beltway and sell to the American people his program for health care and immigration, on taxes. He is the best spokesperson, he's got the bully pulpit, get out of Washington, sell your messages to the people who really care. And also target the districts of the members whose votes we need.

The bottom line is the person that's been the strongest person in Europe is Merkel, she is the most unhappiest about the trip because she is now not a big player on the world stage, and I think to a certain extent, his message was for the U.S., his message was not about, I'm going over there meet a whole bunch of new friends. I mean, I think his message was one of strength; this is what we've done for the world; we're going to continue this for the world; you've got to do your part."

He took it to the Middle East, saying, \"You're not doing your part, and you need to step up more.\" And you know what, it was well- received. Then he went to NATO and said, \"You know what, you're not pulling your weight, you need to do more.\" And begrudgingly, well- received. And then he went to the G7 and said, \"Hey, we're all in this together. Let's fix our economies; let's make our nations great again.\" All positive messages. In some instances, he was calling pupils to the principal's office, but mainly, if you're an American, you were waiting for this for eight years, for a president to stand up for America."

So, it's their responsibility now to basically move the tax bill, and move basically the health care bill. And they've been fighting among themselves. The most important thing for him is no more disarray stories; he needs to sit down with his White House staff tomorrow and say, \"Listen, we've got a tough summer ahead of us; no shakeup stories.\" If he wants to shake the (INAUDIBLE) we can do it in August when everybody is not paying any attention.

In my sense is many people have learned the lessons of Watergate. They're not going to violate the laws in the way that that was done. Woodward, I think, is an elder statesman at this point in time. The problem is a bunch of young journalists who've been waiting 30 years to be the Woodward and Bernstein of their day, and you now see this going back and forth between The New York Times and The Washington Post, who can get the story, who can -- who can get the sources.

If I would, this week, I would bring in my FBI leadership at this point in time, justice (INAUDIBLE) leadership and intelligence leadership. Guys, I want this stopped.

But one this is for sure, the media herd mentality that Bob Woodward spoke about, reminds me of the old- time westerns where they go out and they hang the guy and then give him a trial. This is -- Watergate has been on their lips from the moment Donald Trump became president. They're looking for scandal.

The problem today, I think, is that -- and it's not -- it's not -- I don't -- I don't buy the fake news, what I do buy is that people are sources things and you don't -- they won't write these stories unless they had sources. And the sources is too many people want to have their names, or have their story -- the paper to tell their side of the story. I think it prop themselves up.
