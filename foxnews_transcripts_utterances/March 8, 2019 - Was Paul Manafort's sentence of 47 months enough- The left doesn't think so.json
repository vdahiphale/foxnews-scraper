      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” There are breaking developments at this hour in the Jussie Smollett hate hoax case, a story that goes on and on. As of moments ago, 16 additional felony charges. What does that mean? It means Jussie Smollett could go to jail. We'll have the latest on that in a minute. But first tonight, let's say you disagree with the political views of the people who run the country, the billionaire class, the Tesla drivers, our self-appointed clergy on social media, the retired prosecutors and spy chiefs you so often see on television opining about things. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you're watching this show, you're probably not all that impressed about these people. You don't wish them personal harm, of course, some of them are well-meaning people, but you don't think they've done a good job for America. Though somehow, they themselves are richer than ever. You might have voted for Donald Trump to make that very point. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Have you ever considered what these people think of you for voting the way that you did? For daring to be insolent and disobedient? How would they punish you if they ever got the chance? Ever think of that? Well, wonder no more. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yesterday, Paul Manafort received four years in prison for bank fraud and tax evasion. Manafort will be 70 years old in a couple of weeks. He has got no criminal record of any kind. His sentence is considerably longer than the national average for the charges that he pled to. By the time Manafort gets out of prison, he will be elderly, broke, and disgraced. But for our ruling class, that's not nearly enough punishment. Manafort briefly managed Donald Trump's presidential campaign and for that, they believe he must die in prison. Anything less cannot be allowed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Manafort is heading to prison. The judge in the case clearly understands what's happening here. As he passed down his sentence, Judge T.S.

It's about using power to crush your political opponents in order to get more power.

As of moments ago, 16 additional felony charges. What does that mean? It means Jussie Smollett could go to jail. We'll have the latest on that in a minute. But first tonight, let's say you disagree with the political views of the people who run the country, the billionaire class, the Tesla drivers, our self-appointed clergy on social media, the retired prosecutors and spy chiefs you so often see on television opining about things. If you're watching this show, you're probably not all that impressed about these people. You don't wish them personal harm, of course, some of them are well-meaning people, but you don't think they've done a good job for America. Though somehow, they themselves are richer than ever. You might have voted for Donald Trump to make that very point. Have you ever considered what these people think of you for voting the way that you did? For daring to be insolent and disobedient? How would they punish you if they ever got the chance? Ever think of that? Well, wonder no more. Yesterday, Paul Manafort received four years in prison for bank fraud and tax evasion. Manafort will be 70 years old in a couple of weeks. He has got no criminal record of any kind. His sentence is considerably longer than the national average for the charges that he pled to. By the time Manafort gets out of prison, he will be elderly, broke, and disgraced. But for our ruling class, that's not nearly enough punishment. Manafort briefly managed Donald Trump's presidential campaign and for that, they believe he must die in prison. Anything less cannot be allowed."

Keep in mind that serial murderer, Al Capone only got 11 years for crimes similar to those that Manafort has been charged with. But Capone was just a gangster, Paul Manafort is an enemy of the Democratic Party and that's much worse.

There are a lot of Republican consultants here who are grateful tonight that they didn't take the job. They are heading out on spring break tomorrow. Manafort is heading to prison.

Ellis reminded those watching that Manafort was, quote, \"Not before this court for having anything to do with collusion with the Russian government to influence this election.\" That's literally true. Manafort has not been charged with any crime related to Russian collusion. Nobody has been charged with a crime related to Russian collusion. That's a fact. That's not an opinion. There's no dispute about it. And yet, somehow, a lot of people are still out there lying about this, probably because nobody in the press ever calls them on it. Watch your elected official say something totally untrue in the most self-righteous possible way."

Keep in mind this is the same Cory Booker who recently has spent hours on the Senate floor wagging his finger in the face of America over mass incarceration and our broken justice system. The same Cory Booker who worked so hard to reduce the sentences for fentanyl dealers and applauded when the bill passed, and yet, that's also the same Cory Booker who now is outraged that a tax cheat isn't getting the death penalty. Has Cory Boker ever cheated on his taxes? I hope not. That would be hypocrisy. It would be interesting to know. It would be interesting to know if any of these hyenas circling Paul Manafort has ever fudged a deduction or somehow violated our complex banking laws. Somebody should check. The penalty is pretty high these days. Just kidding. This isn't about taxes, obviously. Cory Booker knows that well. It's about using power to crush your political opponents in order to get more power. The same principle will be on display next week when Manafort is sentenced for failing to register under the Foreign Agent Registration Act of 1938. That will be an amazing moment, if only because of how rarely it occurs. It's like Hayley's Comet here in Washington. In the space of 50 years, between 1966 and 2015, the DOJ charged a total of seven people in FARA cases, just three of them were convicted. Meanwhile, the most powerful foreign lobbyist in Washington still are not registered under FARA. Robert Mueller has no plans to indict them, of course not, they never made the mistake of running Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Chris Hahn is a radio host and a former staff for Senator Chuck Schumer and he joins us tonight. So Chris, the sentence that the Mueller investigation recommended to the judge was up to 24 years. That's twice what the average convicted murderer spends in prison in this country for tax evasion. Is that an appropriate request, would you say?"

He didn't steal any money from a bank. He misrepresented a loan application. No bank actually fleeced by Paul Manafort and he cheated on his taxes, as a lot of people here do, as you know.

He went from one felony count of disorderly conduct to 16 felony counts and to make matters legally worse for Jussie Smollett, the grand jury also returned two sets of charges because they say he gave false statements to two different Chicago police officers and the stories were different, telling police about the racist and homophobic slurs. The suspects yelling, \"This is MAGA country,\" and saying they beat him up, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him. Each set of charges carries a penalty up to four years in prison. Now, experts say it's highly unlikely he will serve eight years, but it is more likely now that he could serve some jail time, though a plea deal is also a strong possibility. Police say Smollett paid two brothers $3,500.00 to stage the attack. And they say the brothers did strike Jussie Smollett, but the scratches and bruises on the actor's face were likely self- inflicted. Jussie Smollett could also face Federal charges for mail fraud. Investigators believe before the alleged attack, he sent himself a threatening letter with white powder that turned out to be Tylenol. The letter is now at an FBI crime lab, so far, no word from the 36-year-old actor or his lawyers about these counts -- Tucker."

One is illegality, filing a false police report. People have done this in the past, for example, the UVA rape case, the \"Duke Lacrosse rape case\" quote-unquote. And there really were no consequences suffered by the people who went to the police and lied to them about events that didn't place. I think if Smollett in fact is convicted, it will send a message, a badly needed message that if you lie to police about events that didn't take place, that's very serious especially in a city like Chicago with a massive crime problem with homicides. You've got police who ought to be finding murderers who were sidelined to work on this fake case, so that's very serious. And then there's a very serious moral problem here, which is in a country that's completely divided, with all of us at each other's throats, the last thing we need is one more reason for us to try to strangle each other and when this whole thing happened a few weeks ago, you had a case involving a black man who is also gay, which made it a racial case, a sexual case. And of people blamed it on people who supposedly said, \"This is MAGA country,\" which turned it into basically a war on Trump supporters. So the last thing we need in this country right now is people adding to the tension and division we're suffering already and I think this is why this man has done something very immoral as well as illegal and he ought to spend several years in jail breaking rocks as a consequence."

And here we have this actor who gets paid $65,000.00 per episode inculcating or perpetrating this sort of thing, supposedly so he could get a raise and make more than $65,000.00 a week working on \"Empire,\" which works out if did 20 episodes, about $1.3 million, which I think is a pretty comfortable wage, but I guess he didn't like that. And fortunately, he got caught. If he didn't get caught, he would still be considered a victim. He probably would have gone to the Oscars and would have been applauded by all the elite in Hollywood as this black gay man who's suffered the most horrible consequences. \"GQ\" magazine had a headline about this. It was, \"The Racist Homophobic Attack on Jussie Smollett is Far-Right America's End Game.\" And this is the narrative that existed.

I order to even score, we must now give the black man a head start or even hold the white man back to even the race.' I don't buy that.\" So a lot of these comments he has previously made could end up being an issue both with African-American voters and just where the Democratic Party is now as a whole. I mean, we know that the Party has gone increasingly leftward leaning. Medicare for All used to be outside of the mainstream, now it's a litmus test for Democratic candidates, so Joe Biden may not be in the mainstream of the Democratic Party anymore."

It's driven them -- many of them anyway -- to become pro-war, pro-censorship, pro-China, pro-CIA and a bunch of other things that would have horrified them just 10 years ago. Stephen Cohen knows a lot about this. He's been at the heart of Russia studies and politics for a long time, obviously, a very famous Russian Studies Professor at Princeton NYU and a contributing editor to the \"Nation\" magazine and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So you've been around American politics and Russian diplomacy for decades. How has this story, the Russia collusion changed the Democratic Party, would you say?"

      "utterance": "Some people think I've been around too long. I'm working on that. Look, as a historian, I know that parties have parties within them. They're divided. And I saw that when I was growing up in the segregated south. My father was a Franklin Delano Roosevelt Democrat for social justice, yet, the Democratic Party was a segregationist party in the south. We see something like that going on today, I fear. That is to say that the party and its candidates for the presidency are preaching social justice and economic justice and traditional liberal values, but they're pushing this Russiagate story against Trump in a way that I think is making the Democratic Party the party of Cold War with Russia, which easily could be Hot War, the party of neo-McCarthyism and a party that doesn't care the way it used to about civil liberties. You made the point at the top of your broadcast, I think about Paul Manafort. It seems to be a party that wants a death sentence for artful tax returns, so that would put an awful lot of people in prison."

      "speaker": "COHEN",

They were all done by -- I don't know if you have thought of this -- by Republican Presidents. Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan, correct?"

And yet when he does, whatever a Republican President did in the 20th Century, try to cooperate with Moscow, it's called treason. And I'm not making this up. You remember in July last year, he went to Helsinki for a summit with Putin, the Russian leader, something that every American President since Eisenhower had done, had a Summit with a Kremlin leader and what did they say when he came home - Trump came home? Treason -- driven by the Democrats. So, I mean, to my mind, though I've been a kind of Democrat most of my life, the Democrats are becoming the party of anti-national security."

Nobody has ever accused this show of carrying water for Elizabeth Warren, that's for sure. But when somebody says something smart and true, we want to be the first to congratulate that person. We are not partisans. We're just looking for people of good faith to make good decisions. And that would be a good decision, one of the main reasons it would be is because monopolies have immense power and these monopolies use that power to censor unpopular speech -- conservative speech almost always.
