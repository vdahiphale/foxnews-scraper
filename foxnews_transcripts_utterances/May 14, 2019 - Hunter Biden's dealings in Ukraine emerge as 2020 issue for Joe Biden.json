      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” Busy news night. We are glad you are with us because we are tracking multiple major breaking stories as we begin. And tonight, the deep state is in even more deep trouble, no pun intended. U.S. Attorney John Durham has been appointed to investigate the origins of the Russian probe it. This is huge news. This is the boomerang we've been telling you about, a massive step forward. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Durham is a nonpartisan career U.S. attorney. He specializes in uncovering corruption at the highest levels of our federal government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, back in the early 2000s, Durham was appointed to investigate the FBI's Boston police field office, and resulting in a conviction of an FBI special agent, as well as another law enforcement official connected to the notorious gangster \"Whitey\" Bulger. In 2009, Durham was appointed to investigate abuses in the CIA. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Over his decades-long career, Durham has successfully prosecuted dozens of government officials, gang members, drug traffickers alike. And he has been praised by members on both sides of the aisle for his steady and cautious pursuit of truth and of justice. And tonight, he is squarely focused on why our country's most sensitive and intelligent tools were turned against its own citizens at the height of a presidential election. Now, Fox News is reporting that Durham is collaborating with Inspector General Michael Horowitz in his ongoing investigation into FISA abuse and FISA abuse fraud. And get this: Durham's investigation is not new. It has now been underway for weeks and possibly even months. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And needless to say, the bad actors in the deep state, they are getting very nervous tonight and they are now turning on each other, little circular firing squad forming. Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, well, they're blaming Loretta Lynch for the rigging of the investigation into Hillary Clinton and her server, and obstruction of justice. And Bruce Ohr, well, he is blaming the DOJ and FBI officials for ignoring his warning about Christopher Steele and the dossier. Well, that was in August of 2016. James Comey is trashing Strzok and Page on national TV, and he is also in a fight with the Rod Rosenstein. They are attacking each other's character. And also, Andrew McCabe is attacking anyone pretty much with a pulse. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, it's a crisis mode for the deep state and it's every man, every woman for themselves. Even Comey's former general counsel, James Baker, he is trying to get ahead of the story by warning that Horowitz is going to uncover some major mistakes in the FISA process. You think? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look.",

Wow. Interesting.

Well, there is now and again more growing evidence tonight that Comey knew full well that Steele was completely unreliable. A brand-new report breaking from investigative reporter from \"The Hill\", John Solomon, showing that the State Department official Kathleen Kavalec did in fact inform a high ranking official at the FBI about her meeting with Steele. Many days, as many as ten days before the FISA warrant against Carter Page. The first one was submitted in October 2016.

If passed, this would be the most restrictive law in the country. Meantime, as you were talking about, three independent production companies have vowed to not work in Georgia. Acting Director Mark Duplass, who runs one of the companies, tweeted, and I'm quoting here, \"Don't give your business to Georgia. Will you pledge with me not to film anything in Georgia until they reverse this backwards legislation?\" So far, no takers. Neither the Motion Picture Association of America nor Netflix, Disney or any major studio has signed on. That's likely because Georgia offers tax credits of 30 percent, significant for an industry that spends roughly $3 billion a year in Georgia. Though back in March, several dozen actors like Ashley Judd, Sean Penn, and Alec Baldwin signed a letter agreeing to boycott Georgia, the letter was delivered to Governor Brian Kemp by actress Alyssa Milano, who oddly enough is in Georgia right now taping her Netflix show, claiming she is contractually obliged to do the show this year, but won't come back next year. And Milano is apparently not having sex, saying, \"Join me by not having sex until we get our bodily autonomy back. I'm calling for a sex strike. Pass it on.\" Again, not many takers.

And tonight, the deep state is in even more deep trouble, no pun intended. U.S. Attorney John Durham has been appointed to investigate the origins of the Russian probe it. This is huge news. This is the boomerang we've been telling you about, a massive step forward. Now, Durham is a nonpartisan career U.S. attorney. He specializes in uncovering corruption at the highest levels of our federal government. Now, back in the early 2000s, Durham was appointed to investigate the FBI's Boston police field office, and resulting in a conviction of an FBI special agent, as well as another law enforcement official connected to the notorious gangster \"Whitey\" Bulger. In 2009, Durham was appointed to investigate abuses in the CIA. Over his decades-long career, Durham has successfully prosecuted dozens of government officials, gang members, drug traffickers alike. And he has been praised by members on both sides of the aisle for his steady and cautious pursuit of truth and of justice. And tonight, he is squarely focused on why our country's most sensitive and intelligent tools were turned against its own citizens at the height of a presidential election."

      "utterance": "Durham's investigation is not new. It has now been underway for weeks and possibly even months. And needless to say, the bad actors in the deep state, they are getting very nervous tonight and they are now turning on each other, little circular firing squad forming. Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, well, they're blaming Loretta Lynch for the rigging of the investigation into Hillary Clinton and her server, and obstruction of justice. And Bruce Ohr, well, he is blaming the DOJ and FBI officials for ignoring his warning about Christopher Steele and the dossier. Well, that was in August of 2016. James Comey is trashing Strzok and Page on national TV, and he is also in a fight with the Rod Rosenstein. They are attacking each other's character. And also, Andrew McCabe is attacking anyone pretty much with a pulse. Well, it's a crisis mode for the deep state and it's every man, every woman for themselves. Even Comey's former general counsel, James Baker, he is trying to get ahead of the story by warning that Horowitz is going to uncover some major mistakes in the FISA process. You think? Take a look."

Mistakes, you mean, like, you using untrue -- something that is unverifiable, Russian misinformation, propaganda, outright lies paid for by Hillary Clinton to literally inform the American people because it was leaked to \"The Washington Post\", David Corn and Michael Isikoff as the very basis for a warrant to spy not only on an American citizen but an American citizen working for the Trump campaign, and the entire opposition party that none of these guys we know wanted to win that election. Wow. Interesting. Like when James Comey swore that information provided to the FISA court, he signed that first FISA application, he was signing that that was true and correct and verified and corroborated. And, by the way, the application has the word \"verified\" on it. Now, Mr. Baker, that would not be a mistake. That would be willful, premeditated, a criminal act committed for the sole purpose of deceiving and committing fraud on the FISA court and stripping Americans of their constitutional, inalienable rights while trying to also simultaneously rig a presidential election in the United States. And not only did James Comey make no attempt to verify or corroborate the so-called intelligence. Well, there is now and again more growing evidence tonight that Comey knew full well that Steele was completely unreliable. A brand-new report breaking from investigative reporter from \"The Hill\", John Solomon, showing that the State Department official Kathleen Kavalec did in fact inform a high ranking official at the FBI about her meeting with Steele. Many days, as many as ten days before the FISA warrant against Carter Page. The first one was submitted in October 2016. Here on this developing story, investigative reporter from \"The Hill\", we have our friend John Solomon with us. All right. This is getting more interesting by the day."

      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's important. For the first time, we know who in the chain of command actually got tipped off by the State Department that Steele had made this remarkable appearance on October 11, 2016. The person she identified it as person named Stephen Laycock. At the time, he was the section chief for Eurasia inside the FBI counterintelligence investigations. So, the division that was doing the Russia investigation. My sources tell me he immediately forwarded the Kavalec's information to the team running the Russia case, which would have impeached Strzok's team. Why is this important? We know from the October 11th meeting that the State Department detected from Steele in accurate information about his allegations about his allegation about Russia collision, that he had an election deadline, political motive, a election deadline to get the start on Trump off to the public. And that he had been leaking to the media, especially \"The Washington Post\" and \"New York Times.\" The FBI should have gone and checked that out. That's what people former people who held Mr. Laycock's job today, that predecessors say that's what we do in the FBI. When we get a tip off that are informant rogue, you go back and you check. You don't just proceed with your FISA and ignore what went on. So, a very good development tonight. A witness identified for those Congress and the inspector general's investigations."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that most significantly, this gives the inspector general the ability to get grand jury subpoenas to a sitting U.S. attorney. So, it creates a new investigative tool that inspector general's don't normally have. They are administrative in their approach. And remember, some of the people that are key witnesses no longer fall under the Justice Department's purview. They're former employees because they're either fired or resigned. So, the U.S. attorneys have great reputation of investigating fairly and honestly. But prior controversies inside the FBI, he's now involved in that tool. The grand jury subpoena is another piece that can be played here to get to the bottom of the truth."

It's cascading down. No one in the deep state is safe from justice, which is why they are all turning on each other. Operation Boomerang no longer -- Operation Crossfire Hurricane is in full effect. The Russian hoax is now in the rearview mirror. Mueller is over, the entire witch hunt. Anything you hear going forward, well, that is only noise. The president didn't collude. He didn't obstruct. And let's fake, phony narrative about the Trump campaign, the conspiracies about Russia, it's not even on life support at this time. It is dead. It's buried, and it's not coming back. But the anti-Trump mob, especially in the media, they just can't seem to let it go. That includes, by the way, James Clapper, who was literally begging CNN to get back on message.

That's what the concern was and was the predicate for any of these investigations. I wish people paid more attention to volume one of the Mueller report, the exhaustive detail about what the Russians did, and we are losing sight of that."

This all happened under your watch -- and Biden's and Obama's watch. But it was then President Obama, he was just laughing it off. Tell Vladimir I will have more flexibility after the election. If you look at volume one of the Mueller report, you will see it was the Trump campaign that rebuffed Russian operations every step of the way. And while it was the Clinton campaign who actually paid for Russian disinformation in the form of a dirty dossier full of Russian lies. \"New York Times\" suggesting may be Russian disinformation in the form of a dirty dossier full of Russian lies. Suggesting may be Russian disinformation from the get-go. That dirty Russian dossier that you, James Clapper, allegedly linked to your current employer, fake new CNN. Yes, that one. Well, James, tick tock, because John Huber's investigation into leaking is around the corner. Of course, that's no concern of the House Intel Chairman. That would be Adam the cowardly Schiff, who doesn't seem to care about government leaking or abuse of power, because Schiff is on an all- consuming mission to smear, slander, besmirch, attack the president of the United States which is exactly why he is desperately trying to get Robert Mueller to appear before Congress.

Did Vladimir see it? Yes, but of course, but of course. Buzova. Surrounding an actual hoax and conspiracy theories. Four separate investigations cleared President Trump. The FBI's nine-month investigation under Comey came up with nothing. The special counsel's 20- month investigation, nothing. The House Intel Committee's investigation, nothing. The bipartisan Senate investigation, nothing. But then you got sleepy, creepy Uncle Joe Biden who is desperate to try and win and delineate himself from the radical leftist in his own party, well, some saying even the front runner at this moment, he's not going to let facts get in the way.

And then they had a leak that to press outlets and then they pick up those press reports and used it in the FISA application. Comey said, oh, no, it was a mosaic.

They knew that at least one big part of it, because it's supposedly that money was being funneled through this Russian consulate in Miami which doesn't even exist. So, the FBI knew, good and well, that Steele had a lot of problems. And I'll say something else about Steele. So, you know, it's called the Steele dossier. It's really just Clinton opposition research. I think once we get to the bottom of this, what we're going to find is that Steele has a small role in actually crafting this. And I'll go back to what I started with, these really were the perverted fantasies of Simpson working with the Clinton campaign to say what can we draw appear that we can spread out lies to the American people, that we can feed into the FBI, and lo and behold, let's get an investigation going on the Trump campaign.

If passed, this would be the most restrictive law in the country. Meantime, as you were talking about, three independent production companies have vowed to not work in Georgia. Acting Director Mark Duplass, who runs one of the companies, tweeted, and I'm quoting here, \"Don't give your business to Georgia. Will you pledge with me not to film anything in Georgia until they reverse this backwards legislation?\" So far, no takers. Neither the Motion Picture Association of America nor Netflix, Disney or any major studio has signed on. That's likely because Georgia offers tax credits of 30 percent, significant for an industry that spends roughly $3 billion a year in Georgia. Though back in March, several dozen actors like Ashley Judd, Sean Penn, and Alec Baldwin signed a letter agreeing to boycott Georgia, the letter was delivered to Governor Brian Kemp by actress Alyssa Milano, who oddly enough is in Georgia right now taping her Netflix show, claiming she is contractually obliged to do the show this year, but won't come back next year. And Milano is apparently not having sex, saying, \"Join me by not having sex until we get our bodily autonomy back. I'm calling for a sex strike. Pass it on.\" Again, not many takers. Even Milano admits her sex boycott has gotten mixed reaction. Sean."

We're at their mercy, basically, Sean. And this means trouble for men. I mean, sex strikes have worked throughout history in South America and Africa, and Greece. I could see Georgia turning blue as a result of the sex strike. I can see conservative men, gun toting guys, pickup driving guys, they're maybe two, three weeks into a sex strike. They're voting Bernie Sanders, Sean. Anyone of us could fall victim to a sex strike. OK? We have to take this threat seriously and pay very close attention."

We've been saying for a long time that personal responsibility and a woman's choice happens before you get pregnant, not after you get pregnant. So if that's the line that she wants to draw, if she wants to get on board with religious conservatives and our sexual ethics, I say, great job. Tell me where to sign up. To speak at this rally for personal responsibility and choice before reproduction actually happens, I think it's great."

They've also admitted they don't care about the working men and women because that's who the boycott is really going to effect."
