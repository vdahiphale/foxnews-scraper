      "sentences": "And welcome to HANNITY this Monday night. Tonight, less than a week after federal investigators raided the apartment and the office of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, well, now, America's mayor is now claiming that the feds are trying to frame him because of his work as President Trump's personal attorney. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Mayor Giuliani will join us in just a moment with an exclusive TV interview. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, trillions and trillions of your hard-earned money in new spending, trillions of new tax hikes. The Biden administration's new proposals that would cripple American -- every American taxpayer, every one of you are going to be paying more. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the costs of his radical policies are already being felt nationwide. Look at this. Gas prices, they are now skyrocketing. The cost of heating your home, cooling your home, that's way up. Energy prices across the border are all way out. And, of course, the price of goods and services, they are also on the rise. Look at this today. Procter & Gamble announcing a nationwide price hike on nearly all of its products. We all buy Procter & Gamble, right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } General Mills also announcing plans to raise prices on everything from cereal to snack bars. Coca-Cola, they are raising prices. Yep, Kimberly- Clark, yep, she's doing a great job at raising prices up pretty much everything. The cost of timber and paper products, by the way, if you can even find them, they're going through the roof. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's your money. It's your paycheck. It's your income. And it is now becoming less valuable with every passing day. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the reason for this is obvious. Joe Biden decided to limit our supply of oil and gas in his very first week in office. This is simple economics. This is not something you have to go to MIT and get a degree in and that a supply and demand. They crisscross. And that will dictate price. When you artificially lower the supply, guess what, the demand remains the same. You pay more for that product. Now, think about it -- everything that we all buy, all of us, is transported in a truck. Every good, every service, yeah, we need trucking involved. And many of those goods and services are produced using machines that run on oil and gas. Every business relies on energy to keep the lights on. It is the lifeblood of our economy and the world's economy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Corporations, well, I know they like to say we are raising taxes on corporations. We have told you often on this program -- corporations pass the tax costs onto us, onto you and your family. You, the consumer. So, that's right, everything you buy is getting and will be getting more expensive. And it will only get worse if Joe Biden's massive corporate tax hike gets signed into law. Yet, on top of the capital gains tax. But according to Joe, your president and the radical left, you know, the new green deal socialist left, well, the ends will justify the means. They want some kind of eco-socialist Green New Deal government where no one uses oil and gas and everyone is dependent upon the government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at this one number. It's never been like this in the country. We now have a record, a whopping 34 percent of personal income is coming to Americans via handouts from the federal government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That would be called a redistribution of wealth. That is called socialism. Socialism never works. I have a whole chapter in my last book. \"Live Free or Die\". Socialism, its history of failure. That number has now doubled in less than a year and with $6 trillion, Joe Biden has plans for so much more. By the way, we only take in, well, less than $4 trillion a year. Joe says it's not going to impact the deficits, too. Now, in addition to the corporate tax hike, the capital gains tax height, the Biden administration is also planning a tax hike on individuals making over $200,000 a year. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, they keep saying it is $400,000 year, but that is because Joe is weak and frail, confused, and struggling cognitively. And he can't seem to keep numbers straight or lies, depending on which point of view you may have, straight. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

As you can see, Joe at times barely can put out a coherent sentence. Now he is not running the show. But we do have the radical socialist, the Green New Deal socialist. They are the ones in charge. They are bragging about how they control Joe and they are setting the agenda, and all of us come of the entire country is paying the price. All right. We're going to have a lot more coming up on this. But, first, let's turn to America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He is now facing off against Joe Biden's Department of Justice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, last Wednesday at around 6:00 a.m., Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office, they were raided by dozens of federal investigators. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Mayor Giuliani is apparently under investigation for a potential FARA violation. To give you some reference, most violations involve an American not registering foreign work appropriately with the U.S. federal government. In other words, not filling out the proper paperwork. By the way, most violations are resolved with something called a fine, not your home raided, predawn raid, 6:00 a.m. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, recently, Mayor Giuliani told FOX News that he never committed a FARA violation and he was shocked because he had offered to discuss all the allegations with the U.S. attorney's office in New York. But apparently, they never agreed and instead, they decided for a predawn raid of his office and his home. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The only thing that was missing, like in the case of Roger Stone, CNN cameras weren't tipped off. Wow. What a change of pace. Remember, these were all process crimes. Mayor Giuliani is claiming that the fed's motivations are political. He said, quote: The only lawyers they raid are lawyers for Donald Trump. I can't think of another lawyer that has been raided other than lawyers for Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the mayor is also accusing the feds of illegally tapping into his privilege messages with his top client.

Is he going to be held accountable for anything? Did he violate any FARA laws in any way? We need an investigation. We do know that he lied on a gun permit application for which he has never been tried. Why do I think if I did that, they'll lock me up and throw away the key? We know that his foreign income is, well, extremely questionable at best. We read to you on air the Grassley-Johnson Senate report laid out in great detail.

When you compare that to what we learned with the Russia hoax and you compare that with what we played with Hunter and Joe Biden and you compared -- we now have three people that signed FISA applications. Jim Comey, Sally Yates, Rod Rosenstein, knowing what we know now, yeah, we wouldn't have signed those FISA warrants that says that the top of the warrant, verified. They were in to the court, to spy on a president. And in spite of referrals by the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, nobody has ever been held accountable.

I think it's very disturbing that they had to send 7 FBI agents with blazers that are emblazoned with FBI at dawn to raid Rudy Giuliani's apartment when his lawyer has been offering for 18 months for him to come in for questioning because there were so many leaks out of that investigation into Rudy Giuliani's alleged lobbying in Ukraine. And, you know, there is no reason for them to have been so heavy-handed. And in addition, what is incredibly disturbing is the fact that they were spying on the president's lawyer, on Rudy Giuliani. They took all his documents and emails from the iCloud in November of 2019. That was right before the impeachment. That was exactly one the Democrats were gathering dirt, as much as they could find, on the president. What better way to do that than to spy on the president and his lawyer. Now, they may have had a perfectly good reason. They got a search warrant. But the optics are shocking. And they only told Rudy Giuliani's lawyer, Robert Costello, about that after they raided his apartment. So why you would treat a 76-year-old hero of New York, the mayor who saved New York, and it is a bitter irony that right now when New York is going down the tubes as far as crime and grime and disorder goes, the man who saved New York the last time this happened is being treated so shabbily.",

      "utterance": "And welcome to HANNITY this Monday night. Tonight, less than a week after federal investigators raided the apartment and the office of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, well, now, America's mayor is now claiming that the feds are trying to frame him because of his work as President Trump's personal attorney. Now, Mayor Giuliani will join us in just a moment with an exclusive TV interview. But first, trillions and trillions of your hard-earned money in new spending, trillions of new tax hikes. The Biden administration's new proposals that would cripple American -- every American taxpayer, every one of you are going to be paying more. But the costs of his radical policies are already being felt nationwide. Look at this. Gas prices, they are now skyrocketing. The cost of heating your home, cooling your home, that's way up. Energy prices across the border are all way out. And, of course, the price of goods and services, they are also on the rise. Look at this today. Procter & Gamble announcing a nationwide price hike on nearly all of its products. We all buy Procter & Gamble, right? General Mills also announcing plans to raise prices on everything from cereal to snack bars. Coca-Cola, they are raising prices. Yep, Kimberly- Clark, yep, she's doing a great job at raising prices up pretty much everything. The cost of timber and paper products, by the way, if you can even find them, they're going through the roof. It's your money. It's your paycheck. It's your income. And it is now becoming less valuable with every passing day. Now, the reason for this is obvious. Joe Biden decided to limit our supply of oil and gas in his very first week in office. This is simple economics. This is not something you have to go to MIT and get a degree in and that a supply and demand. They crisscross. And that will dictate price. When you artificially lower the supply, guess what, the demand remains the same. You pay more for that product. Now, think about it -- everything that we all buy, all of us, is transported in a truck. Every good, every service, yeah, we need trucking involved. And many of those goods and services are produced using machines that run on oil and gas. Every business relies on energy to keep the lights on. It is the lifeblood of our economy and the world's economy. Corporations, well, I know they like to say we are raising taxes on corporations. We have told you often on this program -- corporations pass the tax costs onto us, onto you and your family. You, the consumer. So, that's right, everything you buy is getting and will be getting more expensive. And it will only get worse if Joe Biden's massive corporate tax hike gets signed into law. Yet, on top of the capital gains tax. But according to Joe, your president and the radical left, you know, the new green deal socialist left, well, the ends will justify the means. They want some kind of eco-socialist Green New Deal government where no one uses oil and gas and everyone is dependent upon the government. Look at this one number. It's never been like this in the country. We now have a record, a whopping 34 percent of personal income is coming to Americans via handouts from the federal government. That would be called a redistribution of wealth. That is called socialism. Socialism never works. I have a whole chapter in my last book. \"Live Free or Die\". Socialism, its history of failure. That number has now doubled in less than a year and with $6 trillion, Joe Biden has plans for so much more. By the way, we only take in, well, less than $4 trillion a year. Joe says it's not going to impact the deficits, too. Now, in addition to the corporate tax hike, the capital gains tax height, the Biden administration is also planning a tax hike on individuals making over $200,000 a year. Now, they keep saying it is $400,000 year, but that is because Joe is weak and frail, confused, and struggling cognitively. And he can't seem to keep numbers straight or lies, depending on which point of view you may have, straight. Take a look."

There's no reason to fact-check Joe. Joe never lies. Only Donald Trump lied. And, of course, much of the time, no one can really decipher what Joe is trying to say.

They are bragging about how they control Joe and they are setting the agenda, and all of us come of the entire country is paying the price. All right. We're going to have a lot more coming up on this. But, first, let's turn to America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He is now facing off against Joe Biden's Department of Justice. Now, last Wednesday at around 6:00 a.m., Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office, they were raided by dozens of federal investigators. Now, Mayor Giuliani is apparently under investigation for a potential FARA violation. To give you some reference, most violations involve an American not registering foreign work appropriately with the U.S. federal government. In other words, not filling out the proper paperwork. By the way, most violations are resolved with something called a fine, not your home raided, predawn raid, 6:00 a.m. Now, recently, Mayor Giuliani told FOX News that he never committed a FARA violation and he was shocked because he had offered to discuss all the allegations with the U.S. attorney's office in New York. But apparently, they never agreed and instead, they decided for a predawn raid of his office and his home. The only thing that was missing, like in the case of Roger Stone, CNN cameras weren't tipped off. Wow. What a change of pace. Remember, these were all process crimes."

They took documents that are privileged and then they unilaterally decided what they could read and not read. So, the prosecutors from the Justice Department spied on me."

Is Rudy Giuliani's FARA investigation, does it have political motives, and if it does, we all need to have equal justice application of our laws. And that raises the question about zero experience Hunter Biden. Is he going to be held accountable for anything? Did he violate any FARA laws in any way? We need an investigation. We do know that he lied on a gun permit application for which he has never been tried. Why do I think if I did that, they'll lock me up and throw away the key? We know that his foreign income is, well, extremely questionable at best. We read to you on air the Grassley-Johnson Senate report laid out in great detail. Zero experience Hunter, Imagine, when it all of you like this deal? He made millions of dollars from Burisma. That is the Ukrainian oil and gas giant. It's owned by a sketchy Ukrainian oligarch. He received three and a half million dollars in a wire transfer to his company from a Russian oligarch known as the first lady in Moscow. The Grassley-Johnson report pointed out $5 million from a state-backed Chinese company. Another $100,000 for a shopping spree compliments of a prominent Chinese national. Why are we all so lucky? A hundred grand from a Kazakhstan oligarch, earmarked for a brand-new car. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Remember, hunter Biden had zero experience in oil, in gas, or finance, or zero experience in any of these countries that we're talking about. And they were paying him for what? His connection to his father? Something even Hunter Biden admitted during what was a disastrous \"Good Morning America\" interview. Take a look."

Oh, what would happen, imagine for a second, what if it was Vice President Donald J. Trump? Donald J. Trump leveraged a billion taxpayer dollars to get a prosecutor in Ukraine fired that was investigating, let's say, Don Jr. or Eric Trump. What would happen if any Trump supporter lied on a gun purchase permit like Hunter Biden appears to have done? And what else is on Hunter's laptop?

So, we have an anonymous whistle-blower, that says something nefarious happen. Then we have the transcript. There was no quid pro quo. We have out of all of the witnesses who testified in that impeachment, they were either opinion witnesses or hearsay witnesses.

And the fact that they hid and concealed the Hunter Biden story, we now know that Hunter Biden was under federal investigation. We now know in Hunter's lawyer that the laptop was probably his. He says it could have been his but we know it was. There were hundreds of pictures of him on it, correspondences with his father.

Let me tell you something. There is a big difference between Hunter Biden who did something worthy of federal investigation and someone like Jared Kushner who just went around the world solving Middle East peace, something no one has been able to do, but Jared has and Ivanka did incredible work as well. There is a massive difference there. And you're right. If they had even the slightest shred of integrity or filling out paperwork the wrong way, they would be sought after.

It's a crime for a public official to confer benefit, a billion dollars, on a foreign country in exchange for something of value to himself or an immediate relative, his son, millions of dollars from Ukraine, not to mention China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Romania. The list goes on and on. Instead of focusing on Rudy Giuliani, it is foolhardy and vindictive and folly to go after a lawyer not representing Ukrainian interests and getting paid for it, but representing the president of the United States. He is duty-bound to engage in what he did, fact-finding, the gathering of evidence, the collection of information and passing it along to his client, the president, in addition to the Department of Justice. Moreover, you know, he's an advocate. He is defending the president and was doing so at the direction and at the behest of the president of the United States. That means he doesn't fall under FARA as a foreign lobbyist. No more than a member of Congress would be if he or she traveled to Turkey and spoke with President Erdogan and came back and began advocating a pro- Turkish position. That's not foreign lobbying. That's their job. You know, it's silly and reckless to accuse a lawyer of doing this. Just ask Greg Craig who two years ago he was charged with a FARA-related violation. The jury acquitted him in a nanosecond. Why? Because they realized immediately he was acting as a lawyer, not as a lobbyist. So, this is against Rudy Giuliani a political persecution masquerading as a potential criminal prosecution. It's dumb."

And they could have subpoenaed all these things but they did not. And they are doing it in the middle of an impeachment. When you compare that to what we learned with the Russia hoax and you compare that with what we played with Hunter and Joe Biden and you compared -- we now have three people that signed FISA applications. Jim Comey, Sally Yates, Rod Rosenstein, knowing what we know now, yeah, we wouldn't have signed those FISA warrants that says that the top of the warrant, verified. They were in to the court, to spy on a president. And in spite of referrals by the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, nobody has ever been held accountable.

I think it's very disturbing that they had to send 7 FBI agents with blazers that are emblazoned with FBI at dawn to raid Rudy Giuliani's apartment when his lawyer has been offering for 18 months for him to come in for questioning because there were so many leaks out of that investigation into Rudy Giuliani's alleged lobbying in Ukraine. And, you know, there is no reason for them to have been so heavy-handed. And in addition, what is incredibly disturbing is the fact that they were spying on the president's lawyer, on Rudy Giuliani. They took all his documents and emails from the iCloud in November of 2019. That was right before the impeachment. That was exactly one the Democrats were gathering dirt, as much as they could find, on the president. What better way to do that than to spy on the president and his lawyer. Now, they may have had a perfectly good reason. They got a search warrant. But the optics are shocking. And they only told Rudy Giuliani's lawyer, Robert Costello, about that after they raided his apartment. So why you would treat a 76-year-old hero of New York, the mayor who saved New York, and it is a bitter irony that right now when New York is going down the tubes as far as crime and grime and disorder goes, the man who saved New York the last time this happened is being treated so shabbily."

Incontrovertible evidence confirmed most of it by Inspector General Horowitz that we had premeditated fraud committed on the FISA court to spy on a president, a transition team, and a presidential candidate. It was based on a phony dossier from Russia, bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton. None of those people were held accountable. We seem to live in America now that if you have one political point of view and you lied to Congress because the Horowitz report, they have referrals for top FBI officials that lied to Congress, but yet no predawn raids, no guns blazing, no CNN cameras, and no charges whatsoever.

When you look at the rioters from all of last year who got away, the Antifa people, no -- they are not still languishing in jail like the Capitol rioters."

      "utterance": "This past weekend, massive victory for the GOP in the special election for Texas' sixth district, now where both candidates name Susan Wright and Jake Ellzey, who are advancing now to the runoff. You see both of them are Republicans. And here's the interesting thing. The GOP combined for nearly 70 percent of the vote in a district that President Trump only won by three points in 2020. And that's not all, because a never Trump candidate that was backed by swamp creature, Adam Kinzinger, well, completely failed, embarrassed himself, grabbing just under 3 percent of the vote. So, Republicans of Washington hear loud and clear that the Make America Great agenda in the country still alive and well and not the party of the establishment, the swamp, or special interests, or others. Don't take my word for it. Well, this is Mitt Romney in his home state of Utah at their GOP convention. Take a look."

Here with reaction, with us, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is with us. Governor, I'm glad you're here. You know, it's very interesting how your state has handled corona, how red states have handled it versus blue states. And it seems that the agenda that Donald Trump proposed is the Republican Party. But I think there are some people that think the Republican Party would go back to the good old establishment days. I don't see it. Do you?"

And that's what I loved about working with him, is that he followed through on the promises that he made in the campaign in 2016. Now, we kicked off today in South Dakota, National Travel and Tourism Week. And South Dakota right now is number one in tourism in the nation. We had millions of people come to our state largely because they heard the story of how we embraced freedom. We talked about Mount Rushmore last Independence Day. And people came here. They didn't just come to visit. They're moving here. Their businesses are moving here. It's because we have embraced what Republicans say they believe in, we actually did it."

You did everything that was asked of you and they won't grant you a permit for fireworks on the Fourth of July. And the other thing that was fascinating to me is, you saw 200 police officers laid off in Seattle and said, please come to South Dakota. We want to hire you. We respect you. We won't defund you, and we'll let you be able to do your job professionally."

And the Biden administration refused to give us the permits we needed to do so. So, I filed litigation and lawsuits against them to get them because I think there wasn't any reason for denying us the permits. It appears to be political and punitive. And so, I'm going to fight this in court and hopefully win. But listen, Sean, we are supporting law enforcement officers. We're supporting the men in that mountain because of our history. We saw last year riots and protests in cities all across this country still seeing them today, the violence on our streets that is endangering so many people. We did a national campaign of law enforcement officers, asked them that if they wanted to live in a state where they were respected to come to South Dakota."

      "utterance": "Now, after Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina exposed the Democrats' moral hypocrisy and their feigned and phony pleas for racial healing, the left-wing's smear tactics are as vicious as they have ever been. For example, you have a Democratic Party leader in Texas. His name is Gary O'Connor, he's facing now calls tonight to resign after calling a senator, Senator Scott a, quote, \"Oreo.\" Wow. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, well, she is as unhinged as ever, now claiming that, quote, every day, we have seen this nation get more racist. Here with reaction is civil rights attorney, FOX News contributor, Leo 2.0 Terrell, along with Pastor Darrell Scott. Pastor Scott, I'm getting a little sick and tired of the repulsive name- calling of African-Americans that happen to have conservative political viewpoints. It seems in this woke cancel culture, the one area where, you know, it's no holds barred, you can smear, slander, attack, and say anything you pretty much anything you want no matter how racial in its context."

They have an entire country walking around on egg shells in the name of social political correctness. They have no problem hurling slurs and attacking a man simply because his viewpoint does not align with theirs. I wonder where they have to say about Kamala Harris, because Kamala Harris got on and basically said the same thing that Senator Tim Scott said."

And once again, this guy down there, this party rector (ph), this kind of guy, he ought to know better. First of all, when he did that archaic word out from, nobody has used that word in decades. That shows that that's something that he has down on the inside of him that needs to be rooted out. And he used it so liberally against Tim Scott, but he won't use it against Kamala Harris. It's a party of hypocrisy and the party of identity politics that used race to enrage or inflame the passions of the black community in order to have the black community voting feelings over facts. It is a political ploy. That's all it is."

      "utterance": "I'll tell you, Sean, the key here is this. There is a disconnect between all of the areas that you have articulated in black America and Democratic leadership. There is a total disconnect. The Democratic leadership sees the race card as a profitable business. They can't, they don't want any type of resolution to it because it will have no Democratic Party. There would be no black voters within the Democratic Party. This guy who made that comment, Gary O'Connor. I don't want him to resign. He is the poster board of the Democratic Party, the poster boy that represents bigotry, the Klan, and racism. And Maxine Waters, she is living in 1950. She has been playing the race card for 30 years. She passed no legislation. But in order to make herself relevant, she will keep talking the race card because that is the only way she can get attention. She is not a legislator. She is just there yelling and playing the race card. That is all she is there for."
