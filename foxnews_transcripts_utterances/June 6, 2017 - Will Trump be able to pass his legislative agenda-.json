Tax reform is a combination of tax cuts with removing loopholes, removing cutouts, meaning increasing taxes in other areas of the tax code so you end up revenue neutral. To do that, you have to offend a lot of people. You have to go against a huge number of constituencies. And that is infinitely more difficult than tax cuts, which are cheap. Everybody is in favor of it. Of course you blow up the budget. It's the difference between Reagan '81 and Reagan '86. Tax cuts was easy. That's what you get in ‘81. In '86 he did tax reform. It took a year-and- a-half of negotiation and it was a tremendous success. They can't do it in a few weeks, the tax reform, because you have to deal with all of these constituencies who are against removing all the loopholes, some of which a lot of people like, for instance, the state and local tax deduction. And you get a lot of pushback from Republicans in those states.

I think it's pretty pathetic. You have control of all of government. You've asked for the control. You went to the people in good faith, we thought, and said this is what our plan is going to -- we're going to do this. They voted on it many times bird when the votes didn't count. Now everyone is running scared. There is no political courage. And I think the House bill actually has a lot of problems, and I think it actually won't lower the cost of health care as many predict. I talked to many doctors who actually practice medicine who know what time it is on this.

      "speaker": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "That's why I think you just heard in that clip a real slip-slide. The president spoke about tax cuts. Tax reform is a combination of tax cuts with removing loopholes, removing cutouts, meaning increasing taxes in other areas of the tax code so you end up revenue neutral. To do that, you have to offend a lot of people. You have to go against a huge number of constituencies. And that is infinitely more difficult than tax cuts, which are cheap. Everybody is in favor of it. Of course you blow up the budget. It's the difference between Reagan '81 and Reagan '86. Tax cuts was easy. That's what you get in ‘81. In '86 he did tax reform. It took a year-and- a-half of negotiation and it was a tremendous success. They can't do it in a few weeks, the tax reform, because you have to deal with all of these constituencies who are against removing all the loopholes, some of which a lot of people like, for instance, the state and local tax deduction. And you get a lot of pushback from Republicans in those states. So I think we are looking at cuts which will be cheap to do politically and will be very difficult in terms of economics, because how do you make up for the revenue loss?"

That absolutely needs bipartisanship to pull off something like that. But I thought what Trump said today was really important because yesterday Marc Short, the legislative director, briefed at the White House and said yes we would prefer tax reform, big base broadening, revenue neutral tax reform, but we need the economic growth. And he suggested that as a fallback plan they'd be happy to take just tax cuts."

You've got in the past, you had some support from Democrats and others. You have historically low oil and gasoline prices. If you are ever going to do it, you can do it now because it will have the least effect.

If he had no involvement with the Russians, he didn't have to recuse himself. Democrats never, rarely recuse themselves from actual investigations, so I wouldn't have done that. But that having been said, Jeff Sessions is one of your most stalwart supporters. He carries the conservative populist banner. And he is actually doing a really good job as A.G. right now.

This man, the attorney general is a pillar of this administration, and the president has to -- he's always going to have a disappointment here and there with anybody who works for him in any department. It happens in all administrations. If you can't absorb this one issue on which he disagrees, the recusal, and you have to get rid of him, then nobody is safe, and then you have an intrinsically highly unstable administration reflecting instability inside the president's head.
