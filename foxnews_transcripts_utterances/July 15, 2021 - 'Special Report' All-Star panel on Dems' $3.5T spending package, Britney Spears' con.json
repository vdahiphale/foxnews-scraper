Jason, let me start with you. It's bold. They are kind of on a knife's edge as far as the numbers. Can they get it through? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I hope not, Bret, frankly. I can't get past the numbers. We're talking about World War II level spending. We are not at war, let alone a world war. And Biden is behaving and the Democrats are behaving as if they have this huge mandate to just spend and spend and spend until the cows come home. And they don't.

It's quite something. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Right. In Washington Democrats are saying that there should be no -- nothing that the minority can do to affect legislation. And then in Texas, where Republicans have a strong majority in their legislature and are trying to pass basic election integrity, Democrats are literally fleeing the state to avoid -- in order to obstruct the passage of a bill that would tighten up election integrity. It is really interesting that Democrats are putting so much into this fight against basic election integrity. Republicans view it as making it easier to vote but tougher to cheat. And Democrats say that making it easier to vote and tougher to cheat is voter suppression. It's a very interesting -- it's very interesting to note just how much Democrats care about not tightening up any election integrity, and it suggests something about how much of a threat they view that to their electoral power.
