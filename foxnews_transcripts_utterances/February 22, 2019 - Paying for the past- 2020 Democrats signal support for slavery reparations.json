I understand she may be trying to excite her African- American base in the case of Senator Harris. I understand it may be important to talk about racial inequality. But this is the kind of thing that can turn off white moderate voters who might be looking for an alternative to Trump.

But going back to the conversation we were just having, I think reparations is a word, and that was part of the question for those presidential candidates, but I think when we get to do the details, if this continues to be a theme, it will be more about trying to work on income inequality, trying to make sure that poor people, both African-Americans and Latinos, as they mentioned, have some more opportunities, and have policies that can help them. Whether or not it ends up being a check, which is probably what people think of when they hear reparations, I'm not so sure that's what they're talking about."

But once aboard he delivered the grim news. He had fumbled the plastic eating utensils before reaching the gate, and the crew did not have any forks on such a short flight. What happened next was typical. Ms. Klobuchar berated her aide instantly for the slip-up. What happened after that was not. She pulled a comb from her bag and began eating the salad with it, according to four people familiar with the episode. Then she handed the come to her staff member with a directive -- clean it.\" Howie, this is now probably the sixth article citing anonymous sources."

She is so difficult to work for, she's so cruel to her staff. I don't think this resonates with voters. She's tough on her staff? She says she is tough on herself and she has high standards for her staff. It just seems the kind of thing that if these people feel so strongly, having worked or dealt with Amy Klobuchar that she is a terrible person, then they ought to go on the record.

He's been slow on this in the past, slow to punish offenders like Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop here in D.C. I think a tougher rhetoric in the summit shows he may be turning the corner and taking hold of this terrible issue."

My loser is \"The Washington Post.\" They were stopped with a $250 million lawsuit for smearing the Covington children who were here for the March for Life. It's unlikely that that suit well win, but it speaks to some great frustration with media performance. And we did have a Supreme Court justice this week say it's time to revisit libel laws of \"New York Times\" versus Sullivan."
