This comes as there are complaints from passengers they're not being treated well by the commercial airlines.

Now, we've seen some improvement over the course of the summer, but still not an acceptable level in terms of performance, cancellation, and delays. So, here's what we're doing about: we'll collaborate with airlines when they're ready to take steps that are positive and proactive, whether that's improvement in pay that are helping with hiring or flexibility in customer service. We're also going to enforce passenger and consumer rights. And this is not new for us, as matter of fact, it was last year that I announced the stiffest fines ever imposed under our consumer protection program for airlines that were failing to provide refunds to passengers after they got stuck with cancellations. As a matter of fact, we have just concluded other 10 investigations on airlines on these issues, and have launched another 10 or so that we're going to pursue to make sure that the consumers and passengers are protected. At the same time, I do want to emphasize again, we've seen movement in the right direction. You know, I gathered airline leaders after the Memorial Day travel weekend. We saw a really high level of cancellations and delays there. The July 4th travel we can we just came through which had some of the busiest travel days of the year, definitely fewer cancellations and delays. The numbers I just saw from last few days, they're around 2, 2-1/2 percent, still higher than they should be. It's never going to be zero. But we really want to see them push toward 1 percent or so with realistic scheduling, responsible customer service, and all the things airlines need to do to properly service the tickets that they are selling to passengers.",

Now, what's clearly the case is we need to cultivate, train, and support a new generation of qualified pilots. As a matter of fact, just last week, I was out with some programs that are helping to cultivate that interest in students and support them as they get their hours and get those qualifications. The answer is not to keep the baby boomer generation in the cockpit indefinitely. The answer is to make sure that we have as many in as good pilots ready to take their place, to have a stronger pipeline. We're backing that up with FAA programs that support high school and college curriculums to get into aviation. And, of course, ultimately, it will be for the airlines and those employers to hire and retain excellent talent. And, you know, this is an issue we're seeing across the aviation sector, across the transportation sector at large -- the importance of having competitive pay, great job quality, so that we can bring in and keep the people that are going to be needed to power America's transportation sector.",

Right now, for example, we're in the middle of rolling out up to a billion dollars in airport improvements. And these are going out to airports across the country. Orlando is going to see about $50 million to help expand gates and allow them to have more capacity and accommodate more passengers. Chattanooga is going to see improvements that help passengers move more smoothly through the airport. And we're not forgetting smaller, more rural facilities that might not be household names, but could mean a huge amount economically to those regions. The Chamberlain, South Dakota, for example, their general aviation terminal right now is a mobile home. We're going to fund them to have the kind of terminal they really need in order for flight operations to grow and to succeed. So, we're proud of what we're doing. Whether it's this airport terminal program going to 85 airports around the country that we're working on that this week, or initiatives to eliminate railroad crossings that can be both a headache and a safety hazard in communities across the U.S., or, of course, so much funding going to fixing roads, bridges, and other facilities that people need in order to get where they need to go safely and conveniently.",

And this is an important thing to point out: we're not creating all of the designs in Washington. We know that it's local communities and individual airports or facilities that are going to know what their needs are. We're trying to trying to provide more of the funding. But again, those dollars are going to be moving quickly.

You know, there are a lot of lessons from choice of the `50s, `60s, and `70s. A lot of communities can point to where highway that was put in the period where they didn't pay attention to the community or listen to the community. It really cut up and separated a lot of our towns. And so, we're also funding ways to reconnect those communities when a rail line or a highway overpass is doing as much harm as good. We're going to do it better this time. The 2020s I think is going to be remembered as a period where we set up infrastructure that we're going to be proud of for an entire century.

When I talk to people around Wyoming in terms of inflation, they're spending $100 a week more now than they were last year just to -- just to keep up.

You want enough money that you can buy a week's worth of groceries and you want to have enough money to pay the bills at the end of the month. But Joe Biden is not going there. Oh, no.

He is -- he's an incredible figure and someone who I think certainly changed the dynamic. But part of the problem here is that Boris stopped being Boris.

The problem for them now is that forming that coalition again, I think, will prove to be very impossible. And just one thing that I think we should appreciate about politics in the U.K. is that, you know, as much as people may speak in high Dutchen (ph) about honesty or scandal or something like this, this is such a farcical reason for him to be pushed out on so many different respects. It had a lot more to do with the failure of Covid related policies, his break with a lot of the things that he stood for before he ascended to the PM position and not to do to spending too much on parties or drapes.

      "utterance": "Let's start with travel hassles during the busy summer travel season. We've had weeks of cancellations and delays amid a pilot shortage. This comes as there are complaints from passengers they're not being treated well by the commercial airlines. And after American taxpayers gave the commercial aviation industry $54 billion during the pandemic, can you understand why some taxpayers feel like they aren't getting their money's worth from the airline industry?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUTTIGIEG",
      "utterance": "That's right. A lot of passengers have experienced frustration, including me and millions of other Americans. Now, we've seen some improvement over the course of the summer, but still not an acceptable level in terms of performance, cancellation, and delays."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "So, here's what we're doing about",
      "utterance": "we'll collaborate with airlines when they're ready to take steps that are positive and proactive, whether that's improvement in pay that are helping with hiring or flexibility in customer service. We're also going to enforce passenger and consumer rights. And this is not new for us, as matter of fact, it was last year that I announced the stiffest fines ever imposed under our consumer protection program for airlines that were failing to provide refunds to passengers after they got stuck with cancellations. As a matter of fact, we have just concluded other 10 investigations on airlines on these issues, and have launched another 10 or so that we're going to pursue to make sure that the consumers and passengers are protected. At the same time, I do want to emphasize again, we've seen movement in the right direction. You know, I gathered airline leaders after the Memorial Day travel weekend. We saw a really high level of cancellations and delays there. The July 4th travel we can we just came through which had some of the busiest travel days of the year, definitely fewer cancellations and delays. The numbers I just saw from last few days, they're around 2, 2-1/2 percent, still higher than they should be. It's never going to be zero. But we really want to see them push toward 1 percent or so with realistic scheduling, responsible customer service, and all the things airlines need to do to properly service the tickets that they are selling to passengers."

As they leave, they take not just a substantial part of the labor force with them, but also decades of expertise and experience in the air. I'm told Senator Lindsey Graham is talking with colleagues about potentially raising that retirement age for commercial pilots to 67. Would you support that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUTTIGIEG",
      "utterance": "Look, these retirement ages are there for a reason, and the reason is safety. I'm not going to be on board with anything that could compromise safety. Now, what's clearly the case is we need to cultivate, train, and support a new generation of qualified pilots. As a matter of fact, just last week, I was out with some programs that are helping to cultivate that interest in students and support them as they get their hours and get those qualifications. The answer is not to keep the baby boomer generation in the cockpit indefinitely. The answer is to make sure that we have as many in as good pilots ready to take their place, to have a stronger pipeline. We're backing that up with FAA programs that support high school and college curriculums to get into aviation. And, of course, ultimately, it will be for the airlines and those employers to hire and retain excellent talent. And, you know, this is an issue we're seeing across the aviation sector, across the transportation sector at large -- the importance of having competitive pay, great job quality, so that we can bring in and keep the people that are going to be needed to power America's transportation sector."

You've said that basically the funding rolls out over five years. We're seven months into that process. What are you and your team doing to try to move things along?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUTTIGIEG",
      "utterance": "Well, we have been announcing a new program every few days pursuant to that infrastructure law. Right now, for example, we're in the middle of rolling out up to a billion dollars in airport improvements. And these are going out to airports across the country. Orlando is going to see about $50 million to help expand gates and allow them to have more capacity and accommodate more passengers. Chattanooga is going to see improvements that help passengers move more smoothly through the airport. And we're not forgetting smaller, more rural facilities that might not be household names, but could mean a huge amount economically to those regions. The Chamberlain, South Dakota, for example, their general aviation terminal right now is a mobile home. We're going to fund them to have the kind of terminal they really need in order for flight operations to grow and to succeed. So, we're proud of what we're doing. Whether it's this airport terminal program going to 85 airports around the country that we're working on that this week, or initiatives to eliminate railroad crossings that can be both a headache and a safety hazard in communities across the U.S., or, of course, so much funding going to fixing roads, bridges, and other facilities that people need in order to get where they need to go safely and conveniently."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "And this is an important thing to point out",
      "utterance": "we're not creating all of the designs in Washington. We know that it's local communities and individual airports or facilities that are going to know what their needs are. We're trying to trying to provide more of the funding. But again, those dollars are going to be moving quickly. And I'll tell you, even before you see the improvements finished, you're going to see a lot of construction jobs associated with putting them in."
    },

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUTTIGIEG",
      "utterance": "Sure. We're funding a lot of improvements for roads and bridges, too, but we're doing it in a better way I would say than what has been on the past. You know, there are a lot of lessons from choice of the `50s, `60s, and `70s. A lot of communities can point to where highway that was put in the period where they didn't pay attention to the community or listen to the community. It really cut up and separated a lot of our towns. And so, we're also funding ways to reconnect those communities when a rail line or a highway overpass is doing as much harm as good. We're going to do it better this time. The 2020s I think is going to be remembered as a period where we set up infrastructure that we're going to be proud of for an entire century. And I'm thrilled to be part of the process of working with states, working with cities, working with communities, working with airports and transit authorities, to get that work done."

But I'm proud to be part of this administration that has done such work to bring America back from the brink of a recession, to create record job growth, to build achievements that would not have been thought possible just a couple of years ago, like the bipartisan infrastructure law that I have the honor of working on. You know, people scoffed at the idea that you could get anything done on a bipartisan basis in Washington. And yet, the president delivered it, and that's after years and years, multiple presidents, multiple congresses coming and going, promising infrastructure bills without any results.

The American people know what they want. Families are really hurting all across the country. When I talk to people around Wyoming in terms of inflation, they're spending $100 a week more now than they were last year just to -- just to keep up. And, you know, they said, what do you really want? You want enough money to be able to fill your tank with gas. You want enough money that you can buy a week's worth of groceries and you want to have enough money to pay the bills at the end of the month. But Joe Biden is not going there. Oh, no.

The gun industry has made a lot of money out of this, but America is not safer because of it."

And even before this period of the economy, American families all responded that the price of prescription drugs are just too high. People sometimes can't afford the medicines they need to stay alive. They wonder why the same drugs made in America cost a fraction of what we pay for months in countries like Canada and Europe, and they wonder why we haven't done anything as a nation to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. The Democrats, Chuck Schumer, and all of us are working towards bringing down these prices to say to people who are facing insulin dependent diabetes that the cost of their drugs and insulin will be less than not more than $35 a month, dramatic changes, bringing down prices that families struggle with every single day. Now, Senator McConnell has stepped up and saying, I'm going to stop this effort to bring down prescription drug prices. I don't want you to do it and you shouldn't do it. And if you persist in this effort to try and do it, I'm going to stop the bill that gives us better competition with China. The semiconductor industry is central to economic growth and job creation in this country. We've lost ground on it, and we've got to build a change that. And McConnell has said he's going to stop that bill and he's going to do it if we should violate the pharmaceutical companies' plea to us not to lower prescription drug prices. The bottom line is this, American families need help in paying their bills and they need help in lifesaving drugs being affordable. The Democrats are leading that. Senator McConnell opposes it."

I would think that Justice Thomas should recuse himself from any decisions that relate to the January 6th episode. Already he was the single vote earlier on a case related to that issue.

But you think about it for a second. Gas prices actually are headed down. They're still too high, but they're headed in the right direction. In addition to that, you have to stop and think about the January 6th committee, which has had success in terms of penetrating public consciousness and public opinion. In terms of the bringing chaos, Trump's chaos to the forefront of the conversation again. And then you think about the abortion decision. You think about the gun massacres that have taken place.

He is the third prime minister in a row brought down by Boris Johnson in certain respects, which I think we should appreciate. He is -- he's an incredible figure and someone who I think certainly changed the dynamic. But part of the problem here is that Boris stopped being Boris. And by that I mean he stopped being the kind of populist that conservatives could have confidence in when it came to forming the kind of coalition that led to getting 14 million votes in 2019. The problem for them now is that forming that coalition again, I think, will prove to be very impossible. And just one thing that I think we should appreciate about politics in the U.K. is that, you know, as much as people may speak in high Dutchen (ph) about honesty or scandal or something like this, this is such a farcical reason for him to be pushed out on so many different respects. It had a lot more to do with the failure of Covid related policies, his break with a lot of the things that he stood for before he ascended to the PM position and not to do to spending too much on parties or drapes. It would be the equivalent of getting rid of Gavin Newsom for going to the French Laundry. It doesn't really track as being very serious."

Republicans, conservatives here are still locked into Trump. But I think Johnson wants to influence who might come next. His successor. Maybe he thinks he might be re-elected at some point.

I think the Democrats clearly want to say, we are doing something. We can get things done. And Mitch McConnell's tactic over the years has been to stall, to obstruct, and he's employing that tactic now at the risk of looking hypocritical because he supports these bills in the past. So, the question becomes, what does he think? And I think it's about just what you said, Mike, which is that he's worried now that it looks better for the Democrats with weak - with week Republican nominees running for these Senate seats. You know, the numbers in Georgia have shifted recently with suddenly Senator Warnock doing much better against Herschel Walker. You look in Pennsylvania, similar shifts.

But if your - if your people who were out there on the trail vocalizing this have significant personal challenges, that makes it tougher to do. That being said, every indication we have in terms of the overall perspective, the right track wrong track, the level of shifts that you've seen, and in some of these special elections and the like seem to indicate a Republican wave year that may, as we've seen in wave years before, end up sending a lot of people to Washington who no one ever expected to make it there."
