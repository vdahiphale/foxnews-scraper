Also, tonight what's really behind the Left's push as I just said to abolish the Electoral College. Are they looking to silence you, smaller states and rural America? My “Angle” a little later. Plus, they might seem like innocent statements, but Candace Owens is here to tell us why Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton's remarks yesterday should be taken as a stark warning to conservative America. And Dr. Drew is here tonight. His Can't Miss message to California Governor Gavin Newsom ignoring a homeless epidemic that has revived medieval diseases.

There was no illegal collusion. There was no collusion of any kind with the Russians and the investigation should have ended the day that decision was made, but it continued on and on and on with collateral crimes many of which were not even committed and others of which if it were committed could have been easily prosecuted by ordinary prosecutors.

In fact, those values are often diametrically opposed and that's OK. That's how the framers envisioned it. And that's why the Electoral College provides a necessary balance. While on occasion, the candidate with the most votes doesn't win, but in those cases, it's usually because that candidate only appealed to a slice of America, not a broader coalition.

He should have come to that conclusion and I think the only thing Barr should have said that he didn't say is that there should no longer ever be any special counsel. The Mueller investigation puts the final nail in the coffin of Special Counsel, special prosecutors, the Attorney General could do this himself. There are staff people, there are civil servants, there are full-time line prosecutors everything that was done here could be done by them. When the special prosecutor, the special counsel in this case says I couldn't have indicted the President anyway according to the Constitution, then what was his investigation all about. As Judge Ellis pointed out in the Manafort case, they weren't interested in Manafort, they were interested in squeezing Manafort so that he could sing maybe even compose against President Trump, but it turned out there was nothing against President Trump. There was no illegal collusion. There was no collusion of any kind with the Russians and the investigation should have ended the day that decision was made, but it continued on and on and on with collateral crimes many of which were not even committed and others of which if it were committed could have been easily prosecuted by ordinary prosecutors. So, I think we're seeing the death knell of the special counsel's office."

But Governor Huckabee, I think that statement in and of itself was an indication as to why this whole Special Counsel statute, provision, the way it goes has got to be just done away with, just do line prosecutions but these special counsels are always opening the door to corruption or to bias or to concern about bias.

In other words, there must be high crimes to impeach. And if President Obama had done what President Trump is alleged to have done, there'd be no high crimes. So, there wouldn't have been impeachment, there wouldn't have been talk of impeachment. This is a clear attempt to violate the Constitution in the interests of one party. And if the Hillary Clinton had been president, they were trying to impeach her for non- impeachable offenses, I'd be making the same arguments, the only differences they'd build a statute to me on Martha's Vineyard and they'd be inviting me to every possible dinner party because I'd be defending their champion Hillary Clinton.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, to be fair, Beto does have some experience with the whole warped thing. While seriously, the Founders designed the Electoral College as part of the overall system of checks and balances, so that all 50 states, not just the most populous ones have a meaningful say in electing the President. Alexander Hamilton, one of our faves Federalist Paper Number 68, he wrote the electors chosen in each state are to assemble and vote in the state in which they are chosen. This detached and divided situation will expose them to much less to heat and ferments than if they were to all be convened at one time in one place. Nothing was more to be desired than that every practical obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. Interesting. Well that could be the definition of I don't know today's deep state, cabal, intrigue and corruption. Just tripped up my tongue. Well now largely funded by powerful globalists, including George Soros affiliated group, dispensing with the Electoral College has become a priority to most of the 2020 Democrats as you saw. Now without the Electoral College, think about it. Those candidates could spend most of their time campaigning and just a handful of states like California, New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois popping in and out of their biggest cities. The same places by the way where they raise all of their money. Now there was a time when Democrats believed in running in rural states rather than just seeking to disenfranchise them. RFK campaigned in Appalachia. FDR visited the Dust Bowl. They believed in a system that required candidates to appeal to a broader segment of America one that includes rural areas, the Midwest, the Deep South, states like New Mexico and even New England. And by the way, don't be fooled for a millisecond by this argument."

      "utterance": "Gosh, she really thinks we're stupid. We must fell for the DNA tests, but we didn't. Now California has a population of 40 million people. West Virginia has about 2 million. So how would that state have any meaningful say in this new system. Without the Electoral College, we'll essentially be living in something akin to a tyranny disguised as a democracy with a handful of liberal states making all the decisions for the rest of us. For instance, California with its super Democrat majority believes in sanctuary cities. Of course, pot legalization, taxes, regulating anything that moves and their values and concerns, it's beautiful state but those values and concerns often don't match up with those of other states, like South Carolina, Indiana, Georgia. In fact, those values are often diametrically opposed and that's OK. That's how the framers envisioned it. And that's why the Electoral College provides a necessary balance. While on occasion, the candidate with the most votes doesn't win, but in those cases, it's usually because that candidate only appealed to a slice of America, not a broader coalition. Remember the electoral map that showed how counties voted in 2016. Wow, it's like a bid red ink spot. Well, people often refer to the United States, don't they as a democracy. But we're not. We're a republic. The founders made a very smart decision not to establish America as a pure democracy because they feared the mob mentality and what James Madison called the tyranny of the majority. Now given modern media, they were present, it's also important to know who is behind this effort to do away the Electoral College. And it's not a new idea but it has been renewed and I think invigorated since Hillary lost. Does the name David Boies mean anything to you? Well, he not only successfully argued the gay marriage case at the Supreme Court, he represented Al Gore in the 2000 recount. He's now arguing the cases against the Electoral College in Massachusetts, California, South Carolina and Texas. Who's funding the litigation? Well, a bunch of big law firms. They don't do stuff for free, I used to work for one. Now probably the same folks also who helped gin up the faux outrage, about statues that have been standing in public squares for decades. I bet they have a hand in this. And the same folks who are spending millions on local and state campaigns and Arizona and Florida for Secretary of State, state judges and city school board officers, they are really into this. They're really agitated to keep Trump out. No re-election for him. The Left means business. Now, they've already tried to silence and demonize traditionalists in business, on college campuses, in the public square and in the social media. If the Left believes it has to upend the entire constitutional structure to quash the influence of flyover country. Whether it's from court packing or lowering the voting age or axing the Electoral College. They'll do it. And it's up to smart constitutionalists to make the case for the rights of the threatened minority and middle America. Small Town USA is every bit as American as New York and LA and they should have a say in our government. And that's “The Angle.” All right here now to respond is Saul Anuzis, Senior Consultant to the National Popular Vote Initiative. Saul, you're an old friend and it's wild that you're doing this because you and Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg and George Soros' kids are all on the same side.

Tonight, Chasten's brother says these stories have been spun for political advantage by Pete Buttigieg and are hurting his family. Since the \"Washington Post\" article came out, the family has been subjected, he says, to hateful messages by email, social media, and text, one suggesting that my next guest kill himself. Here now exclusively, Pastor Rhyan Glezman, brother of Chasten Buttigieg. Rhyan, thank you for being here.

I think a mayor's role is very important. But at the end of the day, if you only have the mayor role, and you are go at the highest office in the country, you need to have a different story.

And they do it on late-night TV of Trump and people like yours truly all the time. I don't care. It doesn't bother me what other people, frankly, say about me. I don't care.

And I think it's also ironic because her whole platform is she thought she was strong enough to be the president of the United States and she can't deal with any doctoring of videos on the Internet. Just think again of what Trump has to deal with every single day. This is ridiculous. But I will say this. Silencing and banning conservatives, that actually works for us. It works for us. When you ban somebody's favorite political commentator, their followers don't go, OK, I guess now I'm a Democrat. They double down and they dig their heels in.

We will have a typhus as outbreak this summer. I'm hearing from experts that bubonic plague is likely. It's already here. It will get onto the rat fleas. And then now finally we have this oral fecal route contamination, which is typhoid fever, three cases, one confirmed, probably three. This is unbelievable. I can't believe I live in a city where this is not third world, Laura. This is medieval. Third world countries are insulted if they are accused of being like this. No city on earth tolerates this.
