And it remains to be seen whether Biden is even capable of standing upright at this moment. Now his cognitive decline, everybody knows that it's obvious. He needs cards for pretty much everything. And lately, it seems he doesn't just need electoral support from women, but physical support as well like whenever he's walking with Michigan Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, that was odd. And today attending the Queen's funeral, Dr. Jill seemed more like nursemaid Jill, than First Lady. Then rudely, did you notice this the Biden's actually arrived late, and thus in a very awkward moment the President of the United States had to stand and be told to wait as Military heroes processed in. The Guardian writing, 'After arriving hand in hand, the Biden's finally sat down in their places at the abbey at 10:05am. The schedule published by Buckingham Palace suggested the 500 invited dignitaries should have been seated between 9:35am and 9:55am. Perhaps as a consequences of the opting out of the buses taking other leaders from the assembly point at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, the Biden's were also given seats, 14 rows back in the south transept of the Abbey.' Now for a President, who publicly prided himself on his vast experience in foreign and domestic affairs, this was embarrassing. It even when needing physical support, Joe Biden can always count on his regime media support. Look out KJP because Scott Pelley of CBS seems like he's auditioning for your job.",

Be on the sight of the global elites, America under Biden is becoming its own hellscape of economic pain. An article in the Wall Street Journal was so upsetting to me tonight that I had to share it with you. When single mom Jamaica Bonvillian was asked about her grocery trip, she started tearing up. 'I just get to the point she said where I break down and I'm like, OK, how do I do it? She's taken on extra work, painting and landscaping on the weekends to try to make up the difference'. And then there's the heartbreaking story of Jessica Boudreaux. Her other son and her grandson are moving in with her soon, and she doesn't know how she's going to afford to feed everyone. 'Luckily, my grandbaby is only two, so he doesn't eat a lot,' she said. And maybe just maybe the party claiming that they're so pro women should pay attention to Megan Naquin's experience. The Journal reports that she now spends more on her groceries for her family of eight than on her $1,500 monthly mortgage. Stuff hasn't gone up a little bit. It's gone up tremendously, the homemaker said. Now, these are real American stories. And once in a while a reporter from another network will actually do his job.",

Now that summer is over the harsh, cold reality of American life under this Democrat majority is starting to set in. Republicans are well-positioned to comfortably win back the House, and are on a surer footing than just weeks ago to net the one seat necessary to capture a narrow Senate majority. And the concern of whether leadership in the Senate was going to get involved has apparently awakened Mitch McConnell. Not only is he holding it another fundraiser for Blake Masters in Arizona, but again Axios is reporting in another article tonight, that he's actually having some closed door confidence over the GOP winning back the Senate now. We told you, then for good reason look, they have a winning argument. Last week's FOX poll found that 59 percent of voters said they were extremely concerned with inflation and higher prices. Of course, 40 percent said, 45 percent said the same about abortion policy. And Republicans are trusted more on the economy by a margin of 14 points, that's 52 to 38 according to new polling by the New York Times. The economy, crime and the border should be all that the Republicans hit and hit hard from now until Election Day. Anything else it frankly right this, this one is a distraction. And the first time candidates that you know the Republican Party is nominated, that people are said all they're not good enough. Look, they're not squishes, they want real change. Because the time for small reforms that's over, we have to save America all over again and frankly that's going to require big reforms. The radicals though now running the Democrat party, it's easy to point out they're responsible for the coming recession and the violent crime that's tearing apart the American landscape. The tears that are welling up in the eyes have worried mothers and grandmothers, all the concern felt by fathers and young people and entrepreneurs, all those people just starting out, they are the direct result of the Democrats cruel policies. And that's 'The Angle'. All right. Joining me now is John Ratcliffe, Former Director of National Intel and Stephen Miller, Former Senior Advisor to President Trump, and Founder of America First Legal. Stephen, with everything I laid out in 'The Angle' Democrats, you know, should be giving Republicans runaway wins in the House and Senate. At this point, do you agree that the Senate majority takeover by the Republicans is looking much better? STEPHEN MILLER; FORMER TRUMP SENIOR ADVISOR: Oh, it's absolutely looking much better than it was, even a short time ago, as Republican candidates are beginning to get their message out on the issues you just mentioned. So we see tight races in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Washington State and New Hampshire, Nevada. Vance is putting it away in Ohio. We have Herschel Walker, getting out into a very comfortable lead in Georgia. But we cannot be overconfident, we have to work, we have to get the message out. And we have to explain exactly what you said. America under Biden is a poor country. It is a weaker country. It is a more violent country, and more dangerous country. And it's a country where moms and dads can't even afford to put food on their table for their own children, this is heartbreaking.",

You know, the message is very clear, obey the state, do what we say, nobody is safe. So I think it's very clear that when things are personal, it's that democratic rule has been personal against anyone that would oppose what's been happening. And you know, to your monologue, the point that you made, Laura is exactly the right one, you know, people focus on you know, this election, its kitchen table issues. And now, Joe Biden and his administration have made national security a kitchen table issue. We got a 400 percent increase in illegal immigration. We've got a 4,000 percent increase in fentanyl coming into this country enough to kill everyone in the country. We got a 3,000 percent increase in the number of terror suspects from the terrorist watch list encountered by CBP, it's naive to think that the people watching this show aren't going to be tragically impacted, their friends, their family, their neighbors, by one or more of those things in this country that have made the country less safe, as Stephen said.",

I think it's this race in Texas highlights what I've been contending for a while now that the political landscape always settles out after Labor Day, especially when the economic news that's bad is unrelenting, as it has been with inflation and prices. So the blue surge is that a fallacy?",

It is the economy. It is inflation. It is crime. It is immigration. And even the NBC News poll showed Republicans with a 36 point advantage on border security 19 points on the economy, 23 points on crime.

One volunteer saying, \"We're used to dealing with people in need we are super happy, like they enriched us. We're happy to help them on their journey.\" A bystander tossed the migrants a bag of chocolates as they were leaving. \"I brought the candy,\" they proudly boasted. A Boston immigration attorney adding, \"We've got their backs. And they're not alone.\" And finally, a church organist said the island now felt lonely. The governor of Florida got it wrong. He thought we wouldn't know what the deal. Actually, people here really give a damn. They really care.\" Charlie, I actually thought this was a headline from \"The Babylon Bee\" or \"The Onion,\" but this was a 44-hour outpouring of support for the migrants, and you might as well have thought there were like dozens of organ donations or something going on and people being invited to stay for a couple of months.

And so this is the way that the left has always operated. Sometimes they say it's hypocrisy. It's really hierarchy. And the way to get the Democrats attention at the highest levels of government is not send them to the Kamala Harris, not just send them to Chicago. No, send them to the homes of Democrat donors, and they start to freak out. And what's so amazing, Laura, is they say we care so deeply about these migrants. Really, you care so deeply about them, you kick them off your island and what 44 hours? And say, they always enrich the experience, they enriched the experience so much that you couldn't even keep them there for a couple of days. You know who doesn't have the luxury? The border towns in Arizona. The border towns in Texas. They don't have the luxury just to kick them off the mainland, 5,000 a day some estimates show.

And lately, it seems he doesn't just need electoral support from women, but physical support as well like whenever he's walking with Michigan Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, that was odd. And today attending the Queen's funeral, Dr. Jill seemed more like nursemaid Jill, than First Lady. Then rudely, did you notice this the Biden's actually arrived late, and thus in a very awkward moment the President of the United States had to stand and be told to wait as Military heroes processed in. The Guardian writing, 'After arriving hand in hand, the Biden's finally sat down in their places at the abbey at 10:05am. The schedule published by Buckingham Palace suggested the 500 invited dignitaries should have been seated between 9:35am and 9:55am. Perhaps as a consequences of the opting out of the buses taking other leaders from the assembly point at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, the Biden's were also given seats, 14 rows back in the south transept of the Abbey.' Now for a President, who publicly prided himself on his vast experience in foreign and domestic affairs, this was embarrassing. It even when needing physical support, Joe Biden can always count on his regime media support. Look out KJP because Scott Pelley of CBS seems like he's auditioning for your job."

Be on the sight of the global elites, America under Biden is becoming its own hellscape of economic pain. An article in the Wall Street Journal was so upsetting to me tonight that I had to share it with you. When single mom Jamaica Bonvillian was asked about her grocery trip, she started tearing up. 'I just get to the point she said where I break down and I'm like, OK, how do I do it? She's taken on extra work, painting and landscaping on the weekends to try to make up the difference'. And then there's the heartbreaking story of Jessica Boudreaux. Her other son and her grandson are moving in with her soon, and she doesn't know how she's going to afford to feed everyone. 'Luckily, my grandbaby is only two, so he doesn't eat a lot,' she said. And maybe just maybe the party claiming that they're so pro women should pay attention to Megan Naquin's experience. The Journal reports that she now spends more on her groceries for her family of eight than on her $1,500 monthly mortgage. Stuff hasn't gone up a little bit. It's gone up tremendously, the homemaker said. Now, these are real American stories. And once in a while a reporter from another network will actually do his job."

Now that summer is over the harsh, cold reality of American life under this Democrat majority is starting to set in. Republicans are well-positioned to comfortably win back the House, and are on a surer footing than just weeks ago to net the one seat necessary to capture a narrow Senate majority. And the concern of whether leadership in the Senate was going to get involved has apparently awakened Mitch McConnell. Not only is he holding it another fundraiser for Blake Masters in Arizona, but again Axios is reporting in another article tonight, that he's actually having some closed door confidence over the GOP winning back the Senate now. We told you, then for good reason look, they have a winning argument. Last week's FOX poll found that 59 percent of voters said they were extremely concerned with inflation and higher prices. Of course, 40 percent said, 45 percent said the same about abortion policy. And Republicans are trusted more on the economy by a margin of 14 points, that's 52 to 38 according to new polling by the New York Times. The economy, crime and the border should be all that the Republicans hit and hit hard from now until Election Day. Anything else it frankly right this, this one is a distraction. And the first time candidates that you know the Republican Party is nominated, that people are said all they're not good enough. Look, they're not squishes, they want real change. Because the time for small reforms that's over, we have to save America all over again and frankly that's going to require big reforms. The radicals though now running the Democrat party, it's easy to point out they're responsible for the coming recession and the violent crime that's tearing apart the American landscape. The tears that are welling up in the eyes have worried mothers and grandmothers, all the concern felt by fathers and young people and entrepreneurs, all those people just starting out, they are the direct result of the Democrats cruel policies. And that's 'The Angle'. All right. Joining me now is John Ratcliffe, Former Director of National Intel and Stephen Miller, Former Senior Advisor to President Trump, and Founder of America First Legal. Stephen, with everything I laid out in 'The Angle' Democrats, you know, should be giving Republicans runaway wins in the House and Senate. At this point, do you agree that the Senate majority takeover by the Republicans is looking much better? STEPHEN MILLER; FORMER TRUMP SENIOR ADVISOR: Oh, it's absolutely looking much better than it was, even a short time ago, as Republican candidates are beginning to get their message out on the issues you just mentioned. So we see tight races in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Washington State and New Hampshire, Nevada. Vance is putting it away in Ohio. We have Herschel Walker, getting out into a very comfortable lead in Georgia. But we cannot be overconfident, we have to work, we have to get the message out. And we have to explain exactly what you said. America under Biden is a poor country. It is a weaker country. It is a more violent country, and more dangerous country. And it's a country where moms and dads can't even afford to put food on their table for their own children, this is heartbreaking."

You know, the message is very clear, obey the state, do what we say, nobody is safe. So I think it's very clear that when things are personal, it's that democratic rule has been personal against anyone that would oppose what's been happening. And you know, to your monologue, the point that you made, Laura is exactly the right one, you know, people focus on you know, this election, its kitchen table issues. And now, Joe Biden and his administration have made national security a kitchen table issue. We got a 400 percent increase in illegal immigration. We've got a 4,000 percent increase in fentanyl coming into this country enough to kill everyone in the country. We got a 3,000 percent increase in the number of terror suspects from the terrorist watch list encountered by CBP, it's naive to think that the people watching this show aren't going to be tragically impacted, their friends, their family, their neighbors, by one or more of those things in this country that have made the country less safe, as Stephen said."

And he thinks somehow this is going to be a winning issue for him in the midterms, the idea of turning and continuing to turn the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security into a weapon of oppression against Republicans and conservatives. I predict that swing voters middle of the road voters, independent voters who see criminals and thugs, beating people in the street unrestrained, uninhibited, but see good upstanding Republicans being persecuted are going to say no more, they're going to put the Democrats out of office, they're going to say we want criminals and predators behind bars.

You just pointed out Laura, that yesterday was the fourth time, in less than one year, the Joe Biden misstated his own Taiwan policy, and the fourth time in less than one year that the White House came back and had to correct him and say, that's not what our policy is on Taiwan. If we don't know what our policy is with respect to Taiwan, what is China thinking right now? They know that we don't know. And, you know less than two hours ago, Laura our reports are that eight Chinese Military planes flew into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone, now don't get too alarmed, because that's been happening a lot in the Biden Administration. But if they take military action, what is the clear and unambiguous response we can all expect from the Biden Administration based on what we've seen. The truth is we don't know, and China will take advantage of that because there's no deterrent effect."

Well, well, well, a new poll would seem to snuff out that pipe dream. It shows Governor Abbott with a commanding nine point lead in Texas. Now it turns out that Texas voters might just be responding positively to what Abbott is doing, by shipping some of the migrants to liberal enclaves. Joining me now is Tom Bevan, President, Co-Founder of RealClearPolitics. Lot to get to with you, Tom. I think it's this race in Texas highlights what I've been contending for a while now that the political landscape always settles out after Labor Day, especially when the economic news that's bad is unrelenting, as it has been with inflation and prices.

I mean, Texas still, even though Democrats dream of turning it blue, it still has way more Republicans, the Democrats and with the move from Hispanic voters to the Republican Party in South Texas, I mean Greg Abbott is that 37 percent with Hispanics, Beto O'Rourke's at 41.

I think that'll give you some indication of where things stand. But what, was interesting about the NBC News poll, and this gets to your point, Laura, which is, despite all the talk of the legislative victories and the Dobbs decision, the economic I mean, the landscape, the political landscape, and dynamic of this election has not changed. It is the economy. It is inflation. It is crime. It is immigration. And even the NBC News poll showed Republicans with a 36 point advantage on border security 19 points on the economy, 23 points on crime. Now while abortion has energized Democrats, there's no question about that. And it is up on their list of top concerns. It's not overall, it's not within dependents.

Obviously, the abortion issue is in play and Democrats are going to bring it up, as much as and as often as they can.

In his own words, Joe Biden says I never observed anything untoward, but he told us he didn't know anything about the business dealings. So how would he know what to observe or what not to observe?

It's for an emotional day because the Queen, but also of this. To fully appreciate the emotion, I need to read through CNN's invaluable reporting. \"Migrants' 44-hour visit leaves an indelible mark on Martha's Vineyard. One volunteer saying, \"We're used to dealing with people in need we are super happy, like they enriched us. We're happy to help them on their journey.\" A bystander tossed the migrants a bag of chocolates as they were leaving. \"I brought the candy,\" they proudly boasted. A Boston immigration attorney adding, \"We've got their backs. And they're not alone.\" And finally, a church organist said the island now felt lonely. The governor of Florida got it wrong. He thought we wouldn't know what the deal. Actually, people here really give a damn. They really care.\" Charlie, I actually thought this was a headline from \"The Babylon Bee\" or \"The Onion,\" but this was a 44-hour outpouring of support for the migrants, and you might as well have thought there were like dozens of organ donations or something going on and people being invited to stay for a couple of months.

And so this is the way that the left has always operated. Sometimes they say it's hypocrisy. It's really hierarchy. And the way to get the Democrats attention at the highest levels of government is not send them to the Kamala Harris, not just send them to Chicago. No, send them to the homes of Democrat donors, and they start to freak out. And what's so amazing, Laura, is they say we care so deeply about these migrants. Really, you care so deeply about them, you kick them off your island and what 44 hours? And say, they always enrich the experience, they enriched the experience so much that you couldn't even keep them there for a couple of days. You know who doesn't have the luxury? The border towns in Arizona. The border towns in Texas. They don't have the luxury just to kick them off the mainland, 5,000 a day some estimates show.
