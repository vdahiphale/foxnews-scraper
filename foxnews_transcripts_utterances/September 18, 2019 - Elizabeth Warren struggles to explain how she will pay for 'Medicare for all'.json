It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” It's an epic clash in California, the president visiting the liberal stronghold and having major disagreements with its leaders on hot button issues. The president setting off liberal activists after raising millions in the state. Protesters fought with Trump supporters outside one of the fundraisers in Beverly Hills. This comes after Hollywood celebrities threatened to out his donors. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But that's not all. The president continuing to attack cities there and the homeless crisis saying, quote, we can't let Los Angeles, San Francisco, and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what's happening. There are policemen on the B who are getting sick. They're actually sick. They're going to the hospital. We can't let that happen. And earlier today, Trump killing California's ability to set its own auto emission standards. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Emily, you're from California.

Auto emission standards, I would think that most conservatives would say that's a states' rights issues. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

If I can speak for a second to on his disagreement, quote, unquote, with those liberal leaders. He's exactly right. And there was a letter that Governor Newsom sent to Trump on behalf of most of the mayors, and he -- they essentially said, look, homelessness is a decade old problem, and they ask for more handouts. They ask for 50,000 additional vouchers and to increase the value of the vouchers. But if I were a citizen still of California, I would be saying, where is my $600 million in taxpayer money going -- I gave you last year? Where's the additional $6 billion dollars that was just budgeted for my tax dollars?

In terms of the homelessness situation, California wants to be a tone republic. They ignore federal immigration law, federal marriage laws, federal drug laws. They're always ignoring the federal law. Then, all of a sudden they have a big homeless crisis, and they say, hey, feds, can we have some of your money to help fix this? They should have all the money in the world. They have the highest taxes, a huge tax base. They're the most compassionate, and Democrats control every single level of government, so why aren't they doing anything about it? Scott Adams retweeted a very nice article the other day and it says, why California keeps making homelessness worse? A number of reasons, the liberalized drug laws, they have no mandatory treatment if someone is running around like crazy, a lunatic, they can't help those people, and they screwed up their housing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Other warm weather states like Arizona, red state, has less tax revenue, they don't have this problem because they have strong oversight, the law enforcement, they coordinate with them, and they don't let just like drug addict, crazy people roamed the streets and keep coming in and out of prison. So, if you look at the way they've mismanaged this, think about how they've mismanaged the high-speed rail? Remember this train that was supposed to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles? It was supposed to take ten years. It was supposed to cost $33 billion, and you're going to do it under three hours. Now, they have a cost overrun of $44 billion, 13 years in addition to the 10 years it's going to take.

Because you live in a huge state where the rich never have to see the poor. I mean, this is the ultimate inequality. The rich never have to go downtown. They never take the subway. I don't know anybody who takes the subway in L.A. Being governor of California is such a Cush job, because the rich people who support you, they don't have to care about the taxes because they can afford it.

If you subtract politics and the media, who are basically driving this divisive business models, you could solve these problems, and you could accept that Trump would, but you can't expect Trump to solve the problem, because your ego won't let it. He could solve this. We all know. We want to get drug addicts off the street. We want to get the mentally ill into institutions, and we want to get the people who are truly down on their luck the help that they need. But as long Trump does it, the left can't let that happen.",

Thankfully, everywhere included the great Reason Magazine who independently analyzed the thing. But then they also analyzed the effective Hillary Clinton's campaign rallies using the same framework. They found that her rally led to an even greater increase in hate crimes than Trump rallies. Right there reasons just exposed what happens when junk science marries the media, it creates really stupid offspring. The study compared counties with rallies to others without them. Now, political rallies are usually held near large populations where raw crime numbers are higher, so no surprise. Big cities where rallies took place also had a few incidents of hate crimes, unlike smaller towns without rallies who reported no such crimes. So quite easily, reason show that you could do the same with Hillary rallies that the study authors did with Trump's. How could the media fall for this? Well, they wanted to fall for it. It's how you got Kavanaugh, Covington, Smollett, they sell the junk to people who need to believe the same thing they believe.

In the latest case you mentioned, Buck is accused of injecting a 37-year- old man with methamphetamine back on September 11th. Now that man survived which is why they filed the charges. But if you remember back in the past few years, two other men have been found dead inside his Hollywood apartment including 26-year-old Jamal Moore and 55-year-old Timothy Dean. Both had overdosed on methamphetamine within 18 months. At the time, there was not enough evidence to charge Buck even though Jamal Moore wrote in his journal, \"I've become addicted to drugs. And the worst one at that, Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth. It was painful, but after all the troubles I've become addicted.\" Moore's family went on to say, look, if Buck was a black man he'd have been taken to jail right away. Prosecutors say Buck would lure these men into his home with a \"bath of drugs, sex and shelter.\" And there was the case of Jermaine Gagnon. He told the Daily Mail at one point that Buck once flew him from Minnesota to LA and injected him with methamphetamine \"he said, I was so scared I felt death walked into my soul. I called my mom. I said I feel like he's going to kill me.\" So, police are now investigating the death of Timothy Dean, reinvestigating the death of Jamal Moore and now they have this brand new case and if you don't know, Ed Buck donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic causes and candidates. And now some candidates at least over the past 18 months decided they were going to give the money back. Prosecutors clearly believe they have enough evidence to put Ed Buck in prison for quite some time. Dana.",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” It's an epic clash in California, the president visiting the liberal stronghold and having major disagreements with its leaders on hot button issues. The president setting off liberal activists after raising millions in the state. Protesters fought with Trump supporters outside one of the fundraisers in Beverly Hills. This comes after Hollywood celebrities threatened to out his donors. But that's not all. The president continuing to attack cities there and the homeless crisis saying, quote, we can't let Los Angeles, San Francisco, and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what's happening. There are policemen on the B who are getting sick. They're actually sick. They're going to the hospital. We can't let that happen. And earlier today, Trump killing California's ability to set its own auto emission standards. Emily, you're from California. Let me begin with you. Auto emission standards, I would think that most conservatives would say that's a states' rights issues."

      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think part of his arguments, which I firmly support, is the fact that without the regulation they'll be higher innovation and the ability now for the market to set prices rather than the state to do it in kind of this manufactured way. If I can speak for a second to on his disagreement, quote, unquote, with those liberal leaders. He's exactly right. And there was a letter that Governor Newsom sent to Trump on behalf of most of the mayors, and he -- they essentially said, look, homelessness is a decade old problem, and they ask for more handouts. They ask for 50,000 additional vouchers and to increase the value of the vouchers. But if I were a citizen still of California, I would be saying, where is my $600 million in taxpayer money going -- I gave you last year? Where's the additional $6 billion dollars that was just budgeted for my tax dollars? Where is that going now? So they're arguing with the president and saying that he's doesn't believe in actually fixing homelessness, but nothing they are doing is helping, even though they're spending more and more dollars of taxpayers to attack the problem that literally is making people sick and will potentially start an epidemic in that state anytime soon."

Air quality, you can still do those types of things on terms of the pollution, and the dirt, and everything -- other cities have done that.

Because if you think about it, if you make it like 58-55 miles a gallon or whatever, you're creating these very, very light, costly cars. You get into an accident with a car like that, there's more people that die. So all they're saying their cars are going to be safer, because they're going to be stronger, and they're just going to be a little more affordable for regular middle-class Americans, and I think that's fine. In terms of the homelessness situation, California wants to be a tone republic. They ignore federal immigration law, federal marriage laws, federal drug laws. They're always ignoring the federal law. Then, all of a sudden they have a big homeless crisis, and they say, hey, feds, can we have some of your money to help fix this? They should have all the money in the world. They have the highest taxes, a huge tax base. They're the most compassionate, and Democrats control every single level of government, so why aren't they doing anything about it? Scott Adams retweeted a very nice article the other day and it says, why California keeps making homelessness worse? A number of reasons, the liberalized drug laws, they have no mandatory treatment if someone is running around like crazy, a lunatic, they can't help those people, and they screwed up their housing. Other warm weather states like Arizona, red state, has less tax revenue, they don't have this problem because they have strong oversight, the law enforcement, they coordinate with them, and they don't let just like drug addict, crazy people roamed the streets and keep coming in and out of prison. So, if you look at the way they've mismanaged this, think about how they've mismanaged the high-speed rail? Remember this train that was supposed to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles? It was supposed to take ten years. It was supposed to cost $33 billion, and you're going to do it under three hours. Now, they have a cost overrun of $44 billion, 13 years in addition to the 10 years it's going to take. And now, it's going to cost -- it's going to take over three hours to get to and fro."

I'm for political stunts if they actually solve problems. But what's interesting to me is how do you get such neglect to be acceptable for so long? Because you live in a huge state where the rich never have to see the poor. I mean, this is the ultimate inequality. The rich never have to go downtown. They never take the subway. I don't know anybody who takes the subway in L.A. Being governor of California is such a Cush job, because the rich people who support you, they don't have to care about the taxes because they can afford it. They don't have to care about the homeless because they never see them. They don't have to care about the disease that's been spread because they'll never step foot in skid row. So that's why Newsom doesn't have any pressure because they don't care. If you subtract politics and the media, who are basically driving this divisive business models, you could solve these problems, and you could accept that Trump would, but you can't expect Trump to solve the problem, because your ego won't let it. He could solve this. We all know. We want to get drug addicts off the street. We want to get the mentally ill into institutions, and we want to get the people who are truly down on their luck the help that they need. But as long Trump does it, the left can't let that happen."

When he was mayor of San Francisco, care not cash did not work. There is still a homeless problem there that is increasing by the year. And by continuing to focus on just one aspect fact of it, they're ignoring everything else that this president is at least touching on regardless of the intent.

Thankfully, everywhere included the great Reason Magazine who independently analyzed the thing. But then they also analyzed the effective Hillary Clinton's campaign rallies using the same framework. They found that her rally led to an even greater increase in hate crimes than Trump rallies. Right there reasons just exposed what happens when junk science marries the media, it creates really stupid offspring. The study compared counties with rallies to others without them. Now, political rallies are usually held near large populations where raw crime numbers are higher, so no surprise. Big cities where rallies took place also had a few incidents of hate crimes, unlike smaller towns without rallies who reported no such crimes. So quite easily, reason show that you could do the same with Hillary rallies that the study authors did with Trump's. How could the media fall for this? Well, they wanted to fall for it. It's how you got Kavanaugh, Covington, Smollett, they sell the junk to people who need to believe the same thing they believe.

And then everybody reads it, and then it gets on cable TV, and then politicians start talking about it. Very, very slick. Also, extrapolate this out for a second. How many junk science studies have they done on global warming, on guns, on Russia, think about all the other fake things that have gotten mainstream that a simple fact-check proves them wrong.

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, they didn't have enough evidence back then, Dana. That's the whole thing. This new case gives them new ammunition. Prosecutors call Ed Buck a violent sexual predator who preys on men struggling with addiction and homelessness. In the latest case you mentioned, Buck is accused of injecting a 37-year- old man with methamphetamine back on September 11th. Now that man survived which is why they filed the charges. But if you remember back in the past few years, two other men have been found dead inside his Hollywood apartment including 26-year-old Jamal Moore and 55-year-old Timothy Dean. Both had overdosed on methamphetamine within 18 months. At the time, there was not enough evidence to charge Buck even though Jamal Moore wrote in his journal, \"I've become addicted to drugs. And the worst one at that, Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth. It was painful, but after all the troubles I've become addicted.\" Moore's family went on to say, look, if Buck was a black man he'd have been taken to jail right away. Prosecutors say Buck would lure these men into his home with a \"bath of drugs, sex and shelter.\" And there was the case of Jermaine Gagnon. He told the Daily Mail at one point that Buck once flew him from Minnesota to LA and injected him with methamphetamine \"he said, I was so scared I felt death walked into my soul. I called my mom. I said I feel like he's going to kill me.\" So, police are now investigating the death of Timothy Dean, reinvestigating the death of Jamal Moore and now they have this brand new case and if you don't know, Ed Buck donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic causes and candidates. And now some candidates at least over the past 18 months decided they were going to give the money back. Prosecutors clearly believe they have enough evidence to put Ed Buck in prison for quite some time. Dana."

As Trace just said, the LA DA basically says look, there wasn't enough evidence, but a couple of extra details about this particular overdose. So that guy was there on the 4th of September and he was injected by a buck on that night. He thought he was having - that he was overdosing. So, he left, went to the hospital, got help whatever and came back on the 11th. And Buck injected him twice more and then the alleged by the police and then basically Buck thwarted this guy's attempts to get help. This is so nefarious. And then cops come, they find hundreds of photographs which we knew about right. We know about the diary of the former one that passed away in 2018.

You know when you keep having dead bodies show up at your house and overdosing at your house and nothing happens. Maybe he thought he could get away with it and this kind of stuff continued. Obviously, he had a fetish for injecting young black men with massive amounts of methamphetamine and then doing all sorts of sex acts on them while they were inebriated.

You had Harvey Weinstein, who is a predator. You had Jeffrey Epstein, who is a predator. They all realized that if you give the money to the right people, you'll get off after getting off. You know and I think how many did - he had to kill three people in order to finally get people to notice.

He has a show called Nuff Said and he likes to talk to people about all those sorts of things like your childhood et cetera. He asked me why a positive mindset is so important. I talked about that and then he asked me this question. What is your favorite emotion? And this is what I came up with."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I think my favorite emotion is pride and other people, being happy for somebody else is probably when I feel the happiest. Especially, the TV business and politics is like this too that if you can't be happy for somebody else's success, you will feel constantly diminished."

Go to Fox Nation, one smart person Greg Gutfeld did a great interview with Terry Schappert, hilarious. He teaches me how to create improvised weapons out of stuff in your house. And then the podcast, my podcast and Fox News Radio. Vince Van Patten, amazing poker player, tennis player, but a legendary actor of the Van Patten family, we talk about every.

How about this from Jaclyn, repot it, change the soil, make sure you're using bonsai soil. I never knew that existed the roots--"
