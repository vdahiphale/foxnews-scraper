It was inspiring. It was one that called to the noblest ideals in the human heart of saying that we want people to be free, and America certainly is committed to an America-first policy. But there's a Trump doctrine here now. And that is, yes, America first, but we're not isolationists. For those who seek the cause of human freedom and dignity, the star and stripes are on your side. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I feel like that is something that is one of the most important things that any president can do, is to articulate those noble ideals that resonate in every human heart, because that's why we have America.
