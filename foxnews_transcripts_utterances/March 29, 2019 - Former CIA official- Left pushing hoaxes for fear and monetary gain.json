      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It's probably hard to imagine being more cynical about the news media than you already are. You watched the coverage, you know how totally dishonest it is, you read their tweets, you know how a vindictive and unimpressive they are. If one of your kids went to work at CNN, would you even tell your neighbors? You might be more tempted to say he was in prison. It's less embarrassing, so it is going to be hard to shock with more stories about corruption in the news business, but prepare yourself, we have got a new one. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Today, an independent journalist called Yashar Ali wrote an account of an experience he just had with Dafna Linzer. Linzer is a former \"Washington Post\" reporter. She now oversees all political coverage for both NBC News and MSNBC. Ali did not expect to be talking to her, he just got on the phone with the Democratic National Committee. He had a scoop about the dates of the first primary debates, it's not a big deal, but he wanted to make sure that his facts were right. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The DNC confirmed his story, but then asked Ali to delay publishing it. They wanted time to notify their state parties about it first. Ali refused. He doesn't work for the DNC, he just wanted to break his story. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That was it. And then he got an unexpected call from Dafna Linzer, again who works at NBC News. Here is Ali's account of what happened next, quote, \"She asked if I could hold the story and I said, I couldn't. She was agitated, \"Why not?\" I said, I am not going to lose a scoop, and then she got angrier and said, \"Why not? It's not a big deal, let them make a few phone calls.\" My jaw dropped. I realize that Dafna Linzer, the head of all political coverage for NBC News and MSNBC was not calling to advocate for her network, she was calling to advocate the DNC's position. She wanted me to wait to so they could call state party leaders. The head of the political division was trying to bully me at the behest of the DNC over a dumb scoop.\" Unquote. Pretty shocking. Now before you dismiss it as hearsay, keep in mind that Yasher Ali is not a conservative, hardly. He once worked for Gavin Newsom, he was a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. He is not a right winger. He is the opposite. He has no reason to lie about this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The head political executive at NBC News was doing errands for the DNC. She's a hack. This kind of behavior is par at NBC News. During the last campaign, the Chairman of NBC, Andy Lack leaked the \"Access Hollywood\" tape to \"The Washington Post.\" Why? Because he wanted to make sure Hillary Clinton won the presidency. Then he lied about it and crushed the career of Billy Bush because he was on the way. A year later, NBC tried to protect Hillary Clinton's close friend, Harvey Weinstein. They tried to kill a story about his sexual assaults and then they lied about that, too. They got caught. Last fall, when the creepy porn lawyer was making wild gang rape allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, during his confirmation hearing, NBC News knowingly sat on evidence that would have cleared Kavanaugh's name, but they didn't release it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If Chuck Schumer demanded the United States invade Belgium tomorrow, NBC News would dutifully produce a report about WMDs stockpiles in Brussels. The Walloons are the real threat. Whatever it takes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Hours after Robert Mueller deflated the Russia hoax, Nancy Pelosi commanded the press corps to start covering healthcare. She said that out loud in a press conference, so CNN immediately scrapped its entire lineup. The next day, every show on CNN from six in the morning until midnight, every single one without any exception repeated Democratic talking points about Obamacare. These are not journalists, these are faithful servants of the Democratic Party. It might be easier if they just admitted it, we all know it. Chris Plante hosts a radio program, \"The Chris Plante Show,\" one of the best things ever on radio and he joins us tonight. We are happy he is here. How exactly would this happen -- the mechanics is a little bit confusing to me. How would the Director of Political Coverage at NBC News know that Yasher Ali was working on this story? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Well, she got a call from the DNC and someone at the DNC when Yasher Ali called and then said, \"I've got this scoop and I'm going to run for your fun for a couple of minutes.\" They said, well, who do you call to kill the story? And I'm sure they have a long list of people, a phone book of people in the news media, but they choose to call for this purpose, Dafna Linzer, who as you said is the Director of all political coverage for NBC and MSNBC. And what did she do? Did she say, \"Well, I can't do that -- that would be unethical.\" She dutifully called at the request of the DNC a freelance reporter. This is a woman who has great power in the news media. If you are a freelance reporter, NBC and MSNBC are possible sources of revenue for you and for your wife and your children and for their college fund, and Yasher Ali very much to his credit took umbrage with her acquiescence to the DNC's call and he sounded the alarm. Now he is going to be hurt for this professionally because Dafna Linzer does not appreciate, and NBC News does not appreciate that Yasher Ali went public with this because theoretically, at least, it is embarrassing to them, but the DNC knew. Who do we call? We want to spike this story. How do we put this on ice? Let's call Dafna, she can dangle a little bit of a thread over his head, he is a freelance guy. He can't alienate network people. She is a bigwig. She call and put him on the ice.

Mueller didn't exonerate Trump. Trump exonerated Trump. He never did anything wrong. The real question right now that I ask, and I want everybody to ponder.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It's probably hard to imagine being more cynical about the news media than you already are. You watched the coverage, you know how totally dishonest it is, you read their tweets, you know how a vindictive and unimpressive they are. If one of your kids went to work at CNN, would you even tell your neighbors? You might be more tempted to say he was in prison. It's less embarrassing, so it is going to be hard to shock with more stories about corruption in the news business, but prepare yourself, we have got a new one. Today, an independent journalist called Yashar Ali wrote an account of an experience he just had with Dafna Linzer. Linzer is a former \"Washington Post\" reporter. She now oversees all political coverage for both NBC News and MSNBC. Ali did not expect to be talking to her, he just got on the phone with the Democratic National Committee. He had a scoop about the dates of the first primary debates, it's not a big deal, but he wanted to make sure that his facts were right. The DNC confirmed his story, but then asked Ali to delay publishing it. They wanted time to notify their state parties about it first. Ali refused. He doesn't work for the DNC, he just wanted to break his story. That was it. And then he got an unexpected call from Dafna Linzer, again who works at NBC News. Here is Ali's account of what happened next, quote, \"She asked if I could hold the story and I said, I couldn't. She was agitated, \"Why not?\" I said, I am not going to lose a scoop, and then she got angrier and said, \"Why not? It's not a big deal, let them make a few phone calls.\" My jaw dropped. I realize that Dafna Linzer, the head of all political coverage for NBC News and MSNBC was not calling to advocate for her network, she was calling to advocate the DNC's position. She wanted me to wait to so they could call state party leaders. The head of the political division was trying to bully me at the behest of the DNC over a dumb scoop.\" Unquote. Pretty shocking. Now before you dismiss it as hearsay, keep in mind that Yasher Ali is not a conservative, hardly. He once worked for Gavin Newsom, he was a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. He is not a right winger. He is the opposite. He has no reason to lie about this. The head political executive at NBC News was doing errands for the DNC. She's a hack. This kind of behavior is par at NBC News. During the last campaign, the Chairman of NBC, Andy Lack leaked the \"Access Hollywood\" tape to \"The Washington Post.\" Why? Because he wanted to make sure Hillary Clinton won the presidency. Then he lied about it and crushed the career of Billy Bush because he was on the way. A year later, NBC tried to protect Hillary Clinton's close friend, Harvey Weinstein. They tried to kill a story about his sexual assaults and then they lied about that, too. They got caught. Last fall, when the creepy porn lawyer was making wild gang rape allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, during his confirmation hearing, NBC News knowingly sat on evidence that would have cleared Kavanaugh's name, but they didn't release it. If Chuck Schumer demanded the United States invade Belgium tomorrow, NBC News would dutifully produce a report about WMDs stockpiles in Brussels. The Walloons are the real threat. Whatever it takes. Hours after Robert Mueller deflated the Russia hoax, Nancy Pelosi commanded the press corps to start covering healthcare. She said that out loud in a press conference, so CNN immediately scrapped its entire lineup. The next day, every show on CNN from six in the morning until midnight, every single one without any exception repeated Democratic talking points about Obamacare. These are not journalists, these are faithful servants of the Democratic Party. It might be easier if they just admitted it, we all know it. Chris Plante hosts a radio program, \"The Chris Plante Show,\" one of the best things ever on radio and he joins us tonight. We are happy he is here. How exactly would this happen -- the mechanics is a little bit confusing to me. How would the Director of Political Coverage at NBC News know that Yasher Ali was working on this story?"

      "utterance": "Well, she got a call from the DNC and someone at the DNC when Yasher Ali called and then said, \"I've got this scoop and I'm going to run for your fun for a couple of minutes.\" They said, well, who do you call to kill the story? And I'm sure they have a long list of people, a phone book of people in the news media, but they choose to call for this purpose, Dafna Linzer, who as you said is the Director of all political coverage for NBC and MSNBC. And what did she do? Did she say, \"Well, I can't do that -- that would be unethical.\" She dutifully called at the request of the DNC a freelance reporter. This is a woman who has great power in the news media. If you are a freelance reporter, NBC and MSNBC are possible sources of revenue for you and for your wife and your children and for their college fund, and Yasher Ali very much to his credit took umbrage with her acquiescence to the DNC's call and he sounded the alarm. Now he is going to be hurt for this professionally because Dafna Linzer does not appreciate, and NBC News does not appreciate that Yasher Ali went public with this because theoretically, at least, it is embarrassing to them, but the DNC knew. Who do we call? We want to spike this story. How do we put this on ice? Let's call Dafna, she can dangle a little bit of a thread over his head, he is a freelance guy. He can't alienate network people. She is a bigwig. She call and put him on the ice. She called -- can you imagine doing such a thing."

In fact, it's hard to imagine that Barr even voted for Donald Trump -- not his kind of guy and yet now, for some reason, Bill Barr has developed such a deep loyalty to Donald Trump that he is willing to destroy his own reputation, subvert American government and commit crimes. Why? In order to help Donald Trump, his new love, hide his criminal Russian collusion. That's what they're telling you. It's ridiculous. It's insane, but they tell you a lot of things like that with remarkable frequency that people were supposed to be the most impressive in our society, fall for hoaxes that no normal person would ever believe. Jussie Smollett's transparently bogus hate crime, a dozen more just like it in the past two years. The fake Duke rape case, the even faker UVA fraternity rapes. The Covington high school kids. They hated American- Indians. Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The fraudulent FDA food pyramid that helped make America fatter and less healthy -- eat more breakfast cereal, that'll slim you down. They bought all of this and much more without even pausing. When creepy porn lawyer told them that Brett Kavanaugh was a sex criminal, they believed him. Then they told us that creepy porn lawyer would make a good President. These are the people who bragged about how much they revere science, \"We're the party of science,\" and at the same time insist that you can change your biological sex by wishing it so. Forty years ago, these same people warned us a new Ice Age was coming. Now, they shriek about global warming. They will literally believe anything. On the left, the enlightenment is over. Superstition reigns in its place. This is what happens when conventional religion, the ones we all mock, die. People who say, \"Well, I'm secular, just find something even more implausible to believe in and impose on the rest of us,\" but with way less self-awareness and therefore, far more dangerously.

But if you step back, I think there are a couple things happening why Democrats are falling for these kinds of hoaxes, the Brennan's and the Clapper's, that's stuff -- that's coup d'etat stuff. If you look at liberal journalists like why do progressive journalists do this? It's about money, right? More of stories about bad orange men mean bigger, you know, clicks and views and that means bigger your money and book deals and so forth, right. And then Democratic politicians, why are they doing it? Well, more of that stuff means more fear; that means panic, hysteria. That brings in donations and that brings in votes. So that's the short answer to your question, but actually, Tucker, I think there's something bigger happening here that actually is more frightening to me and that is as a Party, we are telling you through these hoaxes that you were a victim, right, whether it be the Smollett case, the Covington kids, right? If you are a victim, then you belong to us and even if you haven't been a victim, you will be at some point, so that I think is the underlying issue since we have embraced identity politics, we have to get people to the polls based on fear, on panic and that's the stuff that look, Trump would be gone in two or six years, right?"

In the meantime, we look forward to seeing how CNN covers this, if at all, they are always telling us about the rise of hate crimes. How can they ignore this one? We'll find out. Well, it has been an almost unbelievable week in the news. Certainly, one of the most remarkable we've had since the show started two and a half years ago. So what better way to end it than a week summary by former Secret Service agent at Dan Bongino -- who has thought long and hard about the week's craziest stories, and he joins us tonight.

Avenatti, Avianti, whatever you want to call him. I believe Trump calls him Avianti. This was never a serious person, okay. Can we all agree on that that Avianti, the creepy porn lawyer was never a serious person. Yet, this guy was discussed despite the recent news about him getting into some new trouble here. This guy was discussed as a presidential candidate on other networks, Tucker. That actually happened in the real world."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, and by the way, he was promoted by CNN and MSNBC as a legitimate candidate. They fawned over him. He is their kind of guy. Not surprising. I agree. That is a terrific number three. What's number two?"

Listen, I don't know Jussie, Tucker. And everybody has got the right to be presumed innocent. Unlike the left, the police state left, I actually believe in the Constitution. But you know, the kids they have this thing on Twitter, where they say, \"Just take the L.\" Like take the loss when something breaks bad for you and move on. Just take the loss, guy. Jussie, I don't know, I've got no dog in this fight, but the evidence that your initial story about the bleach carrying, MAGA hat wearing dudes, it's just not looking good right now and Tucker, that maybe be understatement of the millennium. The story doesn't look good. Stop threatening lawsuits against the city. Just move on and take the L, buddy."

I'm having surgery in my bathroom when this thing breaks on the weekend, this summary. This is just a monstrosity because it's just a story about so many different things. Media bias and the radical left, this lurch by the left towards a police state, but here is the take away in this, Tucker. Remember this, and don't ever forget this to everybody listening. Mueller didn't exonerate Trump. Trump exonerated Trump. He never did anything wrong. The real question right now that I ask, and I want everybody to ponder. I'm pretty sure I have the answer is when exactly did Mueller find out there was no collusion, Tucker? Of course he was going to exonerate. I mean, he didn't do anything wrong. And my best guess here, based on some research I've been doing for my follow up book is that as early as June of 2017, right after he is appointed and the latest is July of 2017, which begs -- 2017 -- which begs one final question and I will move on here, what the hell was Bob Mueller doing for 600-plus days if he knew Donald Trump was innocent?"
