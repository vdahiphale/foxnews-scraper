Temperature-wise, you get the idea, cold air up across the North, but not that cold just yet. And then really warm here across the South. And this warm air is moving up toward the Northeast. So today we have got a snowstorm that is going on. But the warmer air is going to move in. And when it does, we're going to see some icing, a bit of an ice storm tomorrow, and then rain behind it, and then a new storm Sunday into Monday. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So a lot to watch. Right now, we have some snow behind the tail end of this storm down across parts of Texas, West Texas.

Watch what happens here. All of this moisture, this is tomorrow primarily, a major rainmaker across all of the eastern third of the country. Behind it, cold air moves in. But we will move in a little bit closer here toward the Northeast. I want to point this out. So, right now, we have snow, and higher elevations are going to see maybe six to 12 inches of snow. Then, through the night tonight and into tomorrow, start to get a warmer air mass above following towards the frozen air mass below. That means we're going to be watching an ice storm here. So, imagine, say, six inches of snow and then a layer of ice across the top of that, and then we have a brief period of rain behind it, before the cold air comes back in. So, by the time we get towards Monday, we're going to have just kind of a very solid, very dangerous sheet of messy ice, slush stuff here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then we have another storm that comes in Sunday and Monday, a coastal storm that is going to cause some more problems and bring eventually a very kind of white Christmas.

But Nordstrom -- I think this is worth noting -- actually had its best November same-store sales in something like seven years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Some analysts just telling me, you know what? Sometimes, with clothes, people still want to go in. They want to feel the fabric. They want to try something on before they get it home. And then online retailers knocking it out of the park, I think up something like 25 percent even vs. this time last year so far. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And of course we haven't even hit Christmas yet. But it seems to be all of these incentives are really getting people to spend money. Kohl's doing well online. So is Macy's. So is Wal-Mart. And then, of course, Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla in the room just getting bigger, Neil.",

They have also been encouraging individuals to act as lone wolves. That appears very specifically in the most recent ISIS propaganda, too. They have lost their caliphate, and so who are ideologically aligned with the Islamic State are now in a position where the best that they can manage, so to speak, would be an attack during the holidays.

That's a record. They say it's because of the economy. Take a look at the FlightAware app. Shows you how many flights are up in the air. One of our producers actually already had to deal with the backup flying from here in Los Angeles last night. They had a major problem. The plane had issues. They got -- she got to Atlanta late.

And you will be seeing it soon enough in February in your paychecks, sooner than that when it comes to what Wall Street is cooking up to splurge on both its shareholders and its workers. More of that in a second, but all of this at time when a lot of people are taking to the skies and they will be busy, in fact, record busy, not only trying to get off to grandma's, but trying to beat what could be a bad snowstorm. We're all over it with Hillary Vaughn in Los Angeles, where that travel rush is on. We have got our meteorologist Rick Reichmuth on a winter blast that could be following suit, and Jeff Flock going shopping with the sending rush on at any store anywhere across the U.S. of A.

Now, security lines are going to be longer because the TSA says they have more measures in place. Anything bigger than a cell phone needs to be taken out of your bag and put in separate bins, which means the lines are longer. Also, if you're bring a wrapped present, you have to be prepared for the TSA to look inside if they see anything suspicious. Baked goods are allowed. But any liquids, including gravy or any spreads, have to be smaller than a snow globe. But these are the therapy dogs that are working very hard. They are here to keep everyone calm. They also have business cards to keep everyone calm, the passengers happy. And they're of course in the Christmas spirit and very, very cute, Neil."

      "utterance": "We have a really big, kind of about a four- to five-day storm that we're watching across parts of the Northeast or at least a series of storms. A very active pattern. Temperature-wise, you get the idea, cold air up across the North, but not that cold just yet. And then really warm here across the South. And this warm air is moving up toward the Northeast. So today we have got a snowstorm that is going on. But the warmer air is going to move in. And when it does, we're going to see some icing, a bit of an ice storm tomorrow, and then rain behind it, and then a new storm Sunday into Monday. So a lot to watch. Right now, we have some snow behind the tail end of this storm down across parts of Texas, West Texas. East Texas, you have got the rain, very heavy rain moving right in around the Central Mississippi River Valley. And you get the idea here with the rain and the snow to the north. This is the future radar. Watch what happens here. All of this moisture, this is tomorrow primarily, a major rainmaker across all of the eastern third of the country. Behind it, cold air moves in. But we will move in a little bit closer here toward the Northeast. I want to point this out. So, right now, we have snow, and higher elevations are going to see maybe six to 12 inches of snow. Then, through the night tonight and into tomorrow, start to get a warmer air mass above following towards the frozen air mass below. That means we're going to be watching an ice storm here. So, imagine, say, six inches of snow and then a layer of ice across the top of that, and then we have a brief period of rain behind it, before the cold air comes back in. So, by the time we get towards Monday, we're going to have just kind of a very solid, very dangerous sheet of messy ice, slush stuff here. Then we have another storm that comes in Sunday and Monday, a coastal storm that is going to cause some more problems and bring eventually a very kind of white Christmas. This is a look at the precipitation forecast. So, most of this current storm is far to the northern, northern parts of New England. And then the next one, Monday, Sunday into Monday, is for everybody. This is a look at your delays on Saturday, because of all that weather that we're talking about. There's going to be lots of delays in the airports tomorrow, Neil, across the Eastern part of the country. Today, so far, we're looking really pretty good."

Something is going on here, because it's one of the busier Christmas shopping seasons we have seen I think in 12 years are the latest statistics. And now more companies are adding a little fuel to this financial fire here, promising all sorts of help with the money that they're getting back from Uncle Sam, too. In fact, they're awash in so much of that dough that from PNC Financial, Sinclair Broadcasting, Wells Fargo, they're splitting it up. Not only rewarding shareholders, but paying a lot of their workers bonuses. In the case of AT&T and some of the other big names like Sinclair Broadcasting, $1,000 for every one of their workers. Market watcher Gary Kaltbaum on what that means, FBN's Deirdre Bolton. That's a lot of extra gravy, isn't it, Deirdre?"

So, this anticipation of the tax reform, the fact that unemployment is at a 17-year low, and then let's not forget the stock market. Looking at an S&P 500 with a year-to-date return of 20 percent. All of this adding up to consumer confidence. So some brick and mortar stores are actually doing pretty well, which is surprising, because we talk a lot about online. But Nordstrom -- I think this is worth noting -- actually had its best November same-store sales in something like seven years. Some analysts just telling me, you know what? Sometimes, with clothes, people still want to go in. They want to feel the fabric. They want to try something on before they get it home. And then online retailers knocking it out of the park, I think up something like 25 percent even vs. this time last year so far. And of course we haven't even hit Christmas yet. But it seems to be all of these incentives are really getting people to spend money. Kohl's doing well online. So is Macy's. So is Wal-Mart. And then, of course, Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla in the room just getting bigger, Neil."

Most were of the opinion that they would just buy back stock, maybe increase their dividends. But they have got sort of a curse of riches here, given the money that they're going to get back from holding abroad. They can afford to do both, in other words, satisfy shareholders who want some more and satisfy workers who are getting more. What do you think of that?"

And if they feel wealthy, they are apt to spend more. If they spend more, businesses do better. If businesses do better, they hire more. Those people that get hired spend more and then around and round we go. That's what makes great economies. And all I can tell you is, speak to people now. They feel so much better about things, in spite of all the nasty rhetoric from both sides of the aisle. People feel better. They see what is happening. And guess what? Dollars are dollars.

And then after Christmas, you do one for the new year. What is the best New Year's resolution? To be able to keep more money. I don't think the Republicans understand just how you have to be repetitive and how you have to be convincing and to assume that, with only 30 percent of Americans now supporting this legislation, that it's going to take a lot of communication, a lot of education, because people, Neil, just don't know what is in the bill."

But the idea that American businesses and American workers are going to get more out of this is something that every American wants. And I got one more dial for you. And I haven't done this all year. This is the best congressional exchange of 2017. I don't think your viewers have seen it. We dialed it. And it's with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.

We have projects ready to go out where I am in Loudoun County and other localities across the country. And we would be willing to pay a share, if the federal government comes in and help. And there are localities across the country who want to rebuild our crumbling airports, our crumbling roads, and the infrastructure problems that you're seeing with these airports on fire. And the thing is, it's really something where it doesn't matter if you're in rural America, you're in the suburbs, or you're downtown. You're seeing infrastructure failing. Here in D.C., obviously, we're stuck in gridlock and traffic all the time. We want the relief. If you're in rural America, to get your product or what you're trying to work on to the market, you need better roads and better connections. You have to remember, transportation is about economic development and about economic empowerment. It's about getting products to places quicker, getting people to places quicker, which means more economic productivity. It's a perfect next step after tax reform to get people back to work and to help our economy grow."

But in October, an ISIS-inspired attacker drove a rented truck up onto a crowded bike path in Lower Manhattan claiming eight lives. It is these kinds of attacks that stand as examples of the consistent threat faced here in New York and across the world. And there's efforts being taken to stop would-be jihadis before they can act. There was a man arrested, charges filed by the FBI today, filed charges today about a Modesto, California, man who they say was planning to attack San Francisco's famous Pier 39 on Christmas Day. According to court documents, Everitt Aaron Jameson offered to give people who shared his radical jihadi beliefs rides in his company tow truck. The threat of vehicle attacks, Neil, as you know, is one of the greatest concerns that law enforcement officers have all across the country. Here, in an effort to protect Times Square, there will be barricades, and, of course, big vehicles used to block any possible vehicle attacks. That's the security that we see at big events all cross the country now -- Neil."

And the work that we just heard about by the FBI to prevent an attack on Christmas Day out in San Francisco is exactly the kind of effort that we need to see from law enforcement and the intelligence community in this country. Look, the Islamic State has been putting out a lot of propaganda posters recently specifically citing this time period and Christmas and New Year's Eve as times to attack. They have also been encouraging individuals to act as lone wolves. That appears very specifically in the most recent ISIS propaganda, too. They have lost their caliphate, and so who are ideologically aligned with the Islamic State are now in a position where the best that they can manage, so to speak, would be an attack during the holidays. So we're at a heightened threat right now, Neil, but we also have the best intel and best law enforcement agencies in the world. So I think we're all going to be just fine this holiday season.

People often talk about in the security business times and routes. You have to make sure that you vary them. You have to make sure that you're not overly predictable, because it's essential for the bad guys to know where you will be and who will be there. But when you're talking about Times Square, or when you're talking about some of these very other large gatherings that will occur in the next week or so, it makes it difficult. That said, the NYPD is the largest police department in the country. They know that it's a threat. They see the postings from the Islamic State and there's also a balance to be struck between making sure everyone is aware of the Islamic State propaganda that is out there and then allowing that propaganda to take on a life of its own and create overreactions and anxiety beyond what is necessary in the general public, because that is, in and of itself, a goal of the jihadis.

And then it's supposed to get real bad tonight and into tomorrow. I will tell you this -- 107 million Americans are going to hit the roads, the rails and the air for this trip through the New Year's. That's a record. They say it's because of the economy. Take a look at the FlightAware app. Shows you how many flights are up in the air. One of our producers actually already had to deal with the backup flying from here in Los Angeles last night. They had a major problem. The plane had issues. They got -- she got to Atlanta late. Missed her flight to Carolina. We know there's been problem and an hour-a-half-hour delay at one point in Dallas. So the backup has already begun, at least at some of the airports and on the roadways as well. Back here live. You can get a look -- you can see how it starts to back up all of a sudden? This is starting to happen. Eventually, it's going to be backed up full-time -- 107 million -- 97 million will be on the roadways, Neil. And the biggest issue of course is weather. They're saying 22 states will be affected by either flood alerts or snow going from basically the Rockies to Texas, from Texas up to Maine. Here in California, traffic is always crappy. So, really, it doesn't matter about the holiday or not. You're going to get stuck someplace here in Southern California. And it all starts for some people when they get off work here, Neil, in a couple hours -- back to you in New York."
