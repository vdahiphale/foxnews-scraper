A day of tributes in the nation's capital after the passing of the 41st president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, and in moments, my Angle takes a look at how the media are shamelessly using what should be this reverend occasion, well, to hit the current occupant of the White House, President Trump. And also tonight, a jarring admission from a U.N. panel. Could criticizing mass migrations actually become a criminal offense? A story you will need to see to believe. Plus, President Trump and Rudy Giuliani are opening new lines of attack on how Bob Mueller's team is conducting the witness interviews. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } With no collusion in sight, has the special counsel actually crossed the Rubicon here?

Sadly, though, with the death of George H.W. Bush some in the media and politicians from both parties are abusing this moment to trash, instead, the sitting president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As the Bush motorcade was making its way to the capitol for the last time MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace, a former Bush aide herself, could not restrain herself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Things like open borders, China trade, NAFTA, high taxes, endless wars, those weren't Trump policies.

For example, in 2010 the company said China exported $5 million of quartz into the U.S. Last year that number jumped to more than $450 million. And for the first nine months of this year the total bounced up again to $526 million. But the quartz wasn't just being imported. It was being illegally dumped in the U.S., meaning China was subsidizing it so it could be sold in this country well below cost. The goal of course is to undercut the competition and control the market. Cambria estimates that last year alone China displaced $1.2 billion of U.S. quartz. And adding insult to injury, China was also slapping a 40 percent tariff on quartz being imported to their country. Last April, Cambria petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission to intervene, writing, quote, \"Fair trade and free-trade are inseparable paradigms. You simply cannot have one without the other. We believe strongly in free trade -- to protect it, we must demand fair trade.\" And sure enough, subsequent investigations have found that China was indeed dumping underpriced quartz into the United States. So in September the Commerce Department increased tariffs on select Chinese quartz to five times the previous number, and bumped up the tariffs once again in November. Clearly the companies reselling the cut-rate Chinese quartz were hoping to keep the goods flowing. Now it appears they too will have to make a few adjustments. Laura?",

A day of tributes in the nation's capital after the passing of the 41st president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, and in moments, my Angle takes a look at how the media are shamelessly using what should be this reverend occasion, well, to hit the current occupant of the White House, President Trump. And also tonight, a jarring admission from a U.N. panel. Could criticizing mass migrations actually become a criminal offense? A story you will need to see to believe. Plus, President Trump and Rudy Giuliani are opening new lines of attack on how Bob Mueller's team is conducting the witness interviews. With no collusion in sight, has the special counsel actually crossed the Rubicon here? We're going to examine that. But first, honoring Bush by bashing Trump. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. When a former president passes away it's appropriate to celebrate his life, his achievements and to remind the public of his record and his legacy. Sadly, though, with the death of George H.W. Bush some in the media and politicians from both parties are abusing this moment to trash, instead, the sitting president. As the Bush motorcade was making its way to the capitol for the last time MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace, a former Bush aide herself, could not restrain herself."

Look, even if you don't care for President Trump, even if you just hate President Trump, try showing just a little bit of class and decorum, as Bush 41 would have.

They reduce a presidential death to just a political battering ram like any other issue. But what you hear -- if you listen closely, is the last gasp of an embittered establishment. Now, as we have seen across Europe and across much of the United States, populism is swamping the old guard, whether it's on the right or on the left. So rather than direct their anger at Trump, the establishment frankly in both parties should be directing it at themselves, for it is their policies that the voters turned against in 2016. Things like open borders, China trade, NAFTA, high taxes, endless wars, those weren't Trump policies. Those were the policies of the establishment and the establishments GOPers apparently think that the way, what, win them back the people that they lost to Trump is to belittle the president non-stop, even during formal and informal on-air eulogies and tributes? At a time like this when a father, a grandfather, a great grandfather and a former president has died, we should be bigger than the petty politics of the moment. I think we should be capable of uniting as Americans and celebrating the best of George H.W. Bush without resorting to the same old usual political snark and calumny. And isn't that what President Bush would have wanted? And that's The Angle. Joining me now, we have an amazing panel, former governor of Arkansas and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee, presidential historian, Reagan biographer Craig Shirley and former White House counsel to George H.W. Bush, Ambassador C. Boyden Gray. All of you, it is great to have you. I know our former President Bush would love the fact that we're all getting together to talk about this moment and his legacy and honor him for who he was, his patriotism, his love of country, his deep sense of public service. Craig, I want to start with you. What did Bush, I mean, you knew him -- I knew him not as well as Boyden. I want to hear from Boyden on this, but we grew up in the Reagan revolution.

I'm going to say it's really fun. She used to call him like -- just belittle the Bushes like what they watched, what they listened to for music. I was reading a column from May 1, 1990. She called them the gracious cruise director of international politics. She lampooned him for patting Barbara on the derriere during the Dukakis campaign. That's the nice stuff she said about him. As for his great relationship with the press as we alluded to earlier, look at this 1987 \"Newsweek\" cover. Bush considered it the cheapest shot of his political career. Check it out.

He would set out in the wilds of Texas to create a business. Of course he was tough enough and he got really angry with them. He says, \"You know, none of you ever had to watch your child die.

Well, I don't know what a fixer is. Nobody has on LinkedIn card I'm a fixer. I mean, I know dentist, I know doctors. I don't think I have ever met a fixer. So Michael Cohen taped his own client. What lawyer has taped his own client? A judge found probable cause to authorize searches of Michael Cohen's residence, his hotel, his office. They found a treasure trove of information which led to his plea in the southern district of New York to tax evasion, to false statements to a bank, which involved lying, then his lawyer goes on CNN and offers up his testimony to the special counsel. Well, is that a way to try and sell your cooperation? And then after that what's his plea? His plea, what is it of all things? It's to lying.

The most worrying part is the section on the media, where it says very clearly that media outlets who are intolerant, critical, xenophobic, or racist in their criticism of mass migration -- now, as soon as you start to define people like that, you're getting into territory where people can be defined as committing hate crimes.

There is a 1951 definition of what a refugee is, and it's a person in fear of their life or their liberty as a result of their race, their religion, their views, their orientation. That does not mean that millions of people that have crossed the Mediterranean over the last couple of years, encouraged by Angela Merkel, were refugees. They weren't. They were economic migrants coming from all over the world, using the opportunity of the huge stupidity made by Angela Merkel. I genuinely believe, good evening, Laura, that Christians living in Iraq and countries like that who have literally got nowhere to go, they qualify as genuine refugees. But you cannot open the door to mass millions and suddenly pretend that's OK. And this is exactly what the U.N. are trying to do next week. They're trying to bail out Angela Merkel and the other politicians who have made these huge mistakes. And I would have thought what Mrs. Merkel ought to do, rather than defending her judgment, is to apologize to millions of German people for fundamentally changing the nature of a culture of the towns and cities in which people live without ever asking the people."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Laura, as the U.S.'s largest producer of quartz countertops, backsplashes, and floor tiles, Minnesota's Cambria company makes it their business to keep an eye on foreign competition. For example, in 2010 the company said China exported $5 million of quartz into the U.S. Last year that number jumped to more than $450 million. And for the first nine months of this year the total bounced up again to $526 million. But the quartz wasn't just being imported. It was being illegally dumped in the U.S., meaning China was subsidizing it so it could be sold in this country well below cost. The goal of course is to undercut the competition and control the market. Cambria estimates that last year alone China displaced $1.2 billion of U.S. quartz. And adding insult to injury, China was also slapping a 40 percent tariff on quartz being imported to their country. Last April, Cambria petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission to intervene, writing, quote, \"Fair trade and free-trade are inseparable paradigms. You simply cannot have one without the other. We believe strongly in free trade -- to protect it, we must demand fair trade.\" And sure enough, subsequent investigations have found that China was indeed dumping underpriced quartz into the United States. So in September the Commerce Department increased tariffs on select Chinese quartz to five times the previous number, and bumped up the tariffs once again in November. Clearly the companies reselling the cut-rate Chinese quartz were hoping to keep the goods flowing. Now it appears they too will have to make a few adjustments. Laura?"

      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "utterance": "We saw an opportunity. We started the company, we founded the company, myself and Jim Ward, our finance manager, were the original employees. Today we have nearly 2,000. We went through a lot of struggles to build the business, as you would imagine. By 2010 or 11 after the meltdown of 2008, we got back on our feet, and the company was starting to flourish as was the industry. And we developed a lot of technology, invested heavily in innovations, did a lot of work around productivity, and really the business started to skyrocket. And about that time, 2013, 2014, the Chinese producers from China started to dump product into the United States."

      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "utterance": "We are free traders, and you have to have fair trade to have free trade and a level playing field. I think the president understands that and does his team. We like competition. Competition helped us develop our technologies a lot better. We have tremendous competition in the industry from other domestic producers, and it's been good for the industry and for the business. It's not competition. This argument by some of the politicians about free trade, they don't understand what free trade is. They should get out in the market and run a manufacturing facility and have your manufacturing worker have to compete with the Chinese government instead of a Chinese manufacturing worker. There is no competition there."

The graduate students and undergrads and hardworking, unskilled labor that come out of high school and go to work in a manufacturing facility. And they work hard. They're innovative. They're productive. They're focused and they're diligent in their work. They're amazing, and they'll compete with anybody in the world. But you cannot compete with a rogue party dictatorship like China who has targeted this amazing economy in America as their target to, I say heist our manufacturing platforms and move them to China."

That's what the president and his excellent team, Lighthizer, Wilbur Ross, and Peter Navarro and others that are over there, they are extraordinary leaders in this part of our economy, they understand that it's a trade- enforcement tool to ensure that trade law that is violated is dealt with. And these conditions -- they're violating existing U.S. trade law. We didn't go and ask for new law. We asked the United States government, trade and commerce, to -- we petitioned them to go after China and investigate whether they are violating U.S. trade law."

      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "utterance": "Laura, there's a couple of key points. If you look at what they displaced in our market prices, it's over $1 billion, which is one-sixtieth of the deficit. In addition to that, the Chinese product in some cases -- this is amazing to anybody that's manufactured in the marketplace -- their prices were below our raw-material costs."
