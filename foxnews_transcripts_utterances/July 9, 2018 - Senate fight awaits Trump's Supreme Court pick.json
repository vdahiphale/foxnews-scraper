Just today, the Fox News power rankings moved her seat from a toss-up to likely Republican, and that means that she's got a big decision to make, because that race is moving away from her, she has a way then to buck her party, the Democrats, and to vote with the president and try to keep her senate race competitive if she decides to do that.

And the initial list of 20 that the president put together with his team and with the advisors was outstanding. He then also listened to input and feedback from other people, added five additional names. And then, subsequent to that, he's narrowed it down to four quality candidates, four people that would admirably serve this country and welcome the opportunity, and have pledged to follow the law and have demonstrated that when you look at the review of their judicial record, of their opinions. Some have written more opinions than others that will always give the other side some meat to be able to pick with to try to take issue with whoever the president chooses. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But he made an outstanding choice with Neil Gorsuch, and I fully expect that he's going to make another very good choice and announcement tonight during the 9 PM hour, the Hannity Show, and we'll find that out.

So, regardless of what side you're on, Democrat or Republican, they agree with that, liberal or conservative. So, ultimately, and I agree with Dana, that they will in fact get this through. So, we have to trust in the judgment. He's made solid choices. And like Sean said, these are promises made, promises kept.

They call every nominee, whoever they are, a Republican presidential nominee, a SCOTUS nominee, a right-wing extremist. They called John McCain a right-wing extremist, and he votes with the Democrats half the time. They called Mitt Romney a right-wing extremist, because he has, like, a binder full of women he wanted to hire. So I think people tune that out now, and the bottom line is when you say that, you know, \"Well, oh, President Obama didn't get his pick.\" That's because he was a lame duck with no Senate control in a presidential election year.

But the Democrats have been very reluctant to engage on judicial confirmations over the past few decades. That is about to change. They're going to spend about $5 million initially on this effort. I think it will fail, but I think you will see the Democrats start to reengage and invest on this issue in the future, because they have been able to rile up their base in order to vote on judicial confirmations, but this will change their mind.

A source is telling Fox News that President Trump has made a final decision after a report that he was considering four candidates, judge's Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, Raymond Kethledge, and Thomas Hardiman. Senator Lindsey Graham saying the president can't go wrong with either of these contenders."

By the way, thank you all for having me. I'm not as funny as Greg Gutfeld. I'm warning everybody at home. At 9:03 Eastern, the left is going to be in the process of trying to smear, besmirch, slander, destroy the character of whoever the president picks. We use the term \"Borking\" now almost as a verb. We think of what a great justice -- Clarence Thomas, if you haven't read his book which is called My Grandfather's Son, it is one of the great American hero success stories. Juan is shaking his head. It is one of the best books I've ever read. And he's become one of our great justices. Whoever the president picks and I think those are the names, the great thing is, is that he told us all ahead of time and it will be another promise made, promise kept. And the other thing, Newt Gingrich and I were just talking and he said to me, he goes, before the president makes his decision tonight, close your eyes and for 30 seconds just think, imagine if it was Hillary making that choice it would be nobody close to who the president will pick. The president believes this is about judicial philosophy, constitutionalism, regionalism versus judicial activism. And it really -- that's pretty much it."

And, you know, Dirk Durbin, I think, we've just have him there saying that it's more important to stand on principle to them than it is to worry about those red state Democrats. I don't know if that will actually hold true. For example, take somebody like Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. Just today, the Fox News power rankings moved her seat from a toss-up to likely Republican, and that means that she's got a big decision to make, because that race is moving away from her, she has a way then to buck her party, the Democrats, and to vote with the president and try to keep her senate race competitive if she decides to do that. So, I think you'll see that. I think McCaskill will be under pressure in Missouri. I think Donnelly will be under tremendous pressure in Indiana. I don't think that the pressure on Collins and Murkowski on the Republican side will be that persuasive. At the end of the day, when they voted for Gorsuch, they were there. They might have had concerns. I think at the end of the day, they will also be for whoever the president picks here. I could be wrong, of course, but my gut instinct is that there's going to be a lot of fire and fury, so to speak. But that when the vote is called that the Republicans will come home."

Vanilla, strawberry, chocolate -- you'll prefer one a little bit over the other, but they're all fantastic, solid choices. They've been incredibly well vetted by the Federalist Society, by the Heritage Foundation as well. And the initial list of 20 that the president put together with his team and with the advisors was outstanding. He then also listened to input and feedback from other people, added five additional names. And then, subsequent to that, he's narrowed it down to four quality candidates, four people that would admirably serve this country and welcome the opportunity, and have pledged to follow the law and have demonstrated that when you look at the review of their judicial record, of their opinions. Some have written more opinions than others that will always give the other side some meat to be able to pick with to try to take issue with whoever the president chooses. But he made an outstanding choice with Neil Gorsuch, and I fully expect that he's going to make another very good choice and announcement tonight during the 9 PM hour, the Hannity Show, and we'll find that out. And, in fact, 32 of the top deans, scholars, and attorneys, government officials have concurred that the president's choice will be confirmed and put through. So, regardless of what side you're on, Democrat or Republican, they agree with that, liberal or conservative. So, ultimately, and I agree with Dana, that they will in fact get this through. So, we have to trust in the judgment. He's made solid choices. And like Sean said, these are promises made, promises kept. He promised to put conservatives, constitutionalists that would follow the law on the bench, and I fully expect that that's who he will choose tonight."

I do think that the decision for the president to change -- for his lawyers to get him to go out there and say that he's reluctant to do an interview, or that they're advising him not to do an interview is the influence Emmet Flood who understands very well the whole role of the executive branch, and the congressional branch, and legislative branch and the separation they're in.

As a former prosecutor, I'm telling you that would color the investigation and compromise it. In addition, you have people who are involved in it like James Comey. I'm going to agree with you that he overstepped his bounds, he was inappropriate. He acted as the head of the FBI and as the charging prosecutor making a decision determinative as to what charges if any could be filed.

They call every nominee, whoever they are, a Republican presidential nominee, a SCOTUS nominee, a right-wing extremist. They called John McCain a right-wing extremist, and he votes with the Democrats half the time. They called Mitt Romney a right-wing extremist, because he has, like, a binder full of women he wanted to hire. So I think people tune that out now, and the bottom line is when you say that, you know, \"Well, oh, President Obama didn't get his pick.\" That's because he was a lame duck with no Senate control in a presidential election year.

But the Democrats have been very reluctant to engage on judicial confirmations over the past few decades. That is about to change. They're going to spend about $5 million initially on this effort. I think it will fail, but I think you will see the Democrats start to reengage and invest on this issue in the future, because they have been able to rile up their base in order to vote on judicial confirmations, but this will change their mind.
