And then they talk at the ballot box, and I think that's what counts. I think that's how the silent majority make their voices heard. I think a lot of the people, the young people, black lives matter, the open borders activists, those people are going to get out there because they don't have a lot to do. They don't have jobs. They don't a lot going on. And that's when you see the hatred and animosity, maybe the passion to be fair.

I mean, this is an interesting point, Dana, because if you think of impeachment as the ultimate goal for the far left here, then you are talking about high crimes and treason. Right? That's the definition. That is a political statement. That's not a legal definition.

Remember we are at the RNC and how well he did and he gave a great speech? And a lot of people talked about his political future. This is trying to do reputational and generational damage to the Trump family. And they are starting heavily and aggressively with Donald Junior in terms of the family. They've tried to take hits, you know, at Ivanka who by the way has been very passionate coming out on behalf of women's issues and fair pay for women and help for working women as it relates to health care, as relates to Syria, and the chemical weapons attacks. So, for me, when I see something like this, I just wonder what is the motivation is behind us, in terms of somebody going after him like this. I don't see any evidence of a crime. And Dershowitz is right. Perhaps this is really the perfect time to find some clarification, some clarity as it relates to what is appropriate and what isn't. Let me tell you, if my father is running for President of the United States, I would sit down and take a meeting and find out if there was information against an opponent. Let me tell you something. Compare this to what Hillary Clinton did to the women that accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct or assault of conduct against them. Et cetera. What did she do to smear them and investigate them?

It's not about -- we know as Americans it is not about collusion, it's about settling the score. And I would think, yes, we might do the same thing because we would be angry over an election but at a certain point, you've got to let it go. I mean, I can redefine collusion as the collusion between the media, academia, and the entertainment industry, who have been trying to brainwash us for decades over the dumbest ideologies. We've been victims of collusions all of our lives. The narrative here is that the Trump presidency is in disarray. That's what we know because that's what we elected. We are okay with disarray. We elected somebody because they don't have experience in politics. Therefore, he's surrounded by people who are not adept at controlling the narrative. Maybe that's their fault and maybe Donald should have known better but the bottom line is this, if you wanted this not to happen, you could have had a Kasich, you could have had a Rubio, but then you wouldn't have had the phenomenon, you wouldn't have had the revolution."

Now, that would be cooperating and urging on a foreign power. So, you guys say, well, there is no treason and Democrats looks silly and I agree. But that's not to say that there is not real problems here. I mean, even, you know, for me, as a Democrat, I looked to see what are Republicans saying? When are Republicans going to become critical?

Today, Ivanka Trump -- and actually, this is my one more thing, she was able to announce that the president is going to put in more money towards humanitarian aid for the famine that's being exacerbated in Africa.

You want people who are on the fence or on the wall to come to the wall. You don't want to say, hey, guess what, we'll take money from this and this and other causes that you like. I say you make it the world's longest strip mall because then you could employ people, it could be nail salons, Chinese take-out, dry cleaners, the always the karate studio.

On the food stamp point, if the administration can actually prove that they can't get those roles down, and I think that they probably should be able to -- they should do that in a demonstrable fashion rather than just throwing thing out and saying people that haven't worked in three decades we'll take all their food stamps money away."

Something like this is happening, but it is part of this sickening culture where people are not respecting the men and women that faithfully serve in blue. They try to beat them down. They turn and flip the card like that they're the enemies. So now, the police and the ones that serve every morning and get up and try and go and do this job are the ones that are hunted and disrespected. And it is really appalling to me that this is going on in this country. And it's been going on for a while, and we know where it started and what administration, and Bill de Blasio should be thrown out."

I think one of the reasons that you don't see a lot people flooding the streets after something like this because real, average Americans are trying to take care of their families, they're going to work. They have commitments. But there's a silent majority out there. And the silent majority they talk to their friends, they talk to their neighbors, they talk to their families about something like this. And then they talk at the ballot box, and I think that's what counts. I think that's how the silent majority make their voices heard. I think a lot of the people, the young people, black lives matter, the open borders activists, those people are going to get out there because they don't have a lot to do. They don't have jobs. They don't a lot going on. And that's when you see the hatred and animosity, maybe the passion to be fair. And you're not going to see a lot of real, you know, hard-working Americans coming out, unfortunately, like this because life moves fast."

And also, President Trump led the effort to allow a group of Afghan girls into the country after they had been previously denied entry, the group of 16 that would partake in an international robotics competition next week. There's some public backlash because the state department had initially denied them.
