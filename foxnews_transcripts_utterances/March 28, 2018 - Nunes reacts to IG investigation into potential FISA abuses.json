And finally, now, we are one step closer to getting the justice we've been calling for, and you, the American people, deserve. Now, by the way, this announcement could not come at a better time because tonight, newly uncovered text messages between Trump-hating FBI lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, they are revealing even more evidence -- this is only a smidgen of what is coming in terms of the potential abuse of power within some of the highest levels of our government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reportedly livid tonight at the FBI's lack of cooperation following requests for documents related to a number of important cases. And the mainstream media was in a frenzy today over a story that President Trump considered pardoning Lieutenant General Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. One itsy-bitsy problem, the story was fake news the whole time. Also, James Comey just added one more stop to his upcoming book tour. He's doing a town hall with Jerry Springer wannabe, creepy Anderson Cooper. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And also, I speak with the FBI informant in the Uranium One case.

      "sentences": "It's official. I told you at the beginning of the year, 2018 will be and is now becoming the year of the boomerang. And our top story tonight, after months of ringing the alarm about the abuse of power within the FISA court system, well, the DOJ inspector general has finally now announced plans to investigate alleged foreign intelligence surveillance abuses. We've been calling for this. This, of course, by the DOJ and the FBI. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have been exposing how the unverified Clinton bought and paid for dossier filled with Russian and Russian government plies in propaganda and misinformation was used as evidence to extend a FISA warrant on Carter Page. We also showed you how circular reporting from Michael Isikoff and Yahoo News citing the phony dossier was intentionally used by the FBI as an attempt to strengthen their FISA abuse case against Page. We have unearthed shocking conflicts of interest and extreme anti-Trump bias, sadly at the highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ. But we are finally one step closer to getting to the bottom line truth in what is the biggest abuse of power scandal and this history of the country. And, of course, we deserve to know the truth and we are revealing the real and ever present danger to have the powerful tools of intelligence in the deep state used against the American people. I know this is slow. I know this is frustrating. But we are now finally making serious progress. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And according to the DOJ inspector general statement, it says in part, quote: 'As part of the examination, the OIG also will review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source' if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is interesting. Additionally, 'the OIG will review the DOJ and FBI's relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISA court applications.' In order for this investigation now to be successful, it must answer the following questions. These are only a few of many. What did the FBI really know about the Steele dossier and when did they know it? This is critical. What was the FBI's relationship with a foreign national by the name of Christopher Steele who used Russian sources? Was the FISA warrant against Carter Page politically motivated? And did political bias influence the FBI or DOJ during the Russia investigation? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } My message tonight to the FBI and DOJ is turn over to 1.2 million documents that Congress has now subpoenaed and it is time to appoint a special counsel because you cannot ever investigate yourself. This brings us to our next breaking story. Congressional investigators from the Freedom Caucus, the only guys doing any work in Washington, they have now unearthed tonight even more texts between anti-Trump lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Remember, there are over 50,000 Strzok-page texts. This is but a small sampling of what they believe could reveal damning new evidence that the FBI, the Obama White House, and the CIA, and the deep state, and the intel community, were all working together in order to open up a politically motivated Trump-Russia collision investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's explain why congressional investigators, you know, think this is important. According to one text message from Strzok to Lisa Page, August 2nd, 2016, Strzok makes a reference to the first inter-agency meeting discussing coordination between the FBI and the DOJ on the DNC hacking case. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is what Strzok writes. Quote: 'Thanks so much for having the discipline to wait another 24 hours to have the first meeting about the case with the DOJ.' These congressional investigators that we spoke to tonight's, they believe this is evidence that the FBI and DOJ met to discuss the Russia election hacking investigation. And then get this, August 25th, 2016, Harry Reid, he is briefed by then CIA director, you know, the guy that voted for the communist in the '70s, how did he ever become a CIA director? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Anyway, with John Brennan about Russia's attempts to influence the election. And then two days after that meeting, Harry Reid sends a letter to then FBI Director James Comey, urging him to open an investigation into Donald Trump. He wrote at the time: 'The evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government on Donald Trump's presidential campaign continues to mount.' if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } After the letter became public, Strzok texts Lisa Page a link to a 'New York Times' article referencing the letter, writing, quote: 'Here we go.' Oh, may be that's sort of like their insurance policy. Next, the FBI used that letter as a legitimate cover for their investigation into Russia collision and as a part of their FISA warrant application against Carter Page, a Trump associate. That gets them all the emails. That gets them right into the heart of the Trump campaign. In other words, this was a coordinated effort to spy on, bring down, and tarnish the Trump campaign. Sara Carter and House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes will be here tonight and they will explain all of this to you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And while we continue to bring information about the deep state forces that are working to take on the president, work to make sure president never got elected, well, the FBI is stonewalling the American people and Congress when it comes to these request for documents related to three important topics, including the department's investigation into Clinton's email server, information about potential FISA abuses, and the justification behind why Andrew McCabe was fired from the FBI. The release of documents has been extraordinarily slow. As a matter of fact, it almost sounds like obstruction to me. It's so slow that the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, well, he was now was forced to issue a subpoena. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } 'The Washington Examiner's' Byron York is reporting the Attorney General Jeff Sessions is absolutely livid and apoplectic with the FBI Director Christopher Wray and his low compliance with these important requests. Give us these documents! In response, as we reported last night, Director Wray has now promised to double the amount of staff working on releasing the documents and is going to double up their shifts. But is this too little too late? Should a contempt of court order be issued if the FBI does not comply with Bob Goodlatte's subpoena? All right. That's an important question. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We turn our attention to another top story we're following. The media erupted into a frenzy today, absolutely goes nuts over a story in 'The New York Times' speculating that, quote, 'Trump's lawyer raised the prospect of pardons for General Flynn and Paul Manafort.' One little itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny little problem with the story -- it's fake news. And we know because one of Trump's lawyers, Ty Cobb, put out a statement. It reads: 'I've only been asked about pardons by the press and have routinely responded on the record, no pardons are under discussion or under consideration at the White House.' Oh, fake news. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Ty Cobb could not have been more clear. That does not stop their corrupt mainstream media from obsessing over the story during today's White House briefing. We have the evidence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look.",

That was in August 2016, that early that month, at the beginning of August, we know that Jonathan Moffa, working with a counterintelligence division of the FBI, working alongside Peter Strzok and was probably Peter Strzok's supervisor, according to my sources, actually went to the White House to have a meeting with Denis McDonough who was the chief of staff for President Obama. And what's so fascinating about that is that he entered the White House early in the morning that August, goes into the White House with three other people who are not named on the White House log, and then doesn't check out until 11:59 that night. So, we don't even know what time he left. But he meets with Denis McDonough and it it's apparently about this -- the Russia investigation. And that puts him just one degree of separation from the president, because Denis McDonough is his chief of staff. So, President Obama was very well aware, according to the sources that I've spoken with, at least they believe he was very well aware of what was going on in the beginnings of this investigation.",

But as I've said, eventually, we're going to get all of these documents. So, let me walk back a little bit of the history that we have with Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page. In October, I asked what had happened. Didn't get any information what happened, you know, between Strzok and Page. Didn't know, we asked, is there anything there waiting to see? Well, finally, we see a leak to 'The Washington Post' of text messages. At that point, finally, in December, I asked DOJ to send me everything that was pertinent and relevant to our investigation. And as you know at that time we had informed the Department of Justice that we were looking at them for FISA abuse and other matters. So, they produced some of the text messages which is fine. They did that. They said that's all we needed. Well, then a couple of months later a few more text messages show up, a couple of weeks ago there's the conversation between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page talking about the FISA court judge. Clearly, that would have been something that the House intelligence committee would have been interested in. And now the emails that text messages that you are talking about today on the show, Sean, I have not seen them.

But three months earlier he is using it and the FBI is using it as the bulk of an application for a FISA warrant against the campaign associate of Donald Trump in the lead up to a presidential election, which allows them to then spy on the emails of an opposition party candidate. This is not a game. This is now, to me, the biggest abuse of power scandal we have had in history. You get these ridiculous people on the left making insane Watergate analogies. But Watergate was a chip breaking, a third grade break in. This is about the powerful tools of intelligence. This is about the FBI and DOJ exonerating a presidential candidate from crimes that we know that were committed. Then, using Russian information that they didn't verify, not telling a FISA court the whole truth. It's like, what do we need to get the wheels of justice really turning here?

We need those documents like yesterday. Yesterday we needed those documents. And what, I think now the difference where we were from a few months ago because of the obstruction, because of the cover-up the pressure that the American people are now putting on Congress by making everybody aware of this, asking their congressmen why is it the Department of Justice can stonewall Congress for this long? I believe that Bob Goodlatte's subpoena is going to be enforced. I think we're going to get all of the documents.

Bottom line is senior officials here are cheering the fact that there is going to be this Justice Department inspector general investigation by Michael Horowitz into exactly what happened with FISA abuse. President Trump as you know has been pushing for this for some time. Some sort of scrutiny of top Obama officials and former FBI officials like Andrew McCabe and James Comey. Remember, Attorney General Jeff Sessions just a few weeks ago said he wanted the inspector general to look at this. Some supporters of the president said the inspector general would bury this and that Sessions have made a mistake. But this is a sign Horowitz may be moving full speed ahead. On Devin Nunes first reveal, as mentioned a moment ago with his memo laying out how top officials in the Obama administration got that warrant from the FISA court to spy on ex-Trump advisor Carter Page. Most importantly, Comey, McCabe and other officials used former British spy Christopher Steele as anti-Trump dossier without telling the judge of the DNC and the Clinton campaign had paid for that dirt. Democrats have been deeply skeptical about this FISA abuse that it will really lead anywhere. They've also been skeptical that the president will be able to get any momentum on his efforts to crackdown on illegal immigration. But the president today tweeted out praise for officials in Orange County for standing up to that state's sanctuary policies in California. He also received a briefing as you could see on border wall prototypes as we learned that in the California town of Calexico they've already replaced more than two miles of a tiny barrier that was built years ago. They've now replaced it with a 30-foot high bollard style wall like one of the prototypes the president was looking at just a couple of weeks ago in California. So the Trump administration is starting to build this wall, not all at once but maybe piece by piece. The president by the way, last story tonight also tweeting about North Korea saying, quote, 'For years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. We look forward.' That comes as the president sealed a new trade deal with South Korea, and said he now wants to move from the economy to start with security issues on the Korean peninsula, Sean.",

It's frustrating to me too. But we have breaking tonight, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, he's now going to open an investigation into FISA abuses within the Department of Justice and the FBI. This is big, big news and we'll explain why. Now, we have been sounding this alarm about the deep state weaponizing the intelligence community night after night. And finally, now, we are one step closer to getting the justice we've been calling for, and you, the American people, deserve. Now, by the way, this announcement could not come at a better time because tonight, newly uncovered text messages between Trump-hating FBI lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, they are revealing even more evidence -- this is only a smidgen of what is coming in terms of the potential abuse of power within some of the highest levels of our government. Also, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reportedly livid tonight at the FBI's lack of cooperation following requests for documents related to a number of important cases. And the mainstream media was in a frenzy today over a story that President Trump considered pardoning Lieutenant General Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. One itsy-bitsy problem, the story was fake news the whole time. Also, James Comey just added one more stop to his upcoming book tour. He's doing a town hall with Jerry Springer wannabe, creepy Anderson Cooper. And also, I speak with the FBI informant in the Uranium One case. He will be in studio with me. That's coming up for the first time. We have that and more in tonight's big, breaking news opening monologue."

And our top story tonight, after months of ringing the alarm about the abuse of power within the FISA court system, well, the DOJ inspector general has finally now announced plans to investigate alleged foreign intelligence surveillance abuses. We've been calling for this. This, of course, by the DOJ and the FBI. We have been exposing how the unverified Clinton bought and paid for dossier filled with Russian and Russian government plies in propaganda and misinformation was used as evidence to extend a FISA warrant on Carter Page. We also showed you how circular reporting from Michael Isikoff and Yahoo News citing the phony dossier was intentionally used by the FBI as an attempt to strengthen their FISA abuse case against Page. We have unearthed shocking conflicts of interest and extreme anti-Trump bias, sadly at the highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ. But we are finally one step closer to getting to the bottom line truth in what is the biggest abuse of power scandal and this history of the country. And, of course, we deserve to know the truth and we are revealing the real and ever present danger to have the powerful tools of intelligence in the deep state used against the American people. I know this is slow. I know this is frustrating. But we are now finally making serious progress."

      "speaker": "And according to the DOJ inspector general statement, it says in part, quote",
      "utterance": "'As part of the examination, the OIG also will review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source' This is interesting. Additionally, 'the OIG will review the DOJ and FBI's relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISA court applications.' In order for this investigation now to be successful, it must answer the following questions. These are only a few of many. What did the FBI really know about the Steele dossier and when did they know it? This is critical. What was the FBI's relationship with a foreign national by the name of Christopher Steele who used Russian sources? Was the FISA warrant against Carter Page politically motivated? And did political bias influence the FBI or DOJ during the Russia investigation? My message tonight to the FBI and DOJ is turn over to 1.2 million documents that Congress has now subpoenaed and it is time to appoint a special counsel because you cannot ever investigate yourself. This brings us to our next breaking story. Congressional investigators from the Freedom Caucus, the only guys doing any work in Washington, they have now unearthed tonight even more texts between anti-Trump lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Remember, there are over 50,000 Strzok-page texts. This is but a small sampling of what they believe could reveal damning new evidence that the FBI, the Obama White House, and the CIA, and the deep state, and the intel community, were all working together in order to open up a politically motivated Trump-Russia collision investigation. Let's explain why congressional investigators, you know, think this is important. According to one text message from Strzok to Lisa Page, August 2nd, 2016, Strzok makes a reference to the first inter-agency meeting discussing coordination between the FBI and the DOJ on the DNC hacking case."

    {
      "speaker": "This is what Strzok writes. Quote",
      "utterance": "'Thanks so much for having the discipline to wait another 24 hours to have the first meeting about the case with the DOJ.' These congressional investigators that we spoke to tonight's, they believe this is evidence that the FBI and DOJ met to discuss the Russia election hacking investigation. And then get this, August 25th, 2016, Harry Reid, he is briefed by then CIA director, you know, the guy that voted for the communist in the '70s, how did he ever become a CIA director?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Anyway, with John Brennan about Russia's attempts to influence the election. And then two days after that meeting, Harry Reid sends a letter to then FBI Director James Comey, urging him to open an investigation into Donald Trump. He wrote at the time",
      "utterance": "'The evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government on Donald Trump's presidential campaign continues to mount.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "After the letter became public, Strzok texts Lisa Page a link to a 'New York Times' article referencing the letter, writing, quote",
      "utterance": "'Here we go.' Oh, may be that's sort of like their insurance policy. Next, the FBI used that letter as a legitimate cover for their investigation into Russia collision and as a part of their FISA warrant application against Carter Page, a Trump associate. That gets them all the emails. That gets them right into the heart of the Trump campaign. In other words, this was a coordinated effort to spy on, bring down, and tarnish the Trump campaign. Sara Carter and House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes will be here tonight and they will explain all of this to you. And while we continue to bring information about the deep state forces that are working to take on the president, work to make sure president never got elected, well, the FBI is stonewalling the American people and Congress when it comes to these request for documents related to three important topics, including the department's investigation into Clinton's email server, information about potential FISA abuses, and the justification behind why Andrew McCabe was fired from the FBI. The release of documents has been extraordinarily slow. As a matter of fact, it almost sounds like obstruction to me. It's so slow that the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, well, he was now was forced to issue a subpoena. 'The Washington Examiner's' Byron York is reporting the Attorney General Jeff Sessions is absolutely livid and apoplectic with the FBI Director Christopher Wray and his low compliance with these important requests. Give us these documents! In response, as we reported last night, Director Wray has now promised to double the amount of staff working on releasing the documents and is going to double up their shifts. But is this too little too late? Should a contempt of court order be issued if the FBI does not comply with Bob Goodlatte's subpoena? All right. That's an important question. We turn our attention to another top story we're following. The media erupted into a frenzy today, absolutely goes nuts over a story in 'The New York Times' speculating that, quote, 'Trump's lawyer raised the prospect of pardons for General Flynn and Paul Manafort.'"

That was in August 2016, that early that month, at the beginning of August, we know that Jonathan Moffa, working with a counterintelligence division of the FBI, working alongside Peter Strzok and was probably Peter Strzok's supervisor, according to my sources, actually went to the White House to have a meeting with Denis McDonough who was the chief of staff for President Obama. And what's so fascinating about that is that he entered the White House early in the morning that August, goes into the White House with three other people who are not named on the White House log, and then doesn't check out until 11:59 that night. So, we don't even know what time he left. But he meets with Denis McDonough and it it's apparently about this -- the Russia investigation. And that puts him just one degree of separation from the president, because Denis McDonough is his chief of staff. So, President Obama was very well aware, according to the sources that I've spoken with, at least they believe he was very well aware of what was going on in the beginnings of this investigation."

Then she pays for a phony Russian dossier that a foreign national puts together, the FBI doesn't verify it, it turns out to be false, they presented to a FISA court judge, and they omit the key part of the information, which is a she paid for it and they never verified it, and it's like pulling teeth to get truth out of the Department of Justice and the FBI.

There's a lot of information here that needs to be investigated. I absolutely agree with the other guests here on the show, with Gregg and Jason, that we need a special counsel to do this investigation, they really need to be able to have somebody who can subpoena, has a subpoena power to get the information that they need from the FBI and from the DOJ. There is no other way around it. Look, we built a special counsel investigation into a president based on a guy at a bar, George Papadopoulos, and an unverified dossier. And they have been going after this president now for more than a year. There was enough sufficient evidence here to open up a secondary special counsel.

Congressman, I'm reaching a point of frustration here. We are talking about with these new Strzok-Page memos, this was within the 3,000-plus-page dump that we finally got to the last minute that you had to subpoena. There's 1.2 million documents, Congressman, and I applaud Chairman Goodlatte. But as we just heard from Congressman Chaffetz, he asked for these documents in 2016. Why -- how is it possible that Rod Rosenstein feels that he has the right to withhold this, not only from the American people, but Congress, people like you and Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee? Your job is oversight. We do have checks and balances the last time I checked the Constitution, sir."

But as I've said, eventually, we're going to get all of these documents. So, let me walk back a little bit of the history that we have with Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page. In October, I asked what had happened. Didn't get any information what happened, you know, between Strzok and Page. Didn't know, we asked, is there anything there waiting to see? Well, finally, we see a leak to 'The Washington Post' of text messages. At that point, finally, in December, I asked DOJ to send me everything that was pertinent and relevant to our investigation. And as you know at that time we had informed the Department of Justice that we were looking at them for FISA abuse and other matters. So, they produced some of the text messages which is fine. They did that. They said that's all we needed. Well, then a couple of months later a few more text messages show up, a couple of weeks ago there's the conversation between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page talking about the FISA court judge. Clearly, that would have been something that the House intelligence committee would have been interested in. And now the emails that text messages that you are talking about today on the show, Sean, I have not seen them.

Because in January of 2017 then President-elect Trump was told by James Comey the dossier is salacious and unverified. But three months earlier he is using it and the FBI is using it as the bulk of an application for a FISA warrant against the campaign associate of Donald Trump in the lead up to a presidential election, which allows them to then spy on the emails of an opposition party candidate. This is not a game. This is now, to me, the biggest abuse of power scandal we have had in history. You get these ridiculous people on the left making insane Watergate analogies. But Watergate was a chip breaking, a third grade break in. This is about the powerful tools of intelligence. This is about the FBI and DOJ exonerating a presidential candidate from crimes that we know that were committed. Then, using Russian information that they didn't verify, not telling a FISA court the whole truth. It's like, what do we need to get the wheels of justice really turning here? Because I know I', fed up, and my audience is fed up."

Well, now this boomeranged on them. And you know, you have at least I think half of the American people now know that the other party, the Democrats appear like they weaponized to some degree the intelligence services, you know, by using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Apparatus in this country to go and target the opposition campaign is totally unacceptable. And that's what happened here. And so people are beginning to learn the truth. So, I am happy that Bob Goodlatte subpoena these 1.2 million documents. But I said this earlier in the week. We need those documents like yesterday. Yesterday we needed those documents. And what, I think now the difference where we were from a few months ago because of the obstruction, because of the cover-up the pressure that the American people are now putting on Congress by making everybody aware of this, asking their congressmen why is it the Department of Justice can stonewall Congress for this long? I believe that Bob Goodlatte's subpoena is going to be enforced. I think we're going to get all of the documents. And if we don't, then we should move quickly to contempt and then move to impeachment. One of the mistakes we made is we never impeached Lois Lerner and we never impeached Koskinen.

Well, it's not as cold as it used to be. I used to feel bad at 20 below, here's Ed Henry. But you still have your big jacket on."

    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right. Well, it's little, it's raining tonight, Sean. Bottom line is senior officials here are cheering the fact that there is going to be this Justice Department inspector general investigation by Michael Horowitz into exactly what happened with FISA abuse. President Trump as you know has been pushing for this for some time. Some sort of scrutiny of top Obama officials and former FBI officials like Andrew McCabe and James Comey. Remember, Attorney General Jeff Sessions just a few weeks ago said he wanted the inspector general to look at this. Some supporters of the president said the inspector general would bury this and that Sessions have made a mistake. But this is a sign Horowitz may be moving full speed ahead. On Devin Nunes first reveal, as mentioned a moment ago with his memo laying out how top officials in the Obama administration got that warrant from the FISA court to spy on ex-Trump advisor Carter Page. Most importantly, Comey, McCabe and other officials used former British spy Christopher Steele as anti-Trump dossier without telling the judge of the DNC and the Clinton campaign had paid for that dirt. Democrats have been deeply skeptical about this FISA abuse that it will really lead anywhere. They've also been skeptical that the president will be able to get any momentum on his efforts to crackdown on illegal immigration. But the president today tweeted out praise for officials in Orange County for standing up to that state's sanctuary policies in California. He also received a briefing as you could see on border wall prototypes as we learned that in the California town of Calexico they've already replaced more than two miles of a tiny barrier that was built years ago. They've now replaced it with a 30-foot high bollard style wall like one of the prototypes the president was looking at just a couple of weeks ago in California. So the Trump administration is starting to build this wall, not all at once but maybe piece by piece. The president by the way, last story tonight also tweeting about North Korea saying, quote, 'For years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. We look forward.' That comes as the president sealed a new trade deal with South Korea, and said he now wants to move from the economy to start with security issues on the Korean peninsula, Sean."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I just want to do one follow-up because it's a story obviously we've been breaking news on for months now, and more particularly especially since that the Nunes memo came out. How can the Democrats be unhappy about or think it's not even going anywhere the whole FISA abuse scandal when they knew, meaning the FBI, and those that were involve in the application, the original FISA application that Hillary bought and paid for it. They never told the FISA judge that fact. And secondly, it all turned, a lot of it turned out to be lies and none of it was corroborated or even verified by the FBI which is a matter of FISA law and FBI protocol."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "This is a problem for Democrats. Because remember, after Devin Nunes came out with that Republican memo. There's all kinds of criticisms he's taken information out of context, all kinds of allegations. But when Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee had his bite of the apple, if you will, and put out that Democratic memo it really didn't refute the key findings that you're laying out there about alleged FISA abuse in the Obama administration. And Michael Horowitz let's not forget, is someone who was first nominated to a senior federal post going back to the George W. Bush days, then was appointed to a post by then-President Barack Obama. So he is someone who is seen nobody is perfectly non-partisan in Washington but Horowitz is seen as somebody who is a fairly honest broker. And so, you're right, that it's going to be hard for Democrats to just dismiss this as nothing."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Good to see you. Joining us now, the White House senior adviser for strategic communications, Mercedes Schlapp. The White House should be happy that in fact this now will be investigated. But we're still waiting on the first Horowitz report, the inspector general report, and now I understand that's been delayed. It's got to be frustrating at the White House that the wheels of justice grind this slowly, Mercedes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE ADVISER FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, clearly what the president wants is transparency, he want to make sure that they can look into the FISA and figure out if there were any political abuses. There has always been concern about that. And I think that that's what the president is going to be pushing for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I think there were abuses. I think I can be a little more opinionated than you. I think, as I said, she paid for it, Hillary, they never told the FISA court. That would be deception. The FBI has an obligation to verify it. They never verify it. Fusion GPS never did and ten they're leaking phony information, unverified information and they're not telling the FISA court judge that they never check into it. Where does the president stand tonight on the issue of the military? He's our commander in chief. That is his number one responsibility. We know he had an increase in the defense budget. I can't think of a more important issue to national security than building the wall. Drug leaders, drugs coming across. Human trafficking. The possibility that enemies of this country can cross over at will. Does he have the ability, will he use that defense budget money to build that wall?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, the president is exploring a variety of options at this point. Clearly, what we're seeing is that with the budget money that's been coming in with the $1.6 billion that was agreed upon is definitely an investment. A down payment into it to ensure that we have border wall and fencing and new construction. That's critical. As Ed Henry mentioned there are going to be places already where they are going to be repairing this wall from a 12-foot wall to a 30-foot wall which will again, make it increasingly difficult to have illegal immigrants come to our country. Secondly also is the part of technology and personnel. You are talking about a 10 percent increase in ICE funding. A very critical as you see, Sean in terms of what we need to be doing to ensure that our national security is taken care of and that our immigrant -- and that the wall is being built. And that is something and a promise that the president is keeping."
