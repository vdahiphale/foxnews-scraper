The President at the State of the Union said violent crime in El Paso, Texas dropped after the border wall was built. But, the next day, fact checkers claimed the President lied. Look at this Vox headline here, \"A border fence did not lower crime rates in El Paso, in fact, crime went up a bit.\" Now, that's a total dishonest distortion of the facts. The media cherry picked the timeline from the time money was authorized for the wall and until only 2011 to make it look like crime went up. But the facts are, when the wall was completed in El Paso in 2009, there were 3,300 violent crimes reported that year, and in 2016, the latest year data was available, about 2,600 violent crimes were reported. Crime dropped 20% since the wall was erected in El Paso. Now, the fact checkers have become fake news. Socialism on the rise. Here is the president at the State of the Union."

All right, ladies first, Wendy, we'll start with you. I know what's going on here. It is an identity politics pretzel that you guys have wrapped yourselves into. Okay, because you have the Governor in blackface. If he resigns, you have the black Lieutenant Governor accused of sexual assault and if he steps down, then you have another white Democrat in blackface.

You had Jimmy Kimmel not too long ago dressed up as Karl Malone. I mean, he's a big Karl Malone fan. I can't believe you can even find this online. Jimmy Fallon, I think was Chris Rock at one point.

And if I go there, they are going to be all over me to answer these questions. I want you to answer them first.\" The same reason I didn't go on Sunday morning shows that Sunday before the debate. The president knew full well I wasn't going and that night, after the debate was over, 10 minutes after it was over. He called me and he said, \"I won the debate because of you. You are the best campaign debate prepper I have ever seen. Will you still run the debate prep for debate number three?\" So this whole idea that I was off the team, I was there and then on election tonight, I was in his apartment with he, and Melania and Baron and the rest of the family watching election returns.
