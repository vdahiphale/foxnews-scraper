And you will not believe what a long time Hillary Clinton ally is saying about this explosive scandal. And tonight, Judicial Watch is scoring yet another major victory. The State Department is being told to speed up the release of Hillary Clinton's emails. How about some urgency?

      "sentences": "All right. Massive breaking news at this hour about the Clinton bought and paid for fake news Russian propaganda dossier, that, of course, was used by the Obama administration to obtain FISA warrants to surveil members of the Trump campaign and then the president-elect. Our own Ed Henry is reporting that in two closed door meetings this week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes that he told Republican lawmakers that he has seen evidence showing clear abuse of government surveillance programs by the FBI and Department of Justice officials. Ed Henry is also reporting that Nunes told his colleagues that he plans to share evidence of this abuse with the entire House later this month. Now, this is a major development but, as we have been saying, there is so much more information that needs to come out and it will because I'm telling you this is the beginning of a massive historic scandal. It's unfolding unlike anything this country has ever seen before. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is going to reach the very highest levels of your government, including the DOJ, the FBI, the intel community. Sara Carter tonight reporting and we have confirmed with our sources that as soon as next week, examples of systemic FISA abuses will in fact be revealed. And the unbiased so-called journalists, well, they should be able to see this as the major story it is worthy of further investigation. But as the media in this country so abusively biased and so anti-Trump that they can no longer care about simple, basic fundamental truth, our Constitution, our freedoms, our liberties? Does the media not care about any of this? The media as we have been pointing out nightly is so bad at this point in time in history and so radically left in their ideology that in fact, sadly true facts, they don't get through to them. The only thing that seems to matter is destroying and delegitimizing President Trump. That has been their only objective for over a year. You see it happening day after day, hour after hour. It's pretty disgusting, it's pathetic, it's a disservice, it's disgraceful to you the American people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it's why we are going to keep asking the tough questions here on this program and we'll keep getting information that the American people, all of you deserve to know. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, also tonight, the president is eviscerating FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer mistress Lisa Page over anti-Trump text messages. The president is telling the Wall Street Journal, quote, a man is tweeting to his lover that if she loses, we'll essentially go back to the insurance policy, which is, they lose, we'll go to phase 2? And we will get this guy out of office? I mean, this is the FBI we are talking about. I think that is, you know that is treason. See, that's treason right there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then the president added: that's a treasonous act, what he tweeted to his lover is treasonous. Now, here is the insurance policy text message President Trump is referring to. Peter Strzok writing his mistress: I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office that there is no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we here at Fox News and on this show, we believe, we haven't confirmed yet, the Andy mentioned in that text is the Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Now that message is only the beginning of this massive scandal. Stay with us here. It gets complicated. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Strzok and Page also called Trump an idiot. A loathsome human and said F Trump and congressional investigators, they are working to determine if these Trump-hating FBI lovers were leaking information about the Russia investigation to the press after a new round of their text messages were released. By the way, there is about 9,000 more to go. And Strzok also sat in on Hillary Clinton's FBI interview for the email investigation after he and James Comey exonerated her or begun writing the exoneration letter before the investigation and it was Strzok that signed the original documents kicking off the Russia investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This guy's corrupt tentacles touch seemingly everything and also General Flynn. Now, what Strzok has done here, it is crooked, it is scandalous and even former Clinton strategist Mark Penn is saying he should be fired. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's what Penn said on the Fox Business Network.

      "sentences": "Kind of refreshing. That was a Democrat being honest for once. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, there are reportedly 10,000 total messages between Strzok and Page. We have only gotten a fraction of them. Now, that scandal is only going to get bigger. Now, in addition to his comments about Peter Strzok to the Wall Street Journal, President Trump is also taking aim at Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intel Committee by saying, quote: he left meetings where people are being interviewed and, all of the sudden, they say a story about what's going on inside the meetings, it's probably illegal what he is doing but the Democrats -- well, they know it's a hoax, an excuse for them having lost the election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, while it's unclear if Schiff has been leaking, we know for a fact that another top ranking Democrat has been leaking. President Trump is continuing to slam who he is now calling sneaky Senator Dianne Feinstein because she unilaterally released the Fusion GPS testimony before Congress and Trump tweeted: Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, she blamed her poor decision by the way on the fact that she had a cold, I bet in school the dog ate her homework. And while Feinstein's actions are threatening to disrupt the Senate's investigation releasing the transcript provided some very revealing information about Fusion GPS and their founder Glenn Simpson. Simpson actually testified he never even bothered to verify with the former British spy Christopher Steele had actually put in the Russian sourced phony dossier. He also admitted that he was against Trump during the election. So, clearly, Simpson was more than happy to take over $10 million from Hillary Clinton and the DNC that she is running and put this dossier together that they then tried to use to influence the American people. Oh, Russian propaganda to influence an election. Bought and paid for by Hillary. And then a FISA warrant. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And finally tonight, Judicial Watch is scoring another major legal victory. Federal judge is ordering the State Department to ramp up the release of Hillary Clinton's email from her time as secretary of state and according to Judicial Watch, the FBI discovered 72,000 pages of documents last year that Clinton either tried to delete or did not disclose. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You cannot make this stuff up. If I wrote the most obscene spy novel, you couldn't make this up. The author of \"Trumped Up: How Criminalization of Political Differences Endangers Democracy\", Harvard constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, Sara, because you have been on the forefront this week, we now know that the dossier bought and paid for by Hillary with salacious lies was used to get a FISA warrant against -- if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I mean, it really did. You look at that testimony, you see to yourself first, Glenn Simpson said there was a source inside the Trump campaign. That's proven to be false now, what people have corrected that version of it and said, well, no, he was just talking about George Papadopoulos in London. Then you find out that Glenn Simpson wouldn't answer any questions as to whether he was pushing this dossier to the media. He kept stepping back. He wouldn't answer it. Then, we find out he didn't even verify the information in the dossier. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And when you look at all of, this knowing that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC actually paid for this, paid for this dossier, and that the dossier itself could have been part of a ginormous, a huge, a huge disinformation campaign by the Russians clearly there is a problem.",

I want to use this analogy, that the fix was in, poor Bernie Sanders and his supporters, they had no shot at all whatsoever and even Donna Brazile admits that. Then have you Comey and Strzok , I don't believe I have ever heard of a case where you write exoneration letters months before you interviewed the people involved in an investigation.

But they may play into what White House officials told us last night that the president is more concerned about border security here at home and protecting Americans than what foreign governments have to say about his policies. The bigger question for the president's agenda is whether this episode makes it even harder for him to accomplish the already tough battle of getting the wall along the southern border included as part of a deal on DACA as Republican Speaker Paul Ryan said these comments weren't helpful and Senator Dick Durbin, a key leader in terms of rounding up Democratic votes, flatly claimed the president said it.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to the special edition of \"Hannity.\" President Trump Versus The Swamp. Now, the title is fitting because yes, we are broadcasting tonight from our nation's capital, Washington, D.C., swamp, sewer, same thing. Now, we are following three major breaking stories tonight. Massive new developments in the Clinton bought and paid for phony fake news Russian propaganda dossier used by the Obama administration to spy on members of the Trump campaign. Ed Henry reporting at this hour that House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, he told his Republican colleagues this week in two closed door meetings that he has seen evidence of abuse of government surveillance programs by the FBI and by the Department of Justice and their officials. Plus, the president is accusing FBI agent Peter Strzok of treason over anti-Trump text messages that he sent to his FBI lawyer mistress Lisa Page. And you will not believe what a long time Hillary Clinton ally is saying about this explosive scandal. And tonight, Judicial Watch is scoring yet another major victory. The State Department is being told to speed up the release of Hillary Clinton's emails. How about some urgency? That's good for once. Also, Barack Obama he cannot quit his habit. He's lashing out and attacking again the Fox News Channel. Newt Gingrich is here tonight to discuss and respond. But, first, there is a lot to cover in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. We're glad you are with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Massive breaking news at this hour about the Clinton bought and paid for fake news Russian propaganda dossier, that, of course, was used by the Obama administration to obtain FISA warrants to surveil members of the Trump campaign and then the president-elect. Our own Ed Henry is reporting that in two closed door meetings this week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes that he told Republican lawmakers that he has seen evidence showing clear abuse of government surveillance programs by the FBI and Department of Justice officials. Ed Henry is also reporting that Nunes told his colleagues that he plans to share evidence of this abuse with the entire House later this month. Now, this is a major development but, as we have been saying, there is so much more information that needs to come out and it will because I'm telling you this is the beginning of a massive historic scandal. It's unfolding unlike anything this country has ever seen before. This is going to reach the very highest levels of your government, including the DOJ, the FBI, the intel community. Sara Carter tonight reporting and we have confirmed with our sources that as soon as next week, examples of systemic FISA abuses will in fact be revealed. And the unbiased so-called journalists, well, they should be able to see this as the major story it is worthy of further investigation. But as the media in this country so abusively biased and so anti-Trump that they can no longer care about simple, basic fundamental truth, our Constitution, our freedoms, our liberties? Does the media not care about any of this? The media as we have been pointing out nightly is so bad at this point in time in history and so radically left in their ideology that in fact, sadly true facts, they don't get through to them. The only thing that seems to matter is destroying and delegitimizing President Trump. That has been their only objective for over a year. You see it happening day after day, hour after hour. It's pretty disgusting, it's pathetic, it's a disservice, it's disgraceful to you the American people. But it's why we are going to keep asking the tough questions here on this program and we'll keep getting information that the American people, all of you deserve to know. Now, also tonight, the president is eviscerating FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer mistress Lisa Page over anti-Trump text messages. The president is telling the Wall Street Journal, quote, a man is tweeting to his lover that if she loses, we'll essentially go back to the insurance policy, which is, they lose, we'll go to phase 2? And we will get this guy out of office? I mean, this is the FBI we are talking about. I think that is, you know that is treason. See, that's treason right there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And then the president added",
      "utterance": "that's a treasonous act, what he tweeted to his lover is treasonous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, here is the insurance policy text message President Trump is referring to. Peter Strzok writing his mistress",
      "utterance": "I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office that there is no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40. Now, we here at Fox News and on this show, we believe, we haven't confirmed yet, the Andy mentioned in that text is the Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Now that message is only the beginning of this massive scandal. Stay with us here. It gets complicated. Now, Strzok and Page also called Trump an idiot. A loathsome human and said F Trump and congressional investigators, they are working to determine if these Trump-hating FBI lovers were leaking information about the Russia investigation to the press after a new round of their text messages were released. By the way, there is about 9,000 more to go. And Strzok also sat in on Hillary Clinton's FBI interview for the email investigation after he and James Comey exonerated her or begun writing the exoneration letter before the investigation and it was Strzok that signed the original documents kicking off the Russia investigation. This guy's corrupt tentacles touch seemingly everything and also General Flynn. Now, what Strzok has done here, it is crooked, it is scandalous and even former Clinton strategist Mark Penn is saying he should be fired. Here's what Penn said on the Fox Business Network. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK PENN, FOFRMER CLINTON STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I think that tweet is one of the most damaging things I've ever seen from someone in the government at every level. I don't understand how he is still employed by the FBI. I don't understand how criminal investigation hasn't been opened to all of this. To me, that is hugely damaging to confidence in the FBI. These two folks were having an affair, using official government channels for their personal communications. That alone would have made them a security threat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Kind of refreshing. That was a Democrat being honest for once. Now, there are reportedly 10,000 total messages between Strzok and Page. We have only gotten a fraction of them. Now, that scandal is only going to get bigger."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, in addition to his comments about Peter Strzok to the Wall Street Journal, President Trump is also taking aim at Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intel Committee by saying, quote",
      "utterance": "he left meetings where people are being interviewed and, all of the sudden, they say a story about what's going on inside the meetings, it's probably illegal what he is doing but the Democrats -- well, they know it's a hoax, an excuse for them having lost the election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, while it's unclear if Schiff has been leaking, we know for a fact that another top ranking Democrat has been leaking. President Trump is continuing to slam who he is now calling sneaky Senator Dianne Feinstein because she unilaterally released the Fusion GPS testimony before Congress and Trump tweeted",
      "utterance": "Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. Now, she blamed her poor decision by the way on the fact that she had a cold, I bet in school the dog ate her homework. And while Feinstein's actions are threatening to disrupt the Senate's investigation releasing the transcript provided some very revealing information about Fusion GPS and their founder Glenn Simpson. Simpson actually testified he never even bothered to verify with the former British spy Christopher Steele had actually put in the Russian sourced phony dossier. He also admitted that he was against Trump during the election. So, clearly, Simpson was more than happy to take over $10 million from Hillary Clinton and the DNC that she is running and put this dossier together that they then tried to use to influence the American people. Oh, Russian propaganda to influence an election. Bought and paid for by Hillary. And then a FISA warrant. And finally tonight, Judicial Watch is scoring another major legal victory. Federal judge is ordering the State Department to ramp up the release of Hillary Clinton's email from her time as secretary of state and according to Judicial Watch, the FBI discovered 72,000 pages of documents last year that Clinton either tried to delete or did not disclose. You cannot make this stuff up. If I wrote the most obscene spy novel, you couldn't make this up. The author of \"Trumped Up: How Criminalization of Political Differences Endangers Democracy\", Harvard constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, Sara, because you have been on the forefront this week, we now know that the dossier bought and paid for by Hillary with salacious lies was used to get a FISA warrant against --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, yes. We now it was either in part used or a significant part of the FBI being able to get the warrant to spy on Trump and people within his campaign. But, Sean, when you are looking at the dossier and I think actually leaking Glenn Simpson' testimony actually back fired on the Democrats. I mean, it really did. You look at that testimony, you see to yourself first, Glenn Simpson said there was a source inside the Trump campaign. That's proven to be false now, what people have corrected that version of it and said, well, no, he was just talking about George Papadopoulos in London. Then you find out that Glenn Simpson wouldn't answer any questions as to whether he was pushing this dossier to the media. He kept stepping back. He wouldn't answer it. Then, we find out he didn't even verify the information in the dossier. And when you look at all of, this knowing that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC actually paid for this, paid for this dossier, and that the dossier itself could have been part of a ginormous, a huge, a huge disinformation campaign by the Russians clearly there is a problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Professor, let me go to you. You make some really good point as it relates to the partisan aspect of all this. I'm a conservative. I'm a proud conservative, I don't hide any of that. But we learned a lot that the fix was in. I want to use this analogy, that the fix was in, poor Bernie Sanders and his supporters, they had no shot at all whatsoever and even Donna Brazile admits that. Then have you Comey and Strzok , I don't believe I have ever heard of a case where you write exoneration letters months before you interviewed the people involved in an investigation. They didn't do the investigation, but they are writing an exoneration. Then it seems with the Russian dossier that they are trying to put the fix in there by using bought and paid for Russian propaganda we now learn and then you take it a step further, and that information was put before a FISA court and a warrant issued. As a constitutional scholar, I hope you are as afraid as I am about these issues, about the corrupt nature of all of this and the -- and our constitutional rights in jeopardy here."

    {
      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "I am very much worried about that. That's why I called for right from the beginning an impartial, nonpartisan commission of inquiry to look into every aspect of the last election. Every aspect."

      "utterance": "What the Russians tried to do in terms of the Democrats. What the Russians tried to do in terms of the Republicans. This is a bipartisan issue. Every American suffers when the Russians in any way try to influence the election. Look, I don't think the Russians tried to influence the election necessarily in favor of one candidate or the other. I think they tried influence the election in terms of destabilizing the American political system. And that's why having partisan inquiries by congressional committees doesn't work. That's why having a special counsel who operates behind closed doors doesn't work. We need an open investigation commission. This is too important to all Americans to leave any kind of partisan advantage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let me follow up with the dossier, it was partisan, bought and paid for. Remember, Christopher Steele didn't come on board with fusion until Hillary and the DNC were paying for it, but that dossier used to obtain at least in part, maybe significantly as Sara is reporting, to get a FISA warrant on a opposition candidate and a president-elect. Seems like Fourth Amendment crisis here in many ways."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it would be a Fourth Amendment violation if the material in the FISA warrant were known to be false. Now, under case called Franks versus Maryland, it's not enough under the Fourth Amendment for it to be wrong. It has to be known to be wrong. And so, again, this should be looked into. Every fact should be investigated. Nobody should be afraid of the truth. Let the truth come out. Let the American public decide. Can I say one more thing?"

The Statue of Liberty says give us your poor, your hungry, people yearning to be free. We are a country of immigrants. And I just hope we can elevate the discussion about immigration and try not to insult people from any part of the world and the president can do a great service if he just comes forward and says --"

There would be no Mueller special prosecutor but for the leaking of Comey to the New York Times on one specific memo. So that material may be coming out. It's all building. And there are text messages that are coming out. As Ed is talking about, now we are going to find out more details about the FISA -- the intelligence surveillance abuses. Now, you know my concern is why with are we waiting to find out about them after the reauthorization occurs?

White House aides were not denying it was said. But two other Republicans today who were in that meeting Senators Perdue and Cotton said they do not recall the conversation playing out that way. And the president himself who knows what he said or didn't say tweeted, quote, the language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used.

Now as the president held an event at the White House today to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, various pundits and anchors at CNN flat-out called him racist, while various officials inside foreign governments ranging from Haiti to South Africa also attacked the president. But they may play into what White House officials told us last night that the president is more concerned about border security here at home and protecting Americans than what foreign governments have to say about his policies. The bigger question for the president's agenda is whether this episode makes it even harder for him to accomplish the already tough battle of getting the wall along the southern border included as part of a deal on DACA as Republican Speaker Paul Ryan said these comments weren't helpful and Senator Dick Durbin, a key leader in terms of rounding up Democratic votes, flatly claimed the president said it."

      "utterance": "Yes, but I mean -- one of the problems with the negotiation that the president referred to in his tweet is that this started out, how do you define DACA? It started out as the children of illegal immigrants bought here through no fault of their own should stay here. The current state of negotiations has changed. It's those children plus their parents who came over here illegally and knowingly so, not the infants, not the kids, they will get some sort of legal status as well. To be clear, they're not going to become citizens overnight. This is not amnesty per se. However, they will get some legal status. That's not where this started, San, that's going to upset the president and others who support him."

I would not vote for a deal DACA without funding for the wall. The two should be tied, because the Republicans are 100 percent right. We'll be doing DACA 2.0 in two years if we don't have better border security and that includes wall. It could include sensors and drones and more Border Patrol agents.

If ever there is a time for the Democrats to compromise, it's now. Because Donald Trump means it when he says he will start deporting people. Look, President Obama broke the law when he allowed DACA to take place. He did not have the presidential authority to do it. So what Donald Trump is going to do is enforce the law. The law is on the books. The Democrats want to change the law, they need to compromise."

I mean, look, is Sean Hannity suddenly going to get on the airways and say you know I was wrong about this Obama guy he is my man. No, that is not going to happen. There is a certain segment of hard core Sean Hannity fans. That probably wouldn't want to go have a beer with me. There is no doubt about that. With respect to Sean Hannity I didn't know he had invited me for a beer. His opinion of me does not seem to be very high, but I'm always good for a beer. The history channel is not here. I guess they were embarrassed about the whole Obama is a devil thing. Of course that never kept Fox News from showing up. Good affordable healthcare might seem like a fanged threat to the freedom of the American people on Fox News. It turns out it's working pretty well in the real world. If you watch Fox News on a regular basis, it is a constant menu they will find like folks who make me mad. I don't know where they find them. I wasn't viewed through this prism of Fox News and conservative media and making me scary. And I haven't, you know, turned on Fox News or listened to conservative talk radio yet today, but I have turned them on enough over these past seven and a half years to know I'm not exaggerating in terms of their story. Look, if I watched Fox News I wouldn't vote for me either, right? Because have you got this screen, fun house mirror through which people are receiving information. Those who watch Fox News and those who read the New York Times occupy completely different realities. I mean, if I watch Fox News, I wouldn't vote for me."

I think we have a series of scandals and looking at Devon Nunes today that the abuse of government surveillance by the FBI is so bad and all that we are uncovering here is so bad, he is right, the mainstream media, you know, they want to destroy Trump and they loved him.

Many, many years from now, in a nursing home or a nice retirement community, Barack Obama will be still living in a fantasy life. He will think that Iran should really wanted to have a deal. He will think that high taxes really work. He will think that welfare is a good deal. I mean, what you just put together is as, I think, funny a statement of who Barack Obama is as I have ever seen.

We played the montage of Democrats saying there is no evidence of collusion. Yet, we do have evidence of unbelievable instance of abusing the weapons of intelligence and surveilling, unmasking, and leaking raw intelligence. We know that the fix was in with Hillary and Bernie. We know that the fix was in Comey and Strzok, rigged -- they had an exoneration before even an investigation. We know that Hillary paid for a dossier full of Russian propaganda. We know that dossier now was used to get FISA warrants to spy on opposition candidate and a president-elect and his team. And I'm not even talking about uranium one or Debbie Wassermann Schultz. There seems to be -- there are two realities here. And the media has chosen a reality of partisanship and conspiracy theories. Either that or I'm wrong, but they didn't think Trump could win and people like you and me were right."

Because it's so -- it is so unbelievably hard to understand if you're a normal person. Over here is a left wing corrupt establishment, which sincerely sees this entire fight as a function of identity politics in which if they lose, they will disappear. Over here are the rest of us who are thinking, you know, a lot of these ideas are really weird, I mean, Obama thought if you gave $100 billion to Iran, they would be nice people. Obama thought it was terrific that we had more people on food stamps than ever before. You have a whole list of these things. And this is really a definition of life and death. And so what you and are living through is a period where the old order, the establishment that inherited and this is important to understand. They inherited Walter Cronkite. They inherited Edward R. Murrow. They inherited the old Harvard. They inherited all these great centers of authority and responsibility and they have gradually turned them into left wing nut cake positions. And so, the truth is we're in an identity fight which if we win they disappear. If they win, we disappear. That is why what you and I experience, because we are great friends, we're great warriors in the same cause, and we both understand if we lose, we will literally disappear. On the other hand, if we win, America will continue to move forward as the freest country in the world and I think that is why both of us fight."

As a practical matter, can I shoot off a litany of Obama's statistics and what his true record is on the economy? You mentioned Iran. You think he can bribe murdering thug dictators and not mention radical Islamic terrorism and in a year of Trump, you can compare policy significant changes with tangible results.

Trump's tax cuts, regulatory cuts, pro-business attitude is starting to work. You would think that having the lowest black -- lower than any time under Barack Obama that Obama would say, this is, great, he can't afford to believe it. Nancy Pelosi can't afford to believe it.
