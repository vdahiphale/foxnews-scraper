Voters in five states headed to the polls this week and some razor-thin results has spurred a debate within the Republican Party over just what role President Trump should play in the midterm campaign. Although the president declared victory on Twitter this week, posting that he was five for five with candidates he endorsed in Tuesday's races. Narrow margins in a special election in Ohio and in the gubernatorial primary in Kansas are causing some to raise questions about his claim that a giant red wave is coming this November. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnist Kim Strassel, and editorial board member, Allysia Finley. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Dan, after you look at Tuesday's results, how much trouble is the Republican Party in in November? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: I would say the Republican Party is, indeed, in trouble, Paul. Look, the baseline is that Ohio 12 race where Troy Balderson seems to have won by less than 1 percent with a Democrat. Look, on the scale of one to 10 in competitive House races, Ohio 12 should have been about a nine for the Republicans. Balderson should have won that by more than less than 1 percent. The remaining competitive seats, and there are about 34 of them, are all maybe a five or a six. They are going to be much tighter than Ohio 12. The math suggests that whatever happened there, perhaps women in the upper-middle class suburbs staying home, whatever happened there, is going to lean heavily on the remaining competitive Republican districts. There's no way to sugar coat it, Paul. That is the conclusion from what happened there.",

But look, also, I think it was a problem of how they did it. The issue with Alex Jones for a lot of people is supposedly that he publishes fake news. But that's not why they removed his stuff. They did it because they said that his content was hate speech. That is a very slippery slope. And it gives these groups the ability to essentially censor the way the Senator that you mentioned at beginning was talking about, any views that they don't like under the very broad category of hate speech.",

I mean, if you're going to ban -- so I mean, that would be the argument they would make. But he's not a traditional conservative. And don't put us on the slippery-slope to say we are going to start banning other conservative voices. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, that is the voice -- I mean, that's the argument conservatives will make, and they should make it. I mean, you know, InfoWars, there's probably part of the population out there that is susceptible to those kinds of conspiracy theories. They have always been out there. But this is a country of 325 million people. Let's say a million people have attached themselves to InfoWars and Alex Jones. Is that a threat to the country? Well, it wasn't just Facebook and YouTube that banned him. He's now been banned by virtually all the social media platforms, LinkedIn, Pinterest. Apple has taken him off their iPod listings. The only real platform that he's on now is, indeed, Twitter. So the question is, if you sort of -- where do you draw the line? I think Chris Murphy, the Democratic Senator, in the remark at the beginning, let the cat out of the bag. People like him will push beyond Alex Jones and start including, say Rush Limbaugh, as a purveyor of hate speech.

      "utterance": "Welcome to the \"Journal: Editorial Report.\" I'm Paul Gigot. Voters in five states headed to the polls this week and some razor-thin results has spurred a debate within the Republican Party over just what role President Trump should play in the midterm campaign. Although the president declared victory on Twitter this week, posting that he was five for five with candidates he endorsed in Tuesday's races. Narrow margins in a special election in Ohio and in the gubernatorial primary in Kansas are causing some to raise questions about his claim that a giant red wave is coming this November. Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnist Kim Strassel, and editorial board member, Allysia Finley. Dan, after you look at Tuesday's results, how much trouble is the Republican Party in in November? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: I would say the Republican Party is, indeed, in trouble, Paul. Look, the baseline is that Ohio 12 race where Troy Balderson seems to have won by less than 1 percent with a Democrat. Look, on the scale of one to 10 in competitive House races, Ohio 12 should have been about a nine for the Republicans. Balderson should have won that by more than less than 1 percent. The remaining competitive seats, and there are about 34 of them, are all maybe a five or a six. They are going to be much tighter than Ohio 12. The math suggests that whatever happened there, perhaps women in the upper-middle class suburbs staying home, whatever happened there, is going to lean heavily on the remaining competitive Republican districts. There's no way to sugar coat it, Paul. That is the conclusion from what happened there."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Charlie Cook, who analyzes House races, said there's 68 more House seats that Republicans now hold that are less Republican than Ohio 12 seat. So that puts -- a lot of these are going to be in play, Kim, particularly the suburban seats, the rural areas Trump and the Republican Party still holding very strong, but it's these suburban swing districts which are most at play."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, you are seeing that in these election results. You are seeing that in polling. The Republicans have problem in suburbia, particularly among college-educated voters, women college-eduated voters, who are very down on Donald Trump. And so if you look at that Ohio race, for instance, where Balderson really fell apart was in the suburban part of that district. The farther you got away from Columbus, the more rural the area, he tallied and racked up the votes. But and it is still barely enough to win. But this is something that's a dangerous proposition for Republicans having to rely on simply large turnout from rural voters everywhere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Allysia, let's broaden the field a little bit to the governors' races, which we know we tend not to give much attention to as the Congress, but are very important. And Republicans have, I think, 31 Republican seats now, including most of the upper Midwest. But what did we learn from Michigan's primaries?"

      "speaker": "ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, so here is what they'll say in the White House. Some people have been critical of the president going out and doing these rallies, talking about very controversial subjects, like immigration and trade, saying this is what is alienating these voters. Now the White House and others will make the opposite claim. They say, look, the only reason Balderson won was because Trump went out there and he excited the rural voters and he got them to turn out there. We believe that we would not have gotten a lot of these suburban voters any way. They baked it in against Trump. So the only thing we can do to combat that is get out our base, really turn them out and -- and so that's what you see happening. It's working in Ohio. So we will be able to replicate that come fall. That's their argument."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "So their argument is, I guess, Dan, let's polarize the election on cultural issues like immigration, for example, immigration enforcement, and soft sell the economy, which is doing great, and tax cuts, let's not focus on those, let's make this a cultural battle. Smart strategy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "It works for Donald Trump, there's no question about it. The question is, does it work for the other individual Republican candidates in individual races, such as Barbara Comstock running in northern Virginia, where she is in a very tight race. And cultural issues do not play. Doesn't play in the seat that's being vacated in New Jersey by Rodney Frelinghuysen. Clearly, a very centrist seat in which the Republican is competing with a highly-financed former Marine, woman and prosecutor. In those situations, Paul, I don't think the cultural issues are going to play. They are going to have to run on what they have achieved, which is an extraordinarily strong economy. And some of these candidates are asking, let me do it myself, I can carry it if the president doesn't come in here and ruffle the waters with immigration and trade wars."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    {
      "speaker": "FINLEY",
      "utterance": "Maybe, but you have to consider that there are three Senate seats, Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee, that Republicans currently hold that could be in play for Democrats for just the opposite reason, in so far that immigration backlash against the president's immigration policies may hurt Republicans there."

The president tweeting that, \"Bad environmental laws are magnifying the fires by not allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.\" He added, \"Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading.\" We are back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Allysia Finley.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. This is the ground-zero problem for why you are having fires. And, by the way, not just in California, but throughout the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, other places where, going back 20 years, the federal forest -- the logging ban in federal forests kicked off a trend, and you see it, too, driven at the state level by very bad environmentalist policies. It's a leave-it-alone approach. The USDA did a report in December and said 129 million dead trees in California. And there's a reticence at the government level to go in and really do any lugging, cutting, thinning. And this is what's providing the fuel for these fires. When they get raging, you can't stop them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "This is a puzzle for me, Kim. And I'm a midwestern and not a westerner. But why wouldn't environmentalists want healthy forests? So why wouldn't you want to clear some of this stuff out so that it is less vulnerable to these raging fires?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's the problem with most modern green environmental policy, is it actually doesn't do much to help nature. It is an involuntary reflexive belief that man should not interfere at all. You do not manage nature. You let nature take its course. But if you are going to do that, you going to end up -- for instance, right now, they estimated and Sierra Nevada has had four times as many trees in them as you would in a normal healthy forest. We used to be able to have these massive fires that can just burn and clear everything out, but we can't really allow that anymore given population and the devastation they cause. So your alternative is to go in and manage them mechanically with cutting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Dan, Jerry Brown, the governor out there, has -- he blames climate change. Of course, he blames just about everything bad that happens out there on climate change. But at some point, when do you take responsibility, as a political leader, and -- OK, let's say he's right and this is related to change in climate, the government has to do something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "They do have to do something, but Jerry Brown and the Democrats, the greens, have put themselves in a position where they're very simply incapable of moving. And I want to pick up the point that Kim was just making. One alternative to this is, in these vast areas of running controlled burns, where you burn down some of the forest to clear the area, I mean, they are forests. They are full of trees. Trees are wood and wood burns. But for the last 100 years or 200 years or so, this country has set aside vast areas of the west and they have not -- and they've been untouched, as Kim suggested. They are too big for the federal government to manage, even if they were going in and doing that sort of thing. And as she suggested, if you allow logging companies to go in, private owners, they would be responsible for keeping these forests in healthy shape. They are not healthy."

The White House said Wednesday that it will impose fresh sanctions on Moscow after determining that it used a nerve agent on British soil in March in an attack that sickened the former Russian spy and his daughter and killed a mother of three. This, as re-imposed sanctions took effect on Tehran, the first since President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year. The president warned Tuesday that anyone doing business with Iran will not be doing business with the United States. Cliff May is the founder and president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. So, Cliff, welcome back. Good to see you again. Let's start, though, with Turkey. I want to talk briefly here at least about Turkey. The president using sanctions and serious sanctions to try to get the Turks to return Pastor Brunson to the United States. What do you think of the use of sanctions for that purpose? CLIFF MAY, FOUNDER & PRESIDENT, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES: Well, I think, in general, this administration recognizes a rule, and that is any nefarious behavior that you do not punish, you, in effect, license. So we have multiple countries now taking Americans hostage. That Turkey should take an innocent pastor -- he's been there 20 years. He ministers to a small flock of Protestants. He's being accused of things there's no evidence whatsoever that he is in any way involved in anything nefarious there. The idea that he can be held hostage and various demands made on this is pretty astounding, especially when you consider Turkey is a NATO ally, And I think Trump has been very frustrated by Erdogan on this and on other scores as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "But it's going back and forth. Erdogan says, I'm not going to give in. And Trump is ratcheting up, saying he will double metals' tariffs on Turkey. And you've seen what's happened to the Turkish Lira, just really falling out of bed and creating real nervousness across a lot of currency markets. So there may be some global implications here. How risky is this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAY",
      "utterance": "It's risky, but it's mostly risky to Turkey. And you would think that Erdogan would do the rational thing, which is say, OK, America is my ally, we are NATO members, I can't be holding an innocent American in prison for years, and I have to -- I have to do something about that or I have to make up with them. Instead, of course, Erdogan is moving closer and closer to Russia. And NATO, after all, is meant to protect Europe from Russia predominantly. He is also undercutting American policy vis-a-vis Iran. So he is the best friend-emy, certainly an unreliable ally. And I think a crisis is coming with Turkey sooner than later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Interesting. You mentioned Russia. President -- the Trump administration imposed -- ratcheting up sanctions, this time for chemical weapons use, that nerve agent in the U.K. But here is the question, John, a lot of people are asking. The Trump administration did this. How does this mesh, fit in with the president's clear desire to have better relations with Vladimir Putin?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAY",
      "utterance": "Yes, you know, what's interesting here is that Trump's rhetoric has been conciliatory towards Putin. His policies have been very tough, I think arguably tougher than any administration we have seen. We've had five sets of sanctions this year alone. This is going to be very difficult for the Russian economy. We are already seeing the Ruble fall. We are seeing other problems with the economy and -- in Russia. And more sanctions are coming. So his policies are very tough. He's really insisting that Russia begin to change its behavior even while he, rhetorically, certainly, in Helsinki, is being very solicitous of President Putin."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "It's interesting to watch that contradiction and see how it evolves. Let's turn to Iran, the third country that has seen tougher sanctions. In this, the president is disagreeing with his European allies, who don't like the fact that the U.S. has imposed these sanctions and moved this week to try to protect its own businesses and say you can do business with Iran. But is the president winning this disagreement with the E.U. governments?"

I know they don't particularly like President Trump, but the policy is meant to create change in Iran. At the very least, we should not be funding the nefarious behaviors of Iran, whether it's supporting Hezbollah or Shiite militias in Syria or in Bashar al-Assad, supporting the Houthi rebels, continuing with missile programs. We know that Iran in various ways was violating the Iran nuclear agreement, the JCPOA. The Europeans have been trying to undermine our policies. They are not succeeding because Europe is still relatively free. The governments can -- can't tell the businesses what to do and the businesses are being told by their compliance officers and others, look, we can do business with Iran but we will cut out from the U.S. market, and the U.S. market is absolutely essential to us, the Iranian market is not. Increasingly, we are seeing European businesses saying we are going to abide by the U.S. sanctions, we don't want secondary sanctions on us and we don't want to be cut out of the market. That's very frustrating for the governments. But the governments of Europe deserve to be frustrated because they should be acting with us to curve the nefarious behaviors of Iran."

If the regime says we have to cut back on some of our overseas commitments to various terrorist groups, that's useful. If the regime says let's sit down and negotiate a better JCPOA, we have to do it, that's helpful. If nothing else, there are protests in the streets and the Iranians know who to blame. They blame their own government for the depravations they're suffering because they know that the oil wealth is being spent on Hezbollah and Hamas and Houthi rebels and others, not on them. And I expect they'll be infighting among the ruling mullahs as a result of this as well."

They are not required to just offer their platform for anyone, no matter what their views. Should they have? No. I have two reasons why. One, it is going to fuel the views among conservatives that there's a disproportionate crack-down on conservative voices. And that's going to further polarize the debate over social media and may come back and hurt these companies, who even now, Republican congressional members are gunning for them. But look, also, I think it was a problem of how they did it. The issue with Alex Jones for a lot of people is supposedly that he publishes fake news. But that's not why they removed his stuff. They did it because they said that his content was hate speech. That is a very slippery slope. And it gives these groups the ability to essentially censor the way the Senator that you mentioned at beginning was talking about, any views that they don't like under the very broad category of hate speech."

He spread falsehood about Chobani and immigrants. He was sued and he had to retract that and apologize to get a lawsuit against him dropped. He said falsehoods about the Sandy Hook massacre. I mean, if you're going to ban -- so I mean, that would be the argument they would make. But he's not a traditional conservative. And don't put us on the slippery-slope to say we are going to start banning other conservative voices. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, that is the voice -- I mean, that's the argument conservatives will make, and they should make it. I mean, you know, InfoWars, there's probably part of the population out there that is susceptible to those kinds of conspiracy theories. They have always been out there. But this is a country of 325 million people. Let's say a million people have attached themselves to InfoWars and Alex Jones. Is that a threat to the country? Well, it wasn't just Facebook and YouTube that banned him. He's now been banned by virtually all the social media platforms, LinkedIn, Pinterest. Apple has taken him off their iPod listings. The only real platform that he's on now is, indeed, Twitter. So the question is, if you sort of -- where do you draw the line? I think Chris Murphy, the Democratic Senator, in the remark at the beginning, let the cat out of the bag. People like him will push beyond Alex Jones and start including, say Rush Limbaugh, as a purveyor of hate speech. And there will be pressure on these sites to draw the line much more broadly against conservative opinions."

And they have kept the number of cab medallions artificially low to drive up the price of them and to regulate how many cabs were there. That all got blown apart when these app companies started coming in. And it has put a lot of distress on cab companies. And there has been some financial fallout. But that's called new technology.

It's a vote of no confidence in the subways, which have a huge responsibility to fix their infrastructure at enormous costs. And if people pull away from subways, they are going to erode further.

And in the past, the fear of that revolt has reined in these politicians and they have lost some of these prior battles against Uber and Lyft. They now seem to be plunging ahead anyway.

How do you avoid getting to this moment where all of the regulators are -- I should say not all. Sheila Bair was a dissenting voice at the FDIC.

And part of that is they created, in the Dodd-Frank law of 2010, essentially codification of the bailout scheme, where it's now clear in the law. And like before the crisis, that instead of protecting the bank and depositors and putting the holding company into bankruptcy where all failing firms ought to go, there's now a special place where too- big-to-fail banks go to get better treatment."
