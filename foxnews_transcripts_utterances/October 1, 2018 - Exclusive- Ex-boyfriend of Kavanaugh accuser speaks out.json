      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" coming to you from Washington tonight where we have a show full of exclusives including in his first television interview, the ex-boyfriend of Brett Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick. He says that there are major issues with her credibility and he'll detail each of them. Also, as the obsession over Kavanaugh's high school yearbook continues, what about Dr. Ford's? \"The Ingraham Angle\" got our hands on three years' worth of Holton Arms textbooks. Oh, it's fun to look through them. It is like a walk down memory lane when she was there of course. And we are going to share our findings. But first, Christine Blasey Ford's credibility gap, that is the focus of tonight's Angle. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford last week has produced a report. Her findings are fascinating and speak to Dr. Ford's credibility. Her overall appraisal, Mitchell finds the assault allegations against Kavanaugh to be weak. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in the legal context, here is her bottom line. She writes \"A he said- she said case is incredibly difficult to prove, but this case is even weaker than that. Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them. For the reasons discussed below, I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee. Nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard.\" That's a lower standard. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mitchell then offers a nine-point critique of Ford's account based on the evidence at hand. She writes \"Dr. Ford has not offered a consistent account of when the alleged assault happened.\" In her July 6th text to the \"Washington Post\" Ford said it occurred in the mid-1980s. And then she changed her story in the letter to Dianne Feinstein, where she claims it happens in the early ‘80s. But in her polygraph statement in August, Ford said the assault happened one high school summer in the ‘80s. It changes there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She explicitly crossed out the word \"early.\" Ms. Mitchell continues, saying \"Dr. Ford has struggled to identify Judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name. Dr. Ford has no memory of key details of the night in question -- details that could corroborate her account.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

If you're going to have an unsubstantiated, uncorroborated allegation after the process of confirmation has already concluded, and you're going to go before the committee, and you're going to say all this stuff, and then the media is not going to question you, I just find that to be absurd. By the way, Rachel Mitchell goes on to suggest that in her professional opinion, Ford, as I said, has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault. And so, this just keeps on shifting and shifting.

Feel free to follow there. And if you see the comments, I couldn't believe it. It was outrageous, the names that people called him, cool and the like. This is the same individual who people applauded, we're talking about folks on the left, when he said George Bush doesn't care about black people. My friend on the other side, I'm pretty sure that was great. He said it was great. He enjoyed when he said that. But the moment that you begin to think differently, and I know this as a black conservative, when the moment you begin to state things that maybe breaks or shatters groupthink and monolithic thought when it comes to being a Republican or being conservative, you are considered an outcast. And that is very problematic. And I don't see why us as a community, and it is not just the black community, it is the entire country almost at this point. You talk about the folks on the left, why is it that we are at this place when it only comes to black people? You don't hear them say that when it comes to white Americans. You don't hear that at all.",

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" coming to you from Washington tonight where we have a show full of exclusives including in his first television interview, the ex-boyfriend of Brett Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick. He says that there are major issues with her credibility and he'll detail each of them. Also, as the obsession over Kavanaugh's high school yearbook continues, what about Dr. Ford's? \"The Ingraham Angle\" got our hands on three years' worth of Holton Arms textbooks. Oh, it's fun to look through them. It is like a walk down memory lane when she was there of course. And we are going to share our findings. But first, Christine Blasey Ford's credibility gap, that is the focus of tonight's Angle. Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford last week has produced a report. Her findings are fascinating and speak to Dr. Ford's credibility. Her overall appraisal, Mitchell finds the assault allegations against Kavanaugh to be weak. And in the legal context, here is her bottom line. She writes \"A he said- she said case is incredibly difficult to prove, but this case is even weaker than that. Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them. For the reasons discussed below, I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee. Nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard.\" That's a lower standard. Mitchell then offers a nine-point critique of Ford's account based on the evidence at hand. She writes \"Dr. Ford has not offered a consistent account of when the alleged assault happened.\" In her July 6th text to the \"Washington Post\" Ford said it occurred in the mid-1980s. And then she changed her story in the letter to Dianne Feinstein, where she claims it happens in the early ‘80s. But in her polygraph statement in August, Ford said the assault happened one high school summer in the ‘80s. It changes there. She explicitly crossed out the word \"early.\" Ms. Mitchell continues, saying \"Dr. Ford has struggled to identify Judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name. Dr. Ford has no memory of key details of the night in question -- details that could corroborate her account.\""

Well, doesn't know where it was, nor how she got home or even how she arranged a ride there. All of this leads Mitchell to her next point. \"Dr. Ford's account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she identified as having attended including her lifelong boyfriend.\" Judge Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, Patrick Smythe all deny any such party ever occurred. Ford's friend, Leland Kaiser, goes further saying in a sworn statement that she had no recollection of being at a party with Kavanaugh and never knew him. Now, recall that when Dr. Ford was questioned about her really good friends testimony, she kind of threw her under the bus."

      "speaker": "MITCHELL",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So, guys, we have inconsistencies -- we have discrepancies and inconsistencies, and shades of changing the story. It goes on and on and on. Now, if the media cares to examine Kavanaugh's credibility on questions of whether he drank too much, whether he blacked out, fine, have at it, OK. Do it. But you've got to hit these other issues as well. To me, it is just fair. And that is the question of media credibility, reporter's credibility. It can't be off limits. If you're going to have an unsubstantiated, uncorroborated allegation after the process of confirmation has already concluded, and you're going to go before the committee, and you're going to say all this stuff, and then the media is not going to question you, I just find that to be absurd. By the way, Rachel Mitchell goes on to suggest that in her professional opinion, Ford, as I said, has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault. And so, this just keeps on shifting and shifting. The therapist notes indicated that four boys were in the bedroom when the assault occurred. Then Ford told the Washington Post that four boys were at the party, but only two were in the bedroom during the assault. In her testimony, she said four boys and her friend Leland were present at the party, but she couldn't recall the name of the fourth boy. No one claiming to be the fourth boy has yet to come forward. Now, perhaps the most damning of her Mitchell's critique was this one. \"Dr. Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to the allegation, and her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about her memory.\""

During her testimony, Ford couldn't remember if she gave the Washington Post a complete or partial list of her therapist notes. It's a pretty big deal -- or whether she took her polygraph the day of her grandmother's funeral. That's a pretty big day to forget. Now, none of this is of interest though as I said earlier to the media. They spent the weekend fact-checking and questioning the credibility of Judge Kavanaugh."

But when all three are called into question by a seasoned sex abuse prosecutor like Mitchell -- she's not a political actor -- isn't it time for the media to at least entertain the possibility that they may have gone too far in their coverage? And that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction, Democratic strategist and former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Richard Goodstein and former Secret Service Agent and NRA TV host Dan Bongino. So Richard, why aren't Democrats taking the report from Mitchell a little bit more seriously?"

As evidenced by the fact that when she started questioning Kavanaugh about July 1st on his calendar, man, she got cut off, right? And that was the last we have ever heard of her, when she seemed to be getting close to something that was actually fairly damning towards her. Look, the fact is, a real prosecutor would have spoken to witnesses face to face not just in that kind of perverse setting five minutes versus five. They would have gone --"

Why aren't the Democrats, journalist, for that matter, why aren't they more interested in examining the facts of this case? I understand people are emotional. Victims come at their conclusions in different ways. There is false memory syndrome, they are people who suppress memories. I get all that. However, there are real discrepancies in her own account that she has told to the \"Washington Post,\" Dianne Feinstein and to investigators. Ms. Mitchell is not a political actor. She did not come in here as a trailblazing pundit saying I want to get -- I want to get Ford or I want  exonerate Kavanaugh. So, it seems like it is way overboard on the other side.

But instead, it was held and then dropped as a political bomb right before the final vote. And I am telling you that not only victimized her again, but those of us who have been victimized by different folks in our lives, sexually, it has re-traumatized many of us. And so for folks that are watching this out in America, I guarantee you a whole bunch of people are incredibly frustrated, left, right and center, on having to go through some of these accusations in their own lives, let alone watching this woman be dragged through the mud.

It is still early, but that is not great news for her. In Missouri, Claire McCaskill is down two points in one poll. Obviously, she is the incumbent. Has been fairly popular in Missouri against Josh Hawley and is also after the Kavanaugh issue and after she came out against Judge Kavanaugh. Could this be, when it all boils down to the end of this whole saga, could this be that the year of the woman that we saw in 1982 becomes the year of the man, or the year of the women who are sick of all of these charges?

The real question is independence, which right now are split. But I think if you see an FBI investigation come back that says there's nothing there.

That actual act of violence I thought would wake up people on the left that they can have their radicalism, they can try to fundamentally transform the nation. But I thought that they would back off from their incitements to violence and their radical violent behavior. And instead what we have seen since that point is that they have actually ratcheted it up. They think it works because over many, many years, in fact, it has, not just here, but elsewhere are around the world where leftish has tried these tactics. So they are not backing off.

While the media was busying itself with analysis of the high school that Brett Kavanaugh attended, nobody seems interested in the other side of the equation, the culture at the accuser Christine Blasey Ford's high school Holton-Arms. So we got our hands on three years of Holton-Arms yearbooks, and the pages inside, there's some normal stuff. Sports and all of that stuff, pictures. But also there's like a raucous party like atmosphere. We have been talking about Kavanagh's party habits, but what do we know about Ford's partying ways? And nobody seems interested in asking this question. I think a lot of people because I've talked to some of them are afraid to say anything because then you are shaming the victim, but this is not a criminal trial.

Well, isn't that the exact opposite of what the feminist movement was all about? We're supposed to be treated as men are. Well, OK, that's fine.  Then those allegations, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  Then let's see her high school yearbook.

I think he is doing like a whole performance art on the whole monolithic entertainment industry, and they don't know what to do. Wait a second, he was cool five minutes ago.  Now he has a red hat on that says \"Make America Great Again,\" so he must be cuckoo."

      "utterance": "One of the lyrics in Kanye's songs is It was all good just a week ago. So certainly when he wrote songs and he was bold by saying Jesus walks, what I see from this whole situation is nothing less than a high-tech character assassination in public square, social media. I was completely and totally dismayed when I posted Kanye's picture with him on the jet with the \"Make America Great Again\" hat on and asked people what they thought on my Instagram @GiannoCaldwell. Feel free to follow there. And if you see the comments, I couldn't believe it. It was outrageous, the names that people called him, cool and the like. This is the same individual who people applauded, we're talking about folks on the left, when he said George Bush doesn't care about black people. My friend on the other side, I'm pretty sure that was great. He said it was great. He enjoyed when he said that. But the moment that you begin to think differently, and I know this as a black conservative, when the moment you begin to state things that maybe breaks or shatters groupthink and monolithic thought when it comes to being a Republican or being conservative, you are considered an outcast. And that is very problematic. And I don't see why us as a community, and it is not just the black community, it is the entire country almost at this point. You talk about the folks on the left, why is it that we are at this place when it only comes to black people? You don't hear them say that when it comes to white Americans. You don't hear that at all."

I want you both coming, OK, because we have to talk about this whole issue of race in America, where we are today, and I'd love to have you both on. Thanks so much. The entirety of Dr. Ford's Kavanaugh accusations relies on a single memory.  So could it be something called false memory? A psychologist joins us next with some answers."

Is it possible she created something known as a false memory?  Joining us now to explain what that means is Professor Robert Mather, an expert in experimental psychology. So professor, explain in simple terms very quickly how a false memory may be at play here."

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT MATHER, EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY EXPERT",
      "utterance": "Well, thank you for having me on, Laura. False memories are interesting. There's volumes of research that show going back to Loftus' work that you can implant memories and children such as being lost in the mall. And kind of the key to that is that the image has to have a lot of details. It has to be thought about many times over and over again. And easy to imagine. The ability heuristic allows us to kind of base our belief in the confidence of what we are retrieving on how easily we recalled it."

      "utterance": "Well, some of Elizabeth Loftus' work has demonstrated that therapy itself -- of course this is not all types of therapy, but there are some issues in therapy were false memories are recovered, and of course, they are false."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So in other words if you are in therapy, you're talking about a problem you have currently, and in her case it was with her husband, something about two doors, she wanted two doors at the front of her house.  He got really maybe upset about it. And then something did happen to her, and then she sees Brett Kavanaugh's name mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee, I mean, how does the brain work it? I know that is a big question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATHER",
      "utterance": "That's one possibility. In 1975 there was a case of a man named Donald Thompson, and he was a psychologist that actually studied memory and eyewitness testimony in Australia. And what Mr. Thompson did was he was on air giving a discussion of this when a woman was brutally raped. And she recalled seeing his picture and told the police that he was one that did it. But he had an airtight alibi and the fact that he was on television at the time of the attack."
