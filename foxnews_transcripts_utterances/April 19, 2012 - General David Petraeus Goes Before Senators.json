      "utterance": "Bret, that was a perfect example of his navigating the minefield you talked about. This was a brilliant performance by General Petraeus. Just watching some of it, you can think of what he is to Stanley McChrystal is what Eisenhower was to George Patton. And Eisenhower was very deft politically and Petraeus is deft politically. And generals like that wind up being chairman of the joints chief and sometimes president. That answer in particular, Lindsey Graham wanted him to repudiate what Vice President Biden was quoted to have been saying. He switched and said the last time I saw the president, the president said he is 100 percent behind the policy. It was very deftly done. And as Mara said, he said in July of 2011, what we do will be conditions-based. He said we have enduring commitment. Then he said we're not going to see the troops rapidly flying out the door the way Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said it would happen. He did President Obama a lot of good and himself, General Petraeus, a lot of good and established, I think, beyond any doubt not much will happen in July of next year."

I have no idea if that is true, but you could see why people would come to the conclusion. He is very deft, very skillful as a political player. But I don't think it's so easy for the president to go back on the public commitment he made to begin pull-back a year from this week."

I think when and if they start to get some success in Afghanistan, the pressure from the left will subside. The reason the war is becoming unpopular over the last couple of months is because it looked like it wasn't working. If the surge starts to work, there will less pressure to bring them home right away."

The big thing today, we see that the July, 2011 date becoming more and more meaningless, which is good, because when you have a date like that, when you set a date, which George Bush never did in Iraq, it's a bad idea.
