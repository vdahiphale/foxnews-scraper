You elected as president a fighter, a deal-maker, a disrupter. You sent a leader to the White House who is clearly unafraid to dismantle the status quo in Washington, D.C., the swamp, the sewer. And also, somebody that is now in two years, we see, he fights to keep his promises and get things done that he said he'd get done, frankly come hell or high water. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tonight, what you are witnessing is Donald Trump doing whatever it takes to fulfill his promises.

He got $1.375 billion for the wall and a bill to trip the funding for barriers on the southern border over the previous budget. And it's only seven months this budget. It killed the so-called poisoned pills like any amnesty. It's not in the bill for illegals. No pathway to citizen. No limit on ICE detention. In fact, instead of a limit, this bill funds 5,000 more beds for illegal immigrant detention. And remember, all the far left radical socialist Democrats calling for ICE to be abolished? Well, this bill actually includes a historic funding increase for ICE, including money for additional 600 highly-needed professional officers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, still, you heard the president.

The president can use the $1.375 billion from the budget compromise. So, progress continues for the rest of the fiscal year through October. $600 million from the Treasury Department's drug forfeiture fund, $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense's drug interdiction program.

Let's look at the U.S. code, oh, law passed by Congress signed into law. An act explicitly states, quote: construction of roads and the fences, oh, that would be a barrier, a wall, an installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States. Well, the president also has standing based on the U.S. Code. Right there you can see it, 2808. That allows construction projects for national security. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that's not even all. Since 1978, a whopping 58 national emergencies declared by president starting with Jimmy Carter. And guess what? Thirty- one those national emergency declarations are still in effect today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Former President Obama, he declared ten national emergencies, including one that countered the rise in crime from deadly Mexican cartel. Simply put, there is major, legal, legislative and constitutional precedent for this national emergency when it comes to stopping drugs, gangs, cartels, trafficking and everything else. And all the security risk to Americans at the border as a result of open border. Remember, 300 Americans are dying weekly from heroin, 90 percent of which is trafficked across the southern border. In 2017, more than 70,000 Americans died from the drug overdoses. Excuse me, is that a manufactured crisis? Last year, fentanyl trafficking across the southern border shot up a whopping 122 percent. In Arizona alone, fentanyl deaths have tripled since 2015. And sadly, drug carnage, well, that's just one part of the crisis. In just the past two years, 4,000 criminal aliens were arrested for homicide, 30,000 for sex crimes, 100,000 for violent assaults. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's a two-year period. Last year alone, 800 gang members apprehended at the border, a 50 percent increase from 2017. And today, the president had a very powerful message to one, well, fake news hack who tried to claim that this is all just a manufactured crisis, same talking point the media uses as their best friends in the Democratic Party. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

By the way, for all of you geniuses that are overpaid in the hate Trump media and kind of lazy, let me explain what I do for a living. I am a talk show host. In other words, I'm a member of the press. We are like the whole newspaper on the show. I can produce hours and hours of radio and television where I do straight news. We do tons of investigative reporting. You are too lazy to do it or too biased to do.

We put up names on the show. The manmade drought, delta smelt in California. We investigate what your kids are up to on spring break. Yes, we do investigative reporting. We do straight news as a talk show host. And also, we also did the two-year investigation into the deep state. And we have the evidence you never paid attention to about what was an attempted coup on the president of the United States where they let a candidate free in an effort to sabotage the other. And, of course, like every newspaper, yes, we also, I said, we are like the full news. We give opinion.

Two nights ago, we had on Tim Tebow.

And doing so like others so-called journalists, I used sources all the time. I work the phones daily to get information, to do reporting, investigation, so I can give my audience the best information that you guys aren't giving them. And I'll never ever, by the way, for all of you that speculate, I would never confirm, not even deny who my sources are, who I talk to, who I don't talk to or even if I talk to people alone. What you have in the media right now is obsession. They've got blinders on, and they've got this prism which they see Donald Trump. Lazy, overpaid people in the hate Trump media so blinded by their hatred and the rage for Donald Trump, they need to get their own sources of information, instead of falsely speculating about mine. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, here's a simple truth. Nobody in the media has ever, ever come close to describing the relationship that I had with the president that goes back well over two decades. And, by the way, if one exists, I wouldn't tell you anyway. All right. Now to end all fake news reports on how I accurately predicted exactly what the president would do on the border, he didn't tell me. It's simple. I paid attention to all his public comments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He said it over and over and over again.

What do you think he meant? Remember he said many times, I'm looking at the national emergency seriously. He kept saying these things repeatedly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what those of you in the fake news industry don't seem to understand, the president does listen to other points of view. Yes. But at the end of the day, it's pretty amazing all of you can't figure out that he makes up his own mind. It's not hard to understand what he is going to do because what he has been doing for the last two years, what he has been saying over in the last week is usually what he ends up doing. Now, by the way for the record, I'll say this in all honesty, if the president listened to me, he would have stopped tweeting in 2016, or at least tweeted less, because me and a bunch of other people told him well, you got to stop. I got to admit in retrospect, I actually think he was right to keep doing this, maybe 5 percent less, because what he is doing is bypassing the abusive press that has offered people that hate him every day and he is getting his message directly to the American people, which as you can see in a media landscape full of conspiracy theories, hatred, fake news is now more important than ever before. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take for example the report from \"Newsbusters\". Look at this. All the big networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, they went wild with the collusion coverage. One story that turns out to be false after another. They dedicated over 2,202 minutes of airtime, just the three networks. They aired and they found zero seconds, minutes for the available airtime when the bipartisan Senate report that found no collusion with Russia this week. They didn't cover it at all, because then they would have to admit they were wrong. And I happen to like the fighter that is in the White House. I do like the man who fights, tenacious, unrelenting and fights to keep his campaign promises. It's refreshing. It's energizing to watch him go down the list and see all the success for the forgotten men and women who voted for him in 2016. The policies he advocated for in his campaign that he is now delivering on. Well, to be very honest, I have been supporting -- these are things I publicly stated support for, most of them, for 30 years on radio, 23 years on the Fox News Channel. Why? Because conservatism works. It works every time it's applied. Just like I predicted Obama would fail. Oh, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more on poverty. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at the president's positive record-breaking results on the economy alone. New trade policies. We are making more money. More opportunities for Americans, 600,000 manufacturing jobs, 5.3 million new jobs. Yes, I like those policies. And it's worth fighting for those policies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right.

Now, last night we laid out the entire case. 2016, small group, high ranking, unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, they abuse their power in such a way to try to rig the 2016 election in favor of one candidate, Hillary Clinton, over another candidate Donald Trump. They allowed their chosen candidate Hillary Clinton to stay in the race by clearing her of all charges before they even investigated it. Well, things that no other American could ever get away with. Trust me. We have subpoenaed e-mails, don't delete them, you better not acid wash your hard drive and bust up your devices. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, in July of 2016, Comey, Strzok -- Strzok interviewed Hillary. He's the guy that said we're smelly Walmart voters. He's the guy that said Hillary should win 100 million to 0. Anyway, Comey and Strzok and others, they decided to give her a pass. The fix was in. And they didn't prosecute Clinton for what were obvious felony violations of the Espionage Act, including mishandling top secret, classified intelligence on that unsecure private server at a mom and pop shop bathroom closet. They also chose not to prosecute her over the biggest slam dunk obstruction of justice charges when she deleted, acid washed thousands of subpoenaed e- mails with the bleach bit and beat up her phone with a hammer and ripped out SIM cards. Any other American would have been tried, and they would have been charged with felonies, but not Hillary Clinton. That's what they did as they abuse power. And then also in July of 2016, right after they give her that free pass, that keeps her in the presidential election, the same exact people then use Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for phony Russian dirty dossier to open up an investigation into the Trump campaign. They used the same unverified garbage, oh, to spy on a Trump campaign associate and they were all warned it was unverified, and that Hillary Clinton paid for it. And it was never corroborated or verified and that Steele hated Hillary Clinton. By the way, a lot of it has since been debunked. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Those known lies were used to repeatedly, four separate occasions, commit fraud on FISA courts, and literally deny a fellow American of their constitutional rights. And then they used it later, remember? The insurance policy to illegally attempt a coup, again, using the Russian lies. They knew they were Russian lies. They were briefed that they were Russian lies to unseat the president that they didn't like. The candidate they didn't like, the one who had smelly Walmart voters following him. After months' long investigation, meaning almost nine months, Lisa Page, and James Comey, others, they even admitted, there is no evidence of the Trump-Russia collusion. But that doesn't stop the same group of the unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats from plotting to remove a duly elected president from office. Watch this.",

Now, just this week, Amazon announced that it is canceling plans for its New York City expansion following attacks from leftist, extremists, progressives, and lawmakers like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now, dealing an embarrassing blow to Governor Andrew Cuomo and Comrade Mayor Bill de Blasio, well, now the move would have brought 25,000 jobs to the city. Reported average salary, $150,000. But they would have paid $3 billion in tax breaks for it. The Congresswoman praised the exit, writing, \"Everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed,\" prompting Amazon to fire back accusing her of being \"Never Amazon.\" OK. Adding that the company doesn't want to \"work in this environment in the long-term.\" To be fair to the Congresswoman, she does have one point. Why are they paying just one company? Not every business in New York. Why does one company get $3 billion in tax breaks and grants? Every other business gets nothing. And by the way, for the last two years, Amazon has paid zero in federal income taxes. Now, we should all want a lot more equal playing field. Maybe they'll think in New York, let's cut everybody's taxes. But maybe that would foster competition, innovation, invite a business-friendly environment. Is this a loss of jobs opportunity? And - but is this really something to celebrate? And by the way, now she is calling on that $3 billion to be spent on teachers and the subway. However, she didn't figure out the $3 billion in incentives was based on the job creation. So there's not a pot of gold out there to be spent. To have more tax revenue, you actually need people paying taxes. So it looks like all of this may have set off a war within the Democratic Party. Governor Cuomo accusing New York Democrats of \"putting their own political interest above their community.\" Although Governor Cuomo, you've done the same thing. He has been banning fracking of natural gas that would create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in Upstate New York.

      "utterance": "Welcome to “Hannity” on a busy news Friday. We're going to have a live report on terrible shooting outside of Chicago. Our thoughts and prayers especially to those who have been victims, including four police officers. But first, in 2016, you, the American people, you made history. You elected as president a fighter, a deal-maker, a disrupter. You sent a leader to the White House who is clearly unafraid to dismantle the status quo in Washington, D.C., the swamp, the sewer. And also, somebody that is now in two years, we see, he fights to keep his promises and get things done that he said he'd get done, frankly come hell or high water. Tonight, what you are witnessing is Donald Trump doing whatever it takes to fulfill his promises. More importantly, this is about protecting the lives of the American people and securing the country and our borders. Many lawmakers, especially the Democrats, ignored the crisis at the southern border. They say it's manufactured. One month ago, Speaker Pelosi vowed that Congress wouldn't spend more than $1 on a border wall. It's immoral. But turns out, she's a little off. Take a look."

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "I went through Congress. I made a deal. I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn't supposed to get one dollar. Not one dollar. He is not going to get one dollar. Well, I got $1.4 billion. I'm not happy with it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Nor am I. But the president is right. He got $1.375 billion for the wall and a bill to trip the funding for barriers on the southern border over the previous budget. And it's only seven months this budget. It killed the so-called poisoned pills like any amnesty. It's not in the bill for illegals. No pathway to citizen. No limit on ICE detention. In fact, instead of a limit, this bill funds 5,000 more beds for illegal immigrant detention. And remember, all the far left radical socialist Democrats calling for ICE to be abolished? Well, this bill actually includes a historic funding increase for ICE, including money for additional 600 highly-needed professional officers. Now, still, you heard the president. He is not happy. Nor should anybody be happy, because $1.375 billion for a wall is not enough. It's why I have called this bill garbage from the beginning and why the president is now officially as of today declaring the national emergency that he's been telegraphing to the world he is going to do. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "So I'm going to be signing a national emergency. What we want to do is simple. It's not complicated. It's simple. We want to stop drugs from coming into our country. We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming in our country. It's an invasion. We have invasion of drugs and the criminals coming into our country that we stop but it's very hard to stop. With a wall, it would be very easy. So, I think that we will be very successful in court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I believe that as well. Let's break down exactly what this means. As the president declares a national emergency, the administration will gain access to $8 billion. The president can use the $1.375 billion from the budget compromise. So, progress continues for the rest of the fiscal year through October. $600 million from the Treasury Department's drug forfeiture fund, $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense's drug interdiction program. An additional $3.6 billion from the Department of Defense's military construction account. And he knows the Democrats, as we predicted, they're going to go judge- shopping. They're going to challenge this constitutional executive action in court. But their efforts ultimately, they will come up short. One constitutional scholar after another agrees with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "The president is standing on firm legal ground. Let's look at the U.S. code, oh, law passed by Congress signed into law. An act explicitly states, quote",
      "utterance": "construction of roads and the fences, oh, that would be a barrier, a wall, an installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States. Well, the president also has standing based on the U.S. Code. Right there you can see it, 2808. That allows construction projects for national security. And that's not even all. Since 1978, a whopping 58 national emergencies declared by president starting with Jimmy Carter. And guess what? Thirty- one those national emergency declarations are still in effect today. Former President Obama, he declared ten national emergencies, including one that countered the rise in crime from deadly Mexican cartel. Simply put, there is major, legal, legislative and constitutional precedent for this national emergency when it comes to stopping drugs, gangs, cartels, trafficking and everything else. And all the security risk to Americans at the border as a result of open border. Remember, 300 Americans are dying weekly from heroin, 90 percent of which is trafficked across the southern border. In 2017, more than 70,000 Americans died from the drug overdoses. Excuse me, is that a manufactured crisis? Last year, fentanyl trafficking across the southern border shot up a whopping 122 percent. In Arizona alone, fentanyl deaths have tripled since 2015. And sadly, drug carnage, well, that's just one part of the crisis. In just the past two years, 4,000 criminal aliens were arrested for homicide, 30,000 for sex crimes, 100,000 for violent assaults. That's a two-year period. Last year alone, 800 gang members apprehended at the border, a 50 percent increase from 2017. And today, the president had a very powerful message to one, well, fake news hack who tried to claim that this is all just a manufactured crisis, same talking point the media uses as their best friends in the Democratic Party. Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Let me say up front: the president nor anybody in the White House ever called to calm me down -- whatever that means. I also say this: With all due respect to all of you guys over there it's cracking me up. I'm thrilled with it, because I have been calling for secure borders and build the wall first for a long time. By the way, for all of you geniuses that are overpaid in the hate Trump media and kind of lazy, let me explain what I do for a living. I am a talk show host. In other words, I'm a member of the press. We are like the whole newspaper on the show. I can produce hours and hours of radio and television where I do straight news. We do tons of investigative reporting. You are too lazy to do it or too biased to do. Remember, we're the only show -- one of the only shows that vetted Obama, Frank Marshall Davis and ACORN and Alinsky and, oh, yes, let's not forget the church of the J.D. America and the black liberation theology. Remember our coverage of Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn? Remember all of that? We also had serious investigations on this program into the Duke Lacrosse scandal. I actually met with some of the kids and the families. Baltimore, Maryland, we were right. You all in the media were wrong. UVA, Richard Jewell, the scourge of the gang violence in Chicago. We put up names on the show. The manmade drought, delta smelt in California. We investigate what your kids are up to on spring break. Yes, we do investigative reporting. We do straight news as a talk show host. And also, we also did the two-year investigation into the deep state. And we have the evidence you never paid attention to about what was an attempted coup on the president of the United States where they let a candidate free in an effort to sabotage the other. And, of course, like every newspaper, yes, we also, I said, we are like the full news. We give opinion. I don't hide that I am a registered conservative. We even do gossip occasionally in sports. Two nights ago, we had on Tim Tebow. You see, our First Amendment freedom of the press, well, part of the free press you can be a talk show host and do all of those things. It covers many different and unique roles for the press. And doing so like others so-called journalists, I used sources all the time. I work the phones daily to get information, to do reporting, investigation, so I can give my audience the best information that you guys aren't giving them. And I'll never ever, by the way, for all of you that speculate, I would never confirm, not even deny who my sources are, who I talk to, who I don't talk to or even if I talk to people alone. What you have in the media right now is obsession. They've got blinders on, and they've got this prism which they see Donald Trump. Lazy, overpaid people in the hate Trump media so blinded by their hatred and the rage for Donald Trump, they need to get their own sources of information, instead of falsely speculating about mine. Now, here's a simple truth. Nobody in the media has ever, ever come close to describing the relationship that I had with the president that goes back well over two decades. And, by the way, if one exists, I wouldn't tell you anyway. All right. Now to end all fake news reports on how I accurately predicted exactly what the president would do on the border, he didn't tell me. It's simple. I paid attention to all his public comments. He said it over and over and over again. I heard him. You refused to hear him. Remember when he said, I will add whatever I have to add. What do you think he meant? Remember he said many times, I'm looking at the national emergency seriously. He kept saying these things repeatedly. And what those of you in the fake news industry don't seem to understand, the president does listen to other points of view. Yes. But at the end of the day, it's pretty amazing all of you can't figure out that he makes up his own mind. It's not hard to understand what he is going to do because what he has been doing for the last two years, what he has been saying over in the last week is usually what he ends up doing. Now, by the way for the record, I'll say this in all honesty, if the president listened to me, he would have stopped tweeting in 2016, or at least tweeted less, because me and a bunch of other people told him well, you got to stop. I got to admit in retrospect, I actually think he was right to keep doing this, maybe 5 percent less, because what he is doing is bypassing the abusive press that has offered people that hate him every day and he is getting his message directly to the American people, which as you can see in a media landscape full of conspiracy theories, hatred, fake news is now more important than ever before. Take for example the report from \"Newsbusters\". Look at this. All the big networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, they went wild with the collusion coverage. One story that turns out to be false after another. They dedicated over 2,202 minutes of airtime, just the three networks. They aired and they found zero seconds, minutes for the available airtime when the bipartisan Senate report that found no collusion with Russia this week. They didn't cover it at all, because then they would have to admit they were wrong. And I happen to like the fighter that is in the White House. I do like the man who fights, tenacious, unrelenting and fights to keep his campaign promises. It's refreshing. It's energizing to watch him go down the list and see all the success for the forgotten men and women who voted for him in 2016. The policies he advocated for in his campaign that he is now delivering on. Well, to be very honest, I have been supporting -- these are things I publicly stated support for, most of them, for 30 years on radio, 23 years on the Fox News Channel. Why? Because conservatism works. It works every time it's applied. Just like I predicted Obama would fail. Oh, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more on poverty. Look at the president's positive record-breaking results on the economy alone. New trade policies. We are making more money. More opportunities for Americans, 600,000 manufacturing jobs, 5.3 million new jobs. Yes, I like those policies. And it's worth fighting for those policies. All right. We'll have more on this later, but first, we have to turn to our HANNITY watch on the deep state in light of yesterday's big news. Huge bombshell revelation surrounding disgrace, fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Now, last night we laid out the entire case. 2016, small group, high ranking, unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, they abuse their power in such a way to try to rig the 2016 election in favor of one candidate, Hillary Clinton, over another candidate Donald Trump. They allowed their chosen candidate Hillary Clinton to stay in the race by clearing her of all charges before they even investigated it. Well, things that no other American could ever get away with. Trust me. We have subpoenaed e-mails, don't delete them, you better not acid wash your hard drive and bust up your devices. Now, in July of 2016, Comey, Strzok -- Strzok interviewed Hillary. He's the guy that said we're smelly Walmart voters. He's the guy that said Hillary should win 100 million to 0. Anyway, Comey and Strzok and others, they decided to give her a pass. The fix was in. And they didn't prosecute Clinton for what were obvious felony violations of the Espionage Act, including mishandling top secret, classified intelligence on that unsecure private server at a mom and pop shop bathroom closet. They also chose not to prosecute her over the biggest slam dunk obstruction of justice charges when she deleted, acid washed thousands of subpoenaed e- mails with the bleach bit and beat up her phone with a hammer and ripped out SIM cards. Any other American would have been tried, and they would have been charged with felonies, but not Hillary Clinton. That's what they did as they abuse power. And then also in July of 2016, right after they give her that free pass, that keeps her in the presidential election, the same exact people then use Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for phony Russian dirty dossier to open up an investigation into the Trump campaign. They used the same unverified garbage, oh, to spy on a Trump campaign associate and they were all warned it was unverified, and that Hillary Clinton paid for it. And it was never corroborated or verified and that Steele hated Hillary Clinton. By the way, a lot of it has since been debunked. Those known lies were used to repeatedly, four separate occasions, commit fraud on FISA courts, and literally deny a fellow American of their constitutional rights. And then they used it later, remember? The insurance policy to illegally attempt a coup, again, using the Russian lies. They knew they were Russian lies. They were briefed that they were Russian lies to unseat the president that they didn't like. The candidate they didn't like, the one who had smelly Walmart voters following him. After months' long investigation, meaning almost nine months, Lisa Page, and James Comey, others, they even admitted, there is no evidence of the Trump-Russia collusion. But that doesn't stop the same group of the unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats from plotting to remove a duly elected president from office. Watch this."

McCabe's spokeswoman today denied this report, but we'll have to wait and see. Joining us now with reaction, Alan Dershowitz, professor at Harvard. He wrote the introduction to a new book featuring the text of the Constitution, which I wish some people would read in Congress, and the Declaration of Independence. And we're also joined by former Clinton pollster and adviser, Mark Penn. You know, it's interesting, both of you take heat for being on this show. Both of you take heat for being intellectually consistent and honest. I'm looking at -- I have never seen a case where one candidate was favored over another, and they ignored the other Russia stuff between Uranium One and Russian dossier, the Espionage Act, and deleting subpoenaed emails, and then bludgeoned a sitting president, before and after, with a dossier paid for by the opposition party, Mark Penn, and never verified.

They jumped to take this investigation and make sure that they would continue to control it and put it in the hands of their friends.

And he is suggesting using the 25th amendment that was written to take care of a problem of Woodrow Wilson having a stroke or President Reagan being shot and being on the operating table. These guys are watching House of Cards instead of reading the constitution. The constitution is as clear as it can be. The 25th amendment is applicable only if you are incapacitated. It's not a substitute for impeachment. It's not a substitute for an election. And if Rod Rosenstein actually thought about and suggested wiring the President, invoking the 25th amendment, he should be fired before he has an opportunity to resign. He should be disgraced. The Inspector General, the Justice Department should be looking into it. This is as close as this country has ever come to the consideration of a coup d',tat, a constitutionally unlawful coup d',tat against a duty elected President. Whether you like him or not, whether you voted against him as I did or not, the constitution has to prevail. The 25th amendment has to mean what it says.

Now, dealing an embarrassing blow to Governor Andrew Cuomo and Comrade Mayor Bill de Blasio, well, now the move would have brought 25,000 jobs to the city. Reported average salary, $150,000. But they would have paid $3 billion in tax breaks for it. The Congresswoman praised the exit, writing, \"Everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed,\" prompting Amazon to fire back accusing her of being \"Never Amazon.\" OK. Adding that the company doesn't want to \"work in this environment in the long-term.\" To be fair to the Congresswoman, she does have one point. Why are they paying just one company? Not every business in New York. Why does one company get $3 billion in tax breaks and grants? Every other business gets nothing. And by the way, for the last two years, Amazon has paid zero in federal income taxes. Now, we should all want a lot more equal playing field. Maybe they'll think in New York, let's cut everybody's taxes. But maybe that would foster competition, innovation, invite a business-friendly environment. Is this a loss of jobs opportunity? And - but is this really something to celebrate? And by the way, now she is calling on that $3 billion to be spent on teachers and the subway. However, she didn't figure out the $3 billion in incentives was based on the job creation. So there's not a pot of gold out there to be spent. To have more tax revenue, you actually need people paying taxes. So it looks like all of this may have set off a war within the Democratic Party. Governor Cuomo accusing New York Democrats of \"putting their own political interest above their community.\" Although Governor Cuomo, you've done the same thing. He has been banning fracking of natural gas that would create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in Upstate New York. Think of the revenue that he's losing there, to tap in this vast resource that we have. Even Comrade de Blasio told local media that he'd take on any progressive who thinks it's a good idea to lose jobs and revenue. Now The New York Times writes that \"The Amazon fight has exposed deep fissures within the Democratic Party,\" so much so that even conspiracy theory TV MSNBC are actually sounding the alarm. They're not liking the fighting. Watch this."

      "utterance": "Now, this fits exactly with what I've been saying. The Democratic Party has now been taken over by a new radical, extreme Democratic socialist wing. And that's what they want. And don't forget, by the way, about Ocasio-Cortez. In her particular case, the New Green Deal. That's going to destroy the life blood of our economy. Abolish ICE, an agency which captures criminals and human traffickers. And by the way, free handouts, free education, free college, free healthcare, free retirement, whether you're willing or unwilling to work. Everything is free, and a 70 marginal tax rate to boot. To the Congresswoman's credit, she is the new leader of the Democratic Party. Congratulations, Congresswoman. 2020 Democrats are all signing on to a lot of what she is selling. They're sending the message loud and clear this radicalism is here to stay. All right. Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor, former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. By the way, new podcaster himself, it's called Newt's World. And by the way, Jesse is not going to like that. And it's available on Apple Podcast and anywhere you go for your podcast. Look, I have a lot of questions for you, but the one thing about New York is they have made it impossible for any business. I got to know Bobby Jindal, Rick Scott and Rick Perry so well because they constantly came up to New York to visit companies and steal them. And they did so. And New York is losing tens and tens of thousands of people every year like California and Illinois and New Jersey. Meanwhile, Texas and Florida gaining nearly 400,000 new people moving in every year."

Everything is paid for. Free healthcare, but you can't have private insurance. Free housing. No economic - it's an environment free of monopolies. In other words, takeover of industry.
