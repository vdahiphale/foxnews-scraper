Take a listen to some Sanders folks. We have not heard from Senator Sanders. He has been asked about it, he hasn't answered the question. But others around him have talked about it."

      "utterance": "Yes. And I know that Hillary Clinton, her allies, are furious at this. And colleagues of mine have reported being inundated by texts and emails. It's just anger roaring out from that world, and feeling particularly on a week where Democrats had it going pretty good. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates are indicted and George Papadopoulos signs a plea agreement that, to Democrats' eyes, really propels this narrative of potential collusion with Russia forward. And in general Democrats were relishing what appeared to be civil war in the Republican Party. When you talk about intraparty fighting, we are all talking about Steve Bannon going after incumbent numbers of Congress. Now suddenly we are all reminded of the fact that the Democratic wounds are extremely raw, that the Bernie Sanders crowd never got over the primaries, and indeed believe that Bernie could've beaten Donald Trump, that only Hillary Clinton could've lost to Donald Trump. That's the view among many hardcore liberals. So absolutely a rough turn events for the party."

      "utterance": "Exactly. This was Donna Brazile shoving the Clintons out the door. There has been talk about a changing of the guard. There's been challenges to Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leadership. But this was pretty dramatic. We haven't seen anything like this in some time. Donna Brazile is going to sell a lot of books. That was her intent. But it was also just a real indictment of the Democratic structure. One of the other things that Bernie said when the case was rigged against him was the super delegates. We may see now a push for Democrats to reform the process. So the super delegates, which lined up in favor of Hillary Clinton and really helped propel her to the nomination, that might be up for grabs in the coming years."

The swamp does not want any of this exposed, and yet here comes Donna Brazile. You swamp creatures had better understand something, this is why Trump is president. This is why Trump was elected. He simply is reflecting the thinking of millions of Americans what is going on."

      "utterance": "I do think that -- look, the Clintons basically starved, they took the oxygen out of the Democratic room. They starved challengers in the crib. They did something to make sure that they really weren't challenged. In 2016, look at the Democrats who ran. You had one 74-year-old man who didn't have anything to lose, you had Martin O'Malley, the only guy in the real sweet spot for a president who just went absolutely nowhere. A lot of the talent in the Democratic Party stayed out of the race because they were intimidated by the Clinton machine. And I think Limbaugh is right that what you see now is the Clintons are weak enough to be attacked."

She was a party establishment mainstay and had spent years defending the Clintons. But this is a sign that the page has turned and people are casting their lot with where they see the future of the party. And increasingly I think it is the party's liberal wing."

Let's go FBI and Justice Department.\" A bit of cheerleading on the sidelines. Pocahontas of course is Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, and that is the president's name for her."

It's ironic because I just received an email earlier and I'm sure everyone did as well, that there is a series of events now celebrating the 25th anniversary of Bill Clinton's election in 1992. They're going to be taking place all around town. So it's sort of an ironic capstone to the Clinton era. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
