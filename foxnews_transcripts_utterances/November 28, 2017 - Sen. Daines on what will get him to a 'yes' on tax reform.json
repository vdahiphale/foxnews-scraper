And if we're not OK with that, then we have figure out something to do about it. My proposal is simply that the president of the United States should stop the North's nuclear and ballistic missile testing by declaring that, henceforth, the United States is going to enforce a ballistic missile no- fly zone over North Korea and a nuclear no-test zone. And that anytime the North Koreans attempted to launch a ballistic missile, we're going to take it out. We might take it out with our missile defenses, we might take it out on the ground. If they try to take a nuclear test, we're going to take out. And he should give them assurances that it'll be a limited strike just like the strike in Syria was when these Syrians violated the Obama red line and used chemical weapons. He just took out the base, but he didn't overthrow them. And give then that assurance that if they don't retaliate, that will be it.

First, the ballistic missile technology that they need is already there. I don't buy what Trace said about them nothing having re-entry -- look, it's a ceramic for God's sake. Ceramic isn't that difficult, so I think we have to assume that they can mount something on a rocket. With that said, I disagree that hitting one of these in orbit is going to cause all sorts of radioactive fallout; it's going to be minimal especially when you consider re-entry. So -- but, we're not there yet technically. So, Marc -- what Marc's saying may have merit, but we can't do it. We've got to make sure that if we decide to go down that path, we have to do something called \"brilliant pebbles\", which I've talked to a number of members of Congress about -- both Democrat and Republican. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, Hawaii is not simply preparing doing response drills, they're actually putting more things in place. I don't want to get into great detail, but there are things being done to protect Hawaii and our coast. But we've got to be very clear on this. If we decide to take the policy like Marc is saying, we have to be able to back it up. There has to be a clear and concise penalty that we can enforce. So, I don't believe it would be as catastrophic, but then again, I don't think we can do it at this point.

The president on Capitol Hill today going behind closed doors for lunch with Senate Republicans. Senator Ron Johnson, for example, telling his own Neil (INAUDIBLE) that it was the president's personal attention that got him to \"yes\". Significant, because Johnson was one of 12 Republicans who voted to move the bill out of the Senate Budget Committee along party lines.

There is also growing pressure for Congress to amass the members responsible for more than $17 million in payouts over the last 20 years by the Congressional Office of Compliance.

The missile also landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone -- meaning, it violated United Nations' resolutions, put ships in danger and infuriated the Japanese prime minister. But aside from that, this story is not about distance, it's about trajectory. South Korea intelligence says the ICBM flew 2800 miles up in space, that is 10-times higher than the international space station; it flew for 50 minutes. And experts say, if it was fired on a normal flat-line trajectory, it could have traveled nearly 8000 miles hitting anywhere on the mainland U.S. The question now is whether North Korea also has the technology to attach a nuclear warhead to the missile and allow to survive re-entry into the Earth atmosphere. South Korea says the North does not yet have a heat shield able to protect the warhead. Earlier this month during his trip to Asia, President Trump warned North Korea \"not to try us.\" And today he said this, watch."

Tony Shaffer, a CIA Trained Intel Operative and Senior Fellow at the London Center for Policy Research. So, gentlemen, thank you. Great to have all of you with us tonight.

My proposal is simply that the president of the United States should stop the North's nuclear and ballistic missile testing by declaring that, henceforth, the United States is going to enforce a ballistic missile no- fly zone over North Korea and a nuclear no-test zone. And that anytime the North Koreans attempted to launch a ballistic missile, we're going to take it out. We might take it out with our missile defenses, we might take it out on the ground. If they try to take a nuclear test, we're going to take out. And he should give them assurances that it'll be a limited strike just like the strike in Syria was when these Syrians violated the Obama red line and used chemical weapons. He just took out the base, but he didn't overthrow them. And give then that assurance that if they don't retaliate, that will be it. But we can stop their testing, and I doubt that they would respond."

I give Marc a lot of credit, and read a lot of the stuff, and I, you know, agree with a lot of the many things but not this. The reason being is -- let me pose a scenario: let's say the North Korea decide, for whatever reason, to test a nuclear weapon. And, you know, they test the weapon, it goes off and then we fire a Tomahawk missile into that testing range. You know what can happen? That testing range could implode and we could end up having radioactive fallout going through Seoul or Tokyo. We're talking about 25 million people in Seoul, another 35 million in Tokyo. So, you know what I'd advocate? Let's keep the Trump approach going on North Korea. Let's continue containment, let's ratchet the sanctions up, and let's push North Korea to economic collapse but let's not start opening up what could be the ultimate beehive. You know, I just don't think that's the right way to go in this scenario."

And once they have that, really, nobody's going to be able to bother them in any way. So, that's clearly their goal, right?"

      "speaker": "LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, CIA TRAINED INTEL OPERATIVE AND SENIOR FELLOW AT THE LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, good. Yes, I agree. I don't agree with both of you completely, but let me tell you, kind of, why I don't. First, the ballistic missile technology that they need is already there. I don't buy what Trace said about them nothing having re-entry -- look, it's a ceramic for God's sake. Ceramic isn't that difficult, so I think we have to assume that they can mount something on a rocket. With that said, I disagree that hitting one of these in orbit is going to cause all sorts of radioactive fallout; it's going to be minimal especially when you consider re-entry. So -- but, we're not there yet technically. So, Marc -- what Marc's saying may have merit, but we can't do it. We've got to make sure that if we decide to go down that path, we have to do something called \"brilliant pebbles\", which I've talked to a number of members of Congress about -- both Democrat and Republican. And by the way, Hawaii is not simply preparing doing response drills, they're actually putting more things in place. I don't want to get into great detail, but there are things being done to protect Hawaii and our coast. But we've got to be very clear on this. If we decide to take the policy like Marc is saying, we have to be able to back it up. There has to be a clear and concise penalty that we can enforce. So, I don't believe it would be as catastrophic, but then again, I don't think we can do it at this point. So, we are left with working with the Trump policy."

So, what's clear here is that diplomacy is not going to work. So, we need some sort of -- some sort of coercion to get them to do it. I agree with Col. Shaffer that our ballistic missile technology isn't where it ought to be because, for the last three decades, the Democrat is busy gutting ballistic defense --"

We need to leverage China in such a way to make them accountable because we're here -- not only because of the bad policies of the past two White Houses of not developing counter technology but because the North Koreans have been allowed to do this by the Chinese. I would argue, Martha, we got to go after the Chinese and threaten their most favorite nation trade status as something that they must be afraid that will enforce and, you know, they can do it."

Despite all of the naysayers, President Trump is inching towards a major victory on tax cuts after putting his own personal deal-making skills to the test. The president on Capitol Hill today going behind closed doors for lunch with Senate Republicans. Senator Ron Johnson, for example, telling his own Neil (INAUDIBLE) that it was the president's personal attention that got him to \"yes\". Significant, because Johnson was one of 12 Republicans who voted to move the bill out of the Senate Budget Committee along party lines. He -- this Wisconsin Republican had warned: he was leaning towards \"no\" unless taxes get lowered on so-called \"pass-through businesses.\" The president promised him he'll fix that. On the hill, the president also met with Lindsey Graham, Lamar Alexander, and Susan Collins. That appears now to be moving Collins toward \"yes\" on tax cuts because the president personal agreed to support controversial subsidies on Obamacare that could help stabilize help premiums if this tax bill repeals the individual mandate."

I don't see a deal.\" Well, that lead Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to boycott the White House meeting charging that the president is pushing the country toward a government shutdown. The president fired back by holding the White House meeting anyway.

And we're seeing the stock markets continue to see records are setting records in anticipation, in a great part of what we're going to do here in Capitol Hill as it relates to tax cuts. It's been a productive day. The president did a great job today coming to the Hill. It's just nice to have a president who comes here regularly, often. The vice president comes often as well direct engagement with the executive branch to talk about what is going to take here to get the United States Senate on board and to pass these tax cut. We moved a long way today. In active discussions with the finance committee, with our leadership, with the White House. And I can tell you, I think there's a lot of optimism right now.

So, all of this, as we're learning that just a short time ago, that meeting has been underway and they're discussing, you know, whether or not he will be going to resign, excuse me, and whether, you know, obviously, that would be a stunning blow to his legacy and the enormous time he has spent on Capitol Hill. So, all of this as a backdrop as we have learned perhaps more than ever that we wanted to know about the way that things actually work in Congress when it is as its worst. It appears to be a place where some manage to work forever and to have their messes cleaned up by taxpayers. A point illustrated by the Democratic Congressman Raul Grijalva. He is from Arizona. He's been embroiled in a settlement controversy of his own. He says that Conyers must go, but he says that settlements with employees that are paid by taxpayer dollars, that is simply something that happens all the time. Listen."

And you know, just to be clear here, this has nothing to do with sexual harassment, but it is yet one more example of how taxpayer dollars are perhaps being used to hide bad behavior right here on Capitol Hill. Now the Washington Times broke this latest story. They're saying that back in 2015, a staffer for Congressman Raul Grijalva threatened a lawsuit claiming that the Arizona Democrat was frequently drunk on the job creating a hostile work environment. Grijalva is acknowledging the payment but said that he did nothing wrong and is now demanding an apology from the paper. He claims that quote, the severance fund came out of my committee operating budget. Every step of the process was handled ethically and appropriately. But the fact remains that there was a $48,000 settlement paid for by taxpayer dollars. And this is of course the second House Democrat in what-- less than a week to be outed in this growing scandal over Congress' secret system for settling work place misconduct complaints. The other, of course Congressman John Conyers and we now know that he paid about $27,000 to settle a sexual harassment complaint. And a second -- second accuser came forward just today. And there are mounting calls for him to resign including from members of his own Congressional Black Caucus. There is also growing pressure for Congress to amass the members responsible for more than $17 million in payouts over the last 20 years by the Congressional Office of Compliance. Now there have been bills that have been introduced that would do just that. They have a long way to go. But, Martha, make no mistake, those bill are making some members of Congress very nervous."

And taxpayers who are a party to this entire process are told to keep our noses put of it. So yes, John Conyers needs to go. Congressman Grijalva needs to go. These individuals are supposed to be trusted with the power of the purse. We need the people invest our trust in them. And they have proven to be unworthy of that responsibility and that trust. And the same standard should apply. And here we have a money trail. So yes, the same standard applies if they got to go. They have to go.

      "utterance": "The 46-year-old Libyan Abu Khatallah was found guilty of supporting and participating in the 2012 attacks. At the State Department and Benghazi compound in the nearby CIA post. Khatallah was also convicted on weapons charges and the destruction of U.S. government property but he was found not guilty on the most serious crime, the murder of four Americans. The defense argued Khatallah was a peripheral player and that he arrived at the scene after the attack -- a claim that seemed to be backed up by security camera video evidence. The defense highlighted the government's reliance on a paid informant who received a $7 million reward for tracking down the suspect and providing testimony against him. In a message to the CIA workforce director Mike Pompeo called the verdict a small measure of justice for the terror Khatallah inflicted upon the patriotic men and women stationed in Benghazi. And he met no term in prison while bringing back our people. Khatallah is not eligible for the death penalty but could get length sentence, even life in prison for a prosecutor say the case shows the challenges of bringing terrorism cases in the federal courts. Martha."

The agency under Mike Pompeo's captain just pointed out -- issued a statement earlier today and here's a bit more of that. Mike Pompeo said this, we lost two of our own that night, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods who ran to the sound of the guns and bravely fought to protect Americans, and the two U.S. facilities that were attacked. His father Charles Woods joins me now via Skype. Mr. Woods, thank you very much for joining us on this story tonight. You reaction today when you heard this news?"

Speaking as a retired attorney, if you have a bank robber who is driving the get away car, he is just as responsible for murder as his accomplice that goes into the bank and pulls the trigger. For that reason, Khatallah should have been convicted of murder as well as being an accessory."

Were you surprised at the outcome today?"

    {
      "speaker": "WOODS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I am. Like I say, an accessory to a murder is guilty of murder legally just as much as the person who pulls the trigger. And for that reason, you know, this definitely should be appealed. The other thing that really bothered me about this case from the beginning was the previous administration granted this foreign terrorist, American Constitutional Rights and that should not have happened. The previous administration, they were known for taking away from American citizens our Constitutional Rights, our due process rights, First Amendment Rights, Second Amendment Rights, yet they was willing to give Constitutional Rights to terrorists who committed murder of American citizens outside of the United States, give it them -- tried and convicted in the military process--"

And she mentioned at that time the same thing that we are going to arrest the video maker who is responsible for the death of your son. And this was totally contrary to what she told her daughter just a few hours before that and also what she told the prime minister of Egypt who -- she said this was a terrorist attack but had nothing to do with the videos. So this was inconsistencies as what pops through my mind. Well as American citizens, we need to know the truth, so that when we vote, we can make intelligent choices."

They're deciding his future. They did not though-- we can tell you, ask him to step down or resign at this point. So more on that as we get it. There is a new religious freedom brewing. The Catholic Church in D.C. just sued the D.C. metro system by rejecting their advertisement which they paid for and wasted to put on the sides of buses. It features men under a starry night and a simple slogan, find the perfect gift, the post it to a website. A transit authority spokesperson said the ad in question was declined because it is prohibited by the transit folks and their current advertising guidelines. So is that a valid argument? Here now and here we go again, George Washington University Law Professor, Jonathan Turley. You know, it's always interesting to look at the arguments needed in these cases. It's really freedom of speech versus freedom of religion essentially, right?"

      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW",
      "utterance": "It is. And the transit has a long and checkered history with regard to censoring certain messages. You know they adopted what they say was a content neutral system of rules, in 2015 after losing a series of cases where they picked and choose between different messages. This is a little better. There are no guidelines showing how they choose between these. They talk about barring viewpoints on which there are differing opinions. There are different opinions between one percent and two percent milk. I mean it's hard to, you know, have that as a standard, and so you have to serve in people and groups. So in the Catholic Church, conservative Ianopolis, they took his book advertisement and just showed his picture and a book. But they sell other books. And someone is sitting there at transit like Caesar is saying, you know, crucifixion freedom. And it's not working."

It's just sort of a spiritual message. You know, find the perfect gift. And they make the comparison to a yoga ad, you know, that promises you a higher form of spirituality. And I think about the atheists' billboards that I go by in my way into New York every Christmas time which basically like, Christmas is a hoax, you know."

You know, I am an old free speech nut. And my view the solution to bad speech is more speech. This whole problem started because people could not tolerate opposing views. You had pro-Israel ads and pro-Palestine ads. And both group said, we wanted the other group taken down. One approach is to say, we're going to let viewpoints be spoken and be heard. And we're not going to choose between them. But it instead they did is they said look, we really want people that are saying things for a commercial purpose. So if you say something and you are selling something, it's OK. If you something because you want to help the public, you are banned."

Thus, I consent, sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better and because I am not sure that it is not the best."
