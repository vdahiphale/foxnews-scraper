You're missing a crucial piece of information, which happens in the future, which we don't know. In that case, this virus is much like 9/11. And that the whole point of terror is that it gets through undetected, when your defenses are down and that's constantly morphing and changing its shape or it mutates in order to survive. So we have to think about this the same way we think about terrorism and thinking about 9/11. Now, thinking about the swine flu or whatever other flu you want to talk about, because we know what happened. But do remember being in New York in 9/11 walking down the street thinking the world was going to end every single day. And then you look back and go, well, we got through it.

And we live in an era that's pre-antibiotic, pre-enhanced sanitizers, and hygiene, and just overall personal hygiene. We're living in a very different time where we have a lot more information.

And I do understand because you have a massive epicenter right now from China and now Italy is close to China.

So I would like some explanation from someone on the task force as to why we chose specific areas. I do agree with travel bans. We need to focus on our internal community spread and not have a more of influx of cases coming into our country. But, again, I don't know if you can necessarily pick and choose these.",

I mean, we're going to see that there are people fully recovering. There are negative tests. Our numbers are going to go up.

They were testing them and then sending them home without quarantine, which is why they have now over 80,000 cases. But here's the good news. Over -- the majority of them are already recovered and they're seeing less and less cases every day just like South Korea. The reasons that they having fewer cases is because of tight restrictions and increased testing. So we need to do that here in the United States. Travel bans give us time, give us time here to lesson community spread and be prepared. What we need to do for that is we need aggressive testing. We need our private sector to step up just like it did in South Korea. That is why South Korea has gotten this under control because their private sector, four private companies started making these tests. Not the government, we need to stop depending just on the CDC. We are a nation of capitalism. Yes. And fighters, I believe, and survivors. All right, we're going to make it quickly around the table.

The one thing I do advise and I've said this at multiple hearings and multiple briefings, that right now, we have to start implementing both containment and mitigation. And what was done when you do closing the school is mitigation. We've got to try as best as we can, to distance ourselves from each other, particularly if you are within a group that are at higher risk, if you do get infected, you're going to have a complication. And those are the elderly, people with underlying conditions, chronic congestive heart failure, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes, particularly among those if you're an elderly with that. So those are the kinds of things we need to do now. And the point that I was trying to make is that we don't want to wait until you get a lot of infections because sometimes when you make -- whether it be Maryland, whatever they did, you make a decision to do something. And someone might say, well, are you overreacting. We got to -- we got to lose that. We got to start looking at doing things now in anticipation of what might happen. And the reason is if you look at infectious diseases, how they work, particularly outbreaks of new infections, they go like this, then they go like this, and then they shoot up like that. And if you look at the curves of the history of outbreaks, they have the sharp peak, and then they start coming down. If you look at what happened in China. That's exactly what happened. It's starting to happen a little bit now in Korea. The purpose and the goal of both containment and mitigation is to instead of making it go up like that, blunted so it goes like that. You're never going to suppress it completely. So we have to get used to it. We're going to get infections and probably a lot more infections.",

If you look today at the majority of cases that are new cases, not old ones, new cases throughout the world, the majority of them are from Europe, Europe to other countries.

President Trump taking unprecedented action as Coronavirus fears impact almost every aspect of life here in America. Wall Street taking another big beating today. The stock market dropping by almost 10 percent. Major sports leagues suspending or delaying seasons. The NCAA just announcing that this year's March Madness has officially been canceled. Large gatherings are being limited across the country. And New York City just declaring a state of emergency. There are now more than 1,400 confirmed Coronavirus cases in the United States, and at least 37 people have died. President Trump responding by reassuring Americans that we as a country will get through this pandemic. Here he is earlier today talking about restricting travel from Europe."

I mean, when they raised taxes on us, they don't consult us. And if Americans coming back or anybody is coming back, we're testing. We have a tremendous testing setup where people coming in have to be tested. And if they are positive, it will be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine. Look, the key is, you have to have separation. You have to have separation or this thing takes longer to go away."

      "utterance": "Yes, yes, yes. The important thing is you can't make -- you can't make fear your de vault on this. Because I think, again, we're confusing statistical risks with personal risks. I would first -- I would first ask a really dumb question. When 9/11 occurred, we closed the stock market until September 17. That was six days because we were shell shocked. I think we're making a mistake here by not doing that. And we're making a mistake by foolishly comparing this virus to other viruses or other flus, right? Because it's like comparing last year's Super Bowl to the next year's. You're missing a crucial piece of information, which happens in the future, which we don't know. In that case, this virus is much like 9/11. And that the whole point of terror is that it gets through undetected, when your defenses are down and that's constantly morphing and changing its shape or it mutates in order to survive. So we have to think about this the same way we think about terrorism and thinking about 9/11. Now, thinking about the swine flu or whatever other flu you want to talk about, because we know what happened. But do remember being in New York in 9/11 walking down the street thinking the world was going to end every single day. And then you look back and go, well, we got through it. That's exactly -- right now, because you're in this thing, you feel it."

How you regain that control? By doing positive things for other people, by doing practical things, and practicing all the hygiene tips that the doc suggests, because that gives you a sense of control. But in the meantime, you're going to overstate this because you're in it. And you're going to look back and go like, wow, we got through it. And we will get through it. It's just right now it feels weird."

So you don't get sued. You're freaking out, I can't believe they are doing this. No, it's because some lawyer is saying you don't want this player to sue you or a corporation, you don't want somebody working here to get the virus when you could have sent them home. So all of these are just warnings."

      "speaker": "NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "That is certainly not Chernobyl. I understand how Greg is drawing parallels with 9/11. What has been upsetting me is when I'm seeing the parallels being drawn from like 1918 Spanish flu. And we live in an era that's pre-antibiotic, pre-enhanced sanitizers, and hygiene, and just overall personal hygiene. We're living in a very different time where we have a lot more information. And, you know, unfortunately, the travel bans have to be implemented. Because right now, we have community spread within our country. And I'm not saying necessarily I agree with the exact way the travel bans are being handled because one thing that I think that they missed last night is explaining why the travel ban was in a certain area of Europe and not in other areas of Europe. And I do understand because you have a massive epicenter right now from China and now Italy is close to China. And there is free travel between Italy and a lot of these other nations. But you also have the highest single daily increase in cases in the U.K. And that wasn't part of the travel ban. So I would like some explanation from someone on the task force as to why we chose specific areas. I do agree with travel bans. We need to focus on our internal community spread and not have a more of influx of cases coming into our country. But, again, I don't know if you can necessarily pick and choose these."

I don't think he did that, but I liked the tone of his address. I think he got the tone right. It was just in terms of the content. The kinds of things the Dr. Saphier was talking about, you know, why are you doing this country and not that country, because this country has a major outbreak? What are you thinking? We don't know. I do think when Tom Hanks gets it and his wife, and when the NBA, and now, Major League Baseball, can you imagine cancelling the NCAA tournament? That's a big deal because initially, you think, they will just play it on TV because it's TV revenue. They just canceled it. So, to me, this is a signal for people like me who tend to not want to be an alarmist and think, you know what, let it go. Let it pass, you know. I'm going to just be careful myself. But there is no reason to think things are really bad. You know what, I think things are bad."

I like what you said, Greg, that when it becomes personal, when you hear Tom Hanks and the NBA, it gets closer and closer to home, and we get it then in a different way. And we freak when we're in the middle of it. And I've said today like on Twitter, one day, this is going to be in the rearview mirror. It's going to hurt in the meantime, but we are going to get through it. I believe in this country, and I believe in the systems that we have in place.

We have to make sure we get through this, which we will. But there will be another one.

But I would say we'll see an equilibrium once we start having - implementing these measures, just like what we've seen in China and South Korea. So I would say four to six weeks, I think we're going to level off and then we may have a decline. It may be more than four to six weeks. I don't think it's going to be four to six months, until we have an equilibrium but I don't know -- we don't know."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Actually, to be honest, I think it has more to do with international travel right now. What this is, is a highly infectious disease virus. Australia, they had a travel ban. Initially, very early on, they had a travel ban. The only thing is they allowed foreign students from China come in and they had them do 14-day quarantines elsewhere, Dubai, wherever else, and then they went to Australia. But the point is some of these people didn't actually self-quarantine and then they went to Australia. And now, Australia has it."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "The President goes out there on TV and calls for unity, hope, and resilience and the media calls on him to resign. How sick is that? This guy is not interested in political correctness. He's trying to save lives. If the virus originated in Brooklyn, they would call it Brooklyn virus and other countries would be slapping travel bans on America. It is what it is. It's just about saving lives. And I want to talk about lives and put it into perspective for a second. There have been 37 deaths here in the United States, from Coronavirus. Every death is tragic. But swine flu, during 2010 under Barack Obama, there were 13,000 deaths, 60 million Americans were infected. So 37 versus 13,000, that's a big difference. Now, I'm not downplaying it. I'm putting it in context. And what the President gets hit on is, they say he's downplaying it. Where I'm seeing it, he's trying to reduce fear. If you say we have to be optimistic and we're going to beat this thing and eventually it's going to end, but at the same time, trying to say we've got to wash our hands, quarantine, slap travel bans on. That's a comprehensive approach. And he's trying to be aggressive and he's dynamic. And he's changed gears a little bit because he's responding to how the pandemic is met metastasizing. Last point, this is not a financial crisis. Once we get a handle on thing, markets are going to rally hard back. And we can all get back to watching basketball."

Now, do you think -- I kind of want to know where the error is from. Because to me, it seems like he was reading a script. I mean, a lot of times, he just speaks off-the-cuff. It actually seemed like he was reading a script last night. So, do you think the speech writers potentially had something to do with his errors and it wasn't necessarily his incompetence as people are saying?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, he's the President, so, I mean, you can't not take responsibility as President when you're addressing the American people. So, as I said yesterday here, the speech had to be thoroughly vetted. And apparently, it wasn't. But I mean on the flip side, you've got to understand, and this is what I would say to Jesse, because the Democrats didn't like the speech or some people in the media didn't like the speech, that's not the point. I mean, the point is that he failed to reassure because of the errors that we're referring to. For example, I would say in terms of the travel ban, explain it. I would say talk about the fact we haven't had testing and that the doctor says that was a fail. Talk about where the virus is now, what we can do to reduce its spread in our country. We see all these people acting independently, Broadway, the NBA, certain school systems, where is the leadership?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Well, actually, I will -- I will say that he did have a great call to Americans last night. And that was my favorite part of his speech. He talked about what he wanted to do from the economic side. He talked about the travel ban but then he also said Americans, you have to do this, you have to avoid public places, nonessential travel. I mean, I think that's what's most important here, Shannon. Didn't you think that message did come across?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "I mean, I hope when he kind of appealed to our better nature, our better nature or better angels, and this optimistic thing, America can do this. We've done this before. We're going to come out the other side. We do have to keep reminding ourselves we're going to be looking at this in the rearview mirror, and not super distant future, we hope. Jason Riley had a great piece in the Wall Street Journal this week. He said no matter what, this is going to be politicized. If he comes across as being urgent and overreacting, he's going to be accused as inciting panic. If he seems calm and not that into it, he's going to be accused of -- the word he used was lackadaisical. But this guy, right now, I feel like, you know, he's not going to be able to win. He can't make both sides happy. It's a little dispiriting because you would hope in this moment -- listen, if Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who immediately put out a statement saying how terrible it was last night, I think you can criticize the President. But maybe in this moment, for the country, you call him up, you sit down at the White House, or read on the phone, maybe think of the greater picture before you immediately put out a press release that didn't -- you know, wasn't too long after the speech that sounded like it might have been pre-written."

I mean, there were real mistakes that the White House had to walk back about cargo and people being banned. No, no, no, not cargo, we're talking about humans. Oh, no, not American citizens, American citizens can come back. I mean, these are mistakes that he made. He talks about, you know, flu, as Greg was saying, this is more dangerous than the flu in so many ways. And he wants to equate where he says your health insurer will cover this. You don't have to pay -- well, it turns out they will cover the test, but they won't cover the treatment."

Now, Greg, Obama got some criticism for his Gulf Oil speech, where they said there was a lot of rhetoric, very short on answers and other things. Do you feel -- I personally did not feel last night's speech was full of rhetoric. I thought he was actually getting to the point and telling us his plans. How do you think it compares?"

You think that the Democrats are out of power but remember, it's the media that's out of power in this administration. So no matter what Donald Trump does, he's going to get nailed. They -- when you call it a foreign virus or call it the Wuhan virus, that's racist. Is Ebola racist? Because it's named after a river, another was named after a place. Rocky Mountain Fever is named after the Rocky Mountains. All right. What is really frustrating, you can't trust people anymore because their political hatred is guiding their words, right. And these are people I would normally listen to, but I can't, because you can hear the dripping invective that contaminates their opinions. That's also a virus. I can say fairly that I think America is doing great. I'm disappointed that the stock market isn't closed. That bothers me. I think Trump needs to adjust the way he talks about this. He needs to improve on it because in his heart, Trump is an optimist, right. He's used to engaging and competing against groups, Democrats, and media. A virus is not something you vanquish. It's something you avoid and prepare against. That's something new for him. It may not be in his tool box, but he's a quick learner. And he should learn it. And so, coming from me -- you should trust me, that I say positive things. And I said negative things. But when you listen to the -- when you listen to CNN, Don Lemon screaming at a never Trumper, John Kasich, he wouldn't pile on the President, you see that you can't trust these jerks because they are polluted with bias.

And President Trump has said the same thing. We're going to expand testing. We're going to make sure we have enough physicians and nurses able. Everyone says certain things and I want to know how exactly you're going to do that. And, you know, listening to Bernie Sanders, he said he is going to do -- if this were him, he would declare a state of emergency. And he put together a bipartisan emergency group, full of experts. What do you think the task force is? We have several doctors there, people have been pointed by Obama and people have been pointed by Trump. And we have experts working on this together. So, I, again, feel like that's a lot of rhetoric. And you can say that you would do these things, but they are not giving specifics. What I want from the President, I want him to tell us it will be OK. I know it's going to be OK. But the American people need to know it's going to be OK. So I liked the tone last night. There were some -- some errors in his messaging. But I like that he said we're going to be OK, but here's what we're doing and here's what we need to do. I thought it was great in that sense."

I wasn't blown away by Biden's speech at all. I'll give him this. Testing capacity is not where it needs to be. That's on the CDC. They have plenty of money. Here's the criticism.

So either the administration can say, we aren't doing that, we haven't outlined every single step we're doing. Or they can say, good, OK, yes, how can we work that in? Would that be feasible? How would it work? Listen, though, on Capitol Hill, those folks who are already elected, got some problems there because, you know, we hear that they're trying to talk for all kinds of writers and things into these bills that they're putting together. Both sides just need to stop it for the American people. Get it done. Get it done and get something to the President's desk. If they all got to get in the room and hash it out. Don't leave Washington don't take a recess. I mean, get it done.

Number two, Biden's lied. He's a liar and he's a tool. He lied when he said -- when he opened the thing up and said this isn't about politics, and spent eight months saying that Trump was an unfit president, and that he would be a president. That's politics. He also accused the president of a cover-up. That's politics. So he is a liar and a tool and he's losing his mind before our eyes. He is unfit. That -- it just upset me that he went to that place. Now, Trump's words could be better, but his deeds are effective. His deeds are effective enough to buy us time so that we can prepare and also to prepare for mistakes. If we didn't have a robust economy and we didn't know ahead of time of what was coming.

But Doctor, let's talk about the fact that what we're trying to do now, we know the cases are going to explode here as testing does, but the negatives are going to explode as well. I mean, we're going to see that there are people fully recovering. There are negative tests. Our numbers are going to go up. But the idea is to flatten this, to flatten the curve instead of having this spike where we do overrun the hospitals and people completely freak out. How can these travel bans help to flatten that?

And China did not tell us -- they actually said to their people, that this is not a highly contagious virus. They were testing them and then sending them home without quarantine, which is why they have now over 80,000 cases. But here's the good news. Over -- the majority of them are already recovered and they're seeing less and less cases every day just like South Korea. The reasons that they having fewer cases is because of tight restrictions and increased testing. So we need to do that here in the United States. Travel bans give us time, give us time here to lesson community spread and be prepared. What we need to do for that is we need aggressive testing. We need our private sector to step up just like it did in South Korea. That is why South Korea has gotten this under control because their private sector, four private companies started making these tests. Not the government, we need to stop depending just on the CDC. We are a nation of capitalism. Yes. And fighters, I believe, and survivors. All right, we're going to make it quickly around the table.

It's not going to be months, it's going to be a week or so where you're going to get many, many more tests that are going to be available. The other thing that's important, and there was a considerable amount of misunderstanding about that, that the original guidelines for whether you could get a test was somewhat restrictive.

The one thing I do advise and I've said this at multiple hearings and multiple briefings, that right now, we have to start implementing both containment and mitigation. And what was done when you do closing the school is mitigation. We've got to try as best as we can, to distance ourselves from each other, particularly if you are within a group that are at higher risk, if you do get infected, you're going to have a complication. And those are the elderly, people with underlying conditions, chronic congestive heart failure, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes, particularly among those if you're an elderly with that. So those are the kinds of things we need to do now. And the point that I was trying to make is that we don't want to wait until you get a lot of infections because sometimes when you make -- whether it be Maryland, whatever they did, you make a decision to do something. And someone might say, well, are you overreacting. We got to -- we got to lose that. We got to start looking at doing things now in anticipation of what might happen. And the reason is if you look at infectious diseases, how they work, particularly outbreaks of new infections, they go like this, then they go like this, and then they shoot up like that. And if you look at the curves of the history of outbreaks, they have the sharp peak, and then they start coming down. If you look at what happened in China. That's exactly what happened. It's starting to happen a little bit now in Korea. The purpose and the goal of both containment and mitigation is to instead of making it go up like that, blunted so it goes like that. You're never going to suppress it completely. So we have to get used to it. We're going to get infections and probably a lot more infections."

If you look today at the majority of cases that are new cases, not old ones, new cases throughout the world, the majority of them are from Europe, Europe to other countries.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Right. So it started in China, and we had the travel ban on there, so that helped. And then they went around to Europe. And then from Europe, they came into the United States. And after consulting with the whole Task Force, they decided to slap it on the E.U. And I just think that's smart. Right now, he said, we're doing containment and mitigation. And that's instead of you're getting that huge spike, you're trying to blunt the spike, because the Wayne Gretzky analogy from the other day was brilliant. Because you don't go where the puck is, you anticipate where the puck will be. And that's what they're trying to do now. And they're doing the best job they can. And as he said, there will be more infections, but they're doing the best they can to test."

      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, we need the private sector involved and that was his opening remarks. And I agree because the South Korea already had -- they have a lot of cases and they're seeing a decrease in cases right now. And it's not because containment measures. They didn't do the stuff that China's doing. They didn't shut everything down. They had testing and they had testing right away. And that is because four tech companies came out, put together this test. It was a rapid test. It didn't take days to come back. It took hours to come back. And they gave it to their people. And now they're supplying it to the rest of the world. Shockingly, they're running low on material now because we depend on reagents from Germany, we depend on a lot of things from everywhere. But that's what they did. And now we are dealing with it. Our private sector also needs to step up. We need to make the reagents here and we need to make these testing kits here."

      "utterance": "As we were talking about, I mean, he has worked through numerous administrations and numerous crises. This guy is not new to this. He's a very respected voice. And I think when he just calm and says, yes, we're going to have a spike in cases and we're going to have more trouble, I think people feel comfortable listening to him across the board, regardless of party or ideology or anything else. He needs to be out there every day. The administration needs to get someone out there every day, because transparency is the only thing that is going to reassure people, I think."

We know this is going to happen. So as we keep seeing the numbers of cases and deaths happening and increasing and it's like a shock factor every day, Fauci is saying this, this is expected. So let's do what we can now to do this and we're doing that. So we're still on our way up, but it will -- it will start to even out. Just give it time and do your best to stop community spread."

Catcher out in Colorado, a three-year-old golden retriever. There were some people working at the house. He got out. A FedEx driver finds Catcher, looks at the tag, texts the family and says I found your dog. I'm taking the dog back to the address that's on the tag. And their little you know, surveillance cam catches this FedEx driver, taking Catcher back to the house, putting the doggie inside, and Catcher was safe and sound. This is a good Samaritan. Listen, the FedEx driver did not have to do this. He's not getting paid for this. But Catcher is not fighting it. He's fully picked up and ready to go."
