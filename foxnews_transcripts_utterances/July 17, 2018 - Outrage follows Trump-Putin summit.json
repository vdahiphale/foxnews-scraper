Now, Trump addressed the controversy today and we're going to get to that, but if he's a Russian plant, he's the worst one ever.

I say an awesome plant. Seriously, you've got to be nuts if you think he's the Manchurian candidate. John Brennan does and he voted for a commie at the height of the Cold War.

The world is Donkey Kong and we're always stuck at the same level, especially with Russia. But perhaps, like North Korea, this could be different. Putin is a thug, but you can still chat with a thug while racking up points in his own backyard. Trump played nice, may be too nice, despite the media screeching for a cat fight, but I say smile at Putin's faced then screw him if you must everywhere else. Maybe Trump should have skipped the presser altogether. But ask yourself this, if your TV was off and you're never heard about this story, would you have noticed anything different in your life? Just that it was gradually getting better: jobs, the economy, taxes, terror. Trump is winning on a lot of things. But even if you're winning, you can always do better.

But, I think one of the most important things he did is he recognized he had a problem with the intelligence community, and it's critical for any commander-in-chief to have a good relationship with them because you have to rely on them because your responsibility is to protect the American people and you can't do that if you don't have intel and a good relationship with them.

And then the other one was Bryce Harper. And the question is, does Bryce Harper stay in Washington after this season? He's not having a great season, average-wise. He's hitting the home runs. And then the question becomes, well, is that worth $400 million, Charlie? I don't know. They've got some other people coming up. But I've got to tell you, after last night, it's clear Bryce Harper owns this town. And his face, he's like the franchise player. Ryan Zimmerman has been the franchise player here for years. Bryce Harper is clearly the face of the Washington Nationals. And the question is, is that worth something in and of itself, even if his average is below average at the moment?",

What kind of plant would demand that NATO up their military spending to straitjacket mad Vlad? What kind of plant boosts our military by billions which allows us to do whatever the hell we want until forever? I say an awesome plant. Seriously, you've got to be nuts if you think he's the Manchurian candidate. John Brennan does and he voted for a commie at the height of the Cold War. I guess he's the expert. Maybe Trump should have talked tough but sent a few billion dollars to Moscow on pallots instead. So Donald lost the crazy pants vote, so what? The world is Donkey Kong and we're always stuck at the same level, especially with Russia. But perhaps, like North Korea, this could be different. Putin is a thug, but you can still chat with a thug while racking up points in his own backyard. Trump played nice, may be too nice, despite the media screeching for a cat fight, but I say smile at Putin's faced then screw him if you must everywhere else. Maybe Trump should have skipped the presser altogether. But ask yourself this, if your TV was off and you're never heard about this story, would you have noticed anything different in your life? Just that it was gradually getting better: jobs, the economy, taxes, terror. Trump is winning on a lot of things. But even if you're winning, you can always do better.

He read from a written statement, didn't take questions, so there was nothing off script except for the added, but there could have been other people also, which basically negated most of what he's saying. But, I think one of the most important things he did is he recognized he had a problem with the intelligence community, and it's critical for any commander-in-chief to have a good relationship with them because you have to rely on them because your responsibility is to protect the American people and you can't do that if you don't have intel and a good relationship with them. So I think that's what he's trying to do. Words do matter. They have consequences. Being nice is fine.

Remember we've seen the access Hollywood tape, Charlottesville, firing James Comey, the Con family controversy, separating kids, and Stormy Daniels. All of these things they've all said it's the holocaust. It's another 9/11. It's a constitutional crisis, impeachment, internment camps. But I think the country is tuning this up. We've become numb to this type of hyperbole because the Democrats always overreach. Now they want to abolish ICE.

And when you are asked, do I side with the intelligence community or Putin? That is not a hard answer. That doesn't require clarification. There is one answer and the president didn't give it. And my question continues to be why not? Why will the president not say that Russia did it, unequivocally? He didn't even do that today. Does he not believe it? And there's a whole host of reasons we can look at. It ends with collusion but there's a bunch of things before that, right? Is it ego? Is it he's afraid that he will look like an illegitimate president? But the bottom line is, Dan Coats, the head of national intelligence, last week said publicly, the warning signs about Russian interference today in our upcoming election is like the blinking red lights we saw before 9/11."

The mistake he made was he conflated the whole business about the hacking into the DNC servers and this business about collusion, and that -- when you're President of the United States, you cannot do that, especially if you're standing next to a thug like Vladimir Putin. But, I get a little bit, kind of, you know, sort of hesitant about all of this incredible outrage about all of it because, of course, that's exactly what the press does every day and they have done for the past two years, conflate Russian meddling with collusion. They say, oh, we have proof of Russian meddling, therefore you colluded. And he -- he's a defensive guy. He's always going to punch back. And he's just defensive. But he's a bigger guy than that. He needs to ignore that stuff. People don't listen to the lunatics we're talking about collusion now. He doesn't need to answer that question.

So, if we get along with them, great. If we don't get along with them, then we won't get along with them. But I think we have a very good chance of having some very positive things."

The press has never, never been more vocal -- on Donald Trump. He's the best thing to happen to the press since the printing press, seriously.

      "utterance": "Yes. So the number of times that I've run into you in that very park, it's kind of amazing. But I'd say, I'm rather jealous, but -- but I won't hold that against you right now. The real question that I want to know is after last night's amazing performance by Bryce Harper and, I mean, the dramatics of that sort of come from behind in the last final 15, 20 seconds was pretty astonishing. Is this going to turn the season around for Bryce Harper?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, there's so many questions around Harper. So I was telling you guys that yesterday I got to talk to all the players. And, you know, the biggest crowds were around two players, Manny Machado of the Baltimore Orioles. And again, he's on the trade -- the trade block, because I think the Orioles can't afford him. And then the other one was Bryce Harper. And the question is, does Bryce Harper stay in Washington after this season? He's not having a great season, average-wise. He's hitting the home runs. And then the question becomes, well, is that worth $400 million, Charlie? I don't know. They've got some other people coming up. But I've got to tell you, after last night, it's clear Bryce Harper owns this town. And his face, he's like the franchise player. Ryan Zimmerman has been the franchise player here for years. Bryce Harper is clearly the face of the Washington Nationals. And the question is, is that worth something in and of itself, even if his average is below average at the moment?"

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I'm a National League guy. I grew up as a Mets fan in Brooklyn. Now I'm a Nationals fan. In between, I rooted for the Orioles when Washington didn't have a team."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "But the track record's pretty clear, Dana. The American League won, I think, four of the last five, if not all of the last five times. We've got Max Scherzer out here, you know, and Chris Sale of the Red Sox starting. Those are two great pitchers, but it really comes down to the back end, and we'll see who wins. But if you had to pick, Dana, put your money on the AL."
