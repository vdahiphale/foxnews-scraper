      "sentences": "Hi, I am Greg Gutfeld with Jedediah Bila, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters and Kennedy -- \"The Five.\" Before the ceremonies to remember our fallen veterans, the President of France said he wanted a European Army and claimed he needed to protect against the Chinese, Russian, and U.S. cyber threats. So, us as a potential enemy, that's kind of rude. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Trump said he was insulted and every journal called him a big meanie for that. So, Trump did what Trump does, he tweets a lot, telling Macron maybe he should concentrate on his sad and sagging approval ratings. And that France would be speaking German, if it weren't for us. Also, make France great again, which can only mean lose the mimes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, to the dim, it seems -- this seems like a spat between a French chef and Yankee cabdriver. But really, it is a conversation between allies under Trump. Because Trump doesn't care. If you haven't noticed by now, Trump gets along with Macron, the Canadian dude, the nice lady from Germany, and that English woman who is not the queen. But that doesn't affect his candor. He will tell you when your fly is down, which is why Bill Clinton relied on him so much. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So Trump's friendship means he's going to elbow you, but if anything were to happen to you, he would be there in a heartbeat. And he would send in more than an ear-punishing James Taylor. In fact, we would never abandon France, even if we had to invade the country to save it again. But overlooked in all of this, the greatest thing. During a somber event marking 100 years since the ceasefire that ended World War I, here's the Moroccan King dozing.

So, us as a potential enemy, that's kind of rude. Trump said he was insulted and every journal called him a big meanie for that. So, Trump did what Trump does, he tweets a lot, telling Macron maybe he should concentrate on his sad and sagging approval ratings. And that France would be speaking German, if it weren't for us. Also, make France great again, which can only mean lose the mimes. Now, to the dim, it seems -- this seems like a spat between a French chef and Yankee cabdriver. But really, it is a conversation between allies under Trump. Because Trump doesn't care. If you haven't noticed by now, Trump gets along with Macron, the Canadian dude, the nice lady from Germany, and that English woman who is not the queen. But that doesn't affect his candor. He will tell you when your fly is down, which is why Bill Clinton relied on him so much. So Trump's friendship means he's going to elbow you, but if anything were to happen to you, he would be there in a heartbeat. And he would send in more than an ear-punishing James Taylor. In fact, we would never abandon France, even if we had to invade the country to save it again. But overlooked in all of this, the greatest thing. During a somber event marking 100 years since the ceasefire that ended World War I, here's the Moroccan King dozing. And please, you must wait for the end."

These people are the hardest working people you'll ever see. President Trump was elected not to be the president of Nice, but to be the president of Napa Valley.

Second of all, this idea that somehow patriotism and nationalism are mutually exclusive, it actually doesn't make any sense. I know Emmanuel Macron felt like he was being incredibly profound when he said patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. That is not true. And in fact, globalism, which you could argue is the opposite of nationalism, is very exclusive to patriotism. And those who are globalists tend to be apologist for their own countries, like President Obama. He was the epitome of globalism and he went to other countries.

You spoke before about the antinationalist speech, that was a dig. Then grouping the United States with China and Russia as people who they might have to guard themselves against, that's a dig, and then somehow, when Trump responds and says something even remotely a little bit outlandish or a little nasty, everybody blames Trump. If you poke over and over again, he's going to stand up for the country. He's going to bite back. People should learn that about Trump. I think that clip, by the way, of the King of Morocco was the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

I disagree. I mean, she broke the law when she failed to count and report the vote in a timely manner. State law requires that. She broke the law when she failed to allow lawyers to monitor the process. She broke the law when she mixed, as Jedediah said, the provisional ballots with mail-ins. And they found random bags of votes in random places. She has undermined the trust and the integrity of the election process. And no one believes it's being done in a fair and balanced way. I would and argue that Brenda Snipes has done more to interfere with the elections than the Russians. Because if you think about it, with the Obama and Trump officials both said was that in the 2016 election, Russia didn't interfere with any votes being counted or cast at all. They had a few Facebook pages and they paid some woman to dress up like crooked Hillary. This, you have a woman refusing to say how many votes were counted, cast, or tabulated, breaking all sorts of laws. She has a track record of breaking the law, no one trusts what she is doing, talk about undermining the integrity."

And they have not internalized some of the lessons that the entire nation and the world learned in 2000. And some of the machines they are using to count those votes, particularly in Broward County where Brenda Snipes is lording over the entire chaotic process, they don't work well. And sometimes they are just down to one machine. So you should anticipate that this is going to be a close vote, because the polling always is in Florida and you should know you have to have things working, so you can grease right in there and get the night over with.

They are also using a rapid DNA analysis system, so that relatives can provide samples and identify bodies burned beyond recognition.

And you look at the East Coast and clearly that's a strong Democrat territory. So we're talking about the Midwest, the South remaining strong -- strongly held by the Republicans. And you think who can have success there? And I would say Joe Biden, the reason Joe Biden is at the top of this is he calls himself Working Joe, right, working-class Joe, middle-class Joe.

I know it's hard to ignore, and I know you want to throw him out of the room, because he detracts from the ability of other reporters to ask their questions. And he's ostentatious, and he's annoying. I get it. But the second you revoke it and allow him to make himself the story, it's a gift to him. So I wouldn't have done this. I think the lawsuit may hold up.

Even the word \"website\" at the top is in quotation marks. That's part of his branding.
