President Trump expected to take the stage in just two hours in Nevada after a long week of trading jabs with Joe Biden on the campaign trail. With just 51 days until the election, the President is energizing his base and making a play for a state that he narrowly lost just four years ago to Hillary. Let's get right to Mark Meredith live in Minden, Nevada with the latest, Mark. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They want to do this at the main airport in Reno-Tahoe, instead, that was not allowed to happen. Now you can see the people that have been showing up here all night long, as you mentioned, Nevada is a state that so many people are going to be watching.

This has been an unusual rally in the sense that the campaign has had to change its strategy quite a few times this week because Nevada has strict rules on how many people can gather at events. They want to do this at the main airport in Reno-Tahoe, instead, that was not allowed to happen. Now you can see the people that have been showing up here all night long, as you mentioned, Nevada is a state that so many people are going to be watching. The President lost it four years ago by about 27,000 votes, but the campaign putting a lot of time, money and resources into Nevada, including with this stop right here tonight. You'd be amazed at how many people have made the trip out here to hear from the President himself, Jesse.

You saw some of the videos that she does with Bill, you know, wanting to off himself in the background last week alone, but that's the difference. He wanted to remain calm. Even Dr. Fauci, to his credit said, you know what, I never saw Trump downplay it once. I want my Commander-in-Chief to be able to be calm under pressure. I want him to not exert hysteria to the American people and cause a panic. That doesn't mean he is not dealing with it sincerely or severely. But you know, that's the reality. You know, Bob Woodward, it is a couple of weeks before an election, he's got to crank out another book. You know, he was right once 40 years ago and he has carried it that way ever since.

So we all know that's garbage, but something that's actually a lot different than that, your father has been nominated twice now for the Nobel Peace Prize. I checked out the criteria for the prize.

Now, if I wanted to riot and loot, I could have done that, but that's not really my thing. So I sat at home and I started looking at our opponent that we're running against, Joe Biden, and his half a century in the Washington, D.C. swamp. And when I started doing the research, I couldn't believe how much just totally disqualifying material there is on Joe Biden that the mainstream media just refuses to talk about it. It's not just Hunter Biden's corruption and his, you know, $1.5 billion from the Chinese or the Ukraine or his brother with the contracts to build housing in the Middle East, even though he never built houses. You know, it's the brain surgeries. It's the terrible policies on race. It's supporting NAFTA, TPP, China's permanent status in the World Trade Organization, all of those things that Joe Biden did that decimated the American middle class, that decimated American manufacturing, and they're running him like he's going to fix things now. Joe Biden probably singlehandedly did more damage to the American middle class than any politician alive and he wants to run to be President to fix things? You know, it's all of these things. If there was a mainstream media who felt obligated to actually be journalists, rather than activists, these would all be major stories. So I literally took it upon myself to take them on and tell the American public, to tell the people who are on the fence, the people who don't know, all of the things that Joe Biden did in his half a century in D.C. Guess what, Jesse? If Joe Biden could have fixed anything, he would have done it by now."

There has been no statement of condemnation of apology or reprimand against Jake Tapper or Chris Cuomo. These would have otherwise been at least in Cuomo's case, a fireable offense. Because look at this, you have a network that has no issue with this journalistic malfeasance and these are anchors, remember. These are people that are built that way anyway. They've moderated presidential debates, Tapper and Cuomo, and here you have one offering advice to a candidate on where to run for office. And then in Cuomo's case, not just the questions that Michael Cohen is going to get, but possible answers as well.

I watched it yesterday, and it's about a young West African girl living in the projects in France who comes from a very traditional Muslim background, and then she gets involved with the wrong circle of friends and discovers social media and discovers YouTube and sees all of these highly sexual rap videos, you know, online.

It's years of misinformation, particularly in Vietnam, where I experienced -- I was a small fry there, but certainly at the bottom of the chain, you know, we felt the devastating effect of the continual lying about that we were winning the war, winning the war. It was never true. And it was borne out by reality. So no, I do have -- I think any serious person who has lived any amount of time in our country has to doubt and has to question it. They have not provided convincing evidence and many people -- I'm not alone, I'm not the only one. Many, many people, technical experts that have question this. I tend to believe Julian Assange. I've been behind his case from the beginning. Assange to me is a hero, a solid foundation. He's on trial now in England for extradition to the United States. And he's a real hero and a martyr actually. He has made it very clear that he had nothing to do with the Russian connection. Nothing was leaked to him.

Could you make movies that have been successful, like some Italian mob movie? If you're saying now, you know, 30 percent of those mobsters, they have to be Asian, they can't be Italian.

It was a rather corrupt system with big money and the D.E.A. was born out of that too, and they were cracking down and all there was -- all of these Federal agencies were -- and local agencies were fighting with each other. It was -- they were getting at each other's way. It was like the Vietnam War in the sense that it was badly organized and when overspent, as hypocrisies don't often work, especially when you're chasing something as elusive as drugs.
