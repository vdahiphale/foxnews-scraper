Tonight, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the radical left, they are plotting what will be the single biggest power grab in modern American history. And they will not be answering questions about any of it. Talk about a lack of honesty and transparency. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, according to Joe Biden, you, the American people, you do not deserve to know his position, Kamala Harris' position on what are monumental issues like court packing, keeping the Electoral College, statehood for D.C. and elsewhere, until after the election. We have a lot coming up tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, we'll have the latest details in the curious saga of the presidential debate moderator, Steve Scully, it's fairly remarkable. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First, we do start with a simple fact. The level of transparency in the Trump administration is unmatched. This president communicates with you, we, the American people, often. He does without a filter. He answers a million questions across multiple platforms. He does it each and every day. The president's energy, his enthusiasm, even after a week of having COVID- 19, is remarkable. We saw this last night right here on the program. And again, today, during a two-hour interview with Rush Limbaugh on his show. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look at this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You know, I feel perfect. I have no -- if I'm not anything. You know, I'm off the regimen that they gave me. I want to terminate Obamacare and then come up with a great -- and we have it, come up with a great health care plan that's much less expensive and does include people with pre-existing conditions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I don't think the debate has meant that much because -- and I tell you why, I've done well with debates. I've won all -- I guess I have 15 and I think I won every single poll. I won the poll on this one with him. But I had to be rude because he was lying. He'd get up and he'd just say the series of things. They were all lies, I'd say false, and so, I interrupted him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Now, the president has talked at length about health care cooperatives and health savings accounts. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But over the past three and a half years, this president has been open and honest about his agenda. His signature, the signature of his presidency is that he does when he says he's going to do. He tells you his beliefs, he tells you his plans. He works around the clock, he keeps his promises. For example, I wouldn't say that Bernie Sanders is weak and frail, I say that about Joe Biden. The president fought for better trade deals like he promised, he got it done. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Lower taxes, he got that done. Fewer regulations, he got that done. Constitutionalist on the court, he fulfilled that promise. Building the border wall, he got the money. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Getting out of foreign conflicts but still taking out the caliphate, Baghdadi, Soleimani, the al Qaeda leader in Yemen, he got all of that done also, and building up our nation's defenses. He also got allies to pay their fair share. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There's no mystery with Donald Trump. He straightforward tells you what he thinks, beliefs, and what he promises, and then he's followed through for the last three and a half years. According to Gallup, by the way, more Americans now feel better off under four years of President Trump than under Obama and George W. Bush. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, let's be clear: honesty, being truthful, being transparent, it matters. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Predictability also matters. The president's pro-growth, low regulation agenda, it matters. And make no mistake: you're going to get none of that with Joe and Kamala. And as we speak, they are trying to erase their own history. They don't want you to remember that they once fawn over the Green New Deal and it's still on their website, by the way. They we don't want you to remember that all the times that both Joe and kamala called for a ban on fracking. Oh, we won't stop fracking. That's the exact opposite of what they've been telling us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They don't want you to remember that they once flirted with the idea of defunding the police like it was praised by Kamala Harris in L.A., or as Joe says, redistribution of funds, police have become the enemy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They don't want you to remember the times that they helped put violent rioters back on the streets with this idiotic and as part of their plan also, no bail policy. And right now, they flat-out will not answer a significant constitutional question about court-packing. This illicit practice would absolutely, fundamentally, alter this great democratic republic. It would negate the power of the court. And literally, our system of checks and balances, coequal branches of government, this is a really serious constitutional issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, Joe, he won't give us an answer until, well, after the election. This ought to scare every single person. It ought to scare the heck out of you to be honest. The arrogance is breathtaking. Whatever happened to honesty, truthfulness, transparency? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Chuck Schumer flat out saying that he is threatening everything that's on the table. Well, I believe him. The cavalier attitude about destroying the courts is something that we have never seen before. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, they assert the power of the legislative branch by having activist jurists and judges that they would write the laws. They would determine the law. They would do it by judicial fiat and the reason they will not give a straight answer is clear because they know as they told the American people, you, the American people, the truth, court packing is more than a little concerning especially for those of us that believe in the Constitution. It is dangerous, it is divisive, and it will lead this country down a very scary path where, well, unelected, lifetime, unaccountable judges would determine anything pretty much they wanted to determine. Now, by the way, Joe and Kamala, they are totally controlled by their radical socialist base. They know if they tell us the truth, even if they tried to say they wouldn't do it. I wouldn't believe them at this point, because they will be controlled by AOC and the squad, and by the radical party that they are a part of and they are leading. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, Biden is planning to pack the courts and while he's at it, of course, he wants to get statehood for D.C., Puerto Rico. Oh, that's four Democratic Senate seats in the minds of Democratic senators. They'll have a majority in perpetuity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do they want to ditch the Electoral College also? They certainly will get rid of the legislative filibuster. How do we know? Chuck Schumer is telling us that. His radical base wants total control of the U.S. government or at least until their socialist utopia is fully achieved. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this week in particular, the Democrats and their socialist base, guess what, they didn't think Kamala Harris was liberal enough in her debate with Mike Pence so they put out to their list of demands. It's called the people's charter, basically just a rebranding of their Green New Deal. Free everything for everybody, socialism for all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We can only assume it's a matter of time before the charter makes its way, well, onto Biden's website. And tonight, if you value honesty, transparency, law, order, separation of powers, coequal branches of government, our Constitution, if you value capitalism, you should be very nervous. In 25 days, this is all on the ballot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joe is weak. Joe is frail. He's struggling cognitively. Kamala Harris is the most radical leftists in the United States Senate, more to the left than Bolshevik Bernie. And guess what? That is what's in control of the Democratic Party. Here with more, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, and the Trump 2020 director of press communications, Erin Perrine is with us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Erin, good to see you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let me start with you tonight -- because by not saying it, they're saying it. And now, it's a matter -- if everything is one the table, we have to believe Chuck Schumer when he says everything's on the table, don't we?",

It'd be a real shame to see what happens to your Supreme Court, your filibuster, and your Electoral College. That's not America. That's not democracy. And it's not freedom. President Trump has thought and believes in the three branches of government, while Democrats want to try to do away with the filibuster. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Listen, I served five years on the hill, and in that, I worked three in the Senate. The Senate is the cooling saucer.

So, this is a very consequential exploration of the lies these people tell, but also a lack of regard they have for every single American.

According to reports, the Commission on Presidential Debates has now finally decided to cancel the October 15th matchup between President Trump and Joe Biden. How they do this unilaterally is unbelievable. It comes after the scheduled moderator Steve Scully under fire. He sent what many believed to be an eyebrow raising tweet yesterday. It seemed like he thought it was a private message to our old friend Anthony Scaramucci, writing, quote, should I respond to Trump? Look, Anthony and I, we have political disagreements and I known him a long time. We get along great. But he no longer supports the president and he's very vocal about it. Many are speculating it was meant to be a direct private message, but Scully's claiming he believes he was hacked. But so far, no evidence of that. And get this, it's apparently not the first time that Scully claimed to have been, quote, hacked, on Twitter. For example, on May 20th, 2012, Scully tweeted, quote, I apologize for Saturday's tweets regarding weight loss. Darn those hackers. Have a great Sunday. 2013, he tweeted, quote, I apologize for some earlier tweets. Account was hacked. Now, those tweets did not come from me but provided no actual evidence of hacking. Now, Scully has since deleted his entire Twitter account and don't forget, we told you earlier this week, Scully actually once interned for Joe Biden and worked with the late Senator Ted Kennedy. He tweeted on an anti-Trump article in 2016 entitled, \"No, not Trump, not ever.\" All this certainly creates at the very least, the appearance of bias and the appearance of deep anti-Trump sentiment inside the debate commission, who also, by the way, this week unilaterally, he decided to make the next debate virtual. So, you've got to ask yourself, all right. How much was Scully's Democratic partisan past factor into the debate commission's decision to select them as a moderator? Look, I'm going to be honest. I saw Steve in person and in Cleveland. I've seen him many times over the years. In person, he's a very nice guy, I can tell you that. He does a good job on C-Span. And he sticks to the mission of being down the middle on C-Span when he takes calls for the example. I like to give people the benefit of the doubts but there are a lot of questions here. Ask yourself, imagine if the moderator have worked for multiple Republicans. The media, I think we can predict that they'd be melting down. And also, keep in mind, during a virtual format, well, any moderator would then have an easy access to a mute button. The debates are supposed to be about the back and forth. Well, that will give Sleepy Joe, the ever weak and frail Joe, easy access even to his trusty teleprompter. So, it's just like -- I've been telling you, powerful institutional forces, they are very aligned to stop the president from getting reelected. They are using every bit of power they have to do it. The mob and the media, the Washington swamp, the Democratic Party, the Never Trumper movement, the deep state, Hollywood, they're all in. They want to destroy the president and frankly, they're willing to accept the most extreme policies in the process. If you do not believe me, well, let's listen to far left actress Jane Fonda actually celebrating coronavirus as a blessing to the Democrats. Really? Take a listen.",

His silence is odd. So, now, if it did happen, you have to look at the suspects of course, whether it'd be Carlos Danger or Pierre Delecto. That's where I would start there. But overall, Sean, over the past two weeks, major news organizations have showed that such doubt with the American people in terms of the way that they have covered this race. For instance, CNN two weeks ago, town hall, 16 question asked by audience members. If you think it would be eight Republicans, eight Democrats. Oh, no, it was 13 Democrats and three Republicans with a split on that. And then NBC News earlier this week has the town hall for Joe Biden with, quote, undecided voters.

It turns out, the president was 100 percent correct because the Michigan state Supreme Court a week ago struck down his orders saying that you have absolutely no authority to issue these draconian edicts that are ruining people's lives and livelihoods.

Tonight, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the radical left, they are plotting what will be the single biggest power grab in modern American history. And they will not be answering questions about any of it. Talk about a lack of honesty and transparency. Now, according to Joe Biden, you, the American people, you do not deserve to know his position, Kamala Harris' position on what are monumental issues like court packing, keeping the Electoral College, statehood for D.C. and elsewhere, until after the election. We have a lot coming up tonight. Also, we'll have the latest details in the curious saga of the presidential debate moderator, Steve Scully, it's fairly remarkable. First, we do start with a simple fact. The level of transparency in the Trump administration is unmatched. This president communicates with you, we, the American people, often. He does without a filter. He answers a million questions across multiple platforms. He does it each and every day. The president's energy, his enthusiasm, even after a week of having COVID- 19, is remarkable. We saw this last night right here on the program. And again, today, during a two-hour interview with Rush Limbaugh on his show. Take a look at this."

I want to terminate Obamacare and then come up with a great -- and we have it, come up with a great health care plan that's much less expensive and does include people with pre-existing conditions. I don't think the debate has meant that much because -- and I tell you why, I've done well with debates. I've won all -- I guess I have 15 and I think I won every single poll. I won the poll on this one with him. But I had to be rude because he was lying. He'd get up and he'd just say the series of things. They were all lies, I'd say false, and so, I interrupted him."

He tells you his beliefs, he tells you his plans. He works around the clock, he keeps his promises. For example, I wouldn't say that Bernie Sanders is weak and frail, I say that about Joe Biden. The president fought for better trade deals like he promised, he got it done. Lower taxes, he got that done. Fewer regulations, he got that done. Constitutionalist on the court, he fulfilled that promise. Building the border wall, he got the money. Getting out of foreign conflicts but still taking out the caliphate, Baghdadi, Soleimani, the al Qaeda leader in Yemen, he got all of that done also, and building up our nation's defenses. He also got allies to pay their fair share. There's no mystery with Donald Trump. He straightforward tells you what he thinks, beliefs, and what he promises, and then he's followed through for the last three and a half years.

      "speaker": "And make no mistake",
      "utterance": "you're going to get none of that with Joe and Kamala. And as we speak, they are trying to erase their own history. They don't want you to remember that they once fawn over the Green New Deal and it's still on their website, by the way. They we don't want you to remember that all the times that both Joe and kamala called for a ban on fracking. Oh, we won't stop fracking. That's the exact opposite of what they've been telling us. They don't want you to remember that they once flirted with the idea of defunding the police like it was praised by Kamala Harris in L.A., or as Joe says, redistribution of funds, police have become the enemy. They don't want you to remember the times that they helped put violent rioters back on the streets with this idiotic and as part of their plan also, no bail policy. And right now, they flat-out will not answer a significant constitutional question about court-packing. This illicit practice would absolutely, fundamentally, alter this great democratic republic. It would negate the power of the court. And literally, our system of checks and balances, coequal branches of government, this is a really serious constitutional issue. But, Joe, he won't give us an answer until, well, after the election. This ought to scare every single person. It ought to scare the heck out of you to be honest. The arrogance is breathtaking. Whatever happened to honesty, truthfulness, transparency? Now, Chuck Schumer flat out saying that he is threatening everything that's on the table. Well, I believe him. The cavalier attitude about destroying the courts is something that we have never seen before. By the way, they assert the power of the legislative branch by having activist jurists and judges that they would write the laws. They would determine the law. They would do it by judicial fiat and the reason they will not give a straight answer is clear because they know as they told the American people, you, the American people, the truth, court packing is more than a little concerning especially for those of us that believe in the Constitution. It is dangerous, it is divisive, and it will lead this country down a very scary path where, well, unelected, lifetime, unaccountable judges would determine anything pretty much they wanted to determine. Now, by the way, Joe and Kamala, they are totally controlled by their radical socialist base. They know if they tell us the truth, even if they tried to say they wouldn't do it. I wouldn't believe them at this point, because they will be controlled by AOC and the squad, and by the radical party that they are a part of and they are leading. So, Biden is planning to pack the courts and while he's at it, of course, he wants to get statehood for D.C., Puerto Rico. Oh, that's four Democratic Senate seats in the minds of Democratic senators. They'll have a majority in perpetuity. Do they want to ditch the Electoral College also? They certainly will get rid of the legislative filibuster. How do we know? Chuck Schumer is telling us that. His radical base wants total control of the U.S. government or at least until their socialist utopia is fully achieved. Now, this week in particular, the Democrats and their socialist base, guess what, they didn't think Kamala Harris was liberal enough in her debate with Mike Pence so they put out to their list of demands. It's called the people's charter, basically just a rebranding of their Green New Deal. Free everything for everybody, socialism for all. We can only assume it's a matter of time before the charter makes its way, well, onto Biden's website. And tonight, if you value honesty, transparency, law, order, separation of powers, coequal branches of government, our Constitution, if you value capitalism, you should be very nervous. In 25 days, this is all on the ballot. Joe is weak. Joe is frail. He's struggling cognitively. Kamala Harris is the most radical leftists in the United States Senate, more to the left than Bolshevik Bernie. And guess what? That is what's in control of the Democratic Party. Here with more, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, and the Trump 2020 director of press communications, Erin Perrine is with us. Erin, good to see you. Let me start with you tonight -- because by not saying it, they're saying it.

They don't like the rules so they want to change them. Oh, it's kind of this mafioso mentality. Oh, we don't get our way. It'd be a real shame to see what happens to your Supreme Court, your filibuster, and your Electoral College. That's not America. That's not democracy. And it's not freedom. President Trump has thought and believes in the three branches of government, while Democrats want to try to do away with the filibuster. Listen, I served five years on the hill, and in that, I worked three in the Senate. The Senate is the cooling saucer. It's supposed to keep the hot copy of tea that is the house, the reactionary side, calm and a little more measured. But if they get away with all of that, they will upend America and Joe Biden, what he is, he is just one step closer to Democrats trying to make the United States Venezuela and Cuba.

The other things they've got passed, especially their social agenda, they've moved through the courts and the bureaucracy for the cultural pressure, right? What has Trump done? Trump has pretty much changed the culture of Washington, he's cleaning out the bureaucracy and he's upended the entire court system to get it back to doing what it supposed to do, Sean, which is judge cases on Americans not based on their theology, that's why they hate Trump so much. And just to be clear on this segment, your first part, too, that was a great monologue here. Listen, Biden is playing the game right now where he's lying to both factions of the Democrat Party. He's telling the moderates he's moderate and the liberals he's liberal. He's Gumby. He's whatever you need him to be and that's the problem, because what he's really afraid of are the liberals. And don't forget, if you ever want to see who Joe Biden really is, what's the golden axiomatic rule of D.C. politics, Sean? People are policy. Who are you surrounding yourself with? For his vice president, he picks the most radical member of the Senate, and for his unity task force platform, who does he pick? Bernie Sanders. Look up the Biden-Sanders unity task force.

Or him going, come on, man, are you a junkie? Really weird things. Anyway, during an \"Axios\" focus group of swing voters in Michigan, one participant said this. Biden's not going to make it four years. So, Kamala Harris is going to be president and I have zero trust that she can be president. Everyone else in the group, they agreed. So, yeah, it's kind of important to know what Senator Harris actually stands for. She did not have a good debate with Mike Pence. He kind of eviscerated her this week, but the mob and the media, they're never going to hold her to account. They won't ask why she corresponds to the Green New Deal. They won't ask her plan is to ban oil and gas. They want to ask if she still supports the ban on fracking. She's just lying about that. They won't ask why she promoted that bail fund in Minnesota to put violent anarchists and rioters back out on the streets. They won't ask if she supports ending the legislative filibuster. They won't ask if she wants to ban the Electoral College. And they sure as hell won't ask her, why she's open to packing the courts in the past? It should be a signal. If empowered, they will do it. You might remember this."

They want one-party rule in perpetuity. They don't want two competing parties. In other words, what I've been saying, the most radical tickets of any mainstream party in history. If they win, God help this country. Here with more, FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce. Also, \"Fox & Friends\" co- host, Pete Hegseth. All right. By not saying it, Tammy, they are saying it. And for everybody to say that they think he's not going to survive the first term, we've seen polls now as high as 60 percent.

Both she and Joe Biden, I guess, I don't if it was a gaffe, but have been referring to the team as the Harris-Biden team. She at one point during a Zoom call with supporters referred to it as the Harris administration. Obviously, that discussion has happened. He said himself that he's a transitionary candidate. And then they do this wink and a nod at the people in the know. And this is the ultimate insult to the American people. It tells you that they have no regard for the decisions we have to make, for what our futures will look like, what we expect from these people. They're patting us on the head like where little tiny babies and don't know any better. And let me just add one thing about the stunts of the 25th Amendment. The last time Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats controlling the House pulled a stunt like this was in January with impeachment. And they missed, the coronavirus being sent over from China. The one person who did not miss it was Donald Trump, but the damage was done because they spent two months, not wanting to, have anybody distracted from impeachment. They allow that to occur. So, it makes me very nervous when Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to do her job and wants to engage in personal smears. So, this is a very consequential exploration of the lies these people tell, but also a lack of regard they have for every single American. Your families, the future, we don't matter to these individuals and they are desperate to annihilate Donald Trump because his existence and who he appeals to reminds us that government can be different, presidents can make a difference, and the future is still ours."

They want them to tell -- the American people want to hear what they will do, how they will lead, what their policies are.

It's based in the fact they fear the radical left, if they go with the voters and say, okay, we're not going to pack the courts and the most extreme measure we could possibly take the left abandons them. So, they don't answer the question, and they know they can't answer the question because ultimately they answer the question which is of course they would like to do that. If Nancy Pelosi took to the podium, yes, trying to question Donald Trump but ultimately open the door to the fact that maybe Joe Biden won't make it and so guess who's next in line? Kamala Harris who is ultimately more left than the socialist Bernie Sanders. So, the triad always goes back to the radicals and the most radical impulses, and all they are trying to do 25 days from the election is hide it as hard as they can because that \"Axios\" poll shows it. People see through that. They understand Joe Biden has no business being president. And, ultimately, you laid out the list of things that Donald Trump has accomplished. At the end of the day, you get through COVID-19, and you start to realize this president delivered to. He didn't -- he's never hidden from a question, said, I'll answer that after the election. He's answered them for the people to get that shot again. Come on, come on."

When we come back, massive controversy tonight over the debate moderator. Steve Scully, well, we'll tell you what he tweeted from his account. He now says it was hacked. We'll explain that and more as we continue this busy breaking news Friday night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. This is a FOX News alert. According to reports, the Commission on Presidential Debates has now finally decided to cancel the October 15th matchup between President Trump and Joe Biden. How they do this unilaterally is unbelievable. It comes after the scheduled moderator Steve Scully under fire. He sent what many believed to be an eyebrow raising tweet yesterday. It seemed like he thought it was a private message to our old friend Anthony Scaramucci, writing, quote, should I respond to Trump? Look, Anthony and I, we have political disagreements and I known him a long time. We get along great. But he no longer supports the president and he's very vocal about it. Many are speculating it was meant to be a direct private message, but Scully's claiming he believes he was hacked. But so far, no evidence of that. And get this, it's apparently not the first time that Scully claimed to have been, quote, hacked, on Twitter. For example, on May 20th, 2012, Scully tweeted, quote, I apologize for Saturday's tweets regarding weight loss. Darn those hackers. Have a great Sunday. 2013, he tweeted, quote, I apologize for some earlier tweets. Account was hacked. Now, those tweets did not come from me but provided no actual evidence of hacking. Now, Scully has since deleted his entire Twitter account and don't forget, we told you earlier this week, Scully actually once interned for Joe Biden and worked with the late Senator Ted Kennedy. He tweeted on an anti-Trump article in 2016 entitled, \"No, not Trump, not ever.\" All this certainly creates at the very least, the appearance of bias and the appearance of deep anti-Trump sentiment inside the debate commission, who also, by the way, this week unilaterally, he decided to make the next debate virtual. So, you've got to ask yourself, all right. How much was Scully's Democratic partisan past factor into the debate commission's decision to select them as a moderator? Look, I'm going to be honest. I saw Steve in person and in Cleveland. I've seen him many times over the years. In person, he's a very nice guy, I can tell you that. He does a good job on C-Span. And he sticks to the mission of being down the middle on C-Span when he takes calls for the example. I like to give people the benefit of the doubts but there are a lot of questions here. Ask yourself, imagine if the moderator have worked for multiple Republicans. The media, I think we can predict that they'd be melting down. And also, keep in mind, during a virtual format, well, any moderator would then have an easy access to a mute button. The debates are supposed to be about the back and forth. Well, that will give Sleepy Joe, the ever weak and frail Joe, easy access even to his trusty teleprompter. So, it's just like -- I've been telling you, powerful institutional forces, they are very aligned to stop the president from getting reelected. They are using every bit of power they have to do it. The mob and the media, the Washington swamp, the Democratic Party, the Never Trumper movement, the deep state, Hollywood, they're all in. They want to destroy the president and frankly, they're willing to accept the most extreme policies in the process. If you do not believe me, well, let's listen to far left actress Jane Fonda actually celebrating coronavirus as a blessing to the Democrats. Really? Take a listen."

I don't care that he's a Democrat, if he -- you know, if he would do a fair job at a debate, I'd tip my hat to him.

It's the same reason why you couldn't have George Stephanopoulos conducting a Republican presidential debate. I mean, you're disqualified based on your work history on that alone. But, look, the commission here, Sean, screwed this whole thing up. The way this works is the commission should go to the campaigns, I've been through this many times, and say, look, we've got a problem. We want to make sure you were COVID negative. Show us a couple tests before Monday if you can. If you can't show us a couple negatives before Monday, then we're going to go virtual. Second thing, DNC and the RNC, it's about time that they take over the debates. You can't have a commission full of political people that are pretending that they're not political putting together debates. Just -- be open about it and have the political parties, the DNC and the RNC do this. Now, last thing, in spite of all of that, I think President Trump should do the virtual debate."

      "utterance": "Five press conferences, Sean, in the past 190 days for Joe Biden, while President Trump at least pre-COVID diagnosis was out there almost every day in addition to his press secretary who also did a separate press conference. But, yes, Steve Scully is definitely breathing a sigh of relief tonight. As you said, to be hacked ones, that's kind of difficult. Twice, almost unlikely. Thrice, impossible. So, this keeps happening to Steve Scully, and what gives me pause and why I'm skeptical here in terms of whether this was a hack or not is that Steve Scully still hasn't put out any sort of statement saying, I'm sorry, I didn't do this, this wasn't me, and being definitive about it. His silence is odd. So, now, if it did happen, you have to look at the suspects of course, whether it'd be Carlos Danger or Pierre Delecto. That's where I would start there. But overall, Sean, over the past two weeks, major news organizations have showed that such doubt with the American people in terms of the way that they have covered this race. For instance, CNN two weeks ago, town hall, 16 question asked by audience members. If you think it would be eight Republicans, eight Democrats. Oh, no, it was 13 Democrats and three Republicans with a split on that. And then NBC News earlier this week has the town hall for Joe Biden with, quote, undecided voters. It turns out that many were actually decided already including two that appeared on NBC News six weeks ago to say that they were voting for Joe Biden. Of course, that wasn't shared on Monday night."

However, she calls for unity and then creates the most divisive atmosphere she possibly can over this, blaming it on the president for something she wrongfully said in the debate last week when she good and well knew, she knew that this plot happened back in June. So, it had nothing to do with the president and the police, as you said, the great men and women of the joint federalism task force, the terrorism task force, who took down these monsters are the president's task force. Also comprised to state, local, federal government in the same once the hypocrisy of Joe Biden says he wants to either defund or, what, reimagine? Well, imagine his social workers out there taking down these horrible monsters. The great men and women in law enforcement did that, and Joe Biden could not name one law enforcement organization, one, not one who endorsed him. President Trump has had countless one, and in fact, Sean, I was down to Miami this morning, accepting an endorsement for him, a huge one from the Florida Police Chiefs Association.

Did he make it worse? I mean, that's a lot more plausible than blaming President Trump for a plot in Michigan by people he doesn't even know. But that's what Whitmer and Pelosi and Joe Biden did. The truth is, that Trump has criticized and denounced what Governor Whitmer did with her unlawful and discriminatory and unconstitutional abuse of power. It turns out, the president was 100 percent correct because the Michigan state Supreme Court a week ago struck down his orders saying that you have absolutely no authority to issue these draconian edicts that are ruining people's lives and livelihoods. So, the president was actually correct in his criticism of her. But, you know, nobody except the president, certainly not the media's pointing out that if he is complacent in this nefarious plot, how is it that his own FBI and Department of Justice crackdown on it, arrested the plotters and stopped it? You know, this is simply Donald Trump to blame for everything. If it's a cloudy day, if you get in a car wreck, it's all Donald Trump's fault.

You know, I find this amazing, you know, because I thought liberals were pro-choice, I thought that they believed in religious liberty and are supposedly tolerance.
