      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Election was on Tuesday. We still don't know the outcome. What happens next? And how long does it go on? Well, if you follow the Florida recount 20 years ago, you probably assume you've got some idea how this election is going to play out. Officials in contested states will carefully count all the available votes, supervised by bipartisan observers from both campaigns to reassure all of us, it's on the level. If they find irregularities or they see questions of fraud, we'll all get to learn exactly what those allegations are and how they were resolved. That's what we did in 2000. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Hanging chads? Remember those? We put them on TV so people could see the ballots for themselves. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In the end, the dispute between Al Gore and George W. Bush continued all the way to the Supreme Court. It took 36 days to resolve, and every one of those days, if you remember them, seemed like a month. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That process was excruciating. It required patience and calm. But in the end, it was well worth it. And by the way, the news organizations in this country covered every moment of it. No one in any newsroom in America even considered censoring information about what was happening in the states. That would have been regarded as grotesque and immoral. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, then, as now, almost everyone in the media was a partisan Democrat. That's always been the case. But in 2000, they understood that preserving the public's faith in the system, our American system of government was more important than getting Al Gore or anyone else into the White House. So they pushed for openness and transparency in the process, and thank God they did. A lot has changed over two decades. It is entirely possible now that someday soon, the news media will decide to shut this election down. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Believe it or not, effectively, they have the power to do that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's say tomorrow, officials in Philadelphia produced a large number of newly counted votes. Pennsylvania's Secretary of State hastily ratifies them, puts a seal of approval on them, and then declares Joe Biden, the winner. Winning Pennsylvania would put Joe Biden over the threshold of 270 electoral votes. So Joe Biden is now the President elect. But hold on a minute, how many of the 69 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump this week would believe that and accept it? At this point, not very many, not that anyone cares, and of course, the fact that no one cares is the reason they voted for Donald Trump in the first place. But if you cared about the country and its future, you wouldn't force Donald Trump's voters to believe this. You wouldn't force them to take you on your word. Instead, you would show them. You would convince them. You would pull back, you'd resist hasty calls, and you'd make certain that we got to the bottom of any credible claim of fraud. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Not all the claims are credible, some are and you'd care. You would air the hanging chads. You'd let the process work as we did in 2000. Maybe in the end, Joe Biden would win anyway, maybe he wouldn't. But the public's faith in the system and that's essential in a self-governing Republic would remain intact. That's what you would do if you cared about this country. But let's say you didn't care at all. Let's say all you cared about was power. In that case, you'd go on television and declare Joe Biden, the President elect, even as other states were still counting votes and serious questions about the legitimacy of ballots remained unanswered. You wouldn't care. You'd just shut it down. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The news media believe they can do that, quote, \"The role of declaring the winner of a presidential election in the United States falls to the news media.\" That's what \"The New York Times\" declared this week. So let's say the news networks decide to do that, shut it down. What then? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, Donald Trump and his voters would complain, obviously, but what can they really do? They are not news anchors, they don't own their owns. And if you wanted to stop them from complaining, it wouldn't be very hard. You just accuse them of attacking democracy, then you would censor their social media posts. You might even pull the President off Twitter completely. It's his main form of communication and he doesn't own it. Jack Dorsey runs it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You'd accuse the President of spreading misinformation, and so for the sake of the nation, we can't allow that. If Trump and his voters persisted in complaining, you'd consider stronger measures. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Democrats have been thinking about this for a long time, it turns out. Not the rest of us have, but they have. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This summer, John Podesta played Joe Biden in an election simulation that Democrats held. In that simulation according to reports, Podesta quote, \"Wanted to see what the military would do if Donald Trump refused to accept the election results.\" The military? So what exactly would the military do? It's shocking even to think about something like that, but others have thought about it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This summer, a retired Army Colonel called Lawrence Wilkerson went on the Bill Maher show on HBO, to discuss that question. As you watch the clip we're about to show you, keep in mind that Wilkerson is not a fringe figure. He is not some guy muttering to himself on a city bus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Wilkerson was once Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell. Look him up. He is a famous man. He taught courses at a couple of famous universities. Here's what Wilkerson said. LAWRENCE WILKERSON, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

See here you have one of the people who brought you the war in Iraq, fantasizing out loud about killing even more civilians, in this case, American citizens -- Trump voters in the streets of our cities.

It's a quick way to break everything and it is happening now. Normal people are becoming paranoid. Americans who love this country are beginning to fear it, why? We know exactly why. Because shutting down legitimate discourse and inquiry always has that effect.

If people air concerns, resolve the concerns. Don't call them names. Don't sweep those concerns under the rug. Don't shut it down artificially with unelected news anchors, let our system work.

So, I'm concerned by the number of reports that we are getting on this that I'm getting and that all of us are getting about irregularities and potential fraud in the voting. I can't confirm that any of those are true, perhaps some are. What I'm concerned about is the concerted attempt to ignore them, and the effect that that has on Americans trust in the system. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You know, why our ballots showing up? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mail-in voting, it has a lot of problems, you know, some obvious ones. You send ballots out to everyone, you never know who actually receives the ballot and when they come back. You could be sending them to people who have died without knowing. You could be sending it to people who have moved from the state. So that already has a problem. But there should be one advantage, right? If these things are mailed in, presumably, some of them will come in late, but wouldn't most of them be coming in months or weeks ahead of time? So why are we finding big trenches of ballots hours and in some cases, even days after the polls have closed? Shouldn't mail-in ballots already be there somewhere ready to be counted? And your point is exactly the right one. These are questions. They deserve investigations and answers, transparent answers, and when all we get back is, \"Shut up. You're a conspiracy theorist. You're attacking the integrity of our democracy.\" That doesn't give anybody confidence in the integrity of the system. It makes you suspect that something fishy is going on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

There are some legitimate questions there. It does appear in Pennsylvania that these monitors or observers did face barriers, did face obstructions. There are court orders that went for the Trump campaign to get them greater access. It's a mystery to me why the Pennsylvania officials are litigating this question, because it certainly does fulfill the suspicions of people that there is something going on. So, I don't know why they would do this. But I'm actually looking more closely at the Nevada litigation right now. You know, the Trump campaign is saying that they have evidence of people out of state and even deceased individuals who were allowed to vote. That's the type of thing that really pops out, because most of the challenges in these types of elections, and you and I have been covering them in the past 2000 are usually incremental. You know, you usually grab a group of pallets here, a group there. In the aggregate, they can make a difference if it's a very narrow margin. But what we really look for are those cases where there are large groups of ballots that have been challenged. The Nevada case could be that type of challenge, you know, if -- because it's not just that they believe that there is 10,000 people who may have voted who are ineligible, it would indicate that there was a systemic failure. That's the type of allegation if it's true, that could lead to close judicial scrutiny. So, we're waiting to see if there is evidence of that. We have not seen it yet. The Pennsylvania lawsuit is also worth looking at because they are saying that a judge effectively rewrote the election laws and that some ballots that were late processed are counting. We still don't know how many ballots that would be, but it's already been to the Supreme Court. And then John Roberts sort of kick that can down the road. Well, the can is rattling back to the court this week.",

      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Election was on Tuesday. We still don't know the outcome. What happens next? And how long does it go on? Well, if you follow the Florida recount 20 years ago, you probably assume you've got some idea how this election is going to play out. Officials in contested states will carefully count all the available votes, supervised by bipartisan observers from both campaigns to reassure all of us, it's on the level. If they find irregularities or they see questions of fraud, we'll all get to learn exactly what those allegations are and how they were resolved. That's what we did in 2000. Hanging chads? Remember those? We put them on TV so people could see the ballots for themselves. In the end, the dispute between Al Gore and George W. Bush continued all the way to the Supreme Court. It took 36 days to resolve, and every one of those days, if you remember them, seemed like a month. That process was excruciating. It required patience and calm. But in the end, it was well worth it. And by the way, the news organizations in this country covered every moment of it. No one in any newsroom in America even considered censoring information about what was happening in the states. That would have been regarded as grotesque and immoral. By the way, then, as now, almost everyone in the media was a partisan Democrat. That's always been the case. But in 2000, they understood that preserving the public's faith in the system, our American system of government was more important than getting Al Gore or anyone else into the White House. So they pushed for openness and transparency in the process, and thank God they did. A lot has changed over two decades. It is entirely possible now that someday soon, the news media will decide to shut this election down. Believe it or not, effectively, they have the power to do that. Let's say tomorrow, officials in Philadelphia produced a large number of newly counted votes. Pennsylvania's Secretary of State hastily ratifies them, puts a seal of approval on them, and then declares Joe Biden, the winner. Winning Pennsylvania would put Joe Biden over the threshold of 270 electoral votes. So Joe Biden is now the President elect. But hold on a minute, how many of the 69 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump this week would believe that and accept it? At this point, not very many, not that anyone cares, and of course, the fact that no one cares is the reason they voted for Donald Trump in the first place. But if you cared about the country and its future, you wouldn't force Donald Trump's voters to believe this. You wouldn't force them to take you on your word. Instead, you would show them. You would convince them. You would pull back, you'd resist hasty calls, and you'd make certain that we got to the bottom of any credible claim of fraud. Not all the claims are credible, some are and you'd care. You would air the hanging chads. You'd let the process work as we did in 2000. Maybe in the end, Joe Biden would win anyway, maybe he wouldn't. But the public's faith in the system and that's essential in a self-governing Republic would remain intact. That's what you would do if you cared about this country. But let's say you didn't care at all. Let's say all you cared about was power. In that case, you'd go on television and declare Joe Biden, the President elect, even as other states were still counting votes and serious questions about the legitimacy of ballots remained unanswered. You wouldn't care. You'd just shut it down. The news media believe they can do that, quote, \"The role of declaring the winner of a presidential election in the United States falls to the news media.\" That's what \"The New York Times\" declared this week. So let's say the news networks decide to do that, shut it down. What then? Well, Donald Trump and his voters would complain, obviously, but what can they really do? They are not news anchors, they don't own their owns. And if you wanted to stop them from complaining, it wouldn't be very hard. You just accuse them of attacking democracy, then you would censor their social media posts. You might even pull the President off Twitter completely. It's his main form of communication and he doesn't own it. Jack Dorsey runs it. You'd accuse the President of spreading misinformation, and so for the sake of the nation, we can't allow that. If Trump and his voters persisted in complaining, you'd consider stronger measures. Democrats have been thinking about this for a long time, it turns out. Not the rest of us have, but they have. This summer, John Podesta played Joe Biden in an election simulation that Democrats held. In that simulation according to reports, Podesta quote, \"Wanted to see what the military would do if Donald Trump refused to accept the election results.\" The military? So what exactly would the military do? It's shocking even to think about something like that, but others have thought about it. This summer, a retired Army Colonel called Lawrence Wilkerson went on the Bill Maher show on HBO, to discuss that question. As you watch the clip we're about to show you, keep in mind that Wilkerson is not a fringe figure. He is not some guy muttering to himself on a city bus. Wilkerson was once Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell. Look him up. He is a famous man. He taught courses at a couple of famous universities. Here's what Wilkerson said.

See here you have one of the people who brought you the war in Iraq, fantasizing out loud about killing even more civilians, in this case, American citizens -- Trump voters in the streets of our cities. People didn't used to talk like this on television and on FOX News, they still don't because we wouldn't allow it. That's violent extremism. But on that, no problem. No one even noticed that. It tells you a lot about how they think. You really can't overstate -- and we mean that you -- can't overstate how corrosive language like that is. It's a quick way to break everything and it is happening now. Normal people are becoming paranoid. Americans who love this country are beginning to fear it, why? We know exactly why. Because shutting down legitimate discourse and inquiry always has that effect. It destroys social trust and it sets the table for awful things to come. So let's stop this right now. Slow down. No hasty calls. Our system works. It has worked before. If people air concerns, resolve the concerns. Don't call them names. Don't sweep those concerns under the rug. Don't shut it down artificially with unelected news anchors, let our system work. Only by doing that will we have a country we are going to want to live in 20 years from now. Josh Hawley is a Republican senator from the State of Missouri and we're happy to have him on tonight. Senator, thanks so much for coming on. So, I'm concerned by the number of reports that we are getting on this that I'm getting and that all of us are getting about irregularities and potential fraud in the voting. I can't confirm that any of those are true, perhaps some are. What I'm concerned about is the concerted attempt to ignore them, and the effect that that has on Americans trust in the system."

It also mean things like ballot harvesting, Tucker, where you pay a third party to go collect ballots to bring him in. That ought to be illegal in the United States of America. Let's ban ballot harvesting right now. It is rife with abuse. It is inviting abuse. These are the kind of reforms that we need to pursue. But right now, I mean, right this very instant, there needs to be total transparency in this process. And I've got to tell you, when you see some states going to court to try and stop poll watchers, people just -- just observing the ballot counts. I mean, that is deeply, deeply disturbing."

      "utterance": "Yes, it does. And unfortunately, we've seen it tried in multiple places and we've seen reports of Detroit about ballots brought in there, new ballots in the middle of the night. And we've seen it in Philadelphia. Now, again, to your point a second ago, I don't know if these allegations are well founded or not. That's why you have observers. That's why you have a process. That's why you have a transparent process. I can tell you what else, Tucker, to have some states where they are not even telling us how many ballots they have counted, how many exactly are left. They're not giving reports to us. They say, you know, \"We'll get back to you in 24 hours,\" and then it is completely dark. That also breeds distrust. People have no idea what in the world is going on. So I say again, there needs to be total transparency in this process. Allow poll watchers to come in from both parties. States should be giving regular updates so that the American people can have confidence, and going forward, we're going to have to pursue election integrity reforms."

We, for hundreds of years, we've allowed people who need absentee ballots to request them and then vote with them. But states sent the entire voter file ballots. Wasn't that, under the best of circumstances, a recipe for undermining the public's faith in an election outcome?"
    },

Two days later, we are still counting votes and awaiting the results in those states. Why? Why did a bunch of different states shut down voting on Election Night? These aren't crackpot questions. These are totally legitimate questions, and most people have not heard the answers. Michael Anton has written a fantastic column on this topic. He is the author of \"The Stakes: America at the Point of No Return.\" We're happy to have him on tonight. Michael Anton, thanks so much for coming on. You're among other things, a historian. I know that you care about our system more than any single politician. All of us I think, should feel that way. It does seem like people have legitimate concerns about whether the system is working fairly. Tell us what your concerns are. MICHAEL ANTON, AUTHOR, \"THE STAKES\": Some of the ones that you mentioned, why was voting stopped in five or six states -- I think it was actually five states and six cities for four hours. You know, why our ballots showing up? Mail-in voting, it has a lot of problems, you know, some obvious ones. You send ballots out to everyone, you never know who actually receives the ballot and when they come back. You could be sending them to people who have died without knowing. You could be sending it to people who have moved from the state. So that already has a problem. But there should be one advantage, right? If these things are mailed in, presumably, some of them will come in late, but wouldn't most of them be coming in months or weeks ahead of time? So why are we finding big trenches of ballots hours and in some cases, even days after the polls have closed? Shouldn't mail-in ballots already be there somewhere ready to be counted? And your point is exactly the right one. These are questions. They deserve investigations and answers, transparent answers, and when all we get back is, \"Shut up. You're a conspiracy theorist. You're attacking the integrity of our democracy.\" That doesn't give anybody confidence in the integrity of the system. It makes you suspect that something fishy is going on."

And look, I would say this, I think the person, you know, ironically, one of the people who will be harmed by this, if this continues and this plays out the way it is looking right now will be Joe Biden, to be perfectly honest. If I were Joe Biden, and I were convinced I won and I won, you know, comfortably or at least handily in a number of states and an accurate count would show that, I would be saying to everyone in my party, everyone in my campaign, I would be saying this to all the state elected officials and non-elected officials who are charged with vote counting, be transparent, be open. Let both sides examine this process and see what's going on, because I want the American people, the whole American electorate, including Donald Trump's 67 million voters, I want them all to be convinced that this was fair and that I won legitimately, so that I can govern with the full confidence of the American people in the system.

We've been talking about this all day. You've got a strong margin for Joe Biden. We believe at the moment, Tucker, there's proximately 85,000 ballots still to be counted here in Philly. You get a little bit out here in the suburbs of Bucks County, the collar counties here. Bucks County, we think there's about 34,000 votes still to be counted. A difference right now of 8,800. So how they come in through the course of the night and by the way, Pennsylvania is counting in two, by the way. I'll try and pop up Allegheny County. So in Pittsburgh, you're talking a difference between the two raw votes of 128,000. Last check, there were about 35,000 ballots still outstanding in Pittsburgh. So that covers Pennsylvania. Tucker, down here in Georgia. This thing has just been moving closer and closer all day tonight, 8:22, our time on the East Coast, the difference in the entire state right now in Georgia, 3,400 ballots. Arizona is going to give us a bit of a dump around nine o'clock Eastern Time.

Jason Whitlock has thought a lot about this and wrote a fantastic piece about it today. He is with Outkick.com, of course. We're happy to have him on tonight. Jason, thanks for coming on.

And I think and again, I'm not talking about Donald Trump and Joe Biden there specifically. They are not the parable of hate. I'm talking about their supporters. And Donald Trump's support is coming from people who love Donald Trump, who unconditionally love Donald Trump to the point that they will risk their health and go to maskless rallies of thousands of people. They'll risk their reputations and be accused of being racist and sexist. They'll risk their safety in terms of being attacked by Antifa or Black Lives Matter. They love Donald Trump. Biden supporters hate Donald Trump. That is their energy source. It has nothing to do with Joe Biden. And so, this is about can you take hate and turn that into something that's a winning formula for you? Is hate a more powerful motivation for a base of supporters? And is that how we are going to be deciding elections and deciding who we support? Can we rally enough hate of the opponent to win an election? I think it's a sad statement about where we are in this society as it relates to politics. I think it's a sad statement on where we are in terms of our relationship. This was a country founded on Judeo-Christian values and we are moving completely away from that. God is the embodiment of love, and we are a society that seems to be embracing and favoring hate and empowering hate. And if this election swings for Biden, it's a statement about hate and its power to conquer love if supported by what I believe is corruption."

Again, President Trump stands for a wall, America, America first, bringing manufacturing jobs back. He stands for things and he actually has expressed the ideas. It is no different than Barack Obama. He was all about revamping the healthcare system. People love that. As it relates to Joe Biden, we don't know.

Why would you exclude people from watching something that affects the whole country? The Trump campaign says officials did not comply with the judge's ruling. COREY LEWANDOWSKI, SENIOR ADVISER 2020 TRUMP CAMPAIGN: A judge in this state issued a ruling that the Board of Election has summarily dismissed. They believe they are above the law. It is shameful that the Boards of Election here in Pennsylvania thinks they do not have to listen to a judge's order.

It's called a canvas watcher -- a pre-canvass/canvass watcher and I walked into the Convention Center yesterday at 8:00 a.m. not knowing what I would expect and there was really no direction and it was complete chaos. And it was at that point that I had the opportunity to talk to one of the Trump attorneys and I said, listen, we have a 50,000 square foot facility here and we have steel barriers being set up. Let's say, for optical purposes, one-eighth of the place is free for the people that are supposed to supervise to watch the people that are counting votes, which is a complete farce, okay. You can't make this up. You can see from the videos that I've sent to FOX News, and nobody gave any direction. There were eight-hour shifts and you can do whatever you want. And I started watching. And I said, wait a second, you can't see anything. The closest desk, okay, let's put things in perspective. The closest desk was 30 feet. The farthest desk was probably 150 feet. And you knew this was orchestrated. Everybody had yellow jackets, okay, that's how they orchestrate it. However, nobody knew where these people went and I started looking to the right hand corner and at that point, yesterday, I started taking videos, I said, what are those black trash bags in the right hand corner that filled up the Convention Center. And there was no communication, and when people asked questions, they were really -- you know, they wouldn't answer them. And at that point, you know, you said to yourself, listen, something is wrong here. Something is wrong. So I left yesterday at four o'clock. I came back today and I started taking videos and pictures inside the Convention Center. And the reason you and I are talking is one went viral. Okay. And I really feel sorry for this individual.

There are some legitimate questions there. It does appear in Pennsylvania that these monitors or observers did face barriers, did face obstructions. There are court orders that went for the Trump campaign to get them greater access. It's a mystery to me why the Pennsylvania officials are litigating this question, because it certainly does fulfill the suspicions of people that there is something going on. So, I don't know why they would do this. But I'm actually looking more closely at the Nevada litigation right now. You know, the Trump campaign is saying that they have evidence of people out of state and even deceased individuals who were allowed to vote. That's the type of thing that really pops out, because most of the challenges in these types of elections, and you and I have been covering them in the past 2000 are usually incremental. You know, you usually grab a group of pallets here, a group there. In the aggregate, they can make a difference if it's a very narrow margin. But what we really look for are those cases where there are large groups of ballots that have been challenged. The Nevada case could be that type of challenge, you know, if -- because it's not just that they believe that there is 10,000 people who may have voted who are ineligible, it would indicate that there was a systemic failure. That's the type of allegation if it's true, that could lead to close judicial scrutiny. So, we're waiting to see if there is evidence of that. We have not seen it yet. The Pennsylvania lawsuit is also worth looking at because they are saying that a judge effectively rewrote the election laws and that some ballots that were late processed are counting. We still don't know how many ballots that would be, but it's already been to the Supreme Court. And then John Roberts sort of kick that can down the road. Well, the can is rattling back to the court this week."

And they -- you know, and Donald Trump is sort of a singular force of hatred in the media. And look, he says things and he does things and he is very polarizing. And frankly, you know, I completely agree, every vote should be counted. Everyone goes in and says things like, you know, declaring victory. You know, I think that's irresponsible, too. But I will say this, when people don't know any Trump supporters, they then extrapolate that hatred onto supporters of Donald Trump, onto just average voters who happen to vote for Donald Trump for any number of reasons. You know, black people, Hispanic, LGBT, doubled, 28 percent of LGBT Americans voted for Donald Trump. These are not racist and homophobes. But when you get the media members, you know, who then take their hatred of Donald Trump, put it on average Americans who don't harbor any sort of hatred here, you get this sort of -- the reaction that we see from the supporters who are stunned by it.

Mollie Hemingway is that person. She is a Senior Editor at \"The Federalist.\" We're happy to have her. Mollie, what's your assessment as of right now?"

      "utterance": "It is just so important that people be able to have trust in their election process and there are many reasons why conservatives don't have that trust in the process right now, and what's happening is a lot of elite institutions are trying to sort of bully conservatives into accepting what these elite institutions want. You have Big Business telling people that they have to accept Joe Biden as President. You have Big Tech censoring any legitimate questions about what they are seeing -- what people are seeing happen in states across the country, where ballots are being found, all in a very similar direction. And then you have Big Media, which spent the last four years doing everything in their power to destroy Donald Trump, to get him ousted, saying that there are -- that there is no reason why conservatives or Republican voters or Trump supporters should have any problem at all. This is precisely the wrong approach. These people have destroyed their credibility and they are not in a position to tell people what they should feel or think about what they're seeing. The only way for people to have confidence is through transparency and accountability and that's not what they are seeing in very key states here. And so it is important, no matter who is elected President that people be able to have confidence and really believe that the vote is fair. We are very far away from that and that will have serious ramifications, no matter who is elected President."
