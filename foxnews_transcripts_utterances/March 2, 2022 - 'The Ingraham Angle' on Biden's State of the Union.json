Now, in other parts of the country, the shelling has been the most intense since the conflict began. We're going to have live reports on the ground throughout the hour.

If you want to really undermine Putin, take away the money he's making to go and invade Ukraine, open up American energy, it was working really well under President Trump. But it also undermined Putin's ability to have control over Europe. Biden gave him that leverage. And by the way, Putin is making $700 million a day, every day that he's selling oil to the United States and Europe. We can take that leverage away by opening up American energy, raiding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would then run out we would have no reserve left. Open up all the vast resources that we have, the abundant American resources.

And instead, it was like he gave a speech for a different country where things are sort of OK, and where the last year hasn't seen. All these bad things happen as a result of Biden policies, our energy situation is bad, because Biden on day one decided to keep our energy from being produced. That's why Russia has leverage over Europe and the U.S. in part. The border is insecure, because Biden intentionally made it insecure.

That was one of the things that they asked for months ago. Joe Biden said no. Imagine how different things would be today if Ukraine had those surface to air missiles, all the carpet bombing you're seeing cluster bombs, bombing of schools and daycare centers and hospitals. They would be able, the people of Ukraine would be able to stop those planes and helicopters from coming in, but Joe Biden said no. And he's had a history of this. You know when he was with Obama and they were asking for tank busting missiles, Obama and Biden said no. It was President Trump who gave them those Javelin missiles. Well, you fast forward, you go to what happened just in the last year, the Joe Biden didn't give him the arms that they needed. If he saw it coming, why didn't he help the people of Ukraine? They're trying to scramble to get things like Patriot or Stinger missiles in today. But there's a war going on in the country. It's kind of hard to get those arms in now.

It is these policies that are unpopular, it's not Biden, it's not the way he messages things, it's the actual policies that are causing so much trouble for the economy, for our national security, for our sovereignty as a nation. That's what people are turning against, not individual personalities. And I do have to say, I do think this was a difficult speech to listen to. I think President Biden should try to give speeches earlier in the day. You said he didn't have many gaffes, but it was actually hard as a listener to listen to him struggling so much to just start ticking eight basic words.",

And he has warned, his defense ministry has warned, that, that will continue today. Yesterday we saw Putin's forces take out a well-known landmark, the television tower in Kyiv. And there is growing fear now that he's going to pull back and continue this crushing bombardment of built-up areas. And they also rained down rockets yesterday on the second biggest city of Kharkiv. While Russia's defense ministry urged residents of both cities to flee today saying it was going to strike unspecified areas within the city and hit their communications. However, when it comes to that 40-mile long, armored convoy that we have been talking about, the one that had been bearing down on Kyiv, it has actually made no advances over the last 24 hours. And a U.S. official now saying in fact that it has been beset by logistical problems, supply issues short on fuel and food. And there is growing talk that actually, this is not going the way that Putin hoped it would. And that is why he is doubling down. That is why he's using his heavy artillery. That's why he's using his rockets. The death toll, it keeps rising, and so does the Exodus. The U.N. now saying that 677,000 people have left in the past six days, that number rising by about 100,000 today at the moment, again, no one knows what today will bring.

What it is actually more likely to do is infuriate some of his own people. And they always said that the problem was some kind of an occupation. The problem with getting bogged down here in the Russian death toll rising was that eventually they felt his own people might turn against him. The fact is that we're, we're also learning that many of the soldiers who came into Ukraine, the Russian soldiers, felt that they were coming as peacekeepers so they would be welcomed by the Ukrainians. There are text messages that the Ukrainian had been Ukrainian government have been releasing between soldiers and their families back home saying we thought we were going to be welcomed when we arrived and now, we've been told to shell cities. So, there is actually a concern on the Russian side, no doubt that this might turn Russian public opinion against him. But what is most likely to enrage Vladimir Putin is a sense of this is not going how he wanted. And if he finds himself backed into a corner, he's going to do what we've seen him do over the last day or two and that brings out the heavy artillery and hits the people. He's done it before. He did it in Chechnya. It is a playbook of his, when he's not doing well, he doubles down.",

That's because the Polish authorities as well as those in Romania and Moldova, other bordering countries are waving women and children through now doing everything they can to ameliorate the refugee crisis. But, Laura, this -- the interesting thing here is I'm a -- I'm a child who grew up in Cold War Europe. I watched the fall of the Berlin Wall, we watched the collapse of the Soviet Union, we saw the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, and we have not really seen any kind of refugee crisis like there is now since then. Also, checkpoints are springing up all over Ukraine now. They are manned simply by men with guns who want to do what they can for their country of Ukraine, Laura. And again, I have not seen those kinds of checkpoints on European soil since I was in Serbia during the Kosovo conflict. That's more than 20 years ago.

If you want to really undermine Putin, take away the money he's making to go and invade Ukraine, open up American energy, it was working really well under President Trump. But it also undermined Putin's ability to have control over Europe. Biden gave him that leverage. And by the way, Putin is making $700 million a day, every day that he's selling oil to the United States and Europe. We can take that leverage away by opening up American energy, raiding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would then run out we would have no reserve left. Open up all the vast resources that we have, the abundant American resources. You will lower gas prices at the pump, and you'll take billions of dollars out of Putin's pocket, so it can't use it against the people to Ukraine."

All these bad things happen as a result of Biden policies, our energy situation is bad, because Biden on day one decided to keep our energy from being produced. That's why Russia has leverage over Europe and the U.S. in part. The border is insecure, because Biden intentionally made it insecure. And rather than address these things, he just sort of tried to take credit for some things that were done in the previous administration and generally acted like all the problems that we all live with all the time aren't real."

Keep in mind, Laura, this is the same president who said right when Afghanistan was about to fall that Afghanistan wasn't going to fall -- in within 48 hours, the Taliban had control of the entire country. But if you look at what happened in Ukraine, a month ago, the Ukraine Government was asking America for help with surface to air missiles, for example. That was one of the things that they asked for months ago. Joe Biden said no. Imagine how different things would be today if Ukraine had those surface to air missiles, all the carpet bombing you're seeing cluster bombs, bombing of schools and daycare centers and hospitals. They would be able, the people of Ukraine would be able to stop those planes and helicopters from coming in, but Joe Biden said no. And he's had a history of this. You know when he was with Obama and they were asking for tank busting missiles, Obama and Biden said no. It was President Trump who gave them those Javelin missiles. Well, you fast forward, you go to what happened just in the last year, the Joe Biden didn't give him the arms that they needed. If he saw it coming, why didn't he help the people of Ukraine? They're trying to scramble to get things like Patriot or Stinger missiles in today. But there's a war going on in the country. It's kind of hard to get those arms in now. And by the way, you'd have to train Ukraine Army how to use those Stinger missiles. That's not working."

And I looked at him, I said, what do you want $8.00 gasoline? And the truth is Laura, they do. They're committed to this crazy agenda. The good news is, the American people see through it, they understand how crazy it is. That's why there's a 63 percent disapproval rating for Joe Biden.

This is the president, Joe Biden, whose Administration called parents domestic terrorists if they dare go to a school board meeting and challenge these idiots that we're keeping their kids out of school, doing long term damage to kids; go on against the science that said kid should be in school because he wanted to bow to the teachers' unions, and he changed the CDC guidance even because the teachers union said they wanted it rewritten. So, people aren't going to forget that he thinks maybe just by saying all of these things tonight, people forget what he did the last year, they're not going to forget because he keeps doing it. And if you listen, he kept trying to sell Build Back Better, the failed, even Democrats said enough of the crazy spending, he was trying to sell this idea of spending trillions more dollars and raising taxes. He talked about inflation, and then he talked about raising taxes to 50 percent on companies, which by the way, means we're all going to pay more at the grocery store, at the shopping center if we go buy things. Thank God, we're not going to be able to that won't pass. But that's what Joe Biden still is trying to do. He doesn't get it, and the voters get it. And they're going to have a say in November."

But also, you know, he talked about funding the police instead of defunding the police. After defunding the police had been a major Democrat initiative for years and particularly for, again, that hard left base. But it's worth remembering that the, the Democrat Party is pretty unified on all these things. They like to pretend that some of their people are moderate, like Joe Biden, they like to pretend that he is versus some of these more extreme people. They all vote in lockstep. Almost everyone has voted with the Biden agenda. With just very few exceptions in the Senate. It is these policies that are unpopular, it's not Biden, it's not the way he messages things, it's the actual policies that are causing so much trouble for the economy, for our national security, for our sovereignty as a nation. That's what people are turning against, not individual personalities. And I do have to say, I do think this was a difficult speech to listen to. I think President Biden should try to give speeches earlier in the day. You said he didn't have many gaffes, but it was actually hard as a listener to listen to him struggling so much to just start ticking eight basic words."

And I mentioned the CNN poll, they just released the results of what they call the speech watchers poll. And when it comes to addressing key issues enough, 69 percent said Biden adequately addressed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That goes to what Tom said. Only 47 percent thought the same for inflation. Only 46 percent thought the same for violent crime. The poll also asked if Biden speech made them feel more confident. Only 30 percent said yes, 14 percent said less confident, and it made no difference to 56 percent. The poll also asked which issue in Biden's speech was most important to them? 64 percent said the economy, 36 percent said Ukraine.

Recently, I got that the President was getting about 33-34 percent approval on Ukraine, why? Because the public felt that he didn't stop the invasion, and therefore that with failure of policy. And I, I think the President has a problem going out and giving the remarks he gave, if the Ukraine falls, he will again seem to have totally failed. And, and he was strongest on that issue. And I think is the pole reflects. But really, once you're credible on inflation, immigration, crime, the economy generally, not really. And I think the poll really suggests that on the core issues where he's having problems, not a message, but a performance. He didn't do the kind of pivot, particularly when it comes to energy and energy prices, that would have made a big difference."

That's a big risky bet, given we don't know what's going to happen tonight, tomorrow night, if Putin is going to stay there -- if I mean, we have no idea.

And that's why think they lead with Ukraine, in part, because it gives them an opportunity to do that. Now, whether that changes public perception or not, we'll see. But to your point, it was a risky bet to lead with that, particularly when everyone knows that inflation in the economy is the number one issue in the minds of American has been for a long time.

And as you know, if you're in, and people think that about the economy, that is the most devastating possible thing that you have to reverse, or at least seem to be on the side of people. And when I asked people about, hey, what what kind of inflation are you really feeling? It's gas prices and food prices. Those are the number one and two issues. He tried a little bit to address food prices, but he blamed big corporations for that he wasn't again really credible and more detailed.

And that's because yesterday, we saw Vladimir Putin increasing his bombardments on urban areas, on residential areas. And he has warned, his defense ministry has warned, that, that will continue today. Yesterday we saw Putin's forces take out a well-known landmark, the television tower in Kyiv. And there is growing fear now that he's going to pull back and continue this crushing bombardment of built-up areas. And they also rained down rockets yesterday on the second biggest city of Kharkiv. While Russia's defense ministry urged residents of both cities to flee today saying it was going to strike unspecified areas within the city and hit their communications. However, when it comes to that 40-mile long, armored convoy that we have been talking about, the one that had been bearing down on Kyiv, it has actually made no advances over the last 24 hours. And a U.S. official now saying in fact that it has been beset by logistical problems, supply issues short on fuel and food. And there is growing talk that actually, this is not going the way that Putin hoped it would. And that is why he is doubling down. That is why he's using his heavy artillery. That's why he's using his rockets. The death toll, it keeps rising, and so does the Exodus. The U.N. now saying that 677,000 people have left in the past six days, that number rising by about 100,000 today at the moment, again, no one knows what today will bring. But Vladimir Putin and his defense ministry making it very clear they are going to continue hitting these cities. Laura."

    {
      "speaker": "HALL",
      "utterance": "Well, that works two ways. I mean, yes, it may well infuriate Putin, though he's never shown any signs in the past about being concerned about the safety of his own soldiers. What it is actually more likely to do is infuriate some of his own people. And they always said that the problem was some kind of an occupation. The problem with getting bogged down here in the Russian death toll rising was that eventually they felt his own people might turn against him. The fact is that we're, we're also learning that many of the soldiers who came into Ukraine, the Russian soldiers, felt that they were coming as peacekeepers so they would be welcomed by the Ukrainians. There are text messages that the Ukrainian had been Ukrainian government have been releasing between soldiers and their families back home saying we thought we were going to be welcomed when we arrived and now, we've been told to shell cities. So, there is actually a concern on the Russian side, no doubt that this might turn Russian public opinion against him. But what is most likely to enrage Vladimir Putin is a sense of this is not going how he wanted. And if he finds himself backed into a corner, he's going to do what we've seen him do over the last day or two and that brings out the heavy artillery and hits the people. He's done it before. He did it in Chechnya. It is a playbook of his, when he's not doing well, he doubles down."

You know, in 1941, after Pearl Harbor, the Republican National Committee, the Democratic National Committee actually got together and promised not to conduct partisan elections after that, that we were completely unified as a country. We were unified during the Korean War, we were unified in the -- at least in the early days of the Vietnam War, something like in '68, something like 60 -- 55 percent of the American people supported the war in Vietnam. So it certainly the Cold War, there was bipartisanship support for anti- communism, that, especially in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, it started coming apart. And that's where the seeds are, is in the 60s and 70s, which produced the events of today, which is that we are no longer bipartisanship -- bipartisan when it comes to foreign policy.

Leadership, Laura is about unpredictability to keep your adversaries on their toes and clarity of communication. Joe Biden had neither tonight. And as you watch the syntax slip, it communicated weakness, unsteadiness, and frankly, that's why we're seeing our enemies emboldened and the media's constant reportage of Ukraine."

We only have a few minutes left of Mardi Gras. But for anybody who took part in it, we saw racists come together with joy and love. The outpouring of communal affection, that's unity. Joe Biden could take a lesson, so could the entire country. Watch how Americans can and should get along, and I love that we did it right this Mardi Gras."

    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a fascinating journey in, Laura. You come across the border from Poland and they have had miles and miles and miles of refugees backed up there. I have to say that that number has dwindled a little bit over the last 24 hours, certainly when we came in the backup on the Ukrainian side of the border was probably a couple of miles of vehicles. That's because the Polish authorities as well as those in Romania and Moldova, other bordering countries are waving women and children through now doing everything they can to ameliorate the refugee crisis. But, Laura, this -- the interesting thing here is I'm a -- I'm a child who grew up in Cold War Europe. I watched the fall of the Berlin Wall, we watched the collapse of the Soviet Union, we saw the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, and we have not really seen any kind of refugee crisis like there is now since then. Also, checkpoints are springing up all over Ukraine now. They are manned simply by men with guns who want to do what they can for their country of Ukraine, Laura. And again, I have not seen those kinds of checkpoints on European soil since I was in Serbia during the Kosovo conflict. That's more than 20 years ago. Make no mistake, Laura, this conflict has changed the face of Europe, it is very much taken the continent backward. And the problem is with Putin in charge of his forces still, at this point, and determined to press those forces in and around Ukraine that nobody knows where this will end, Laura."

I have really many friends in Kyiv. For some of them, I cannot get them. I cannot reach out because they're constantly sitting in basements of their apartments and in shelters, trying to hide because there are a lot of alarms and serins informing people about the possible airstrikes.

The place where I am to Kherson city, we are preparing to meet invaders all around the country. We create territorial defense forces. The country is mobilized more than 100,000 Ukrainians are ready to protect themselves with a weapon. And no one knows what will happen. But yes, Russians are going slowly.

We all see in the morning, the last day in Kharkiv, how they bombarded just a civilian district. And that civilian districts my close friends live and they reported that there were no military objects there the same was the tower in Kyiv.
