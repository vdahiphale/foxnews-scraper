What do Blue Origin's picture-perfect mission and inflation have in common? What if I told you today nothing at all, really? Because while Captain Kirk and company made things quick and landed even quicker, inflation is sticking around and the only thing it's doing is making Americans angrier. Today, FOX on top of a price rocket that won't stop at the grocery store, where Madison Alworth sees prices still jumping, at the gas pump, where David Lee Miller sees the cost of filling up still soaring, and at the White House, where Jacqui Heinrich sees a president now scrambling. At least with the Blue Origin guys, they're back safe and sound. The rest of us, safe to say just sounding off. We begin right now with Madison at a Paramus, New Jersey, grocery store checking in on the eye-popping cost of simply checking out -- Madison.",

The Consumer Price Index out today saying that over the course of this past year, prices have gone up 5.4 percent and that's from things like gas and other shopping, the biggest contributor being housing and food. And within food, there are some categories that have increased more than others. Let's take a look at some of the highest hitters in terms of that increase. So, when it comes to meat, you're seeing an increase of over 12 percent annually. Bacon up over 19 percent. Fish and seafood up over 10 percent. We spoke to shoppers today, and many of them say they are clearly noticing the sky-high prices when they shop.",

So numbers confirmed it this morning. Americans are still paying the highest prices in 13 years, the Consumer Price Index still at those elevated levels the past four months, and it's not going down much. And rent is a big reason, making up a third of the inflation gauge, and rents jumped the most in 20 years in September from August. Isn't that astounding? You also have hotel rooms and cruises costing a lot more these days. Cars and trucks are up 42 percent. Appliances like TVs and washer and dryers are not getting any cheaper either. Now, the good part of the story is that consumers are spending a lot more than usual. Stimulus money, vaccinations and businesses reopening are helping to boost the economy. And even though wages are picking up, they did go up 4 percent last month, that's not enough to offset the increase in consumer prices. So Americans aren't feeling wealthier because the prices they are paying are going up faster than their wages are. And inflation is also the main reason why Social Security benefits are going up by almost 6 percent for seniors. And that is the largest increase in almost 40 years. Now, as you can imagine, the Federal Reserve is watching all this very closely. And they have signaled very strongly again this afternoon that it will start cutting back on stimulus starting as early as maybe the middle of next month. We are still at least a year away from interest rates going up, despite the fact that you're looking at these highly elevated prices, Neil.",

And here in Manhattan, where the gas stations are few and far between, filling up your tank could very well empty your wallet. Take a look behind me at the signage. Your eyes do not deceive you, a gallon of premium rounded up $4.90 and it will even cost you more for premium, $5.40 a gallon. According to AAA, the average price nationwide for a gallon is now $3.29. That's a hike of 10 cents over the previous week. Gas is now at the highest price since October of 2014. Surging crude oil prices are to blame. They are now at a seven-year high. AAA says crude prices account for at least half the price that you pay at the pump. The top three most expensive states to buy gas, California, where it's averaging $4.44 a gallon, followed by Hawaii at $4.16, and Nevada, where it's $3.87. And back here in New York City, where most people don't even own a car, Gas prices are on average a little less than $3.5 a gallon. But if you need to fill up on the outskirts of Times Square, expect to pay around five bucks. Listen.",

This new bank surveillance scheme is not aimed at the wealthy or the big corporations. They're aimed at farmers, small businesses and families. They intend to track these total transactions each year. They believe -- Neil, I think this is tied to raising the SALT cap. They think they can get about $250 billion from the bank surveillance and the 80,000 new IRS agents. They think that's how they can pay for several years or more of the SALT cap repeal, which, as you know, half of that goes to millionaire households or bigger.",

And within food, there are some categories that have increased more than others. Let's take a look at some of the highest hitters in terms of that increase. So, when it comes to meat, you're seeing an increase of over 12 percent annually. Bacon up over 19 percent. Fish and seafood up over 10 percent.

The cost of just pretty much everything you buy running at a 5.4 percent annual clip, and therein lies the rub, and, by the way, not just when it comes to food. Susan Li with more on that -- Susan."

      "speaker": "SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, that's right. Daily life is getting more and more expensive. You feel it when paying the rent, booking a hotel, buying a new car, and then filling it up. So numbers confirmed it this morning. Americans are still paying the highest prices in 13 years, the Consumer Price Index still at those elevated levels the past four months, and it's not going down much. And rent is a big reason, making up a third of the inflation gauge, and rents jumped the most in 20 years in September from August. Isn't that astounding? You also have hotel rooms and cruises costing a lot more these days. Cars and trucks are up 42 percent. Appliances like TVs and washer and dryers are not getting any cheaper either. Now, the good part of the story is that consumers are spending a lot more than usual. Stimulus money, vaccinations and businesses reopening are helping to boost the economy. And even though wages are picking up, they did go up 4 percent last month, that's not enough to offset the increase in consumer prices. So Americans aren't feeling wealthier because the prices they are paying are going up faster than their wages are. And inflation is also the main reason why Social Security benefits are going up by almost 6 percent for seniors. And that is the largest increase in almost 40 years. Now, as you can imagine, the Federal Reserve is watching all this very closely. And they have signaled very strongly again this afternoon that it will start cutting back on stimulus starting as early as maybe the middle of next month. We are still at least a year away from interest rates going up, despite the fact that you're looking at these highly elevated prices, Neil."

And here in Manhattan, where the gas stations are few and far between, filling up your tank could very well empty your wallet. Take a look behind me at the signage. Your eyes do not deceive you, a gallon of premium rounded up $4.90 and it will even cost you more for premium, $5.40 a gallon. According to AAA, the average price nationwide for a gallon is now $3.29. That's a hike of 10 cents over the previous week. Gas is now at the highest price since October of 2014. Surging crude oil prices are to blame. They are now at a seven-year high. AAA says crude prices account for at least half the price that you pay at the pump. The top three most expensive states to buy gas, California, where it's averaging $4.44 a gallon, followed by Hawaii at $4.16, and Nevada, where it's $3.87. And back here in New York City, where most people don't even own a car, Gas prices are on average a little less than $3.5 a gallon. But if you need to fill up on the outskirts of Times Square, expect to pay around five bucks. Listen."

Two major ports of entry are going to be expanding their hours, Los Angeles moving to 24-hour, seven-day-a-week operations, Long Beach adding overnight and weekend shifts. Warehouse unions agreed to work overtime. Carriers like UPS and FedEx agreed to increase their volume and get their goods out of there.

I might add parenthetically one of the reasons why I think it's very important that we get the infrastructure plan passed."

He instead allowed progressives to stave this off, to block it until the social spending piece that they have been withholding their votes in order to get is also passed at the same time. That bipartisan bill, by the way, would give $17 billion to ports alone. So you're beginning to hear from the administration just how important it is to get that infrastructure bill done, because it's going to directly address the problem that we're seeing, Neil."

Made him a one-termer. What's the potential impact here? Bob Cusack, The Hill editor in chief. Bob, while people always talk about, it's the economy, stupid, sometimes its prices out of control, stupid, that can do it, too. What do you think of the early impact politically of this?"

That is a state that has been trending toward the Democrats for many, many years. So I think that's the political concern. The policy concern with the president's numbers really tanking since the spring -- he had a good start -- first 100 days went well, got the COVID-19 bill, but now they're tanking and he's now got to -- he's got to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill, plus another social spending bill, which could be $3 trillion to $4 trillion. That's honestly -- there's no way they're going to pay for all of that. And that's not only going to exacerbate the concerns, Neil, of inflation going even higher."

What they say is more than offsetting the potential price pressures is the fact that it's going to keep the economy humming and the people will like all the benefits of that spending.

Jay Powell has been downplaying the concern about inflation for months, and now he's saying it's frustrating, and now they have got to rethink what the problem is and how bad it's going to get. And, of course, this comes in the backdrop of the question of whether Biden will renominate him for another term."

You don't want to do anything to hint to the president you're going to be raising rates or directly assaulting inflation. That could hurt your chances of getting nominated. But it could also mean that, if he is, that's exactly what he does."

We're going to be exploring a little later in the show the prospect you might not even be able to get the tree. And then it brings up the question of Christmas itself.

We are going to make sure that we have this situation, this IRS expansion or strengthening the IRS, in this tax and social spending bill. And it's really not a shocker because this is how Democrats plan to strengthen the IRS to pay for all of their social programs. So the proposal, essentially, as you said, would require banks, credit unions and all sorts of financial institutions to monitor your deposits and your withdrawals that are $600 or higher. It's part of strengthening the IRS to help pay for this -- quote -- \"zero dollar social spending plan.\" Now, Speaker Pelosi yesterday acknowledged that, yes, people are concerned and worried about it, but firmly pushed back and confirmed the tracking is definitely staying in this bill."

She's saying that the proposal does not involve reporting of any individual transactions of any individual, and this is really them just going after individuals who are failing to report their income and what they have earned. But even some Democrats out there like Senator Ron Wyden have said, look, Democrats should work on more -- quote -- \"reasonable criteria\" to make sure that they are focusing on the very wealthy. Pelosi did say, look, they're still under these negotiations and the $600 number that everyone's sort of been talking about, that could change. It could go lower. And so we will see what happens. But, yes, it's a great point that you brought up. It really doesn't feel like they're just going after the rich here."

To Congressman Kevin Brady, the man made possible those big tax cuts we got under Donald Trump. Congressman, when you are monitoring transactions as little as $600, you're not going after the Bill Gateses and Jeff Bezoses. You're looking at a much wider pool here. That's pretty obvious."

So, look, for years, when the IRS commissioner was truly independent, you would meet with them a couple times a year on the Ways and Means Committee, go through the tax gap, compliance technology, customer service, issues like that. And what they always told you, us, we think the cheaters are farmers and small businesses, but we don't know how to get after them. This new bank surveillance scheme is not aimed at the wealthy or the big corporations. They're aimed at farmers, small businesses and families. They intend to track these total transactions each year. They believe -- Neil, I think this is tied to raising the SALT cap. They think they can get about $250 billion from the bank surveillance and the 80,000 new IRS agents. They think that's how they can pay for several years or more of the SALT cap repeal, which, as you know, half of that goes to millionaire households or bigger."

The president's now nearly a million jobs short of what he promised from the last COVID stimulus. Certainly, that worker shortage, which they have been in denial about, is having a real impact on our recovery and Main Street businesses. And these higher prices, which, frankly, I think will get higher as the rental and housing incomes start to go into play here and higher health care costs, look, he's lost the competence of the American people. They don't trust him on his handling of the economy in any sense.

That's what they're betting on, that this package, should it pass, is going to have the same impact as Ronald Reagan's tax cuts had 40 years ago. What do you make of that?"

According to the flight data and the folks with Blue Origin, just two minutes after liftoff, the New Shepard rocket was already cruising past 118,000 feet, traveling more than 2, 200 miles per hour. Think of it, a minute later, 308,000 feet. Before it was all said and done, the Blue Origin suborbital flight reached a maximum altitude of more than 350,000 feet, more than 60 miles above the Earth's surface, providing quite a view and an experience, needless to say, for the four on board."

And he took his brother up in space and a student and a former NASA astronaut as well. But, today, Bezos was here on site. There were some jokes made. He played chauffeur actually and drove the vehicle, drove the crew from the quarters out to the launch pad. There was some joking that he was going to maybe get lost in the space capsule and go up for a second flight today. But, Neil, he stayed here watching safely from the ground with the rest of us."

But Walt Cunningham is here, a genuine American hero, the Apollo 7 astronaut.

They talk about it as like the civilians and being able to go in space and what have you. It's a totally different mission. And people need to appreciate that, because I can only tell you that our launch, our total launch just to get into orbit was just a few seconds under 10 minutes. And we were -- we were pretty busy on -- managing and looking at and monitoring all of the systems in that spacecraft just to keep people alive. And that's not quite what goes on today.

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, in this environment, where you talk about China and the fact it has a lock on information, but I remember from your days here, John, you were quite concerned about the fact so much of the world's labor and so many things and minerals we depend on to say, to this present day, simple chips and other sources, they're all in China. They're the lion's share of all of China. And I'm just wondering where this is leading."

      "speaker": "MOODY",

      "speaker": "MOODY",

      "utterance": "All right. Thank you, John Moody. So good catching up with you. The book is \"Of Course They Knew, Of Course They...\" And, again, it gets into all the possibilities and links them all together. Again, it's fiction. But I'm telling you, you will be reading page by page. It's a page-turner. You will be startled by how it sounds pretty much like real life. We will have more after this."

      "utterance": "Christmas canceled? Remember that famous scene in \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" where there's a bad storm, and Santa Claus says, we're going to have to cancel Christmas? And I thought to myself, storms are storms, but you don't think canceled Christmas. Calm down. But the fact of the matter is, we're looking that way right now. It has nothing to do with storms, unless you want to call inflation and short supply a storm. Mac Harman probably might agree with that, Balsam Brands CEO, maker of all these beautiful Christmas trees right now that are in short supply. So forget about having presents to put onto your tree. You might have a devil of a time finding the tree. What's going on here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAC HARMAN, CEO, BALSAM BRANDS",
      "utterance": "Well, good to see you, Neil. It's crazy right now. The supply chain crisis that everyone's finally talking about has been affecting us for months. And so it's been really hard for us to get all of our different holiday decorations from all over the world here to the United States, because the ocean lines are backed up, the ports are backed up. And the biggest thing, we can't get truckers to get them from the ports into our warehouses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, where, Mac, are the trees coming from? Where do you get most of them? Because these are artificial trees, we should stress. But go ahead."
    },

      "speaker": "HARMAN",
      "utterance": "We mostly sell prelit artificial trees at Balsam Hill, and they are primarily manufactured in China. But we have goods ornaments, tree skirts, all those things coming in from all sorts of places, Europe, India, other places. And they're all stuck right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And where are they stuck, outside this port in California or everywhere?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARMAN",
      "utterance": "They're stuck in all sorts of different places. The biggest place they're stuck is outside of California. We do ship in through lots of different ports in the U.S., New York, Savannah and Texas. But there are so many ships stacked up outside on the West Coast ports. They just can't get unloaded fast enough. And the president today has announced a big initiative finally to get to it. But the problem is, we have got to get truckers to get those goods out of the ports into our warehouses. And that's the biggest shortage that we're seeing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Your trees are beautiful. If people aren't unfamiliar, they don't look at all -- because they're stunning. But do you have a backup line of, I don't know, Charlie Brown Christmas trees in case you can't get the real nice ones because they're in short supply? What's your backup plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it's funny. About six months ago, we said, geez, if we can't get our trees here, what are we going to do? And we looked into selling live trees again, which we used to do, so freshly cut trees that we'd sell on our Web site. And we called some of the suppliers and said, we're sold out. I can sell you trees in 2024."

      "speaker": "HARMAN",
      "utterance": "And so, fortunately for us, we got ahead of it. And so we do have trees here. We don't necessarily have wreaths. We don't necessarily have all the ornaments that we want to have. But we do have the trees. We just may not have the exact species of tree or height of tree or light type that you might want."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Got it. Keep us posted, Mac. Very good seeing you again, Mac Harman, Balsam Brands CEO. See, the trouble with getting presents under the tree, the tree itself, it's a mess, right? And, by the way, in Washington, they could be working right through the holidays, which is fine, because they're not going to have any holidays, right? It's that bad -- after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, if President Biden had to say what he wants for Christmas, it would probably be getting both infrastructure bills signed, sealed and delivered, at least to him, so he could sign, seal them and deliver them to the American people. But he's having a devil of a time right now making any progress on that. So he might end up with just coal here. But let's get the latest from Chad Pergram where things stand. Hey, Chad."

      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good afternoon, Neil. Well, cuts are essential of Democrats are going to get anywhere with their original $3.5 trillion spending bill. Liberal Democrats want it all, but can't have it all. They must whittle down their massive spending package. What makes the cut and what is on the chopping block?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PELOSI",

      "utterance": "I like the idea of that possibility that perhaps, rather than looking at a 10-year allocation, that it could be something smaller, which would reduce the amount of the overall package. I like the idea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin worries that's a gimmick. He fears Congress will automatically re-up the programs later. New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez implores congressional leaders to maintain funding for immigration, public housing and public transportation. Progressives still want to spend $3 trillion. But this will all come down to two people, Manchin and Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema -- Neil."

      "utterance": "Nancy Pelosi wants to do this by the 31st. It is doubtful. There's a lot of concern here on Capitol Hill that if Democrats lose the Virginia gubernatorial race, there might not be the political capital to move this sometime in November. So they want to get it done as early as possible. But if you get into November or December, who knows?"

Well, the good news on the day was that William Shatner, at 90 years young, got to briefly lift off from this planet, take a look down. You can't see any of the arguing going on in Washington. You can't see any of the people freaking out. You can't see any of the threats on supply of goods that will or will not make it for Christmas. All you see is the pristine beauty of a planet.
