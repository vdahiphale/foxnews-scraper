Yesterday, the New York Times' editorial page tantalized its readers by predicting a long and painful ordeal for the President and those close to him. \"Political investigations tend to be marathons rather than sprints. With his investigation, Mr. Nadler is looking to build a case for impeachment, so compelling it will have enough bipartisan support to survive the Republican controlled Senate. Barring that his investigation will serve to keep the heat on Mr. Trump and perhaps keep the democratic base at least somewhat placated as the next election approaches. At least they admit that this is an entirely politically motivated attack meant to soften up the President for 2020 and dangle some red meat on a hook for their base. Now note the wishful thinking.

My friends, Congress specifically delegated to the President the authority to declare national emergencies. They did it long ago in Sections 201 and 301 of the national emergencies Act. If you're a logge, it's 50 USC 1601. He cited this in his official declaration, the President did as is required. And the President is already invoked his national emergency powers on three occasions adding to the 28th earlier national emergency measures that remain in effect today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is an important point. Congress has never before moved to end a President's emergency declaration. Until now. Now even though New York Times front page today painted a grim picture of what's happening at the border.

Happy Mardi Gras and Mardi Gras, come one so time for masquerading and partying before land. And tonight, we're going to unmask the motives of some of those who were trying to take down President Trump. Jim Jordan, Ranking member of the House Oversight Committee is here on the revolt from within and we're going to take you to New Orleans for an insider view of a real carnival and my ride with the crew of Orpheus. That's why I have no voice. Plus a former FEC Commissioner says AOC could face jail time for campaign finance violations. I thought she was all about transparency. And we have some alarming new numbers about the crisis at our border and it's an emergency as the Left wants us to focus on the plight just of illegals. Okay, well, we're going to separate fact from fiction but first, the resistance unmasked, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. All right, the democratic resistance is running at full tilt, making threats and launching investigations of 81 people and enterprises associated and some of them not even associated with President Trump. Now naturally the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Democratic Jerry Nadler's out bloviating for the President's impeachment."

Now I don't know what federal criminal law Nadler studied but my legal background says that is just ludicrous. Now contrary to what Nadler and company claim, none of this is about exercising their constitutional right to oversight of the executive branch. I want you to understand that, it's not about what they say it's about so document request, who needs documents? Why hear testimony? They've already made up their minds. Mueller by the way, has spent two years investigating Russia's possible collusion in the 2016 election and it looks like it's come up with nothing. He's issued indictments called witnesses before the grand jury. He's interviewed more than 40 people. He's reviewed over a million documents and he's even referred separate matters to the Southern District of New York. And remember the Democrats' glowing words about Mueller when he was appointed."

Why did they trust him then to get to the bottom of things, he was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Even Ty Cobb says so now. Now the way I see now Nadler well, come on, I said, Nadler is going to almost entirely retill the ground that Mueller has already passed over. But why is Nadler doing this? Getting back to our theme of unmasking. For the sole purpose of creating a political spectacle and to continue it right up until the last vote is counted in 2020. Remember, President Nixon was threatened with impeachment for obstruction of justice. President Clinton was impeached for obstruction of justice so why is Nadler not moving forward with the articles of impeachment against President Trump immediately?"

      "utterance": "Actually that's not in the constitution either why would I - that's the constitution but a separate question, isn't that what Nadler has been trying to do with his recent impeachment media tour. He's been trying to convince the public that there are 1000 reasons to impeach the President even if he cannot prove a single one. Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neil is requesting the President's tax return from the IRS, that's a shock. Pelosi's spokesman says they will take all necessary steps including litigation if necessary to obtain them. What does that have to do with collusion? Well, anyway, all of this sends a thrill up the leg of the media resistance of course. Yesterday, the New York Times' editorial page tantalized its readers by predicting a long and painful ordeal for the President and those close to him. \"Political investigations tend to be marathons rather than sprints. With his investigation, Mr. Nadler is looking to build a case for impeachment, so compelling it will have enough bipartisan support to survive the Republican controlled Senate. Barring that his investigation will serve to keep the heat on Mr. Trump and perhaps keep the democratic base at least somewhat placated as the next election approaches. At least they admit that this is an entirely politically motivated attack meant to soften up the President for 2020 and dangle some red meat on a hook for their base. Now note the wishful thinking. I love that line on the editorial, thinking a bipartisan support for impeachment, well. Can you count that out completely? Well, at a time when Republicans should be bolstering the President's agenda on key issues especially. I see on one at least they're undermining him. And leadership can't seem to hold it together."

      "utterance": "Well, that's a really bold statement. I was supporting it but hoping he wouldn't take it, meaning he's not going to insist that his members put the real pressure as he could do on his members actually push - you know, look with all due respect, it is partly Mitch McConnell's fault that the President had to declare a national emergency at all. He and Paul Ryan promised the President when he signed that ridiculous omnibus spending bill last year, that they would get him the funding he needed for the wall, before last year ended, no matter what happened in the election. But what happened? Well, we predicted on this show, they didn't do it. McConnell has done a masterful job of getting judges for the Senate, phenomenal on the court, supreme court stuff, all of that. And he can't control how Collins and Murkowski, people like Rand Paul vote. But he basically signaled to them that their vote against the President on this issue of the national emergency was okay. My friends, Congress specifically delegated to the President the authority to declare national emergencies. They did it long ago in Sections 201 and 301 of the national emergencies Act. If you're a logge, it's 50 USC 1601. He cited this in his official declaration, the President did as is required. And the President is already invoked his national emergency powers on three occasions adding to the 28th earlier national emergency measures that remain in effect today. This is an important point. Congress has never before moved to end a President's emergency declaration. Until now. Now even though New York Times front page today painted a grim picture of what's happening at the border. Here's a quote. \"A feverish teenager with a vile-smelling wound on his foot. A man with a head injury and a bright red eyes. Children with fevers, coughs and colds.\" And the Customs and Border Patrol numbers of family units crossing the border was breathtaking."

It goes way beyond that and there's a lot more in that New York Times piece we're going to get into. And we will be naming names and unmasking the motives of those on the Left and some on the right who are working to stop stronger enforcement on our southern border which includes a physical barrier. The President must continue to stand firm on this issue and forge ahead against the chamber of commerce Republicans who want an endless flow of cheap labor and the open borders Democrats who think they have an endless supply of new voters. And as for the democratic impeachment squad, keep unmasking their real motives, you bet. If they cared about the constitution or the rule of law, they wouldn't have let the border get this out of control in the first place and they would have demanded that Hillary Clinton and her protectorate pay for their wrong doing. That's law and order, don't you think? This is a political war. All of this that you're seeing around you and it's meant to undo the President's successes and block his agenda for the next two years, that's all it's about. This isn't just harassment of President Trump. He said that today. It's harassment of the millions of Americans who voted for his agenda and it's an abuse of the entire democratic process that the Democrats claim to care so much about. And that's THE ANGLE. All right, joining me now with reaction, Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. Congressman, let's start on the border issue, then we're going to get back to what else is cooking but I mean, we're going to talk about this later but this is a national travesty and the Democrats will say, oh, it's not bad at all at the border. It's you know, interception of people are down. There are fewer people crossing, what's the real truth?"

So I always say, if what are we on? The fifth caravan? What do we need? Sixth caravan, seventh caravan, an endless caravan before we say it's an emergency. The President is right and some of the - the Republicans who are opposing the President as you said in your - in your opening, in your INGRAHAM ANGLE, some of those are the same ones who last year during the Congress, didn't want to get it done when we had the majority in both the House and the Senate. So this is something that's going to - looks like the Senate is going to vote to overrule the President's order but when the President vetoes and it comes back for veto, we'll be able to sustain this."

And they said, well, we don't really know but that's what we heard and that's what I realized in politics, there's a tendency to criminalize, delegitimize whoever your opponent is and I've always tried to resist it in politics. It's wrong when it was done to George Bush, it's wrong when it's done to Donald Trump and they built - the day Donald Trump was elected, the Democrats went up over drive trying to delegitimize him and they've never stopped.

Great have both you on. Howie, why does the New York Times after laying out, I want to read part of this. They lay out this harrowing story about the border and then they claim in an editorials that doesn't exist, this is part of what they wrote, let's start with today. An average of 2200 migrants a day are now crossing the 1900 mile border with Mexico. Many after grueling journey that leave them injured, sick or badly dehydrated. Yet most of the nation's customs and border protection facilities along the border lacks sufficient accommodations, staffing or procedures to thoroughly assess health needs or to provide more than basic emergency care. And then March 5, The New York Times editorial board says that national emergency doesn't exist.

So these kids are vulnerable to being trafficked. Ninety-three percent of these kids that we are recovering are outside the ports of entry. So where are they going?

In the case of the conservative assaulted on the campus of UC Berkeley, today prosecutors charged the suspect with three felony charges, one of assault likely to produce bodily injury, one battery with serious bodily injury, and one charge making criminal threat. Last month, 28-year-old Zachary Greenberg was caught on camera punching the victim, Hayden Williams, during a recruiting event on the California campus. Last Friday, 10 days after the attack, police identified and arrested the suspect. Williams and his attorney joined me exclusively right after that arrest."

We're going to continue to follow this story and bring you updates as we get them. Also tonight, could the Democrats shining new star be seeing some, well, shiny new prison bars? Congresswoman AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and her chief of staff are accused of illegally funneling nearly $1 million in campaign contributions in an effort to skate around campaign finance laws. The complaint claims that AOC's chief of staff took the money from the PACs that he established and move it into these private entities, LLCs, that he controlled and AOC was on the board of. Now, these are entities that could donate to political candidates and a lot looser on the regulations, and, of course, to candidates like AOC herself, for example. So what happened to the money, and what did the candidate know about it? FOX News caught up with her exclusively today."

Brad, first of all, it's nice to see the tables turned on some of these Democrats who are on their high horses all the time, claiming to have the moral superiority over everybody else. And suddenly, when they are on the defensive, they're like, no, let's get off of that escalator as soon as possible. And Brad, you say that Ocasio-Cortez could actually see jail time in this case? How serious are these violations or even accusations?"

      "utterance": "Sure. Let's be cautious about that, Laura. I've looked at this. I've been doing this for 25 years, as an academic studying it, as a commissioner on the FEC, as a lawyer advising clients. I've never seen this kind of set up. Knowing and willful violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act can result in prison time. But let's not be like the Democrats. Now we've got Trump. Now he's going to jail. My guess is AOC is not go to prison for this. but I do think there are very serious violation. I can't think of a way you get out of violations. There might be one. And it also shows, as you point out, the rank hypocrisy here. AOC is out there promoting this HR-1 bill the Democrats have that would put all kinds of great restrictions on ordinary Americans, grassroots groups, every little nonprofit, and every little trade association if they want to participate in politics. But he is out, and she has this chief of staff, Chakrabarti, who are doing things that seem to be -- I can't think of a way that you get out of a violation on this."

They threw the book at him in federal district court in New York, in Manhattan, because of money that was donated to a senatorial campaign of a friend of his, and it was like his wife, and I can't even remember. But it was de minimis amount of money, it was very little. In this case, and I want people to understand this, this is not wonky. This is very easy to understand. There were two political action committee, correct, started by this wunderkind chief of staff of hers, and that money ended up being funneled into a LLC that could donate money directly to AOC herself, correct?"

And that LLC, or that PAC took in over $2 million and paid out over $1 million to this LLC. But there is no accounting for what it did with over $2 million. It made $62,000 in contributions to candidates, nothing in independent expenditures. What did it do with all this money? Either it seemed to disappear into the pockets of Chakrabarti, or they used it to assist campaigns without reporting it, which would be a major, major problem."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "This gets confusing for most people. They were doing something they weren't supposed to do, and a lot of money was involved.
