Ask big and then gravitate towards the middle after having moved the Overton window in your direction. The only problem with that theory in this situation is that the White House had already apparently given some big concessions which they are now backtracking on. I think leverage goes to the Democrats because they are very happy to stand up to Trump vis-a-vis their base and to say you set this ticking clock. You said you wanted to help these kids. We are happy to keep this as an active issue for us. Your move. I think that Chuck and Nancy, as he calls them, are probably pretty pleased with this development, actually. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I think it's just as much of a problem for Democrats who really want to get something worked out on the deferred action. There is a deadline and there will be people who, by their own statements, really need to be taken care of. And if they don't do something, it's really incumbent upon people who say it's so important to act like it's important and work. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think Americans in general are pretty moderate on this. They want increased security, increased border security. They want enforcement, and they also want something that can help out people who were brought here illegally as children. And so I think for a lot of people outside this town, it just seems like why can't this be something that you work on it. And yes, a lot of people look at it as political leverage, but at some point there are actual lives not just for the people who are the children, or the adults brought who were brought here illegally as children, but also everybody else who is impacted by immigration laws. And this is something that people in this town really don't think about, which is how immigration policy affects people economically, it affects their security, and this is important. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",
