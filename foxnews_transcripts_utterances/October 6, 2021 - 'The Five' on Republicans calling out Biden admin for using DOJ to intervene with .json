If a teacher says your daughter has to share a locker room with a guy, you are going to complain. So, it seems like the Democrats go out of their way to protect the free speech rights of terrorists, anthem kneelers, stature topplers, leakers, and pornographers, but little Ms. Simmons, if she gets upset about something at a school board meeting, the g men are going to come and show up at her door. And what is the FBI going to do? They are going to do what they always do. They are going to infiltrate PTA meetings. They are going to entrap a soccer mom. All while people are trafficking women and they are ignoring tips about school shooters. That's what usually happens here. I think parents should resist this.

Joe Biden is underwater and honesty, economy, COVID, taxes, border, immigration, military, leadership, and competency. So, Joe is going to be of no help to the Democrats in the midterms.

There were few races that Democrats thought we could pick up that we weren't able to close the gap there. There were three polls so far in October. Quinnipiac is the only one that has Republicans up in the generic ballot. But Democrats in YouGov and Morning Consul the margins are getting tighter. Morning Consul was only D plus one, which is a tossup. Right? And when you don't have a president that's necessarily going to help you in every district, whereas -- that was the great thing about Joe Biden, that he was a unifier for all Democrats. You have everyone from AOC to the Tim Ryan's of the world touting his moderate bonafides and ability to work with everybody.

But the longer it goes, the less chance there is for it to happen. And I think the fact that it's the Republicans and the independents who are winning on the issue of prosperity and protecting the United States, and the polls that have come out after Afghanistan make it so clear that Joe Biden is seen as a bubbling, mumbling liar, and then his military comes out and they say something opposite of what he has says. I mean, every day, the news keeps getting worse for Joe Biden. My question is this, though. If the Republicans do get the House, are they going to do what the Democrats did with respect to impeachment? There are a lot of issues that Joe Biden could be impeached on, on a lot of legitimate issues. Will the Republicans have the chutzpah to do what the Democrats?",

Kerry thinks like listen, this guy just does it now here and it slipped and he did throw him under the yacht. But this is the biggest alliance or military development in the pacific for decades, this new alliance we have with the Australians and the British against the Chinese. If Biden didn't know about that and the implications about that, that is pretty scary we not only gave the Australian submarines, we gave them mid-range missiles that can hit the Chinese mainland, hit all their shipping lanes, and China can't do anything about it. They're out of range. So, the Chinese are humiliated, they're panicking and that's why they're lashing out against Taiwan to prop up the regime domestically, but you know, they're up, you know, what's creek.",

If a teacher says your daughter has to share a locker room with a guy, you are going to complain. So, it seems like the Democrats go out of their way to protect the free speech rights of terrorists, anthem kneelers, stature topplers, leakers, and pornographers, but little Ms. Simmons, if she gets upset about something at a school board meeting, the g men are going to come and show up at her door. And what is the FBI going to do? They are going to do what they always do. They are going to infiltrate PTA meetings. They are going to entrap a soccer mom. All while people are trafficking women and they are ignoring tips about school shooters. That's what usually happens here. I think parents should resist this.

And what's so incredible about all of this is that we've got little Johnny who is coming home from school, and Johnny says he's getting yelled at in class. He's six years old, he wears glasses.

There's video of people, of teachers and school board members being accosted on the street. It's my impression, just understanding, you know, President Biden and the people who work for him, Merrick Garland, they don't seem like irrational people that they are going to be talking about folks who are taking this to an inappropriate level versus just someone who is saying excuse me, I don't agree with this but at a curriculum.

It's always -- it was always about grace in civil life. And then she goes after Sinema. She felt the -- she felt that this was a cause for confrontation. She's a hypocrite.

Joe Biden is underwater and honesty, economy, COVID, taxes, border, immigration, military, leadership, and competency. So, Joe is going to be of no help to the Democrats in the midterms. And Trump is off the ballot so the Democrats aren't really going to be super juiced to turn out. And the Democrat's line that they want to run next year is a pandemic defeated and an economy renewed. Right now, we've already had more COVID deaths under Joe Biden than we have had under Donald Trump, and Democrats act like we are still in quarantine, like they are afraid to go to the grocery store. So, I don't know how that's going to play. And the economy is riddled with inflation and labor shortages because of these Biden policies. So, I don't know if they are going to be able to pull it off.

Because they had a really good night on the congressional level and they had a good night on the Senate level. There were few races that Democrats thought we could pick up that we weren't able to close the gap there. There were three polls so far in October. Quinnipiac is the only one that has Republicans up in the generic ballot. But Democrats in YouGov and Morning Consul the margins are getting tighter. Morning Consul was only D plus one, which is a tossup. Right? And when you don't have a president that's necessarily going to help you in every district, whereas -- that was the great thing about Joe Biden, that he was a unifier for all Democrats. You have everyone from AOC to the Tim Ryan's of the world touting his moderate bonafides and ability to work with everybody.

These are things that are bad for kids and maybe we should create an age limit. Like, for cigarettes and alcohol, there's a certain age limit to get on social media but not making it illegal.

And the next thing you know they call up CBS News owned by Viacom, a lot of money in China. She gets that treatment, and then the very next day she's testifying on Capitol Hill. How did that happen ahead of time? And now, she's verified on Twitter and she's flying to Europe to testify. This thing is too perfect the way she just passed the baton to the media who are all saying the same thing, trying to get their hooks into Facebook to control information flow. Again, you're right. This is about controlling information because they're upset that MAGA does well on that platform. And if I were Zucker, I'd be pissed. I'd say guys, I donated millions to the Democrats.

And as Dana pointed out last week and before that, it was magazines that were terrible for young women and the people who end up being models look a certain way and we know how destructive it is.

We commemorate the achievements of these -- excuse me -- trailblazing tomb guards. The old guard stated on social media while this historic event may be the first it's certainly not the last. During this time of the year, the military guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is changed in an elaborate ceremony 24 hours a day to stand guard.
