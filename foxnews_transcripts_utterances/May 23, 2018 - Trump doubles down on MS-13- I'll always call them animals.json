You have to work.\" Translation: Get off your butt and do something with your life. So now evicted, he worried about what's best for him. Which was the advice just given.

They're so worried about the words and it reveals the lopsided priorities. So, you've got a president who is worried about jobs, terror, North Korea, gangs. Meanwhile, you have another side that's concerned that he calls gang members animals. It's like -- imagine your house being on fire and your neighbors are complaining that the fire engines are too loud. That's what this is.

And that one of the ways they've gone after them is like they used to do for the mob through RICO, which is racketeering, and something, and something. I can't remember the exact words. But -- so I asked, well, then what laws that the president said today, like we need congress to do something, what do you think congress could do that could actually help law enforcement? And he said that he does believe that the lax border is a huge problem, because of the ability to regenerate and that they're recruiting at younger and younger ages.

The one thing -- I think today was important to bring attention to it. I did note that in Connell McShane when he was doing reporting for us today, that there's a local Democratic congressmen who was not invited to today's meeting and I think that was a mistake. I think -- because he said he would have gone if he had been invited. And why not try to co-opt some of them, Democrats, so that you can actually make this a bipartisan issue. And these people want to call it -- they want to make fun of the president for saying animals, like they just have to deal with their own politics on that side. But if you really want to solve the problem you will need Democrats, and the local congressmen is probably a good place to start."

And the backdrop behind the president said secure our borders, protect our communities. And one of the participants said you can't protect our community until you secure our border. And the president has that wide view. They do regenerate. And the contrast you see between the folks yelling about the animals comment is the president wants the rule of law, enforcing laws we have, versus lawlessness. He wants borders versus open borders. He believes merit-based immigration is better than the Russian roulette, not to use Russia, but the Russian roulette of who knows who's coming."

Nancy Pelosi's argument was a larger narrative about what the president's rhetoric on immigration overall and how this animal comment bleeds into that larger narrative. It was nothing to do with MS-13. If you ask any Democrat on Capitol Hill, they would say, yes, MS-13 is heinous, they're awful, and that's why we have laws like RICO, and other laws to make sure that gangs like that in this country don't spread. But you have to separate MS-13 from those individuals who, from the dreamers, you have to separate MS-13 from."

You know, if somebody -- I didn't rob a bank, but maybe in the past I might have, so he's probably guilty. If he's not guilty now, he was probably guilty then. It's an illogical argument. You can't say, and I use this analogy before, when you find a hate crime and it turns out to be false, the left says, well, it's false here but it could be true somewhere else.

And so, celebration excess is unsportsmanlike. Introducing politics into a game is unsportsmanlike. It's a sport, so it's unsportsmanlike. I've said this -- had to be a year and a half ago, and I've said, like, imagine if our viewers turned on The Five and instead of doing political conversation we were throwing the ball around for an hour. How upset would they be? That's no different than turning on NFL and having somebody introduced politics into something that is supposed to be enjoyable. And, finally, if you really believe politically in something it has to be - - there has to be a risk. So, my suggestion is that you do it within the game. You actually kneel in the field, because that incurs a cost against your team."
