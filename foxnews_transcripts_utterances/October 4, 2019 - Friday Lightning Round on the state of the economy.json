I think this argument that the process around how the whistleblower complaint was filed and how it came to be -- interesting, relevant, not the main story. The main story is what the president did, what the president said, and why he did and said those things. I think it's smart, frankly, though, from the White House perspective in terms of how to fight back on this to make Schiff front and center. I don't think he is a credible person. I think he has honesty problems, as we saw with that four Pinocchios award that he got from \"The Washington Post\" on this. He is a lightning rod.

And been he first efforts failed, whether it was going after the Electoral College or the Russia hoax, which went on for a very long period of time, and then it went into an attempt to get him out by claiming that by being upset at falsely being accused of being a traitor, that he was obstructing justice. And it is in the midst of this and seeing how the Kavanaugh fiasco played out and whatnot that people just aren't willing to believe what they are told is some huge problem, particularly when it's running in the exact same style as these other things were run. And so I think the problem for Democrats is that people aren't really buying what they are selling about it being a problem. They know enough about what happened in 2016, that our intelligence agencies were working with foreign governments to meddle in our own election. And the idea that you can't investigate that without then getting in trouble again, I don't think sells with a lot of people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I guess I see it very differently. And I agree the American public is exhausted from these issues. I think they are tired of talking about impeachment and Russia-gate, and all of these factors. I do think, however, that when you read that transcript, you look at what Kurt Volker put into the public domain yesterday with the very clear exchange where the president seems to be wanting to get a deal, Zelensky wanted a deal to get a meeting in the White House, and that was related to a national security issue, which is whether you provide this aid to Ukraine or not. I think this goes back, and it's very interesting. I will remember being on a stage with Tom Cotton at the convention, the Republican convention, asking him about the rumors I was hearing at the time about trying to interfere in the Republican platform over aid to Ukraine. And so this Ukraine thing has been around a lot, and it matters. When you see it in black and white from president doing it, I think it's something you can't walk away from. It doesn't mean that there aren't nefarious players trying to do it.

I think this argument that the process around how the whistleblower complaint was filed and how it came to be -- interesting, relevant, not the main story. The main story is what the president did, what the president said, and why he did and said those things. I think it's smart, frankly, though, from the White House perspective in terms of how to fight back on this to make Schiff front and center. I don't think he is a credible person. I think he has honesty problems, as we saw with that four Pinocchios award that he got from \"The Washington Post\" on this. He is a lightning rod.

Mitt Romney tweeted out \"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of a Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated. By all appearances, the president's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\" Thoughts? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think I'm going to disagree with the Guy a little bit on what the main issue is, because I think it actually relates to all of this, which is there has been an effort to get rid of Donald Trump going back many years. And been he first efforts failed, whether it was going after the Electoral College or the Russia hoax, which went on for a very long period of time, and then it went into an attempt to get him out by claiming that by being upset at falsely being accused of being a traitor, that he was obstructing justice. And it is in the midst of this and seeing how the Kavanaugh fiasco played out and whatnot that people just aren't willing to believe what they are told is some huge problem, particularly when it's running in the exact same style as these other things were run. And so I think the problem for Democrats is that people aren't really buying what they are selling about it being a problem. They know enough about what happened in 2016, that our intelligence agencies were working with foreign governments to meddle in our own election. And the idea that you can't investigate that without then getting in trouble again, I don't think sells with a lot of people."

Then the president came out and talked to reporters and essentially said China and Ukraine should investigate the Bidens."

I think they are tired of talking about impeachment and Russia-gate, and all of these factors. I do think, however, that when you read that transcript, you look at what Kurt Volker put into the public domain yesterday with the very clear exchange where the president seems to be wanting to get a deal, Zelensky wanted a deal to get a meeting in the White House, and that was related to a national security issue, which is whether you provide this aid to Ukraine or not. I think this goes back, and it's very interesting. I will remember being on a stage with Tom Cotton at the convention, the Republican convention, asking him about the rumors I was hearing at the time about trying to interfere in the Republican platform over aid to Ukraine. And so this Ukraine thing has been around a lot, and it matters. When you see it in black and white from president doing it, I think it's something you can't walk away from. It doesn't mean that there aren't nefarious players trying to do it. I think you have to get --"

Kurt Volker did testify yesterday, and what happened was he completely undermined the impeachment claims that were being put forward.

People are trying to redefine what he said as if he said something - -"

If you look at the changes since the president took office, GDP growth is down, however, unemployment rates you see is also significantly down, consumer confidence up, and most importantly, average hourly earnings up. Quickly on the economy, we've got a lot to get to here. Guy?"

There have been some red flags in the economy that the media has really focused on, but fundamentally it's strong.
