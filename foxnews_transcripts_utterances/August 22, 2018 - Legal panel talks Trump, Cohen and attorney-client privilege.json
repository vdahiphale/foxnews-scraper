She said \"I am deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absently false. I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett.\" Today TMZ released images of the two of them together in 2013 when Jimmy Bennett was 17 and Ms. Argento was 37. Also they released a text message exchange where she tells a friend of hers, and we'll put it on the screen. \"I had sex with him. It felt weird. I didn't know he was a minor until the shakedown letter.\" She paid him $380,000, working this out with Anthony Bourdain with whom she was involved. Now the Los Angeles police are investigating this, and she has been bumped off the \"X Factor\" in Italy which is a show she's a part of. When I look at this, Jason, and I look at the Catholic Church going through its own passion of sorts on these types of issues, everybody's got to be held to the same standard, no matter your gender, no matter what you believe. People need to -- if you are a victim of this abuse, you have to come forward. And the authorities should get involved. But the broad brushing we have been seeing of men or people of a certain religious persuasion should be put on the backburner and every one of these cases should be evaluated on their merits.

It has to do with the so-called lack of civil rights by police in big cities who are run by Democrats throughout the entire political process. So what's interesting is that this is a problem for Democrats from the past and it's a problem for Democrats right now that has been created by Democrats. So he wants to talk about the kneelers. If these guys really believed in kneeling, why didn't Colin Kaepernick kneel during the Barack Obama administration? It was happening then. And when did Colin Kaepernick help any black in any city, Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, name the city, what has he done prior to that kneeling to help any of the blacks that are being killed in crazy numbers every weekend by other blacks?

Fox News is the only network fully covering the case, and there are new developments tonight. Raymond Arroyo is here for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we will dissect some of the wild stories from the far left. A bizarre sex scandal and cage free animal crackers. And in Texas, a senate candidate -- senate candidate says he has no problem with the NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. We will have the tape to prove it. Plus, more immigration madness in California. There's a hotline to tip off illegal immigrants about ICE raids. More on this unbelievable story later in the hour. But first, Democrats and the left are absolutely salivating, absolutely giddy over the legal trouble faced by former Trump associates Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort.

I think Democrats who are pouncing on this are making a huge mistake. And in fact, there's a reason Nancy Pelosi and others have said to candidates running, this is not the card you are playing.

But I tell you, this thing started Jason, as a Russian collusion investigation. What do we have? We have taxicab confessions. We have a couple people accused of fibbing.

This is not a crime. This is at worst, at worst a civil violation that I don't even think its bad. Me running for office, I can donate to my campaign unlimited sums. Yes, I would have to report that, but this is debatable if this was even a campaign payment. Why? Richard is trying to debate it right here. Richard, let's be honest.

So let me get this straight, while Cohen and Manafort are facing serious prison sentences, everyone in Hillary Clinton's orbit is getting off scot- free. And what about the surveillance of members of the Trump campaign? No charges filed on that and no evidence that the special prosecutor is pursuing that. This all sounds like a two-tiered system of justice to me. Raising questions is the second special counsel needed. Joining me now for reaction are two lawyers, former U.S. attorney Kendall Coffey and Bryan Rotella, CEO and senior partner of GenCo Legal. I appreciate you both being here. I want to get your perspective as attorneys. This whole issue of attorney-client privilege, if you would go out and hire an attorney to do something, I presume that you do it to make sure that it's done legally and lawfully. And you have some protections in being able to give that information and make those things move forward. So, as you look at this situation, Kendall, isn't that a plausible story or scenario? How did that just only fall apart in the Cohen situation?"

Campaign finance laws are especially complicated, especially federal campaign finance laws. So, I strongly suspect not only did the president have no idea that somebody might put this on a prosecution radar screen someday, but I doubt Michael Cohen did. Because what is being talked about is a federal crime, was unsuccessfully raised against John Edwards. You remember that years ago --"

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Bryan, are we supposed to believe that every conversation now that Donald Trump has had with his attorney is somehow part of what the special counsel gets to look at? I think there is some sort of limitation because that attorney-client privilege isn't just waived on all of these issues, correct?"

      "speaker": "BRYAN ROTELLA, CEO AND SENIOR PARTNER, GENCO LEGAL",
      "utterance": "Yes, Jason. I mean, look, for your audience, anyone who heard this allocution that Michael Cohen gave yesterday, and an allocution might sound like something from \"The Sopranos.\" You know, I'm Italian-American and the folks would get up in front of the court and they would attest that there was a thing called the mafia in the United States. I'm not sure if the president should nickname Michael Cohen either better- not-call-Saul or Captain Obvious. I mean, that's pretty obvious when he got up and said yesterday, which is that the president, there are women that he was having relationships with outside of his marriage and that he thought that that might impact his view -- the folks' view on the election. To me there is nothing criminal about that, and getting to your question, as a lawyer, attorney-client privilege is the one sacred thing we have. Lawyers have terrible reputations so I think Kendall would even agree, unfortunately we have it for a reason a lot of times. And it looks like to me that Donald Trump has found himself in the Jurassic Park of lawyers. I mean, I'm waiting for the next raptor lawyer to come out of this thing between Lanny Davis -- and I was listening to your last segment who, you know, the stuff that he did back in the ‘90s, some of the things that we are seeing now with Cohen. And then also let's not forget that Jim Comey is an attorney. And you know very well Jason, look with that attorney did in his findings back on July 5th of 2016 when he found that Hillary Clinton was \"extremely careless with her e-mails.\""

I mean, for folks that may not remember, Lanny Davis was as entrenched in the 90s with the Clintons as episodes of Friends in blockbuster video. I mean, he was part of a culture. He is one of their best friends and that's who's the attorney for Michael Cohen. So the fact that one of your previous guests said that he got up and said what he said in couyrt, which I don't believe is a crime. It's Captain Obvious of something about President Trump. And if that's all that evidence that we've seen today about anything that has to do with President Trump in this investigation, I think it raises a lot of questions to folks out in America who are wondering what's all the billable hours going on in the Mueller investigation? That's all on the taxpayer's dime and I think they're probably pretty sick of it."

New tonight, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is saying she knows it's hard for the family of Mollie Tibbetts to deal with this tragedy, but the nation, she says, should focus instead on what she called real problems like illegal aliens being separated at the border from their kids. Now, the president is firing back tonight with a video on twitter that says it's Mollie Tibbetts who is now personally, permanently separated from her family. Cristhian Rivera today, we got a glimpse of him, the illegal alien charged with first-degree murder in the death of Mollie Tibbetts, appeared in striped prison garb and shackles in the county court in Iowa. ICE agents say he's from Mexico and has been in the United States illegally for up to seven years. Police say Rivera confessed that on July 18th, he followed Mollie Tibbetts during her nightly jog. She pleaded with him to knock it off, stop trailing her, warning that she would call the police on her cellphone. Rivera claims at that point he blacked out and when he woke up, Tibbetts was in his trunk with a bloody skull. Police say the suspect led them to a corn field where they found what they believed to be Tibbets' body. Rivera worked at Yarrabee Farms not far from there. An official at the farm initially claimed they had put him through the federal e-verify system but then clarified that had not happened. As the president, as I mentioned a moment ago, tweeted out a video expressing his sympathy to the Tibbets family and saying this case shows that massive reforms of the nation's immigration laws is simply long-overdue."

Now a 22-year-old man came forward, Jimmy Bennett, to say she abused him when he was 17. She denies those allegations, and she released a statement. I'll read it to you. She said \"I am deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absently false. I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett.\" Today TMZ released images of the two of them together in 2013 when Jimmy Bennett was 17 and Ms. Argento was 37. Also they released a text message exchange where she tells a friend of hers, and we'll put it on the screen. \"I had sex with him. It felt weird. I didn't know he was a minor until the shakedown letter.\" She paid him $380,000, working this out with Anthony Bourdain with whom she was involved. Now the Los Angeles police are investigating this, and she has been bumped off the \"X Factor\" in Italy which is a show she's a part of. When I look at this, Jason, and I look at the Catholic Church going through its own passion of sorts on these types of issues, everybody's got to be held to the same standard, no matter your gender, no matter what you believe. People need to -- if you are a victim of this abuse, you have to come forward. And the authorities should get involved. But the broad brushing we have been seeing of men or people of a certain religious persuasion should be put on the backburner and every one of these cases should be evaluated on their merits.

Remember, PETA is the same organization, Jason, that put the Barnum and Bailey Circus out of business because they were upset with the treatment of animals and featuring animals.

We don't want to bring that issue up. We are about entertainment here, so don't talk about it. I think people would have a problem with that. So I don't understand why people have a problem with young black African- American men who have the spotlight simply taking a knee. They're not asking for a soapbox to placed on the 50-yard line and give a speech and disrupt the game. You're talking about not participating in the anthem by simply silently, quietly taking a knee."

Remember when Barack Obama said we're not the red states, we're not the blue states. We are the United States. That was a very patriotic thing to do. Even a Republican like me thought, hey, you know what, that is a great statement. We do need to become united. So the one chance that we have to come united, no matter where you are on the field or political side of the aisle, that's the thing you do is try to disturb that and distract from that?

First of all, it's an insult, because what they didn't talk about was all the references he made to blacks and the oppression that blacks faced many, many years ago, decades ago, at the hands of his own party, the Democrats. And oh, by the way, what O'Rourke also failed to mention is that all the things that he's talking about with the reason why blacks are kneeling in the NFL has to do with what? It has to do with the so-called lack of civil rights by police in big cities who are run by Democrats throughout the entire political process. So what's interesting is that this is a problem for Democrats from the past and it's a problem for Democrats right now that has been created by Democrats. So he wants to talk about the kneelers. If these guys really believed in kneeling, why didn't Colin Kaepernick kneel during the Barack Obama administration? It was happening then. And when did Colin Kaepernick help any black in any city, Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, name the city, what has he done prior to that kneeling to help any of the blacks that are being killed in crazy numbers every weekend by other blacks? It is a disingenuous movement. For O'Rourke to hearken back to the days of civil rights as if these self-indulgent multimillionaires --"

If you have a hotline or a snitch line and you see law enforcement coming, what you're doing are two things. You're encouraging people to break the law, and you're also intimidating the people that you're supposed to serve, because now they are going to feel compelled to come forward if they see something and try to tell on law enforcement coming to their community. It sets a bad precedent. And again, this is something that as a political practitioner I would love for them to keep doing this. This will help us around the country. But as an American citizen, it's appalling, and I think they should remove it. If they want to do a hotline for something, try to do a hotline for the millions of feces that are around San Francisco and pick those up."
