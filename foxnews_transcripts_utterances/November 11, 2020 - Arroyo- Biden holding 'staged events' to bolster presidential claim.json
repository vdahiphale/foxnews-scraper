      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Black Lives Matters activists are now storming into school board meetings, yes. Demanding anti-racist curricula and even getting their wish in certain states. So, could a potential Biden administration actually federalize this? An ANGLE investigation ahead. Plus, Joe Biden promised he would not declare victory until the election is certified. So, why is he already ready to roll out a cabinet. Mike Huckabee reacts to that. And speaking of Biden what truly unbelievable claim did his sister just make. Raymond Arroyo has that in Seen and Unseen and a lot more. But first, denying Schumer his yes men. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now with things still in limbo in the presidential race, I think many of us have taken - haven't taken the time really or had the energy to contemplate the balance of power in Congress. So first, I want you to take heart in the GOP's stunning show of strength in the house where they flipped nine seats and now lead in 10 of the 13 ongoing races. Yet even with all of that success none of it predicted by the way, they still don't have the majority. But the Senate hangs in the balance now with two runoffs in Georgia against Republican incumbents. It's liberal 33-year-old Jon Ossoff against incumbent Conservative David Perdue and radical Reverend Raphael Warnock against Senator Kelly Loeffler. Right now, Republicans have a 50-48 advantage in the Senate. And if they lose both seats, the chamber would be 50-50, meaning Kamala Harris would break any ties. Now what would that mean? Well that would mean there'd be no stopping a cavalcade of Left-wing policies from a hideous tax increases, to health care for illegals, ending deportations, all deportations, the Green New Deal and court packing, devastating all to our prosperity and our liberty. So, we thought now was a good time to take a closer look at the new faces vying for power. Jon Ossoff's claim to fame is that he worked as a House staffer for the late Congressman John Lewis. He's also a documentary filmmaker, and I almost forgot as a Georgetown grad, he also took classes taught by Madeleine Albright. Wow. But he apparently skipped her talk on diplomacy. This was his vow in January.",

But at least she's not stupid enough to take thousands of dollars from a Chinese media company called PCCW. No big deal. It's only partially owned by the Communist Party in China. And this isn't even the first time Ossoff has been caught taking money from suspect foreign sources. Earlier this year, the Washington Free Beacon, it reported that Ossoff had been paid by the anti-American and pro-Muslim Brotherhood media outlet Al Jazeera, which is owned by the country of Qatar. Now Al Jazeera America you might remember was a ratings bomb. It shuttered in 2016 after only about three years in operation. Of course, Ossoff is your typical millennial Left-wing nightmare. He supports rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, amnesty for illegal aliens, more money for The Butchers of Planned Parenthood and of course the BLM mantra that America is systemically racist. And Georgia, check your gun safe because he's coming for your AR-15. It's textbook. And what about the other challenger, the reverend Raphael Warnock, pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Well, he's got a political rap sheet that goes back almost 30 years. In 1995, the Harlem church where he served as a youth pastor once invited Cuban dictator Fidel Castro to spew his revolutionary rhetoric there.",

And outside, money filled the coffers of both Georgia Democrats, roughly 98 percent of Ossoff's funds and nearly 80 percent of Warnock's war chest comes from outside of Georgia, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Ossoff raised 3.37 million from wealthy Californians just in the third quarter alone. That's more than double the 1.64 million he raised from Georgians. And it's only been a week since the election. But Silicon Valley has already hosted a big virtual - it's a virtual fundraiser for both Democrats. Translation for you. Big Tech wants to keep its cheap foreign labor and its petrified of losing its Section 230 immunity. Liberal elites are going all- in in Georgia from Tom Friedman of The New York Times to Andrew Yang, they're borderline orgasmic at the prospect of a one-party Democrat control of government. Then Nirvana will be upon us. The great reset, reparations, a global wealth tax, open borders, gun bans and a carbon tax. And that is just a start. Now we're going to see what the Republicans are really made of, Georgia election officials, better police these ballots. We cannot see control of the Senate fall victim to another fraud.

So that's important that the election is not stolen from President Trump. Second, it is important that we elect these two senators. You're seeing people come from across the country to make sure that we get support, that we get the resources, that people get to the ballot, to the box, and their ballots are counted fairly, equally. And that is transparent. And that's what has happened in Georgia. So, everybody's watching this, not just the GOP. There are Democrats, black voices for Trump, black voters for Trump feel as though that their votes have been disenfranchised as a people, as a black people. They don't want these black votes going towards Donald Trump and anybody else they want these votes to go to. So, this is a bigger issue, one that we have fairness and integrity in an election process to every vote, every legal ballot where there's a vote that is counted legally and that's important. But at the same time, Laura, when you look at Ossoff, who, as you mentioned earlier, took money from this Hong Kong company that really were against protesters for a democracy over in Hong Kong and other places. How much money has been taken on the table? What about Stacey Abrams? What about others? These groups are getting all this money. Where is this money going? How is this money being spent? There are some corruption going on here and others need to be looked upon them to, where they're getting their money from, who's funding them, what is happening.

Joining me now are two journalists who have been digging into these candidates, Alana Goodman, Washington Free Beacon senior investigative reporter, and Chris Bedford, senior editor at The Federalist.

You've played the clip of we're not talking about how he - the community celebrates Jeremiah Wright, but Warnock was actually going out on television and defending him, defending his Damn America speech back in 2008, when that was under controversy. Obama, in contrast, claimed that he didn't know about that speech, that he was, I guess, absent from church that day. He didn't know that Wright held the radical views that he held, and he cut ties with Wright when that happened. And he said that he found that speech insulting and offensive to Americans. On the other hand, Warnock was going around, going on TV on different shows, saying that the speech was fine. He called it a very fine sermon. This is a sermon where Jeremiah Wright talked, compared the U.S. government to al Qaeda, said that the U.S. government had invented HIV as a way to genocide the black community. So, I think that Warnock is going to have a much harder time explaining that to voters in Georgia because he can't - it's going to be harder for him to distance himself.",

He says, well, I'm not for the Green New Deal, but I'm for massive infrastructure spending for green jobs and a new economy. That's exactly the same thing. The New Republic was just laughing at him.

The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that DeKalb County schools say it hopes to engage with students and parents around the social justice issues this week.

Do they spend that long on George Washington and Thomas Jefferson? No, of course not. Joining me now is Cynthia Garrett, founder of Cynthia Garrett Ministries, author of I Choose Victory.

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham, this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Black Lives Matters activists are now storming into school board meetings, yes. Demanding anti-racist curricula and even getting their wish in certain states. So, could a potential Biden administration actually federalize this? An ANGLE investigation ahead. Plus, Joe Biden promised he would not declare victory until the election is certified. So, why is he already ready to roll out a cabinet. Mike Huckabee reacts to that. And speaking of Biden what truly unbelievable claim did his sister just make. Raymond Arroyo has that in Seen and Unseen and a lot more. But first, denying Schumer his yes men. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now with things still in limbo in the presidential race, I think many of us have taken - haven't taken the time really or had the energy to contemplate the balance of power in Congress. So first, I want you to take heart in the GOP's stunning show of strength in the house where they flipped nine seats and now lead in 10 of the 13 ongoing races. Yet even with all of that success none of it predicted by the way, they still don't have the majority. But the Senate hangs in the balance now with two runoffs in Georgia against Republican incumbents. It's liberal 33-year-old Jon Ossoff against incumbent Conservative David Perdue and radical Reverend Raphael Warnock against Senator Kelly Loeffler. Right now, Republicans have a 50-48 advantage in the Senate. And if they lose both seats, the chamber would be 50-50, meaning Kamala Harris would break any ties. Now what would that mean? Well that would mean there'd be no stopping a cavalcade of Left-wing policies from a hideous tax increases, to health care for illegals, ending deportations, all deportations, the Green New Deal and court packing, devastating all to our prosperity and our liberty. So, we thought now was a good time to take a closer look at the new faces vying for power. Jon Ossoff's claim to fame is that he worked as a House staffer for the late Congressman John Lewis. He's also a documentary filmmaker, and I almost forgot as a Georgetown grad, he also took classes taught by Madeleine Albright. Wow. But he apparently skipped her talk on diplomacy. This was his vow in January."

But at least she's not stupid enough to take thousands of dollars from a Chinese media company called PCCW. No big deal. It's only partially owned by the Communist Party in China. And this isn't even the first time Ossoff has been caught taking money from suspect foreign sources. Earlier this year, the Washington Free Beacon, it reported that Ossoff had been paid by the anti-American and pro-Muslim Brotherhood media outlet Al Jazeera, which is owned by the country of Qatar. Now Al Jazeera America you might remember was a ratings bomb. It shuttered in 2016 after only about three years in operation. Of course, Ossoff is your typical millennial Left-wing nightmare. He supports rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, amnesty for illegal aliens, more money for The Butchers of Planned Parenthood and of course the BLM mantra that America is systemically racist. And Georgia, check your gun safe because he's coming for your AR-15. It's textbook. And what about the other challenger, the reverend Raphael Warnock, pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Well, he's got a political rap sheet that goes back almost 30 years. In 1995, the Harlem church where he served as a youth pastor once invited Cuban dictator Fidel Castro to spew his revolutionary rhetoric there."

A Warnock call for calm then, but the steady stream of anti-police rhetoric from him and his Democrat colleagues continues to fuel the hate and thins the ranks of law enforcement as more officers are quitting, retiring early and more recruits deciding, I don't need this. And outside, money filled the coffers of both Georgia Democrats, roughly 98 percent of Ossoff's funds and nearly 80 percent of Warnock's war chest comes from outside of Georgia, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Ossoff raised 3.37 million from wealthy Californians just in the third quarter alone. That's more than double the 1.64 million he raised from Georgians. And it's only been a week since the election. But Silicon Valley has already hosted a big virtual - it's a virtual fundraiser for both Democrats. Translation for you. Big Tech wants to keep its cheap foreign labor and its petrified of losing its Section 230 immunity. Liberal elites are going all- in in Georgia from Tom Friedman of The New York Times to Andrew Yang, they're borderline orgasmic at the prospect of a one-party Democrat control of government. Then Nirvana will be upon us. The great reset, reparations, a global wealth tax, open borders, gun bans and a carbon tax. And that is just a start. Now we're going to see what the Republicans are really made of, Georgia election officials, better police these ballots. We cannot see control of the Senate fall victim to another fraud. And people need to open their checkbooks or they're going to find their accounts drained anyway by this time next year. Chuck Schumer, he's salivating."

Got to do it, preserving the hard-fought gains of the Trump era, blocking the Democrats massive tax hikes, halting the destruction of our oil and gas industry, and preventing China from becoming the dominant world power. It's all on the line. And whether President Trump's legal team can prevail in its challenges or not, he needs to plan major rallies across the state. The speeches should be about the policies of his that we already know work and Georgia knows works and why the great people of Georgia and the people of the United States deserve better than the hell that Schumer and Pelosi and their Congress would unleash on us. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Vernon Jones, Democrat, Georgia state rep and Black Voices for Trump Advisory Board member. Vernon, tell me, let's first talk about what the GOP needs to do right now to get an edge in these Senate runoffs."

    {
      "speaker": "REP. VERNON JONES (D-GA)",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they've taken let me say, I think Georgians, both Democrats and Republicans and certainly the GOP has taken the lead on making sure there is a vote recount. The secretary of state came out today that there would be a hand count, recount of the ballots. That's important. Also, that legal team, you did mention, the legal team, legal team that's led by Lin Wood. He's making sure that we take a legal approach because those mail-in-ballots, that's where the fraud is more than anywhere else, we believe. And certainly, looking at these machines, Laura, it's crazy that Democrats do not want a recount here. Why? Because they're the ones who have been pushing for these mail-in-ballots. They know Stacey Abrams and others, that's where the chance of tampering with these ballots are taking place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But Vernon my point is, I get your - your point is all well taken on the presidential side. But we're focusing right now on the runoffs. What are we going to do in these runoffs to make sure what may have happened in the Georgia presidential isn't going to happen in the runoffs? Because they're not recounting, they're not recounting the Senate race. They're only recounting the presidential. So, what are the officials in Georgia need to do today to prevent fraud in the - or irregularities, fraud, whatever you want to call it in this runoff elections?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm sorry, Laura, but making sure that Donald Trump is elected like he should have been, that is the most important, because even if we do lose two Senate seats, which are probably we will not, he can veto anything that comes through this passed by a majority Senate or House, any legislation that comes through. So that's important that the election is not stolen from President Trump. Second, it is important that we elect these two senators. You're seeing people come from across the country to make sure that we get support, that we get the resources, that people get to the ballot, to the box, and their ballots are counted fairly, equally. And that is transparent. And that's what has happened in Georgia. So, everybody's watching this, not just the GOP. There are Democrats, black voices for Trump, black voters for Trump feel as though that their votes have been disenfranchised as a people, as a black people. They don't want these black votes going towards Donald Trump and anybody else they want these votes to go to. So, this is a bigger issue, one that we have fairness and integrity in an election process to every vote, every legal ballot where there's a vote that is counted legally and that's important. But at the same time, Laura, when you look at Ossoff, who, as you mentioned earlier, took money from this Hong Kong company that really were against protesters for a democracy over in Hong Kong and other places. How much money has been taken on the table? What about Stacey Abrams? What about others? These groups are getting all this money. Where is this money going? How is this money being spent? There are some corruption going on here and others need to be looked upon them to, where they're getting their money from, who's funding them, what is happening. Those questions are being asked more and more by Georgians and people across this country."

      "speaker": "JONES",

And the reason you haven't heard much about Raphael Warnock's fondness for Castro and Jeremiah Wright or Ossoff's CCP ties and the Far-Left beliefs is because the media, they don't want you to know these things. Thankfully, there are some reporters who are interested in bringing you the truth. Joining me now are two journalists who have been digging into these candidates, Alana Goodman, Washington Free Beacon senior investigative reporter, and Chris Bedford, senior editor at The Federalist. Alana, you say that Jeremiah Wright is just the tip of the iceberg with regard to Warnock's radical and Marxist affiliations. Explain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALANA GOODMAN, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Yes, definitely. And I actually think that Jeremiah Wright is a bigger problem for Warnock than he was for Obama back in 2008 in a lot of ways. You've played the clip of we're not talking about how he - the community celebrates Jeremiah Wright, but Warnock was actually going out on television and defending him, defending his Damn America speech back in 2008, when that was under controversy. Obama, in contrast, claimed that he didn't know about that speech, that he was, I guess, absent from church that day. He didn't know that Wright held the radical views that he held, and he cut ties with Wright when that happened. And he said that he found that speech insulting and offensive to Americans. On the other hand, Warnock was going around, going on TV on different shows, saying that the speech was fine. He called it a very fine sermon. This is a sermon where Jeremiah Wright talked, compared the U.S. government to al Qaeda, said that the U.S. government had invented HIV as a way to genocide the black community. So, I think that Warnock is going to have a much harder time explaining that to voters in Georgia because he can't - it's going to be harder for him to distance himself."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

You guys are still on the 2008 loop of Obama and that just doesn't wash in 2020, that's 12 years ago. But her point is well-taken because obviously this is what he believes as well. I mean, I don't think there's any daylight between what Wright believes about the country and what he believes about the country. He's just not as brazen in what he said. But I want to get back to this question of who these people really are. Ossoff at age 33. He's a young guy, kind of an AOC pajama boy combo kind of thing going on there. But tell me about him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS BEDFORD, THE FEDERALIST SENIOR EDITOR",
      "utterance": "He's got that Justin Trudeau look down that the Left seems to love so much. A thin chested young man. He's the kind he's a guy who's really careful with his words, but not necessarily with his policies to the point that even some on the Left have made jokes about it, like the New Republic when he says he's against the Green deal, which is not an actual defined written law, but it's a plan for great spending on infrastructure, massive projects and getting rid of coal. He says, well, I'm not for the Green New Deal, but I'm for massive infrastructure spending for green jobs and a new economy. That's exactly the same thing. The New Republic was just laughing at him. He says that he's not for defunding the police, but he's for looking at the funding of the police and seeing what they can do, especially when they think the departments are bad. It's like this down the board, the entire board with him. And, to your earlier point, Laura, I think a good way for Georgia to try and make sure this election is fair, that it's not going on for weeks and weeks and weeks. Then we get a result really quickly would be a special meeting of the Georgia legislature that as the demands of votes are held in person, as long as they can't get their mail-in-voting down, they're going to have to go to in-person maybe with an exemption for people who are abroad and overseas with the military."

People end up changing their minds and, you know, who knows? But the mail-in-voting to continue to occur after what we saw. To me, that's insane.

I don't care what they have to do that better get out and vote and open up their wallets. Alana, and Chris, thank you so much.

And then when we bring it into the light, as we should, curriculum should be vetted through public hearings with our local elected school boards. If they don't get their way, they try to intimidate.

The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that DeKalb County schools say it hopes to engage with students and parents around the social justice issues this week.

There's 30 percent proficiency in English, 30 percent proficiency in math, and 74 percent of kids are graduating, and according to the Georgia governor's office, of that 74 percent of students graduating, only 50 percent of them are actually eligible to go on to college or get a job. What are we teaching them about Black Lives Matter if they can't read and write? What does Black Lives Matter mean anyway?

In short, black people won this election.\" Cynthia, of course, she completely ignores the fact that President Trump got the most minority turnout of any Republican president I think on record. So where does this thinking come from? It's their reward now?"

Secondly, no, I don't think anyone gets rewarded for anything. How do you reward an organization that is anti-everything we stand for in America? Listen, I've said it, and I'll say it again -- yes, we all accept and agree with the statement black lives matter, but the organization itself to be rewarded -- to do what? Fill its coffers with more money to promote anticapitalism, anti everything that's not about what they believe in, which is Marxist, which is anti- everything that I believe in, and if they storm into a school board meeting where one of my kids is going to school, or my grandkids, they're going to have big problems on their hands. And I think more Americans have to start to get really angry. You can't come in and disrupt an entire educational process where good people are trying to do the best that they can with your rhetoric and your beliefs."

Imagine how the media would report that event. Cynthia, we have to go, but love having you on. You come back soon please, because this issue is not going away. Loved having you on tonight.

At his COVID event, even though he is not entitled to any CDC or task force briefings, Biden called out the current president, had a brain freeze, and then he slipped. Or did he? Watch this."

This comes up, \"Joe Biden news.\" What's going on? Now even the search engine has been politicized, curtailing our ability to check up on the president's current activities.

It's the media networks who get to make the decision as to who is the president. And why even wait for the votes to be counted? No need for that. Why wait for them to be certified? They know what they want, and they want it now. But here's what I think is a little interesting. Joe Biden hadn't quite been certified yet. It's always better to heat the oven before you put the biscuits in. It's better to shoot the deer before you try to put it in the freezer. And I think Joe may be getting a little ahead of himself out here."

Tonight, Biden announced that swamp creature Ron Klain will be his White House chief of staff. He's the one who said Biden did a rotten job on the H1N1, isn't he? Governor, none of these names scream \"outsider\" to me."

I think it's going to be a real problem because a lot of the people on the left, without whom Joe would never have even gotten as far as he did -- and, again, I'm not going to say elected, because I don't necessarily know that that's for sure yet. But that aside, there's going to be some people on the left that are going to demand not just a seat at the table. They're going to want the entire table. And if they don't get it, they're going to revolt. So he's going to have a mutiny on the bounty right there within his own White House and his own party. I do think that when I hear people say, well, he's a moderate. Let's see. Let's see who he appoints, because personnel is policy. That's something you learn real early when you get into government work. The people that you surround yourself with, that's what your policy is. You can make all the speeches in the world, but the people that you bring in to implement your goals, that's going to really determine your policy. So we'll find out if Joe is a moderate or not. My guess is not nearly as much as people think."

Maybe the greatest gift Trump could give this Veterans Day. Happy Veterans Day, although you deserve many more days and just one and thank you for all of the American armed services members across the country, across the globe, past and present.
