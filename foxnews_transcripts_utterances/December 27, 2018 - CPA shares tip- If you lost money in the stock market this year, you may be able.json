Across the Capitol, Democrats take over the House in a week. And when they do, that $5 billion in border wall money approved by the House, but tabled by the Senate, it's going to disappear.

I'm outside. There is a lot of electricity out here, but you could feel it in the market today. Let's start with how we set up. Obviously, we had the biggest one-point session and history. We gave some of the back at the start of the session. We got a conference. We got a report on consumer confidence. It was a tale of two reports, current conditions, through the roof. People feel fantastic. That's what's driving this excitement out here. Expectations, though, that plunged. People are worried. They're concerned there are a lot of question marks out there. So we had this sideways market. And I got to tell you something. People always look for bottoms and things like that. What I will say, for the second consecutive session, buyers emerged at the very point it looked like the market was going to collapse. In fact, you can argue this 900-point reversal to the upside is as impressive as the 1,000-point move yesterday, also keep in mind too, being led by boring stocks, Campbell's Soup, Kimberly-Clark. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Those are the kind of names that led us up today.

In addition to the China meeting, they're going to turn -- they're going to remove tariffs on 700 items. They're going to remove tariffs on almost 100 I.P. items in July. Things are actually happening beneath the surface that don't get a lot of press, may be starting to resonate within the stock market.",

You will find a lot of bad signs in foreign markets, in foreign stock markets and economies. And that's part of the problem. But, really, it's been a very long run.

What they tell me is that they're afraid of getting the flu. That's what they tell me. It's because a lot of times -- you have to remember that it takes two weeks for the flu shot to develop immunity in our body. So if you get that flu shot right now, you still can get sick. And, sometimes, that happens within the two weeks, and people think it's a shot. There's also coincidental exposure.

Well, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker of the House, Drew Hammill, shot back just a couple of seconds ago. And I will read you the quote here. \"Democrats have offered Republicans three options to reopen the government that include funding for strong, sensible and effective border security, but not the president's immoral, ineffective and expensive border wall.\" Now, just a few minutes ago, the House and Senate met in brief sessions. If you want understand how brief they were, the Senate met for three minutes and 52 seconds, and the House for two minutes and 42 seconds. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, tried to get the floor, tried to get recognized to try to pass a bill on the spot to reopen the government. He wasn't recognized, obviously. We asked Jim McGovern as he came off the floor a few moments ago, what would the plan look like when Democrats take control a week from today? He mentioned, well, that hasn't been worked out yet. So we don't know if Democrats will try to pass a bill that will find all the bills, the remaining seven bills for the rest of the fiscal year and have everything but the wall money. He mentioned it could add -- have disaster aid here. But this shutdown is going to probably go through the 1st of the year. Mark Meadows, the Republican congressman from North Carolina, the leader of the Freedom Caucus, said that he was pretty optimistic about 48 hours ago, he said, but we're really going for a long shutdown right now, Trish.",

But once members get back to Washington -- there's a skeleton crew right now -- and you get protesters outside and the phone lines start to light up and people aren't getting paid, it goes into the next pay period, that's when this starts to get real. By the same token -- and this is a little bit of what the Republicans are telegraphing their strategy -- they know that Nancy Pelosi is toxic, she is unpopular, and that they can cast this on her and say, well, wait a minute, she's in charge now, she bears part of the blame.

In fact, your average Venezuelan has lost more than 20 pounds in the last year. And it's because they don't have access to food. We have seen video exclusive to our program where people are looting food trucks, and they're rioting in the streets because they don't have their basic necessities. Meanwhile, you got Vladimir Putin down there right now. He's just purchased an island right there next to Caracas, about 100 miles away from Caracas, which could easily serve as some kind of launch pad. So we don't like that. He's also just invested in oil fields there, buying up five of them in cash. So, why are the Venezuelans doing business with Putin? Why are they doing business with the Chinese, the Iranians, all of our enemies? Does that need to change? We're going to talk about all of this.

The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve.\" But White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett tells me that he is not concerned that a shutdown, even if it lasts for several weeks, would have a long-term impact on the economy. So, as of now, any market volatility that we're seeing is not going to spook the president into striking a hasty compromise over this border wall.

And that's key, because Mark Meadows is one of the conservatives who talked President Trump into staying firm and not accepting any kind of a spending bill that didn't put a lot of tax money toward a border wall. And that's consistent with what the number two Democrats in the Senate, Dick Durbin, just said, that there's no end in sight to the shutdown. The minority leader there, Chuck Schumer, is being tasked with finding middle ground with the White House, but so far no meaningful developments. Across the Capitol, Democrats take over the House in a week. And when they do, that $5 billion in border wall money approved by the House, but tabled by the Senate, it's going to disappear. So if Republicans are going to take advantage of their majority in the House, they're going to do it with a very, very tight schedule, because Steve Scalise, the majority whip, just sent everybody an e-mail that said no more votes today or tomorrow -- Trish."

Obviously, we had the biggest one-point session and history. We gave some of the back at the start of the session. We got a conference. We got a report on consumer confidence. It was a tale of two reports, current conditions, through the roof. People feel fantastic. That's what's driving this excitement out here. Expectations, though, that plunged. People are worried. They're concerned there are a lot of question marks out there. So we had this sideways market. And I got to tell you something. People always look for bottoms and things like that. What I will say, for the second consecutive session, buyers emerged at the very point it looked like the market was going to collapse. In fact, you can argue this 900-point reversal to the upside is as impressive as the 1,000-point move yesterday, also keep in mind too, being led by boring stocks, Campbell's Soup, Kimberly-Clark. Those are the kind of names that led us up today. It wasn't the Amazons of the world. I think that's a good sign for investors, that you know what? There are other places you can put your money, besides those areas, defense contractors also having a very good session. Also, one more thing, there's a lot of good news out there. In addition to the China meeting, they're going to turn -- they're going to remove tariffs on 700 items. They're going to remove tariffs on almost 100 I.P. items in July.

You will find a lot of bad signs in foreign markets, in foreign stock markets and economies. And that's part of the problem. But, really, it's been a very long run. And investors got nervous for a lot of reasons. Maybe rates were going up too fast, as the president talked about, and they bailed on stocks. And they're coming back in. This is very important, because if we go any lower in the market, it probably means we're going to get dragged into the global slowdown that everybody else is in. If we turn around, it will be like various other corrections and even some mini-bear markets that came back with big gains. So I was buying this week in client accounts. But I'm still concerned it could fall worse. But you see a lot of professional investors coming in with these discounts, looking for deals. It's still a strong economy."

I think about all those tech companies where anything you wanted to sell on the Internet suddenly got a crazy enormous valuation. And that was so basically divorced from the reality of what was going on, in that these companies do at some point need to turn a profit. I look at the fundamentals today, Chris, and I see a strong economy. I see GDP growing at a very nice clip. I see wages going through 3.1 percent. I see the lowest unemployment rates that we have seen in decades, and the lowest ever for minority communities. To me, this is all very positive stuff. And so when I see the crazy volatility in the markets, I wonder how much is these algorithms kind of getting ahead of themselves and not having a real human being there to sort of say, hey, wait a second, things are OK. Things are good."

      "utterance": "Yes, but you have to remember that the algorithms, they're -- they're programmed by human beings. So I think, sometimes, you're starting to see a herd mentality. Certainly, the whole last three months, we saw that. Even throughout 2018, we saw four or five or six -- we had 5, 10, 8 percent moves, up and down up and down. We really accelerated once the 10 percent correction level failed. And now we have gone down to 20 percent. So it seems the market is trying to find a bottom. But I think a lot of this volatility is exacerbated. This is not people sitting at home telling -- calling their brokers saying sell. This is definitely being driven by -- it's just the nature of the way things are today. It's computerized trading, speed-of-light trading. And you get the type of volatility that we have had. But I would watch the percentages. Year to date, if you had gone to sleep New Year's Eve last year, and just woke up today, did the Rip Van Winkle, we're down 8.5, 9 percent. So I think that's really what people are going to look at when they look at their 401(k)s at the end of the year is, how did we do for the year? And I think that's why you -- we still have a good chance that you see good consumer -- consumer confidence moving forward."

But, hey, at least, in these final days, we will we will see how it all shakes out. Right? We have still got a little time left. But you're seeing a nice rally today. We just showed you earlier the 1,000-point jump, better than 1,000 points, biggest point gain ever that we saw yesterday on the Dow. I mean, that's got to, I think, feed into consumer confidence.

I'm saying this is Black Monday, the market down 22 percent in one session, down 38 percent from the highs of August of that summer. Everyone's seeing turmoil. And guess what? We went on a tear for a couple of decades. The economy was stronger. The stock market was stronger. Right now, I can tell you right now, I'm looking at the fundamentals, just like you are. And I feel extremely confident. And I think the American consumer, two-thirds of the economy, their wages are up. They have got better jobs. There's seven million jobs out there. If you don't like the one you have, there's probably one out there paying even more. There's a lot of ancillary noise out there that's taken an impact on this market. And, by the way, I will also say this. From time to time, markets must be challenged, and, from time to time, they go through these sort of - - this sort of turmoil. I don't believe the read, though, is recession in 2019. And because of that, I feel really optimistic for the market, but also, more importantly, for the individuals out there in this economy."

And it's about the very fact that they do not want to see the Republicans and this administration succeed with this issue, because if you guys succeed, guess what?

They need to remember that they have a country because we gave it back to them. And they can make all the demands that they wish, but there isn't anything they can do about it. If the president of the United States wants our people to stay there and thinks there's a need for them to stay there, then they're going to stay there. And the Iraqis can't do a thing about it."

You have to remember who this guy is that's talking and who he is kneeling at the feet of, which is the same cleric that we fought against for years in Iraq. So they're -- it's win-win from their standpoint, because, if for some reason we decided to pull out, then they would claim a moral victory. If we decide to stay, then they can use that as a launching pad for future divisiveness, which means they're going to stir up their people and get them involved and hopefully cause more and more trouble for the forces that are there.

    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, reading into the polls, what I see here is a divide within the Democratic Party. I think we have got on one hand the blue-collar workers, a little bit more moderate. These are the voters that were tempted to vote for Trump or may have voted for Trump. And then I think, on the other hand, you have got this progressive wing of the party that's really concerned about intersectionality, about the Bernie Sanders sort of policies, socialism."

      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, progressives are obsessed with this idea. It's the most important one. And the idea is basically that there are multiple kinds of oppression. They all interact together. So, if you're an African-American woman, you're not just facing racism. You're facing sexism. But this plays into smaller and smaller parts of identity politics. And I think it's going to end up fragmenting the Democratic Party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",

      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "Yes, but what we have learned is that the party needs to unite. So it's divided. But the GOP was divided when Trump was running. So, at the end of the day, the party needs to unite. So they might seem like socialists over here, and maybe the old-school over there, but at the end of the day, I think Bernie Sanders said it, they're going to unite. And it's the party that's going to beat Trump. No more four years..."

A whole lot of investors are actually losing a lot of money as we go into the close to 2018, because it's been a rough couple days. But there are ways to actually write off some of your losses on your taxes. And CPA Dan Geltrude is here with some tips on how you can do that and a whole lot more. Good to see you, Dan. DANIEL GELTRUDE, GELTRUDE & COMPANY: Good to see you, Trish."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELTRUDE",
      "utterance": "Sure. Let's talk about the capital loss rule. So if you have capital losses, which may have happened after this past month, you're allowed to offset them against your capital gains. If you have more capital losses than capital gains, you get to take an additional $3,000 against ordinary income. And if you have even more capital losses after that, you have to carry them forward into the future. So that's how it works."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "OK. Any other tips you can offer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELTRUDE",
      "utterance": "Sure. So, to start with, on medical expenses, you want to try to get those in last minute before the end of the year, because the rules are changing. So we're going to go from 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income to 10 percent. So you need more of them to qualify for a deduction. Also, the divorce rules are changing. So, alimony is no longer going to be deductible starting in 2019. So, if you're getting divorced, you want to get that in as quickly as possible this year, depending."

      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "OK."

      "utterance": "What about gifting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELTRUDE",
      "utterance": "So, in gifting, the rules changed. The estate taxes changed. That all ties into how much you can give as a gift during your lifetime, Trish. So, now, if you're a single person, it's over $11 million, or 22 if you're married. So that's gifting that you could start now, tax-free, to your family members."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "OK, what about 401(k) contributions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELTRUDE",
      "utterance": "Well, 401(k) is a big one, because it's amazing that people have a matching from their employer, and they still don't maximize how much they put away in their 401(k). And I also want to give you another tip on that. Our firm does a lot of pension auditing and 401(k) auditing. Make sure you check your statements, that those matching contributions are getting in there, and they're getting in there on time. You would be surprised how many times that doesn't happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "It is amazing, because it's free money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELTRUDE",
      "utterance": "It is free money. And, sometimes, it doesn't get there. So you have to be careful. You're responsible to check your statements. And if you see something like that happens, you have to go to H.R. and let them know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "All right, let's talk about the market overall right now, because it's been pretty wild, a lot of volatility out there, Dan, and people are getting a little nervous. Hey, yesterday was great, up better than 1,000, biggest single-point day ever gain. And today was wild, but we ended up in positive territory. Is there anything you can tell them to reassure them as we go into the new year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELTRUDE",
      "utterance": "Well, this is not your father's stock market, as they say. Things are changing. And this algorithm, computerized trading, Trish, is having a huge impact on the way these markets are just turning wildly up and down. So I think that's something the regulators are going to have to address going forward."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "That's very interesting. I mean, I think you're onto something. I have been talking about this for a while, because this volatility is so severe. Now, by the way, percentage wise, it's not as bad as it looks, but you're talking about big swings, very, very big swings. And it's not all being done by human beings. We had a guest on earlier that said, well, it's human beings that are actually programming these machines. But, at some point, yes, that human being is not there to control it or reprogram it in real time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELTRUDE",
      "utterance": "Well, the good news about the algorithm trading, Trish, is that it takes the emotion out. But that takes the human factor out to say, some of this stuff is not making sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "I think you need the emotion. Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GELTRUDE",
      "utterance": "So, look, the algorithm -- the algorithms are really getting crazy. They're even programming them now to monitor officials at the Fed to check their tone in their voice, to see if that's giving away anything and how people are going to trade. So, what's happening is, we're getting away from investing, and we're moving towards trading. There's a big difference between the two."
    },

      "speaker": "REGAN",

      "speaker": "CAUDLE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, in some ways, this is what we expect in terms -- we know the flu season goes typically from October to May. And we know that December, January, and February tend to be the height of flu seasons typically. So, in some ways, this is kind of what we -- what we would expect. But I think what's really important to note is that, in 11 states, including New York City in addition, we're experiencing moderate to high flu activity. And this really should put us on alert. This is time to kind of kick things into high gear."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",

      "speaker": "CAUDLE",
      "utterance": "Right -- and Georgia, yes, have high activity. Another number of states have moderate activity. So, really, what we're starting to see is this wave of infections kind of taking hold. This is why -- and why we're talking about this is because it's really important for people, if you haven't gotten that flu shot, you got to go out and get that now."

      "speaker": "REGAN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "What are people so worried about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAUDLE",
      "utterance": "I can believe -- well, the biggest complaint they tell me is that they're afraid that the flu shot will give them the flu. And, honestly, that's one of the biggest myths out there. I always recommend the CDC.gov for information. The flu shot will not give you the flu. Now, there are some flu vaccines that are not right for certain people. But the shot form won't get you sick. So for those people who said, well, I got the flu shot years ago, and it made me sicker than I ever was, it wasn't because of the vaccine. And that's really important to keep in mind."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Because there had been some studies that showed a direct correlation to, say, the swine flu vaccine and actually cases of narcolepsy. This is overseas. So that's partly why people get fearful, right, about the -- because they're saying, wait a second, I get this, and maybe I ward off the flu for a season, but do I invite other problems, any kind of neurological problems, et cetera? What do you say to those people that are fearful of something bigger?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAUDLE",
      "utterance": "Sure. So what I'm talking about is the influenza vaccine, the seasonal flu vaccine. And what I would say is, honestly, I have not actually had a patient tell me that they were concerned about either the swine flu or complications of that vaccine. What people tell me when they're concerned about getting the flu shot -- and, again, this is my personal experience -- I have been in practice for over 10 years. What they tell me is that they're afraid of getting the flu. That's what they tell me. It's because a lot of times -- you have to remember that it takes two weeks for the flu shot to develop immunity in our body. So if you get that flu shot right now, you still can get sick. And, sometimes, that happens within the two weeks, and people think it's a shot. There's also coincidental exposure. Remember, just because you feel like you have the flu doesn't mean you actually do. And you might have actually gotten another bug. There's a number of reasons why people feel that way."

      "speaker": "CAUDLE",
      "utterance": "I always say the earlier the better. Typically, we start offering them actually late summer, early fall. We want them to be done as early as possible. But you if you haven't gotten the flu shot, it is not too late. Everyone, for the most part, with some exceptions, over the age of 6 months, are generally eligible. You want to check your -- with your doctor about certain conditions."

      "utterance": "Is anything going to get done on this border wall, the shutdown fight, before Democrats take the House one week from today? Chad Pergram is on the Hill. He has the very latest for us. And, Chad, I'm kind of discouraged here, because they have an opportunity to work a few more days. They have all headed for the hills -- vacation, that is. And we're going to have a different team in charge there in House in seven days. So where does that leave things?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, everybody right now thinks that this government shutdown is going to run through the new Congress, when Democrats take control a week from today. Now, Sarah Sanders, the White House spokesperson, put out a statement, putting the blame on Democrats, saying that the president stayed in Washington over Christmas ready to work, and they have still not gone back and talked about the offers that the administration made several days ago. Well, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker of the House, Drew Hammill, shot back just a couple of seconds ago. And I will read you the quote here. \"Democrats have offered Republicans three options to reopen the government that include funding for strong, sensible and effective border security, but not the president's immoral, ineffective and expensive border wall.\" Now, just a few minutes ago, the House and Senate met in brief sessions. If you want understand how brief they were, the Senate met for three minutes and 52 seconds, and the House for two minutes and 42 seconds. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, tried to get the floor, tried to get recognized to try to pass a bill on the spot to reopen the government. He wasn't recognized, obviously. We asked Jim McGovern as he came off the floor a few moments ago, what would the plan look like when Democrats take control a week from today? He mentioned, well, that hasn't been worked out yet. So we don't know if Democrats will try to pass a bill that will find all the bills, the remaining seven bills for the rest of the fiscal year and have everything but the wall money. He mentioned it could add -- have disaster aid here. But this shutdown is going to probably go through the 1st of the year. Mark Meadows, the Republican congressman from North Carolina, the leader of the Freedom Caucus, said that he was pretty optimistic about 48 hours ago, he said, but we're really going for a long shutdown right now, Trish."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "All right. So I guess the big question is, ultimately, where does this go? And if the shutdown is going to ever end, it means the president has to get $5 billion for his wall. It feels -- and I have said this before -- like a bad game of chicken and who's going to blink first. Any guesstimates on that, Chad?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "Right, something has to give. Now, a couple of things that often happen, you get into these government shutdowns, and then you start to have the telephone lines ring. I talked to a couple of aides today. And they said they were hearing some calls, not many, from people who were for the shutdown, people opposed. But once members get back to Washington -- there's a skeleton crew right now -- and you get protesters outside and the phone lines start to light up and people aren't getting paid, it goes into the next pay period, that's when this starts to get real. By the same token -- and this is a little bit of what the Republicans are telegraphing their strategy -- they know that Nancy Pelosi is toxic, she is unpopular, and that they can cast this on her and say, well, wait a minute, she's in charge now, she bears part of the blame. That's a good strategy for Republicans come January. And they might be willing to wait this out into the new year and have Nancy Pelosi go tete-a- tete with the president of the United States."

And that is with the vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez. She works under Maduro, Nicolas Maduro. And there's been a lot of difficulty there in Venezuela. In fact, your average Venezuelan has lost more than 20 pounds in the last year. And it's because they don't have access to food. We have seen video exclusive to our program where people are looting food trucks, and they're rioting in the streets because they don't have their basic necessities. Meanwhile, you got Vladimir Putin down there right now. He's just purchased an island right there next to Caracas, about 100 miles away from Caracas, which could easily serve as some kind of launch pad. So we don't like that. He's also just invested in oil fields there, buying up five of them in cash. So, why are the Venezuelans doing business with Putin? Why are they doing business with the Chinese, the Iranians, all of our enemies? Does that need to change? We're going to talk about all of this. You should tune in tonight for my exclusive interview with the vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez, 8:00 p.m. Eastern on the FOX Business Network. I will see you there. \"The Five\" starts now. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc. Copyright CQ-2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.
