      "utterance": "I think that the functional issue here though is that there are two approaches. And I think ultimately the administration would be willing to accept North Korea now as a nuclear weapons power. What they would not be willing to accept nor should they, quite frankly, because of Kim Jong-un's irrationality, is the idea that North Korea could put those weapons onto intercontinental ballistic missiles. And that is something that alters the game. I think what you will see coming up now potentially is much tougher action on China. We have already had the president denouncing the intellectual property theft investigations. But we could see more action at the WTO. I also expect you're going to start seeing carrier battle groups, B-2 bomber squadrons, B-1s out there, because the Chinese as much as they present this image that they hold the cards, the degree to which they do not want American military strikes is very significant. And Trump's random tweets help him in that regard because they don't want to make it --"

The tweet, to some degree I think it's easier for allies to accept the tweet because then they have Mattis and Tillerson calling them up and saying hey, hold on. But the Chinese don't have that. And again, ultimately, American military power is something the Chinese still fear."

      "utterance": "Right. Russia and China simply just want to keep the status quo. Their call for negotiations enables them to just continue on as they are, and that is why these secondary sanctions I think are so important because both of these countries benefit so much financially from their trade with North Korea, China in particular. And so of course it's understandable that they don't want these sanctions, but that's precisely why this might be the best avenue for us to proceed."

We are going to work with our allies. We'll work with China. But people need to cut off North Korea economically. This is unacceptable behavior."

There are things you can pressure the Chinese on. If you put pressure, for example, on Chinese entities doing business behind the scenes with the North Koreans, that puts pressure on European companies as well. You could also, for example, the Southeast China Seas, if the United States starts putting long range anti-ship cruise missiles there, that suddenly upsets the Chinese a lot. If we start selling F-35s to Taiwan, if we're constantly, whether in economic terms or military terms, practice power to show them that if they are saying this is the consensus, America is going to respond with our own consensus. And so I think there are still tools in the kit."
