      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us, and thanks again for making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for keeping \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals\" on the New York Times bestsellers list for three months and counting. Have you gotten you copy yet? A very special show on deck for tonight. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway is here live. Katrina Pierson from the Trump reelection campaign, and later the host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Tucker Carlson himself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also on deck, an exclusive tour of Liberty University with the President of the groundbreaking college, Jerry Falwell, Jr. a tour you won't want to miss. But first my Opening Statement. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The military needs to be deployed to our southern border immediately to stop the caravan of thousands of illegals pouring into our nation. Right now is a very dangerous time for Americans. Border control is essential to your safety and the safety of your family. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The military, the National Guard, ICE, Border Patrol and DHS needs to block this caravan from entering our nation. Now, I'm not saying they are all criminals. What I am asking is, who are they? What I am saying is I want to vet them, screen them. I want to find out who among them is a criminal, who among them is a gang member like the notorious MS-13 gang members who arrogantly rode into our United States by invitation during the Obama years and they are in New York and elsewhere brutally and savagely murdering innocent American citizens. I want to know who is a pedophile? Who is a sex offender? Who thinks they are entitled to beat hair wives? I want to know who has an alcohol problem? Who has a drug problem? Who likes a drive drunk and who has no problem hauling drugs for the cartel? And if you can prove that you're not one of them or any other kind of criminal, I want to know what you have to offer us. What do you bring to this great nation? What are you going contribute? Why should we be proud to count you as an American other than adding to the democrats voting block and continuing the mob mentality that you already exhibited you are proficient at? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, if you are not a criminal, I want you to get to the back of the line behind everyone else who waited for a visa, came here legally, hired a lawyer, learned American history and swore allegiance to this great nation, and only then am I interested in even talking to you about entering. I for one am sick and tired of the sense of entitlement that illegals have to enter this country and then immediately claim their constitutional rights as they carry the flags not of America, but the flags of their country, and God forbid we try to deport them to the country whose flag they so proudly wave. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They have no claim on this country. They are not entitled to be here. They break our laws to come here. Now, this is not a left or right issue. This is a security issue. A safety issue. We simply cannot have people about whom we know nothing living next door to us, working next to us or driving next to us. Crossers claim they are running from violence in their home countries. I spent my career fighting on behalf of innocent helpless, silent victims of crimes, victimized by violence, criminals who should have been stopped long before the crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You are telling me -- you're telling me because they are being victimized that every one of them is a victim and therefore entitled to come here as opposed to anywhere else on the planet? Go to the UN. Stay in Mexico. Now, they say their poverty is justification for illegal entry. I have got news for you, millions are suffering from poverty all over the world -- Haiti, Uganda, Zimbabwe, the Congo, third world countries -- so why is it just central Americans and Mexicans are the poverty stricken ones pouring into this country by the millions? Why? Why? Because they can. Because no one has told them they can't. Because no one has stopped them. They come because there is a big prize at the end -- education, medication, housing, food stamps -- all the things you pay for. So you want open borders. Look at what it's done to Europe. If the left, the mob, and the demon rats have their way, there would be rogue cities and rogue zones all over the US just like Europe with crime-ridden zones where law abiding citizens and law enforcement are afraid to enter, and for good reason. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The left then, the Democrats in this country add an additional layer of protection so illegal criminals cannot be arrested in sanctuary cities and states where American citizens are thus put at risk. These people don't want a border wall. Have you ever asked yourself why? Do you think they have a philosophical or an ideological objection to the concept of a wall or protection? Of course not. All these bozos are protected by doors and fences and security. Yet they want our borders open. They want illegals to cross as a mob and act like a mob and unite around a state they have no right to be in and register and vote Democrat. Many bring poison, drugs that take the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. A primer, 90 percent of heroin use in this country comes through the southern border and Mexico thumbs its nose at us and says, \"Your people ask for it.\" I have got an idea. It's time to play hardball. The foreign aid to those countries -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - - some $464 million in foreign aid from us -- end it. Congress needs to stop the flow of our money to them and if they need it so badly, use to it take care of the poverty and the victimization in their country and I am sick and tired of people telling to us have a heart. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have a heart. We are the most generous country in the world. In 1986, Ronald Reagan gave all illegals amnesty, but amnesty does nothing but create an incentive for additional crossings by illegals so, here we are again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And for all of you who want to trash President Trump, I have got even more news for you. Presidents Bush and Obama sent the military to the border to the tune of $1.3 billion and it's time to do it again. So let me be clear, when you cross the border into these United States illegally, expect to be arrested. You do not have the right to come here. We did not invite you here. You cannot stay here and on your way out, you can tell the Democrats, George Soros and the angry mob that's coming here, you either come the right way like everyone else or be ready to face the military and a one-way ticket back to where you came from. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's my open. Don't forget my book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" It's been now on the New York Times bestsellers list for three months and counting. And believe it, it's got to be killing them at the New York Times. And President Trump tackled the issue of immigration and the caravan in Guatemala while taking on the Democrats at a raucous rally in Nevada today. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us, and thanks again for making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for keeping \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals\" on the New York Times bestsellers list for three months and counting. Have you gotten you copy yet? A very special show on deck for tonight. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway is here live. Katrina Pierson from the Trump reelection campaign, and later the host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Tucker Carlson himself. Also on deck, an exclusive tour of Liberty University with the President of the groundbreaking college, Jerry Falwell, Jr. a tour you won't want to miss. But first my Opening Statement. The military needs to be deployed to our southern border immediately to stop the caravan of thousands of illegals pouring into our nation. Right now is a very dangerous time for Americans. Border control is essential to your safety and the safety of your family. The military, the National Guard, ICE, Border Patrol and DHS needs to block this caravan from entering our nation. Now, I'm not saying they are all criminals. What I am asking is, who are they? What I am saying is I want to vet them, screen them. I want to find out who among them is a criminal, who among them is a gang member like the notorious MS-13 gang members who arrogantly rode into our United States by invitation during the Obama years and they are in New York and elsewhere brutally and savagely murdering innocent American citizens. I want to know who is a pedophile? Who is a sex offender? Who thinks they are entitled to beat hair wives? I want to know who has an alcohol problem? Who has a drug problem? Who likes a drive drunk and who has no problem hauling drugs for the cartel? And if you can prove that you're not one of them or any other kind of criminal, I want to know what you have to offer us. What do you bring to this great nation? What are you going contribute? Why should we be proud to count you as an American other than adding to the democrats voting block and continuing the mob mentality that you already exhibited you are proficient at? Now, if you are not a criminal, I want you to get to the back of the line behind everyone else who waited for a visa, came here legally, hired a lawyer, learned American history and swore allegiance to this great nation, and only then am I interested in even talking to you about entering. I for one am sick and tired of the sense of entitlement that illegals have to enter this country and then immediately claim their constitutional rights as they carry the flags not of America, but the flags of their country, and God forbid we try to deport them to the country whose flag they so proudly wave. They have no claim on this country. They are not entitled to be here. They break our laws to come here. Now, this is not a left or right issue. This is a security issue. A safety issue. We simply cannot have people about whom we know nothing living next door to us, working next to us or driving next to us. Crossers claim they are running from violence in their home countries. I spent my career fighting on behalf of innocent helpless, silent victims of crimes, victimized by violence, criminals who should have been stopped long before the crime. You are telling me -- you're telling me because they are being victimized that every one of them is a victim and therefore entitled to come here as opposed to anywhere else on the planet? Go to the UN. Stay in Mexico. Now, they say their poverty is justification for illegal entry. I have got news for you, millions are suffering from poverty all over the world -- Haiti, Uganda, Zimbabwe, the Congo, third world countries -- so why is it just central Americans and Mexicans are the poverty stricken ones pouring into this country by the millions? Why? Why? Because they can. Because no one has told them they can't. Because no one has stopped them. They come because there is a big prize at the end -- education, medication, housing, food stamps -- all the things you pay for. So you want open borders. Look at what it's done to Europe. If the left, the mob, and the demon rats have their way, there would be rogue cities and rogue zones all over the US just like Europe with crime-ridden zones where law abiding citizens and law enforcement are afraid to enter, and for good reason. The left then, the Democrats in this country add an additional layer of protection so illegal criminals cannot be arrested in sanctuary cities and states where American citizens are thus put at risk. These people don't want a border wall. Have you ever asked yourself why? Do you think they have a philosophical or an ideological objection to the concept of a wall or protection? Of course not. All these bozos are protected by doors and fences and security. Yet they want our borders open. They want illegals to cross as a mob and act like a mob and unite around a state they have no right to be in and register and vote Democrat. Many bring poison, drugs that take the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. A primer, 90 percent of heroin use in this country comes through the southern border and Mexico thumbs its nose at us and says, \"Your people ask for it.\" I have got an idea. It's time to play hardball. The foreign aid to those countries -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - - some $464 million in foreign aid from us -- end it. Congress needs to stop the flow of our money to them and if they need it so badly, use to it take care of the poverty and the victimization in their country and I am sick and tired of people telling to us have a heart. We have a heart. We are the most generous country in the world. In 1986, Ronald Reagan gave all illegals amnesty, but amnesty does nothing but create an incentive for additional crossings by illegals so, here we are again. And for all of you who want to trash President Trump, I have got even more news for you. Presidents Bush and Obama sent the military to the border to the tune of $1.3 billion and it's time to do it again. So let me be clear, when you cross the border into these United States illegally, expect to be arrested. You do not have the right to come here. We did not invite you here. You cannot stay here and on your way out, you can tell the Democrats, George Soros and the angry mob that's coming here, you either come the right way like everyone else or be ready to face the military and a one-way ticket back to where you came from. That's my open. Don't forget my book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" It's been now on the New York Times bestsellers list for three months and counting. And believe it, it's got to be killing them at the New York Times. And President Trump tackled the issue of immigration and the caravan in Guatemala while taking on the Democrats at a raucous rally in Nevada today. Take a look."

They like the caravans. A lot of people say, \"I wonder who started that caravan?\" And I want to thank Mexico. Mexico has been so incredible. Thank you, Mexico and the leaders of Mexico. Thank you. And you know why? Because now, Mexico respected the leadership of the United States. They have respect now. They now respect our leaders. Thank you, Mexico. Great. We appreciate it. We do. But what they want is -- by the way, the wall, the people are screaming, so we started the wall, it's moving along. I want to build it rapidly, I can do it in a year, we did $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion. We have another $1.6 billion, it sounds like a lot of money, when you're going for almost a thousand miles, it's not that much, but the wall is moving. I want to do it in one year.

I must tell you, it seems to have happened all of a sudden. I mean, I haven't heard about a caravan since Obama invited them in 2014 and 2015.

And now people can see what it really means. Before they saw what they called the kid in cages which of course turned out many of them to be President Obama's kids in cages. But let them see what's happening and let them juxtapose that with a President who is saying in light of the modernized revolutionary trade deal, the USMCA -- Mexican-Canadian-American trade deal that we have better relationships with Mexico now. They respect this President and Commander-in-Chief and they are helping now."

    {
      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, they ought to do that because I'll tell you, if you look statistically, Jeanine, and I want everyone to know that until very recently, the predominant trafficker, the predominant person coming over the border was a single male -- one male person coming in from Mexico. Now 45 percent or so are family units coming in, unaccompanied minors or people who say they are a family coming in from Central America. This is a problem because we are encouraging people to smuggle children over and pretend they are a family unit. There is no way for us to know instantly at the border, and by the way, and I've talked to a number of Cabinet secretaries and other senior officials this week. Don't forget, our brave men and women at the border are doing the best that they can and they risk their lives every single day to be there and ask legitimate questions. If you want to come to one of the 26 ports of entry, if you want to stand in line and immigrate into the world's most generous country to immigrants, you can do that. We are talking about the sexual assaults are up now, the child smuggling is up, the drug smuggling is up. And all of these because we don't have -- we are a sovereign nation without physical borders and this President ..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "That's right. There is no doubt. This president has had as a major focus stopping the drug supply and drug demand crisis that is ruining this nation; 72,000 Americans dead last year, 90 percent or so of all heroin in this country comes through the southern border. Obviously, the cocaine comes through the southern border and now, increasingly, the fentanyl that is manufactured in labs in China, we are told is also coming through the southern border because everybody knows it's an easy way to get in. And so, this is very problematic because this President -- and many people don't focus on this, he's constantly talking about the poison coming over the southern border that coming to your community. And this opioid and drug crisis is no longer somebody else's kid or somebody else's coworker, somebody else's community. It's touching every nook and cranny in this country."

The president has made clear that there seems no other explanation other than that the gentleman is dead and I can't get ahead of the completion of any other investigation. It's very disappointing to see a major network run a completely false report that our own Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo and our President said was completely false and fantastical that somehow, the Secretary of State heard an audio tape and/or read a transcript from said audiotape.

Now, several -- two years ago I said all of these state department lawyers should be brought up on contempt or fraud before the court. What do you think should happen?"

He thought there was bad faith in the way, obviously, the State Department had behaved in the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit about Benghazi, no less. And of course, they are hiding their Clinton e-mails from us. They didn't tell the court or Judicial Watch forthrightly about what was going on and that's why they court -- they came in not too long ago and said, \"Look, I had false statements given to me. I don't know about these false affidavits that were given to me. I am interested to know what the Justice Department knew what and when.\" And I'm surprised that Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's top aid was given immunity when I found that she committed perjury and I couldn't believe her in another case about e-mails that Judicial Watch had pursued. So the State Department is fighting us on this, which is most troubling."

You talk about Mary Jo Kopechne and you say divers estimated she had survived for several hours in the Oldsmobile having an air pocket until she finally suffocated from lack of oxygen. But then, you go right to your point, which is, it doesn't matter. The feminist still loved Ted Kennedy."

If Ted Kennedy had said, \"You know I did that, it was cowardly. I was drunk. I didn't want to get arrested for it. I made a horrible decision and a woman died, and I'm sorry.\" I would be the first person to say, \"I believe in that.\" I'd be friends with Idi Amin if he repented. I don't believe in this no forgiveness thing that we're now all into."

Liberty University is a one of a kind school in Lynchburg, Virginia. It is a non-profit Christian university where students and faculty practice what they preach. I had the pleasure to visit recently and got a first-hand tour from its President, Jerry Falwell, Jr."

      "utterance": "Here I am at Liberty University with the President of the University, Jerry Falwell -- how is it that this university in particular is able to get so many students who are so Christian oriented, Constitution oriented, who believe in this country and are so energized by what's going on today?"

      "speaker": "JERRY FALWELL, JR. PRESIDENT, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY",
      "utterance": "Well, I call Liberty the Fox News Network of the academic world. Liberty is different than other universities in so many ways. The \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" did a cover story a few years ago. It said that the success of Liberty University is rooted in the fact that Liberty doesn't try to be like every other university. We try to emphasize academic freedom and freedom of expression. We try to keep education affordable and accessible."

      "speaker": "FALWELL",
      "utterance": "Visitors to the campus are always telling me how they go out of their way to ask them if they need directions. They drop something, the students will pick it up for them. A lot of universities, you walk around campus and the student won't make eye contact with you."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Right. What's the role -- let's get a little more political. I mean, with the midterms coming up. What's the role of the evangelical Christian, having seen everything that we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings and what role do they play and can they turn elections in this country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FALWELL",
      "utterance": "Well, when President Trump said to African-Americans, what the hell do you have to lose? We took that as he was talking to evangelicals as well because establishment Republicans have betrayed us for decades, and so a lot of us voted for Trump because what do have to lose?"

      "speaker": "FARWELL",
      "utterance": "I just think the country has never been more polarized. I remember when I was in law school in the '80s, I would travel with my father when he spoke at different mainstream universities, liberal schools, they would boo because he was a conservative, but they weren't like they are now. Now, in those days, liberals would say, \"I may not agree with you, but I'll fight for your right to say it.\" Now, they don't want you to say it. They become fascists instead of liberals, in my opinion."

      "speaker": "FARWELL",
      "utterance": "You know, I think it's years and years of education in the public schools that are controlled by the Teachers Unions and then higher education that is just all the professors believe a certain way, I forget how many, 98 percent supported Obama at the Ivy league schools, and it's just -- they've just been indoctrinated young people."

      "speaker": "FARWELL",

So what a shock. Here I am at Liberty. I just found someone who has my book. Okay, let's talk about politics and religion. Where does politics - - how is politics affected by your religion?"
