Remember, remember, Putin hired hookers to defile a bed where the Obamas once slept, all in the presence of evil Donald Trump. All that was missing was a sex toy shaped like Mike Huckabee's bass guitar. Still, the media bought it because they wanted to. It's a dilemma for me. The media and the Dems, they're like a person, you know, who's making a disastrous decision, like marrying Charlie Sheen. You want to say, \"No, no, no, no, no, don't do that.\" You realize this person has screwed all of us since day one. So instead, you say, \"Media and Democrats, you go for it.\" Right, Adam?"

      "utterance": "So 17 errors were made in the FISA process, yet we're told there was no bias. But if the errors all went in one direction, how's that unintentional? I mean, maybe I didn't mean to rob that bank, but the 17 mistakes I made along the way, you know, slipping and falling into that ski mask with my hand accidentally landing on that gun and then stumbling blindly into the savings and loan and by pure chance, scribbling, \"Give me the money or you're going die. [beep]\" on the back of a deposit slip, what are the odds of me making all those mistakes like that in a row? Which is why no one buys this crap. As the impeachment satisfies a craven media, it keeps helping Trump in key battleground states. What does that remind you of? The last election. Remember, it was the media who devoted hours to bashing Trump. The result? He won. And yet the media is doing it again with impeachment, mocking Trump and his defenders while pretending this isn't some sham, and Trump's numbers just go up. It's like the Tory landslide in England. A rebuke of rabid leftism. If our Dems were smart, they take that as a preview of what could happen here. You know, it's like watching your buddy take the drug first. But our Dems aren't that smart, and the media protects their stupidity from its consequences. Not to let the Republicans off the hook, however, they all should have walked out of that hearing, but by staying, they gave the charade some credence, and a charade it was. One Democrat even admits the impeachment vote was delayed because it was too late for a TV audience. So how delusional do you have to be to think the solution for your idiotic farce is to get more people to see your idiotic farce? Right, Adam?"

They sense the establishment's under attack, and it is. Who'd have thought, though, that the most radical figure in modern history is a reality TV star with orange hair? Why not let him explain it?"

So the more the critics attack him, the more they prove him right. Andrew Breitbart once said, \"Politics is downstream from culture.\" So this massive irrational reaction to Trump isn't political at all, but cultural. For once, the media, academia, entertainment complex feel threatened. And impeachment is how the emotionally damaged fight back. But it's like the Harlem Globetrotters, every game you know how it's going to unfold. You know the outcome. So we watch Pelosi following the other clowns off a cliff. Engaging in an actual abuse of power, with Democrats vowing that they'll keep impeaching till the very end. It's like that tired cliché about proof of insanity doing the same thing over and over again despite getting the same bad result. We have a better definition. It's called listening to Adam Schiff."

Didn’t hate it until he was accounted -- unaccounted for at 4:00 a.m., and his physical activity levels were spiking.”[laughter]Could have been watching porn. Now, if Fitbit were smart, they’d make an ad campaign out of that. “Fitbit keeps track of your steps, and it keeps track of him.” As for me, I'll give the guy the benefit of the doubt.
