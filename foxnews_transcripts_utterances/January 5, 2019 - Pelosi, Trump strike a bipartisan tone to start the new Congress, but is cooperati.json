I think it a lot of this is going to depend upon how Republicans in the Congress, particularly in the House, responds. If I were the president, I'd pick a couple of things and try and get them done that need to get done, like, let's pass the budget in time, let's fund the government, and then spend, as most presidents do when they don't have control of Congress, on the things over which there's executive authority or the president has a predominant authority, as in the case of foreign affairs. Look for ways to accentuate that the Democrats are being unfair with all of their investigations. The more it looks like he's the victim here, the better off he is. But he's got to be a responsible and reasonable victim and not merely a counterpuncher, which it's going to be difficult for him to restrain himself from doing.",

Nancy Pelosi reclaiming the speaker's gavel Thursday and reminding her fellow lawmakers that Congress is a co-equal branch of government amid the ongoing standoff with President Trump over border wall funding. Here with a look at what to expect from the 116th Congress, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnist Kim Strassel, editorial page writer, Kate Bachelder Odell, and assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman. So, Kate, Nancy Pelosi is back and I guess you have to give her credit because, look, there were a lot of people who were saying, criticizing her and she routed her opponents. How did she do it?"

There were 15 members who voted against her, but I read that as they given a pass to do so because they were in tough districts and she could win without them and didn't need their support. It would have been an entirely scenario if she did. I don't read that as opposition so much, you know, being allowed to walk. But, look, I think she did it by basically agreeing to tilt left on a lot of major issues on the next two years."

      "utterance": "I think that's a philosophical question, and that they are better at power consolidation and power management than the right is. I think that, look, Pelosi has made gestures in their direction. We'll have a lot of hearings on Medicare for All and Pelosi says she supports them. That's a risk going to the American public and saying that's an idea that we are flirting with."

      "utterance": "Well, they will focus on a lot of their priorities, passing bills that would be largely symbolic because, of course, they will not pass in a Republican Senate and they will not be signed by Trump. But bills on health care, maybe a Medicare for All-type bill, bills on energy, renewable energy, all the things that they will want to set the ground work for their presidential nominee going forward.  Beyond that, it's going to be investigations, investigations, and then where we go from the Mueller probe and everything, and just ongoing attacks against President Trump."

That's what the Democratic presidential candidates will be stressing. And once you start the machinery of investigations, and you get the Mueller report, then maybe it's going to be very hard to stop towards a goal of impeachment? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes. As you were suggesting earlier, where do you draw the line on the Democratic left? That will be one of Nancy Pelosi's biggest challenges, trying to decide, if she's able to decide, whether to rein in these investigations and the full-out relentless assault on Donald Trump because there's going to be a point beyond, which certainly Trump supporters will crack back against that, and possibly people more in the center will wonder is the Democratic Party about nothing else than trying to take down the president of the United States."

If you wanted to give President Trump his entire $25 billion, I think you could get a lot of good pro-immigration agenda through. The question is, do Democrats actually want to solve this problem or do they like this fight for political reasons? And the fact that they have continued to resist any wall funding, any trades, suggests they like the fight and not a solution."

I think they are so determined to take down President Trump that they're not -- I think a lot of these new members don't think they are there to get things done, they're to take down the president. There are moderate Democrats, who ran from states like New Jersey, Michigan, who perhaps will be uncomfortable with a strategy like that and may push for legislation, and it's going to be a real challenge for Nancy Pelosi to manage the two sides of the party."

Because the language about the wall -- no money at all, it's immoral, it's inefficient, it's an expensive waste of money -- all of these things don't portend well for getting a deal on the shutdown quickly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "I'm not certain that she's been in different position earlier. I think one of the problems with this was the president, well intentioned, had a session in the Oval Office in mid-December with Schumer and Pelosi, in which everybody sort of got locked in their positions. She was -- she had a lot of difficulty inside the Democratic caucus. This happened early enough that she was able to solve the problem by saying, no money for the wall ever, and that sort of locked her in a position and now it's going to be hard to get her out of it. She had to do that in order to assure that she didn't fight a battle both with Democrats newly elected from Trump districts, who were concerned that she would be too liberal, and the left- wing of the party, the Ocasio-Cortez wing, which she concerned that she would be too centrist. She took care of the problem with the hard left but she may have locked herself in a position that will be hard to get out of."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, I would push -- James Freeman talked about the immigration reform. If I were the Democrats, I would say, look, let's give him money for the wall and let's get something like a DACA fix in return, the DREAMers fix in return, because the wall will -- will diminished in people's minds. The DACA fix, which is like a 70 or 80 percent winner, depending on how you word the question, and it will accrue to the advantage of both Democrats and Republicans, but it's going to be Democrats who will be the people who laid it out on the table and said we are willing to deal with you in order to get it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "What would your advice be to President Trump, how to deal with Democrats? Because my thinking is that the more they investigate him and move toward impeachment, assuming they do, the more Trump will have to rely on Republicans to salvage his presidency, if, for example, they do impeach him in the House and goes to Senate, so it makes him less likely to compromise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "It's very important for Republicans, particularly in the House, to make a -- to treat the Democrat suggestions, like Medicare for All and free jobs and the Green New Deal and so forth, treat it seriously and attack those proposals on the merits. The White House would be great to be involved in that but the one thing that requires discipline and focus, and this White House has neither discipline nor focus when it comes to messaging. But the Republicans have got to treat these issues seriously in order to showcase the differences between what the Democrats are attempting to do and the Republican response. And the Republican response has got to be not only do the Democrats have bad ideas but the Republicans are going to have to give a sense on what it is they would do in lieu of these kinds of things. I think it a lot of this is going to depend upon how Republicans in the Congress, particularly in the House, responds. If I were the president, I'd pick a couple of things and try and get them done that need to get done, like, let's pass the budget in time, let's fund the government, and then spend, as most presidents do when they don't have control of Congress, on the things over which there's executive authority or the president has a predominant authority, as in the case of foreign affairs. Look for ways to accentuate that the Democrats are being unfair with all of their investigations. The more it looks like he's the victim here, the better off he is. But he's got to be a responsible and reasonable victim and not merely a counterpuncher, which it's going to be difficult for him to restrain himself from doing."

We will have a serious of six primaries this year and she's going to probably fare well in those virtual primaries before voters ever show up in Iowa and New Hampshire. The first primary is for talent. She got an early strike there by hiring Bernie Sanders' Iowa guy to work for her. Message, she came out strong with a message on billionaires and corporations controlling Americans, screwing the little man and little woman. Money, we will see how well she does well. That's going to be one of the attractions for Robert Francis O'Rourke, that he had $80 million from small donors. But she's also a formidable fundraiser. Later in the year, we will see organization. We'll see the use of social media. She's not particularly adept in that. She comes across as a little inauthentic."

She has name ID. and a pretty strong image, so I think she will end the year in a pretty good place. But there's no guaranty that she's the nominee.

This is a woman who is all about Medicare for All. She would like to see the federal government actually manufacture its own prescription drugs. She's obviously in favor of much higher taxes. She wants to put vast new restrictions on corporate America, including requiring companies over a certain size to actually get a federal charter and put 40 percent of its board made of its workers. So these are some very radical ideas that are about expanding the size of government and, therefore, are very different. But to the extent --"

She's gets a Michelob Ultra out of fridge and offers one to her husband. He sort of looks at her like, why would we do this.  And it really is --"

But the thing that stands -- where she stands out right now is her proposal to reorganize American capitalism.  Most big companies are chartered at the state level, like Delaware, in particular, which offers a lot of maximum freedom. The main thing that CEO's are responsible for is to the owners, the shareholders, the people who gave them the capital, all right? She wants to make those CEO's accountable not to shareholders predominantly but to what she calls stakeholders, who would be employees, for example, who would be community people, who would be customers, a much broader universe of people, including a lot of political restrictions on what they could do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes. She calls it the Accountable Capitalism Act. And in addition to the federal charter, she wants to put 40 percent of employees on the corporate board, restrictions on corporate campaign contributions.  This is an idea, as Kim was suggesting, of the progressive left, and it probably is an idea that kind of has some resonance with younger people, college kids, who haven't worked in the private sector in companies that have to function day after day. Elizabeth Warren's suggestion here, her expectation is that there are enough people dissatisfied with the capitalist system in the United States that they would consider her candidacy seriously, which is difficult to do at the moment when the American capitalism system seems to be booming."

But This issue, where you see in the clip, she sounds a lot like some Republicans, like Marco Rubio, who developed a plan for how you deal with the slow-growth Obama economy. And they're describing an economy that doesn't really exist, thank goodness, at the moment. Things may change.  But they're basically giving a 2016 message. Her biggest problem, though, I think is that her play for identity politics, her bogus claim of Native American status, I think in a Democratic primary is a mortal wound, because to endorse her, that party would have to say identity politics, which have put so much stock in, is a fraud and a joke and a political tool used when appropriate for our purposes, but ignored when it's not useful to us."

These things will be at the focus of these negotiations. The U.S. wants to see real serious enforceable commitments to cut subsidies and discussion of new sales of U.S. goods, whether soybeans or jetliners, or what have you. The U.S. is focused on those fundamental reforms."

      "utterance": "You know, the old line -- I've covered this story for a long time.  And the old thing, well, we will buy more soybeans, more jet planes, this or that, more liquefied natural gas, that's all fine, nothing wrong with that. That's not going to do it this time, in my estimation. The U.S. wants more and I think U.S. business wants more. What should we -- what are -- what do your companies want to see from this negotiation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Paul, you're absolutely right, that's not going to cut it. Bob Lighthizer, the U.S. trade rep., is focused very much on the fundamental reforms. I do think one of the challenges we are looking at right now is subsidies provided to these key sectors. They're provided by the Chinese central government but also by provincial governments in China. The U.S. is looking for ways that those can be cut and in a verifiable, enforceable way, in addition to the intellectual property protections that I mentioned, so that's certainly where the focus is going to be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "I think you will see the Chinese are going to say, OK, fine, these will be -- we will do this and they might even change legislation in some cases, for example, having to do with joint ventures, allowing more ownership by foreign companies than 50 percent, or I.P. theft. But it seems to me that enforcement is going to be the key, that we have to be able to say, here is how we can track you if you break the agreements, and then have some mechanism for -- for retaliating."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is exactly where people are trying to come up with creative new solutions. Now the threat of tariffs is out there, but for us, in the U.S. business community, you know, at the end of the day, tariffs are a tax paid by Americans, American consumers and businesses.  What can we do that isn't tariff-based?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Well, no. Nobody knows yet. And Democrats have been lining up in the Congress saying that they will be looking for more on the enforcement of labor provisions and possibly some other issues. But, honestly, members of Congress are just starting to focus on this. We, in the business community, who support the agreement, because we need that certainty of the access to the two most important export markets, I think we have a steep road to climb here, but we will be out there trying to explain to members of Congress just how important the markets are and how we need continuity."

And we had glitch in the stock market last month but still up, I guess, about 30 percent from the time I got elected and it's going to go up. Once we settle trade issues and once a couple of other things happen, it's going to go up. It's got long way to go."

U.S. employers dramatically stepped up hiring in December, adding a remarkable 312,000 new jobs, an encouraging end to 2018. So what can we expect in the New Year?

You now have more than a million people in the prime working years since President Trump got elected coming back to labor force or joining it. This is what we have been hoping for, labor force participation going up, jobs up, wages up. Really great news. And especially interesting because we've heard so much about the tax cuts were just going to cause a sugar high, just the first quarter or second quarter boom, second quarter boom won't last, and now it looks like surprising strength at the end of the year."

The manufacturing index really fell off, global growth really slow.  You saw the Apple numbers, stock market. Financial markets have been tightening, credit markets tightening. It's going to be slower in 2019? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: It could be slower in 2019. The big issue looming is, in fact, the trade negotiation with China. As President Trump just said himself in the clip we looked at, the stock market had this little, as he called it, a glitch in December."

And what the United States wants from the Chinese and Xi Jinping, in my mind, is a significant structural change in the Chinese economic model. If you think that's going to happen by early March, which is the deadline President Trump has set, after which he will impose tariffs if he doesn't get what he wants, then I think we are going to a long-term tariff regime. You are really talking about a very long trade, arduous trade negotiation with the Chinese government."

      "utterance": "Kim, if we go to that kind of scenario, where the U.S. slaps on 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion, $300 billion worth of Chinese goods as opposed to 10 percent, and then China retaliates, I think both -- both economies will suffer enormously. There's a big incentive for them, at least both sides, to get the structure of a deal, even if implementation of everything will take some time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, of course. As you were talking about with the last interview, Mr. Murphy, these are interconnected economies. There are some people -- and you hear the president saying it, unfortunately, at times, saying, look, their economy is hurting far more than ours is, that's a good thing. Actually, when their economy is economy is hurt, their consumers aren't buying American goods and everyone ends up worse off. They have to understand -- and the president alluded this, he didn't use the word -- what's hanging over the stock market and problematic in our economy is simply uncertainty. And trade is a big aspect of that uncertainty. The Fed another one. But those are the things that if they could get settled and investors and corporations knew what was coming, then we will probably see that reflected in the stock market and, again, in greater growth."

      "speaker": "KATE BACHELDER ODELL, EDITORIAL PAGE WRITER",
      "utterance": "The short answer is no, Paul.  I think, if anything, we are going to have to rely on a GOP Senate to stop House proposals that would damage growth in the economy. I'm talking about, you know, more harassment on businesses, trying to stop the Trump deregulatory efforts, which the House is going to certainly try to do, maybe trying to raise the corporate tax rate, which in addition to being higher, would add more uncertainty about whether the rate is going to stay.  So hopefully, there's a check on bad policies. But I don't think anything could be put in the pro-growth column at this point."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

      "speaker": "FREEMAN",
      "utterance": "I don't think they made a mistake? We might disagree on this, but I think this is a very strong U.S. economy. Fortunately, so far the power of the Trump tax cuts and regulatory tax cuts is bigger than the downside of the Trump tariffs. Maybe that changes after March 1st. But I think there's a compelling argument that Xi Jinping, you don't have to be a thuggish dictator, you can even still be pretty Communist, but you have to realize, like your most recent predecessors, you have to let markets work."

Romney denying that the move is a sign of a possible 2020 primary challenge. So if it's not a primary challenge potential, setting him up for that, Dan, what is he up to?"

He said, \"I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, antiimmigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.\" Paul, that is pandering. That's pandering to every buzz word in the anti-Trump left, the idea that they are always suburban people who agree with that. Mitt is trying to assemble his 2020 coalition. It could not be more obvious."

      "speaker": "STRASSEL",

And remember, that even if that president hasn't necessarily rallied the entire spectrum of the conservative world around him, the institutions of the presidency are behind him, too, the party apparatus, everything is design today protect them, make it hard for challenger to succeed. Romney has to know that. But all I could say is the animus that drives a lot of Never Trumpers is so huge that it clouds their clear thinking on the success possibilities here."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Kate, one of the things that was striking to me is that Romney didn't really note a major policy difference with the president. He had generals -- talk about character. The question becomes, where would he draw policy lines with the president? Would it be trade, would it be immigration, foreign policy I suppose? But they weren't in that op-ed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ODELL",
      "utterance": "Well, that's what stuck out to me about the op-ed, is that he basically said Trump has had accomplishments but they are on things that  all Republicans agree on. And I think that reveals a sort of misunderstanding on why people took a chance on Trump. Would Mitt Romney have released a list of judges that he would have put on the court in the mold of Antonin Scalia? I don't know the answer to that. Would he have repealed the clean power plan or withdrawn from the Paris agreement? I think there are some confounding realities of Trump and is why people took a chance on him, besides his character. Aside from his character, in spite of it. I think Mitt is not really understanding that."

I'm going to assembly a coalition to rein in your ability to willy-nilly impose tariffs, OK.

I don't think it's going to happen right away. They will hold off until they get a report from Robert Mueller and they see what they get from their investigations.

If it's a special investigator, you never know.
