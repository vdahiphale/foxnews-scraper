But Kilmeade said he wasn't available. So you're stuck with me. My deepest condolences go out to you the audience, you thought you were getting Gutfeld instead, you're getting someone taller, better looking. And someone who didn't get fired from a ton of magazines. You got Watters instead. This is like buying tickets to see Jerry Seinfeld. And Carrot Top takes the stage. Now I give you your money back. But I found out Gutfeld doesn't charge anybody to come see the show. Which makes sense. But there's a silver lining. Unlike a normal show. None of tonight's jokes will go over your head. That I promise you. It's me. And it's an honor to step into Greg's shoes today even though it kind of hurts because he's a size six. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Greg's been on a hot streak recently. So he needs a break. A number one bestseller, a new house, a baby boy. Wait, that's me. You'd think Greg would want to baby finally someone in his life who's shorter than he is? Also someone to laugh at his poop jokes. Greg has a strange sense of humor, doesn't he? It's almost like there's something beneath the surface that he wants to tell us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But I don't think anyone buys a $1200 pair of sweat pants and thinks they're being authentic. Just take history. Take a heat from history's smartest people. They dressed like crap. Einstein, Steve Jobs, me, we don't care."

He ignores more warnings and an obese pregnant diabetic smoking cigarettes. But he can't say he wasn't told. Last week, Curtis Sliwa, Mayoral Candidate, and our best dressed guest tonight hand delivered a letter outlining the chaos at the chronically understaffed jail. It included photos of recently assaulted guards and blasted De Blasio for attending concerts and fun events instead of providing relief. This, after video surfaced of inmates drinking gambling, smoking, like just they were partying in Vegas, except in a casino, they'd have to wear masks. Meanwhile, Curtis released a campaign ad, where he outlines his plans to save the Big Apple all while petting a cat like a James Bond villain."

So, basically, she was brought back from the dead. And all the consultants say, don't use the cat, because nobody's going to focus on your message. And I said, yes, but maybe it's better they focus on the cat because when I'm mad, we're not killing any more dogs or cats, we're going to have no kill shelter. No geese consultant. Take that."

So, I don't have 17 of them, but my level of obsession for the one that I do have is far more unhealthy and strange. I love him. He's the love of my life. And we're going to have a great weekend together when Machi and my husband are at Sandals. And I love the campaign out I just wish I had seen it yesterday. So, it could have had something to watch and I was sitting alone because they were sitting next to each other on the ride home."
