      "utterance": "Exactly, political pardoning himself or his family members, and it ended up with this shakeup and actually a very polished performance from Anthony Scaramucci. And I think the fact that Spicer went -- today, maybe it was a little surprising today but it was not a shock because a White House press secretary has to be a good performer on television, and especially with this president, has to be a good performer on television, and he just was not a good performer."

      "utterance": "Anna, should we imagine the set of attributes that Scaramucci has brought to this job, he has run a very successful hedge fund, he is no stranger to politics. He's donated heavily to both parties. He was involved in the Trump campaign. Should we imagine that he will have greater success than Sean Spicer did?"

      "speaker": "PALMER",
      "utterance": "I don't know. I think the one question is really out there is Anthony Scaramucci has never set strategic messaging for a corporation, for a Congressional office, for the White House, and that is a big job. And the other question is does Sean Spicer's press team, does the communications department, do they see it's an opportunity where they say you know what, I don't want to be working here anymore, or does Anthony Scaramucci bring in his own people? So that's going to be I think the two things that I'm definitely watching for."

    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "We should also mention that he announced that Sarah Huckabee Sanders would be the press secretary. So she'll be the one if they do televised briefings, she will be the one who will actually be the face of it. So it depends -- it's unclear whether that's going to be actually much better. But there is the kind of work that the White House is not doing very much. If the president is going to announce X on Wednesday, all of a sudden on Tuesday we see lots of stories in the press about what the president is going to do. Well, that doesn't happen by accident. There is a communications director planning this kind of stuff. And that's what we don't know if Scaramucci is going to be able to do. But they haven't done that much anyway, but anything would be an improvement."

      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "What he did show today is that he is really good on television. He's got a certain charm. He's not adversarial and defensive. When he brought up the brothers, in the long roster of history, there was Cain and Abel. So it doesn't always work out very well."

      "speaker": "ROSEN",
      "utterance": "One other individual which whom Mr. Scaramucci will have to contend is someone who is reportedly dead set against his hiring, and that is Stephen Bannon. Here's how Anthony Scaramucci addressed that individual at today's briefing."

      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "I've been interviewed about Steve, and he is one of the smartest people I know. I think he was instrumental in helping us win the election. He's got a strong personality. I have a strong personality. The legendary John Weinberg who is now deceased once said some people grow, other people swell. And that's a great line to think about yourself."
