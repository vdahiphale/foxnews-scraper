      "sentences": "Good evening. Welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Last year, unbeknownst to pretty much nobody, a woman in Brooklyn started a Twitter account that was comprised almost solely of videos of liberals talking about themselves. So, the concept was very simple: Find interesting tape that had already been uploaded to the internet by the people who made it and then repost that tape. There was no editing of it, no special effects. There was very little editorial content. The idea was to let activist-types describe, in their own words, what they believe, unfiltered. The woman who created it called that account \"Libs of TikTok.\" Libs of TikTok now has more followers than the entire population of the State of Wyoming. Libs of TikTok's audience dwarfs the nightly viewership on CNN. So, it was quite successful by definition. The question is why? Here's why: It turns out that is repellent as academic lifestyle liberalism may seem to you as an observer. The reality of it, as described by the people who actually believe this stuff, is even worse than you ever imagined. It's really beyond belief, both idiotic and disgusting. It's like watching someone eat roadkill. You feel nauseous, but you can't turn away. So, Libs of TikTok found all kinds of tape on the internet, but they found a bunch of selfie-style videos from the publicly available social media accounts of teachers. They didn't snoop. They just put what people already posted. Here's some of what they found:",

Either way, you have a right as a parent to know what these people are teaching to your children. And yet, before Libs of TikTok, there was not an easy way to find out what they were teaching. You take the teacher's word for it. Well, it turns out there are an awful lot of videos like this out there. Libs of TikTok found a lot of them.

Now again, maybe you're okay with your kids being taught by emotionally incontinent nutcases like that. Maybe you're not. But you probably ought to know either way. So, you can see why Libs of TikTok quickly became so very popular. You didn't have to wade through some long editorial to find out what was actually happening. You could see the raw video and again, you could assess it for yourself. Millions of parents were grateful for that. So, is Christina Pushaw who is the Press Secretary for the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. It was partly in response to videos that she saw on Libs of TikTok that Florida ultimately banned public school teachers from lecturing kindergartners about sex. That's now law. It's one of the most popular laws in the state. A majority of Democrats support it. So, Libs of TikTok was getting results as good journalism does. Not bad for a Twitter feed. So, of course, that Twitter feed had to be shut down. The Biden administration and its many servants in the news media set off to work. The neoliberal slander machine Media Matters published four separate hit pieces on Libs of TikTok in just the past three weeks. It was trafficking hate for allowing liberals to talk about themselves. It was anti-gay as if the site was attacking anyone. Certainly, it was not attacking gays. It was just playing tape of people talking about themselves in their own words - video that they uploaded. Well, Twitter could not stand this. They shut down the account entirely twice. They suspended it. One of the suspensions came after a complaint from a Harvard law instructor called Alejandra Caraballo. Quote: \"My report on Libs of TikTok violating Twitter rules got them suspended,\" she bragged. Yet the woman who runs Libs of TikTok kept going. So ultimately, Jeff Bezos weighed in. Bezos' personal newspaper, \"The Washington Post,\" decided to harass the family of the woman who operates the Libs of TikTok. They couldn't find her, so they went after her family. \"The Post\" sent what it calls its tech columnist, Taylor Lorenz, to show up outside a home that belongs to one of the woman's relatives and then Lorenz set about trying to find the woman herself. She couldn't. She sent a direct message on Twitter to someone who turned out to be not that woman and had nothing to do with the account whatsoever. But because she did that, we know what Taylor Lorenz was saying. Here's what she said, quote: \"You're being implicated in starting a hate campaign against LGBTQ people.\" Right. A hate campaign. So here you have Taylor Lorenz, who is effectively acting as the Stasi for the Deep State, trying to intimidate a private citizen into silence and this morning she gave it her best shot. \"The Washington Post\" published a piece by Lorenz linking to the name, the physical address, and the real estate licensing information of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok. After \"The Post\" published the article, the woman behind Libs of TikTok went into hiding. That was, of course, the whole point of the exercise. People know where she lives because \"The Washington Post\" linked to it, so she had to leave. Now, Taylor Lorenz, of all people, knew this would happen. She knew what she was doing when she wrote the story. She was trying to shut this woman up. It was just a couple of months ago, you might remember, that Lorenz herself complained on television that she was being harassed and that no one under any circumstances would be allowed to show up at her home. Here she is:",

But if you really think it's hard, if you're really against that kind of behavior, why are you engaging in it at scale? So a few weeks later, after shooting that performance, Taylor Lorenz shows up at the door -- and there's the picture right there -- of a relative of the private citizen who posts videos that Taylor Lorenz's bosses don't like, and then she posts that person's identity online. So this is obviously an intimidation campaign designed to shut down a highly effective Twitter feed. But take one step deeper into the story and ask yourself: Did Taylor Lorenz, the woman you just saw crying on TV because she has PTSD, did she really do the reporting here? Did she really track down the personal information of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? Please, of course not. She couldn't. Taylor Lorenz is not a reporter. Apart from whining about herself on television, she has no skills. She couldn't do a weather forecast in a rainstorm. She's not a journalist. She's merely a receptacle for information that other people gather for their own ends, a willing receptacle. So where did she get this information? Who gave her the identity of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? Well, actually, we don't have to guess because today's \"Washington Post's\" story answers that question. \"The Post\" piece tells us that information came from a man called Travis Brown. Travis Brown runs the quote: \"Travis Brown Hate Speech Tracker,\" which uses a variety of proprietary methods to reveal personally identifying information of private citizens who stray from the approved storyline. Now, who pays for all this? That's the question. Well, the \"Travis Brown Hate Speech Tracker\" is funded by something called the prototype fund. Here's how the prototype fund describes the point of Travis Brown's project, quote: \"Prominent right-wing extremist accounts on Twitter and Facebook have developed a well-documented pattern to distribute controversial and extremist content to their followers and then delete it before moderators have the opportunity to react to it.\" In other words, before it can be censored. \"Archiving is an important element in counteracting this behavior and has in many cases led to prominent victories in the fight against the extreme right.\" Extreme right? So, not all hate speech is the same. The hate speech tracker does not target the hate speech of BLM rioters or Antifa. No, only enemies of the Biden administration and the guys at Davos. How do they do it? Well, Brown's methods, according to him, include using automated software to save user account names and social media posts long after they have been deleted. So, there's no hiding from these people. Now, that appears to be a violation of Twitter's terms of service. Not that we care because they don't care. We reached out to Twitter about this. Isn't this a violation? Well, they ignored us. They suspended our account. What's interesting, though, is that Travis Brown himself appears to be a former Twitter employee. So again, who's paying for this? Well, a foreign government is paying for it. The prototype fund gets its money not from private donors, but from the government of Germany -- Germany's Federal Ministry of Education. It says so right on the website. In other words, what happened to the woman who runs Libs of TikTok, her life being destroyed, was not the work of Taylor Lorenz, the fearless journalist who cries on TV from her PTSD. No, it was a foreign intelligence operation designed to silence and intimidate an American citizen. Wait, is that legal? Did the Biden administration have any role in this particular intel op? Why is the German government trying to shut down an American Twitter account posting about American teachers? And since she was the recipient, the willing recipient, of this information from a foreign government designed to destroy an American citizen, why hasn't Taylor Lorenz, at the very least, registered under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA)? We seem to remember quite a bit of talk about this over the last year. We think there was an impeachment trial of it. Someone went to prison because of it, but Taylor Lorenz can take information from a foreign government to crush an American citizen, clearly as part of an Intel operation, and she's a journalist in good standing at Jeff Bezos' newspaper? Lots of questions here. We hope we can get to the bottom of all of them. We're going to start tonight by talking to the creator of Libs of TikTok who joins us right now by phone, and we appreciate your coming on. So I just have to ask because I'm really interested. Why do you suppose the German government wanted to shut down your Twitter feed?",

It's the Trump movement and people who are conservative.

And you know what, it is sad to me to see so many flight attendants celebrating and people that are in their seats because you realize people have just been suffering, fearful that they're going to go to prison. The first announcement they hear, if you don't comply, you know, you can be arrested. Imagine having a Federal charge because you didn't wear a mask over your face. We watched children suffer. We watched special needs kids get kicked off of planes for their inability to keep their masks on their face, as well as young kids, two years old crying and screaming not understanding why they're being made to wear a mask and this is really just happening in America by the way. I've traveled all across Europe, they've all released a mask mandate. This is not based in science. This is just based in control. The government took power, they don't want to give it back. And to me, as happy as I am, as relieved as I am that I can go on a plane and not wear a mask, I don't feel like this is a win because we shouldn't be cheering on the restoration of our basic human rights.

Similarly, OSHA broke the law. They were trying to overreach and decide they could do things that they had entirely no power to do so. When regular people break the law, Tucker, they go to prison. Why is Rochelle Walensky and the C.D.C. and the members of the F.D.A. and the drug cartel that's operating our country, any exception to that rule? It's unacceptable.

Denying reality doesn't change reality. You can say gravity isn't real, but if you jump off the roof of your garage, you're still going to get hurt. And that's true for biological sex. It is in fact real whether the authorities admit it or not. Officials in New Jersey are learning that lesson this week. Two female inmates at a supposedly all women's prison in New Jersey have just become pregnant. We wondered how that happened. Well, it turns out those women had sexual encounters with another inmate who was a biological man passing as a woman. Now some people predicted that this would happen and they were laughed at, mocked, and attacked as bigots, Kara Dansky is at the very top of that list. She said this years ago on our show. She is the President of the U.S. Chapter of the Women's Declaration International, author of the book, \"The Abolition of Sex: How the Transgender Agenda Harms Women and Girls,\" and we are happy to have Kara Dansky back. Kara, thanks so much for coming on.

We need to not have men being housed in women's prisons. But a couple of takeaways from this that I just want to point out, are, first of all, the state is not getting away with this by telling its residents that they are housing men in women's prisons. What they are doing, of course, is telling the residents that they are housing, so called transgender women or trans-women in women's prisons, suggesting that there is some sort of subcategory of women that is called transgender women or trans-women and it's not true. The fact of this story shoots a hole right through the trope that trans- women are women. Our society has been taught that we are supposed to say and think that trans-women are women. But obviously, that is not true because the individuals that are the focus of the story impregnated women and every thinking adult, no matter what the President of the United States has to say on the matter knows that there is no category of women who can impregnate women. So I really want to thank you for highlighting this story, and I also just want to point out that this is not just a problem in New Jersey. This is a problem across the country. I know that we have talked previously about how the State of California recently enacted a law at the end of 2020, which went into effect in 2021, which mandates that men be housed in women's prisons on the basis of their so-called gender identity, if they say that they are women. Washington State has a similar policy. However, this is not just happening in blue states. This is happening across the country. As far as I know, 49 states plus the District of Columbia have some form of law or policy in place that mandates the housing of men in women's prisons.",

You could see the raw video and again, you could assess it for yourself. Millions of parents were grateful for that. So, is Christina Pushaw who is the Press Secretary for the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. It was partly in response to videos that she saw on Libs of TikTok that Florida ultimately banned public school teachers from lecturing kindergartners about sex. That's now law. It's one of the most popular laws in the state. A majority of Democrats support it. So, Libs of TikTok was getting results as good journalism does. Not bad for a Twitter feed. So, of course, that Twitter feed had to be shut down. The Biden administration and its many servants in the news media set off to work. The neoliberal slander machine Media Matters published four separate hit pieces on Libs of TikTok in just the past three weeks. It was trafficking hate for allowing liberals to talk about themselves. It was anti-gay as if the site was attacking anyone. Certainly, it was not attacking gays. It was just playing tape of people talking about themselves in their own words - video that they uploaded. Well, Twitter could not stand this. They shut down the account entirely twice. They suspended it.

They couldn't find her, so they went after her family. \"The Post\" sent what it calls its tech columnist, Taylor Lorenz, to show up outside a home that belongs to one of the woman's relatives and then Lorenz set about trying to find the woman herself.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "So this is obviously an intimidation campaign designed to shut down a highly effective Twitter feed. But take one step deeper into the story and ask yourself",
      "utterance": "Did Taylor Lorenz, the woman you just saw crying on TV because she has PTSD, did she really do the reporting here? Did she really track down the personal information of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? Please, of course not. She couldn't. Taylor Lorenz is not a reporter. Apart from whining about herself on television, she has no skills. She couldn't do a weather forecast in a rainstorm. She's not a journalist. She's merely a receptacle for information that other people gather for their own ends, a willing receptacle. So where did she get this information? Who gave her the identity of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? Well, actually, we don't have to guess because today's \"Washington Post's\" story answers that question. \"The Post\" piece tells us that information came from a man called Travis Brown. Travis Brown runs the quote: \"Travis Brown Hate Speech Tracker,\" which uses a variety of proprietary methods to reveal personally identifying information of private citizens who stray from the approved storyline. Now, who pays for all this? That's the question. Well, the \"Travis Brown Hate Speech Tracker\" is funded by something called the prototype fund. Here's how the prototype fund describes the point of Travis Brown's project, quote: \"Prominent right-wing extremist accounts on Twitter and Facebook have developed a well-documented pattern to distribute controversial and extremist content to their followers and then delete it before moderators have the opportunity to react to it.\" In other words, before it can be censored. \"Archiving is an important element in counteracting this behavior and has in many cases led to prominent victories in the fight against the extreme right.\" Extreme right? So, not all hate speech is the same. The hate speech tracker does not target the hate speech of BLM rioters or Antifa. No, only enemies of the Biden administration and the guys at Davos. How do they do it? Well, Brown's methods, according to him, include using automated software to save user account names and social media posts long after they have been deleted. So, there's no hiding from these people. Now, that appears to be a violation of Twitter's terms of service. Not that we care because they don't care. We reached out to Twitter about this. Isn't this a violation? Well, they ignored us. They suspended our account. What's interesting, though, is that Travis Brown himself appears to be a former Twitter employee. So again, who's paying for this? Well, a foreign government is paying for it. The prototype fund gets its money not from private donors, but from the government of Germany -- Germany's Federal Ministry of Education. It says so right on the website. In other words, what happened to the woman who runs Libs of TikTok, her life being destroyed, was not the work of Taylor Lorenz, the fearless journalist who cries on TV from her PTSD. No, it was a foreign intelligence operation designed to silence and intimidate an American citizen. Wait, is that legal? Did the Biden administration have any role in this particular intel op? Why is the German government trying to shut down an American Twitter account posting about American teachers? And since she was the recipient, the willing recipient, of this information from a foreign government designed to destroy an American citizen, why hasn't Taylor Lorenz, at the very least, registered under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA)? We seem to remember quite a bit of talk about this over the last year. We think there was an impeachment trial of it. Someone went to prison because of it, but Taylor Lorenz can take information from a foreign government to crush an American citizen, clearly as part of an Intel operation, and she's a journalist in good standing at Jeff Bezos' newspaper? Lots of questions here. We hope we can get to the bottom of all of them. We're going to start tonight by talking to the creator of Libs of TikTok who joins us right now by phone, and we appreciate your coming on. So I just have to ask because I'm really interested. Why do you suppose the German government wanted to shut down your Twitter feed?"

I wouldn't agree with that, but at least I could swallow it, the idea that as soon as someone gains influence, they are fair game for reporting, but you know, that's not the case. Imagine for example, if I tomorrow, go to Tucker to Taylor Lorenz's his home and bang on her door, or FOX sends a camera crew to her parents' house or some right-wing independent journalist goes to her sibling's workplace and says, \"We're here to find out information about Taylor Lorenz, an extremely powerful and influential journalist.\" Or imagine if you unmask the identity of say a trans-activist who was popular on Facebook, or a Black Lives Matter activist who had a big Twitter following, you think these people who are defending Taylor Lorenz would say, oh, this is fair game reporting. This is shoe leather journalism. They would declare it like some sort of crisis of national mental health and press freedom. They would like lower the flags to half-mast. It's clearly a huge double standard, punctuated by the fact that Taylor Lorenz was just on national TV sobbing, claiming that she was the victim of exactly this kind of behavior less than three weeks ago."

What has happened is in the Trump era, the media convinced itself the corporate media, that the real threats to the United States were no longer the C.I.A. and the Pentagon and the N.S.A. and Wall Street and Silicon Valley, all of whom are on their side and trying to undermine Trump. It's the Trump movement and people who are conservative. Those are criminals in their eyes, and they move their media lens from the people who used to be the target of it, people in power centers, to individual citizens whose only crime is that they have the wrong ideology and they are using their vast resources. \"The Washington Post\" is owned by Jeff Bezos, not to challenge actual power centers, but to destroy and wreck the lives and reputations of people who they regard as having the wrong politics.

We obviously know the science does not make sense. It never makes sense. Talk about science ever shifting, that's exactly what the C.D.C. specializes in, making up things as they go along, like they're actually \"Simon says\" in the child's game. And you know what, it is sad to me to see so many flight attendants celebrating and people that are in their seats because you realize people have just been suffering, fearful that they're going to go to prison. The first announcement they hear, if you don't comply, you know, you can be arrested. Imagine having a Federal charge because you didn't wear a mask over your face. We watched children suffer. We watched special needs kids get kicked off of planes for their inability to keep their masks on their face, as well as young kids, two years old crying and screaming not understanding why they're being made to wear a mask and this is really just happening in America by the way. I've traveled all across Europe, they've all released a mask mandate. This is not based in science. This is just based in control. The government took power, they don't want to give it back. And to me, as happy as I am, as relieved as I am that I can go on a plane and not wear a mask, I don't feel like this is a win because we shouldn't be cheering on the restoration of our basic human rights. We should be infuriated. And we should want to see these people face consequences because guess what, Tucker? The C.D.C. broke the law. That's what the ruling says. It was unconstitutional. Similarly, OSHA broke the law. They were trying to overreach and decide they could do things that they had entirely no power to do so. When regular people break the law, Tucker, they go to prison. Why is Rochelle Walensky and the C.D.C. and the members of the F.D.A. and the drug cartel that's operating our country, any exception to that rule? It's unacceptable. And I'm not going to cheer until these people are behind bars for what they have done to the dignity of human beings, forcing them to sit behind masks that we know do not work to stop the spread of the virus."

Malcolm Nance, who clearly does not have a lot else going on has decided to be the exception to that rule, it is like when Elvis joined the army, it's kind of inspirational. So, it is not Malcolm Nance we're mad at, we want to know where his backup is. Where is Joy Reid? Where is Max Boot? Where is Joe Scarborough, who people who work with him say is a pretty tough character? Where are all the other people? Where is David Frum? The Ukrainians could desperately use their skills right now. You called for a war, maybe you should go ahead and fight in it. So at least you can say of Malcolm Nance, well, he is.

Well, we opened the show tonight by telling you of the international effort including the German government to censor and silence the Twitter feed Libs of TikTok, but Libs of TikTok is not the only operation in that position. A lot of journalists are being censored. One of them is an independent reporter called Savanah Hernandez. Twitter has banned her permanently. Now, why? What did she do? Well, because she was one of the only people to cover the BLM riots in the summer of 2020 on the ground. They were ignored by big news operations. She didn't ignore it. She went there with an iPhone and took video of what was happening. So we decided it would be worth talking to her. We're glad we did. She's impressive.

Because you can't even go report on these events without being brutally attacked. I was with Elijah Schaffer in Philadelphia, he got punched in the face by Black Lives Matter looters. Me and Julio Rosas, you know, we're Hispanic people, we walk right into the riot, and no one suspects us. But if you don't look a certain way, you can't go into these leftist events or go into a riot without being attacked. So I decided --"

I have sat on plans with Elijah Schaffer right next to me, maskless. As soon as he puts his mask down, just a little bit, they get on him immediately.

It's happened multiple times, I've also gone to several riots and rallies and again on the basis of skin tone, these leftists think that I'm immediately a liberal because of the way that I look. So I've gone to BLM rallies, and I've asked the White attendees, \"Hi, will you apologize for your skin tone and for your ancestors' crimes?\" And they'll go: Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry for what my people did to you. And I'm like, I know, right? Isn't it horrible? What did they do? And they're like, slavery. And I'm like, okay, thank you for apologizing. And so that's why I'm able to get all the footage that I'm able to get and the responses that I'm able to get, maybe not after this interview, but you know, it's because people immediately look at me and I really do have Brown privilege, Tucker. I don't think white privilege is a thing. I think Brown privilege is a thing because I get away with a lot of stuff."

      "utterance": "So in Modern America, if you point out the biological sex is a physical reality, you can be fired from your job, \"The Washington Post\" will send a reporter to your house to intimidate you, but it doesn't change anything. Denying reality doesn't change reality. You can say gravity isn't real, but if you jump off the roof of your garage, you're still going to get hurt. And that's true for biological sex. It is in fact real whether the authorities admit it or not. Officials in New Jersey are learning that lesson this week. Two female inmates at a supposedly all women's prison in New Jersey have just become pregnant. We wondered how that happened. Well, it turns out those women had sexual encounters with another inmate who was a biological man passing as a woman. Now some people predicted that this would happen and they were laughed at, mocked, and attacked as bigots, Kara Dansky is at the very top of that list. She said this years ago on our show. She is the President of the U.S. Chapter of the Women's Declaration International, author of the book, \"The Abolition of Sex: How the Transgender Agenda Harms Women and Girls,\" and we are happy to have Kara Dansky back. Kara, thanks so much for coming on. I'll never forget the first time and it had been at least four years ago, when you said, if we keep going down this path, we're going to have biological men in women's prisons. And you right?"

    {
      "speaker": "KARA DANSKY, PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. CHAPTER OF THE WOMEN'S DECLARATION INTERNATIONAL",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. You know, though -- the story that is happening in New Jersey is obviously horrible for so many reasons. We need to not have men being housed in women's prisons. But a couple of takeaways from this that I just want to point out, are, first of all, the state is not getting away with this by telling its residents that they are housing men in women's prisons. What they are doing, of course, is telling the residents that they are housing, so called transgender women or trans-women in women's prisons, suggesting that there is some sort of subcategory of women that is called transgender women or trans-women and it's not true. The fact of this story shoots a hole right through the trope that trans- women are women. Our society has been taught that we are supposed to say and think that trans-women are women. But obviously, that is not true because the individuals that are the focus of the story impregnated women and every thinking adult, no matter what the President of the United States has to say on the matter knows that there is no category of women who can impregnate women. So I really want to thank you for highlighting this story, and I also just want to point out that this is not just a problem in New Jersey. This is a problem across the country. I know that we have talked previously about how the State of California recently enacted a law at the end of 2020, which went into effect in 2021, which mandates that men be housed in women's prisons on the basis of their so-called gender identity, if they say that they are women. Washington State has a similar policy. However, this is not just happening in blue states. This is happening across the country. As far as I know, 49 states plus the District of Columbia have some form of law or policy in place that mandates the housing of men in women's prisons."

It is a multitrillion dollar industry that is pushing this. It is paying the medical establishment, it is paying most media outlets, it is paying our government, it is paying our schools at all levels, elementary schools through college to push the idea that material -- the material reality of sex does not exist, and that what is more important than the material reality of sex is so-called gender identity. This is all being pushed by a multitrillion dollar industry in the guise of a Civil Rights Movement. It's all a lie."
