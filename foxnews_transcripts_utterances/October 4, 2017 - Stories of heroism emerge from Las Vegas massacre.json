But this is a presidency that's only nine months into its four years, possibly eight. And he -- I don't know if it's growing into it, but the remarks are always spot on. So there's two things I've noticed. One is that when he is one-on-one with people and it's not scripted, he's really good. He always has been. In some ways at his rallies, when he's not on a teleprompter, it's almost as if he's talking to each person individually and he likes the crowd. But what he did in Puerto Rico yesterday was to let the people know I came, so I took the time to come. I promise you that we're going to be here to help, and I touched a few people individually. So that means a lot. Then you go -- if you look at Monday when he did this speech with the diplomatic reception room immediately after the tragedy. That was beautiful presidential oratory. And then today, you have them at the University Medical Center, and he's always with the first lady Melania Trump by his side. And I could think of what it means to the people that are in the hospital recovering from these horrible wounds that the president took the time to come. He spent an hour longer than he was meant too when he was there. And then he's talking to the medical responders. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what this does for him as well that it gets him out of the oval office. It's one of the things I kept thinking in his first eight months before there was a changeover in leadership at the White House is why did they not get him out of Washington? Washington is not where he should be. He's not a creature of Washington. Of course, he has to sort of manage the White House. But once they've been getting him out into the country, was giving speeches in Indiana and Missouri on tax reform, traveling around to do other things. See people, he does a lot better and I think he represents all of us well because we can't go there to the hospital. But we can also pretty inspired by what he said today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

She has been listed as a person of interest and she does have her lawyer on hand in the interviews, but this is a voluntary thing. The FBI saying she's welcome to come and go as she pleases. The experts are telling us what the FBI is focusing on here is Stephen Paddock's mental state. What was he like in the weeks leading up to this shooting and before she left for the Philippines? His political affiliations, his religious beliefs, anything that can point them in the direction of the unknown motive, and maybe they want to find out more about what groups he has spoken with, individuals he might have spoken with in the weeks and months leading up to this crime. They also would be very interested to find out about her knowledge of this vast arsenal of weapons found inside the home in Mesquite, the home in Reno, which are both homes that she lived in with Stephen Paddock, and what knowledge she had about the explosives and the ammunition and all of that stuff. Her sisters as you've said think the reason she was sent away to the Philippines is because that she would have tried to stop him from conducting the shooting. The FBI may probe into that as well. We should tell you the FBI interview could go anywhere from five, six, seven, eight hours. It's unclear if she's going to come back to Las Vegas. She could be in Los Angeles for a few days. We want to show you these new pictures from the Daily Mail, these are new pictures of the guns that Stephen Paddock had inside the Mandalay Bay hotel room. These are some of the semiautomatic weapons there. This is an idea of some of the 23 weapons he had in there. We now know from the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms that at least 12 of those weapons were equipped with the bump stop, that's the mechanism that automatically turns the trigger close to an automatic weapon. It just keeps it perpetually engaged, firing between 400 and 800 bullets per minute. They will check out that as well. And we should note, Jesse, that we will be outside the FBI offices, so when Marilou Danley walks out we will be there to greet her if she is talking to the media. Jesse.",

Did she discuss about the weapons or the ammunition? It seems that the family is trying to lay the narrative that he must have sent her away because he knew that he was going to do this and therefore didn't want her to be dragged into it. But there's also the whole financial aspect and tentacles of it to say, OK, at what point was he sending the money? How much over, what period of time? Did he send more money to a number of different accounts, to other relatives? Where did she say the money got from? Where did he say that he was employed or that he told her? There's a lot of questions that they're going to have for him. They'll probably going to bring her back in for further questioning.

They can cry about it all they want to raise money, but they don't have the votes. A lot of these senators, you know, North Dakota or Missouri, Montana, Democratic senators. They're not going to vote to crack down on the Second Amendment. Remember, Hillary Clinton during the debates went after Bernie Sanders, socialist, for being too pro-gun. But he understands that, because he's from a rural state in Vermont. Now, the polling also doesn't help the Democrats on the issue. Forty-eight percent of American households own guns. Fifty percent of Americans say the government is doing too much to take away their Second Amendment rights. And I think the NRA has a better favorability rating then Congress right now. I agree with Greg. Bump stocks might have to be looked at. I'm also willing to look at background checks and mentally ill people having access to guns guns, too.

      "utterance": "Well, you want to necessarily get better at disaster recovery because that means that you're actually having to go to a lot of disasters. But this is a presidency that's only nine months into its four years, possibly eight. And he -- I don't know if it's growing into it, but the remarks are always spot on. So there's two things I've noticed. One is that when he is one-on-one with people and it's not scripted, he's really good. He always has been. In some ways at his rallies, when he's not on a teleprompter, it's almost as if he's talking to each person individually and he likes the crowd. But what he did in Puerto Rico yesterday was to let the people know I came, so I took the time to come. I promise you that we're going to be here to help, and I touched a few people individually. So that means a lot. Then you go -- if you look at Monday when he did this speech with the diplomatic reception room immediately after the tragedy. That was beautiful presidential oratory. And then today, you have them at the University Medical Center, and he's always with the first lady Melania Trump by his side. And I could think of what it means to the people that are in the hospital recovering from these horrible wounds that the president took the time to come. He spent an hour longer than he was meant too when he was there. And then he's talking to the medical responders. And what this does for him as well that it gets him out of the oval office. It's one of the things I kept thinking in his first eight months before there was a changeover in leadership at the White House is why did they not get him out of Washington? Washington is not where he should be. He's not a creature of Washington. Of course, he has to sort of manage the White House. But once they've been getting him out into the country, was giving speeches in Indiana and Missouri on tax reform, traveling around to do other things. See people, he does a lot better and I think he represents all of us well because we can't go there to the hospital. But we can also pretty inspired by what he said today."

You know, you really feel and I think it's important for the country to see that. I'm glad that he went there. And for anyone to question why he went there, they would criticize him if he didn't. Absolutely, the president belongs there. This was so tragic. And the fact that it was the largest mass shooting in American history, in and off itself it's so significant and it deserves the presence and the contemplation and reflection of the president."

They write silly cartoons. And it's a mess. Social media and TV has a way of holding a mirror up to this country, and that's good because it shows who the real haters are.

The CBS executive says she has no sympathy for any of these victims. Even CNN said the only way reason he rushed to Vegas was because he had a hotel there. It's really disgusting. And then the press can't bemoaned the polarization of the country, and then turn around at the same time and contribute to that same polarization. If you're going to blame Trump for Charlottesville, or mock Melania's heels for Harvey, or lie about the Puerto Rico recovery, or even say that every member of congress is complicit in the shooting death of 59 people, you can't do that. So the media spends -- I think what? Three, or four, or five years denigrating law enforcement. Some of those stories were fake news. But other of those stories, you know, there're some bad apples there and I have to admit that. But at the same time, now is an opportunity for the media to tell those heroic stories and sing the praises of law enforcement, and not just the police but the EMT's, the SWAT teams, because they've saved a lot of lives out there. And the media has so many resources and they can bring to bear towards the tragedy, especially the networks. And you see there's an appetite out there, especially after what we saw in Texas, to hear stories of personal bravery. And instead of spotlighting those great stories, that they're the real America. They're focused on the bitterness and divisiveness of the country and that's what you see. But that's not the real America."

We cannot confirm that she's been interviewed by FBI agents for that long, but she certainly is still inside the building. We should also note this is a voluntary interview for her. She has been listed as a person of interest and she does have her lawyer on hand in the interviews, but this is a voluntary thing. The FBI saying she's welcome to come and go as she pleases. The experts are telling us what the FBI is focusing on here is Stephen Paddock's mental state. What was he like in the weeks leading up to this shooting and before she left for the Philippines? His political affiliations, his religious beliefs, anything that can point them in the direction of the unknown motive, and maybe they want to find out more about what groups he has spoken with, individuals he might have spoken with in the weeks and months leading up to this crime. They also would be very interested to find out about her knowledge of this vast arsenal of weapons found inside the home in Mesquite, the home in Reno, which are both homes that she lived in with Stephen Paddock, and what knowledge she had about the explosives and the ammunition and all of that stuff. Her sisters as you've said think the reason she was sent away to the Philippines is because that she would have tried to stop him from conducting the shooting. The FBI may probe into that as well. We should tell you the FBI interview could go anywhere from five, six, seven, eight hours. It's unclear if she's going to come back to Las Vegas. She could be in Los Angeles for a few days. We want to show you these new pictures from the Daily Mail, these are new pictures of the guns that Stephen Paddock had inside the Mandalay Bay hotel room. These are some of the semiautomatic weapons there. This is an idea of some of the 23 weapons he had in there. We now know from the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms that at least 12 of those weapons were equipped with the bump stop, that's the mechanism that automatically turns the trigger close to an automatic weapon. It just keeps it perpetually engaged, firing between 400 and 800 bullets per minute. They will check out that as well. And we should note, Jesse, that we will be outside the FBI offices, so when Marilou Danley walks out we will be there to greet her if she is talking to the media. Jesse."

Well, I think what's going to be very important is to see whether she's making consistent statements with perhaps text messages that she has seen relatives, and try to see if she's actually being truthful with respect to her relationship with him, in terms of what she knew, when she was present, and if there was any kind of way that she had information, or helped him, or assisted him with anything put in here name or purchased under her name using her credit card. Anything like that. Because there were some information that a credit card perhaps was left in the room that identified back to her. They did say she came here on her own. But as you see the statements now from her relatives that we've been hearing some of the sound on tape of that in terms of, you know, what did she tell them about the relationship? Did she discuss about the weapons or the ammunition? It seems that the family is trying to lay the narrative that he must have sent her away because he knew that he was going to do this and therefore didn't want her to be dragged into it. But there's also the whole financial aspect and tentacles of it to say, OK, at what point was he sending the money? How much over, what period of time? Did he send more money to a number of different accounts, to other relatives? Where did she say the money got from? Where did he say that he was employed or that he told her? There's a lot of questions that they're going to have for him. They'll probably going to bring her back in for further questioning. The thing that was smart that she did was cooperating with the authorities and try to hurry up and get back here. WATTERS: Yeah, you're right."

And also with her, I kind of like don't buy it necessarily that she had no idea because the FBI has said they think he was planning this for two months.

There's a little bit -- it's not as clear cut. When you're talking about gun control, Greg, one thing that you always talk about is looking at facts versus emotion. So today in The Washington Post, there was a writer did an op-ed. She used to work for 538.

But if you use facts instead of feelings, you find that you may have to make the switch, because your feelings are going to evaporate and you're not going to have anything left. Emotional arguments wither. They're attractive, but data always beats emotions. I wish it was different. I wish there was data that said this is what caused this. So we can -- if it's the bump stocks, ban them. I'm for that. That's the only thing I can put my handle on that might be different. But look, The Washington Post article is very powerful, because that was a reporter who changed her mind because she was going, like, everything was a dead-end. She could see. The irony, too, is that some people are so distrustful of Trump that they only want the government to have guns. How does that make any sense, Kimmel?"

They can cry about it all they want to raise money, but they don't have the votes. A lot of these senators, you know, North Dakota or Missouri, Montana, Democratic senators. They're not going to vote to crack down on the Second Amendment. Remember, Hillary Clinton during the debates went after Bernie Sanders, socialist, for being too pro-gun. But he understands that, because he's from a rural state in Vermont. Now, the polling also doesn't help the Democrats on the issue. Forty-eight percent of American households own guns. Fifty percent of Americans say the government is doing too much to take away their Second Amendment rights. And I think the NRA has a better favorability rating then Congress right now. I agree with Greg. Bump stocks might have to be looked at. I'm also willing to look at background checks and mentally ill people having access to guns guns, too. But the issue with guns is similar to the issue with abortion, with Democrats. Any small infringement on abortion, they go crazy.

But when these individuals over and over again are outgunning law enforcement, we should be concerned as Americans. In Alexandria, they had more bullets than law enforcement. Here, he had more bullets and more surveillance than law enforcement. One of the security officers was shot. So sometimes Americans can say to ourself, \"OK, so you're outlawing the people that are supposed to protect us. Hmm. That's problematic.\" When you have 47 weapons between your three houses, you have high-capacity magazines, you have rifles that have the ability to penetrate police armor, these are all things that are problematic. I'm not saying we need to pass sweeping gun regulations to take everybody's guns. My father and brother are both gun owners. But what can we do to make sure you don't have 47 weapons?"

I don't see -- I don't understand how you people do business. I'm going to work on the fact that we've got, you know, Kim Jong-un and Iran and all these other issues on my plate.

Twenty-four nurses and healthcare professionals joining with electricians, equipment workers and engineers on a flight donated by United Airlines -- doing the right thing, United -- that left Newark today on its way to Puerto Rico to assist on -- on the outliers outside of San Juan in the countryside, to help Puerto Rico get back on track. The flight also includes 30,000 pounds of emergency relief supplies. So shout out to all those union workers doing good work for the people of Puerto Rico."
