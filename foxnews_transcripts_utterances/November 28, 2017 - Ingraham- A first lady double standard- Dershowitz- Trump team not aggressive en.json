I wish you well, but I don't think that we can forget the way that the conservative media did treat Michelle Obama. I think that's something that you are overlooking here. So, for example, Infowars called Michelle Obama a tranny, which is something that is so problematic, I can't even get into the different reasons why.

That's because she is married to Donald Trump. Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the elite ruling class and the existing order, which he ran on smashing that existing order and that's why he got elected.

He is working diligently every single day to try to solve those problems. And Vanity Fair and the left-wing media have nothing better to do than to that attack Melania Trump for her shoes and Christmas decorations. That is actually going to work in favor of President Trump's reelection. I would argue actually that kind of reaction by the mainstream media helped to get Donald Trump elected in the first place.",

Let's assume that Jared Kushner did that. He should be praised for it. There is nothing criminal about that. What is Mueller doing investigating whether or not somebody during the transition was trying to influence American foreign policy to the benefit of the American people? So I think the Trump administration ought to be more aggressive in challenging the scope of this investigation, challenging subpoenas, challenging who is called as witnesses. This is supposed to be a narrow investigation about whether or not there was illegal, unlawful collusion with Russia. Collusion itself is not a crime. But now what they are doing is going after people for what is the equivalent of jaywalking. Did they sign the right form? Did they include this in the form? That's all an attempt to try to squeeze them into testifying against the Oval Office.",

But since she is married to President Trump, it's a very different story. The first lady's shoes were wrong during hurricane relief. Remember, they mocked her accent in a recitation of the Lord's Prayer before a rally. Now according to some in the media, she can't even decorate the White House for Christmas properly.

      "utterance": "OK. That is great to go back and remember. It was her arms. Everything was great about Michelle Obama on the cover of Vogue. You would swear that Michelle walks on eggnog. But when Melania Trump unveiled this year's spectacular White House Christmas decorations, Vanity Fair went on the attack. This nasty columnist, I never heard of her name, Kenzie Brian, suggested that the first lady had finally made herself productive. This is what she said, \"Is it safe to assume that we have some clarity as to what she's been up to when she is not traversing the Great Wall of China or making an appearance at the turkey pardoning ceremony? Maybe?\" It's funny how little concern they had for what Michelle Obama was up when she was jetting all over the globe and hosting private parties at the White House with all of the Hollywood glitter. I mean, every other weekend, it was like celebration time in the White House or she was carting her children all over the place on the Harry Potter movie set, walking down Broadway every time she and Barack had date night. It was all great, all at the taxpayer expense. I could go on and on and on, but it's nearly Christmas. Back to Melania, the first lady made one of the most elegant entrances I have ever seen at a White House Christmas decoration preview. She descended the Truman staircase as ballet dancers performed in the great hall. That was even ridiculed. Vanity Fair this time actually put words in the first lady's mouth, writing, quote, \"Adequately done. She probably whispered to the principal dancer. I only counted four mistakes.\" Isn't that fun? Online some are comparing night time images of the Christmas decorations to a total nightmare, the white witch. It's all up there. The real nightmare is the double standard that has become so obvious, routine, and apparently so acceptable where conservative women are concerned. The only real acceptable real authentic woman in the media landscape today is a liberal woman, a progressive one. If you are not, you are just too dumb and stupid to know the difference. Remember what these two first ladies said."

Long ago these icons of the left and others sounded the dog whistle that it was OK to trash conservative women and their media lackeys followed orders. It's disgraceful that a White House garden planted and maintained by the park service was celebrated for years in the media as a Garden of Eden because it was dreamt up by Michelle Obama. But when a conservative first lady decorates the White House and spends time with D.C. school children, she is accused of exploiting them and savaged for her wardrobe. What happened to women being able to choose whatever they want to wear, whatever they want to wear it? They are pro chose to aborting babies, but you can't choose what you want to wear? It's a glaring double standard. It has to end. It's so obviously. Leave the first lady alone and enjoy the decorations. It's Christmas time, which may well be the most beautiful series of decorations I have ever seen at the White House and that's the ANGLE. Joining us now with reaction, conservative commentator, Monica Crowley, along with Julie Alvin, a liberal analyst. Julie, I want to start with you because I thought -- look, Michelle Obama had her own style and approach. That's great. She was the toast of the town for eight straight years. She is still the toast of the globe no matter where she goes. She is a celebrity former first lady and treated like royalty. OK. Why the treatment of Melania from her accent and ridiculing her child at one point and now the Christmas decorations? Why?"

That's not something that I think is of particular interest to the public. It's not something that I support. Melania, I think your decorations look lovely. I wish you well, but I don't think that we can forget the way that the conservative media did treat Michelle Obama. I think that's something that you are overlooking here. So, for example, Infowars called Michelle Obama a tranny, which is something that is so problematic, I can't even get into the different reasons why. Breitbart allowed virulently racist comments about Michelle Obama to surface on its website. Rush Limbaugh criticized Michelle Obama for her weight. This particular network had a contributor who also criticized Michelle Obama for her weight and referred to her as Barack Obama's baby mama. So, while I certainly don't agree with the hoopla over Melania's decorations, I think they look nice. I think she should be allowed to decorate the White House and not received criticism for it, we can't act as though the media was not critical of Michelle Obama."

Laura, look, we know that for a long time there has been a huge double standard that's operated against conservative and Republican women and in favor of liberal women and Democratic women. The attacks on Melania Trump all the way down to her Christmas decorations take us to a whole other level. That's because she is married to Donald Trump. Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the elite ruling class and the existing order, which he ran on smashing that existing order and that's why he got elected. Melania Trump is spectacular in every way and a dazzling representative of the United States particularly when she travels abroad. She did this beautiful display at the White House. So, look, what they need to understand the Trumps and everybody in the White House, everybody in this administration is that no good deed by them will ever go unpunished. Therefore, they need to absorb that and learn from it and ignore and go on doing what they are doing. This country has major issues, which this president and his team were brought in to try to solve from Iran, to North Korea, to taxes, to immigration to the wall. He is working diligently every single day to try to solve those problems. And Vanity Fair and the left-wing media have nothing better to do than to that attack Melania Trump for her shoes and Christmas decorations. That is actually going to work in favor of President Trump's reelection. I would argue actually that kind of reaction by the mainstream media helped to get Donald Trump elected in the first place."

ABC News, \"Flynn's lawyer meets members of special counsel's team, raising specter of plea deal.\" \"Vanity Fair,\" \"Has Mike Flynn already flipped on Trump?\" \"New York Times,\" \"A split from Trump indicates that Flynn is moving forward to cooperate with Mueller.\" Is that actually the case? Joining us now renowned legal expert, Harvard law prof emeritus Alan Dershowitz. Hi, Professor Dershowitz, how are you?"

      "utterance": "Is this really, it seems like the way it's being portrayed, it's the end for Donald Trump. The impeachment gallows are waiting for him. Mike Flynn because of his work with perhaps what he did with Turkey might somehow mean he is flipping on Trump. What could be going on here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "I think if he were actually flipping on Trump and if he had made a deal with Mueller, we would never know about that. Nobody would like that information. Part of the deal would be that you would have to keep this absolutely secret. I think the question nobody has been asking is who has leaked this, and why have they leaked this? I know his lawyer by reputation. And what his lawyer I think is doing is offering his client for sale or at least for rent. What he is saying is, he is up for grabs. If the Trump administration wants him, they can have him. Just give him the pardon. And if the Trump administration doesn't give him a pardon, we are available to make a deal with the special counsel. But I don't think the special counsel is ready to make a deal yet because it's not clear that Flynn has anything to offer. First of all, his credibility is worthless. He has already been accused of perjury. Second, he is a witness that has been bought or at least rented. Any descent defense attorney could shred him by saying he'd sell you his mother. He is trying to save his son, he's trying to save himself. He will say anything. He will not only sing, he'll compose and create evidence if he has to do that in order to get a deal. So I don't think we are anywhere close to where the media has portrayed Flynn and a deal with Mueller."

      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "I think the administration is not aggressive enough with Mueller. They should be in court challenging what Mueller has been doing. He is going so far beyond any possible scope of his investigation. For example, there were reports that they were investigating whether Jared Kushner tried to get the United States to change its policy toward Israel, the Obama administration, which was allow the resolution condemning Israel for occupying the Western Wall, the holiest place in Judaism. Let's assume that Jared Kushner did that. He should be praised for it. There is nothing criminal about that. What is Mueller doing investigating whether or not somebody during the transition was trying to influence American foreign policy to the benefit of the American people? So I think the Trump administration ought to be more aggressive in challenging the scope of this investigation, challenging subpoenas, challenging who is called as witnesses. This is supposed to be a narrow investigation about whether or not there was illegal, unlawful collusion with Russia. Collusion itself is not a crime. But now what they are doing is going after people for what is the equivalent of jaywalking. Did they sign the right form? Did they include this in the form? That's all an attempt to try to squeeze them into testifying against the Oval Office."

But it's so obvious that Mueller is going well beyond the scope of what his authority is. I read the letter authorizing his investigation. And what he has done and some of the witnesses he pulled and some of what he has subpoenaed, he is no subpoenaing things that are so far beyond the scope of the investigation."

Was he ever trading information? I have to tell you, if I were Trump's lawyer I wouldn't give Flynn one bit of information because you know there is always the possibility that he will flip. So I think this story has a lot yet to be revealed."

And even into the 20th century, Phil Sheridan who had been general of the Union Army coined the phrase, went out to go after Indians in the west, and he good the phrase the only good Indian is a dead Indian.

A minister in Chicago just opened a 3,000 seat mega-church in the middle of the city, and he wants his church to be a sanctuary and a safe haven from allures of crime and violence. But can faith and this church succeed where the government has failed? A lot of liberals will doubt that. But joining us now from Chicago is Pastor Horace Smith. Pastor, thanks for joining us. I was thinking about this today when I was reading about you. There are a lot of churches in Chicago. And you have Father Pfleger with St. Sabina's, I'm not a big fan of his, but he has his church. You've got Reverend Wright. Is he still kicking around? You've got a lot of churches, a lot of people trying. They have been unable to stem the violence. So how is yours going to be different?"

There are a lot of churches in Chicago, there are quarter of million churches in America. But the question is to the church itself, are we really doing what we should be doing to make a difference? And that's the key. We cannot turn things around by ourselves. But where we're located and what we're doing can be meaningful and impactful if we really represent what we preach about and then put our money where our mouth is. I think you will see a difference. So every church has to look at its own self and say, what are we doing? Are we really doing the work we are called to do by Christ or are we doing something that's more of a social impact thing that just won't work?"

It's fun, and it's fun to have people on stage and dancing and electric guitars and all of that. That's great, praise the lord. But the mentoring, what you need with especially these young boys, many of them are fatherless and have no role models. We just talked about this in the hip hop segment we did earlier."

But once they are attracted you must have real programmatic things that really hit at the heart of the matter. And it begins with our own example, the leaders of the church, the generations. When we just opened this church. It's kind of a new church, we've been here 102 years, but its theme was crossing over with multiple generations. What we're saying is that there is a responsibility of each generation to the other. In many ways I think my generation, the one that preaches to me, in some ways we have really failed these young people. So we have almost blamed the victims.
