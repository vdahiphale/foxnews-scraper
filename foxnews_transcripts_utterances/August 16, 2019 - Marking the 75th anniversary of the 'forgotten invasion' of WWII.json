So, President Trump, like Harry Truman and Andrew Johnson before him, apparently has his eye on possibly purchasing the country of Greenland. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Good Evening, everybody.

As I said, Harry Truman offered 100 million in gold to purchase Greenland back in 1946. And in 1867, Andrew Johnson had his state department check into the idea as well. President Trump says he is always looking at things with a developer's eye.

He's sort of feeling out what they think about it, brought it up several times, sort of with various levels of seriousness according to the report.

Real estate has paid off well for the United States. The Louisiana Purchase, the annexation of Texas, California, obviously Alaska. And another point that sector of state Pompeo pointed out is that if the diarist warnings about global warming do come true, then, you could be looking at new trading routes that are being opened up through the Arctic.

Obviously, we tried to buy it in 1946 for $100 million the price might be going up. But I don't think it's totally off of the table. And from a geostrategic point of view, I think it's totally worth bringing up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } To the question of whether or not Donald Trump is merely distracting, it is true that Donald Trump is the king of controlling the media narrative. But he has this knack of bringing up actually serious concepts. And because he is the one who's bringing it up, people dismiss it out of hand, I think it's a brilliant idea, and I think we should look forward to it. If Denmark says it's not for sale, that seems to me like the beginning of a real negotiation. Perhaps, we will actually see the art of the deal.",

But so far, all the medical examiner is saying is that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that the cause was hanging. Further, The Daily Beast is reporting that the marks on Epstein's neck looked like those from fabric which squares with the information that Epstein died or tied a bedsheet around his neck and then secured it to the top bunk which is about five-and-a-half feet off the ground. There are reports that Epstein was found kneeling forward as if he lunged forward similar to the way that Robin Williams killed himself a few years ago in Tiburon, California. We don't know if Williams broke his hyoid bone near his Adam's apple but several medical examiners say lunging forward is as a rule not enough force to break the hyoid. And they add that just because Epstein was found on his knees doesn't necessarily mean he did not throw himself off the top bump bunk or roll himself off. Needless to say, this report has not satisfied critics who call this the perfect suicidal storm. Remember, he's placed on suicide watch, then surprisingly removed from the watch six days later. He's in a cell with no cameras but it's supposed to be checked on every 30 minutes. Yet on the night of his death, the guards reportedly fall asleep and leave Epstein alone for three hours, and then try to falsify records to cover it up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Finally, the injuries to Epstein's neck appear to be more severe than what normally happens in a suicide. As you said, the DOJ and congressional investigations may uncover more evidence but experts say they are unlikely to contradict the medical examiner. And breaking right now from the New York Times they say three of Epstein's lawyers are planning to challenge the autopsy report going forward. Martha?",

Number two, the first to pull out, my understanding, will be the advisors. The advisors with the Afghan army is our long-term strategy. We have been advising the Korean -- South Korean army, for example, for 70 years. And we -- I'd rather use their soldiers than our soldiers. And then the final piece that a lot of people aren't talking about right next door to Afghanistan is Pakistan with seven times the population and the potential of loose nukes. And if Afghanistan devolves into chaos Pakistan will go with it. So, I guess my message is, Mr. President please, look, do not be to Afghanistan, please, what President Obama was to Iraq.

There are even reports that his own folks are concerned about that at this point. But my next guest argues the opposite. She says that despite what have you heard this week the economic sky is not falling. She also said this today. \"Let us not let left wing media talk us into a recession. Make no mistake they are eager to do so,\" she writes. Here now Liz Peek, former partner of Wall Street firm Wertheim and Company, now a Fox News contributor. Liz, great to have you on The Story. Thank you so much for being here tonight. You know, we talked about this a bit last night on the show. And there were some critics, you know, saying that it's not true, that, you know, people out there are not giddy about the possibility that this could be kind of a ding in the armor for President Trump as he heads into 2020, what do you say about that?",

You don't hear about productivity increasing for the first time in a decade or wages rising at over 4, 4.5 percent. Those things are very encouraging. But look, let's connect the dots here. President Trump was elected and immediately consumer and business sentiments went through the roof. Heights we had not seen in a decade. What does that mean? It means consumers start to spend and businesses start to invest. The liberal media knows very well if they can shake consumer confidence. Make people begin to doubt this recovery has legs, people will begin to retrench. And the good news is we just had really excellent consumer spending numbers, and frankly, I was very cheered by Walmart. Walmart had the best comp store sales in 10 years. So, whatever they are saying out there on the media, people just aren't buying it. Instead they are going to the stores and buying what they want.",

I mean, some of the confidence that the president encouraged via tax cuts and deregulation, we've seen a reversal of that because they really don't know what's going to happen in China. I really hope for a trade truce because I think that kind of puts those issues behind us. And by the way, businesses are scurrying around repositioning their supply chains to avoid problems there. But that clearly has hurt the economy. Another area though I think of interest is the whole home building sector which is not doing very well. But that's something that I think will start to come back. Maybe in the second half. But probably next year. Mortgage rates are incredibly low and we need housing. The problem right now is that house prices are high and inventory is low.

But also, some of these recent shootings and talked about the men who swept in as heroes. And it sort of juxtaposes that whole idea with the toxic masculinity argument and sort of beating up on men in a number of ways in recent history too. She writes \"This is a noble side of masculinity that we once would perpetuate in folklore and stories passed down from father to son about what it means to be a real man. But in the new era of toxic masculinity young men are taught to ignore their heroic instincts and learned to be weak. They are instructed to always be on guard against the monster within.\" Lisa?",

And strategically located between North America and Europe in the Arctic Ocean. Has about 58,000 residents and it currently relies on Denmark for two- thirds of their budget revenue. Not a new concept though. As I said, Harry Truman offered 100 million in gold to purchase Greenland back in 1946. And in 1867, Andrew Johnson had his state department check into the idea as well.

He's sort of feeling out what they think about it, brought it up several times, sort of with various levels of seriousness according to the report. And it has asked White House staffers, look into the idea. See what it would -- see what it's all about. So, the story quickly took off and tweets like this showing a gold Trump Towers sprouting up on the Greenland coastline, getting attention today. So, here now to talk about it, Michael Knowles of the Daily Wire, host of the Michael Knowles Show. And Robin Biro, former campaign director for President Obama. Good to have both of you with us. Thank you for being here tonight. So, Robin, it's been approached before, strategically. It's an interesting area for the United States.

There were -- here we saw a lot of tweets from him yesterday about the economy, reassuring us with that inverted yield curve, that everything is going smooth. And, you know, that we had that leaked executive order proposing to censor the Internet, I don't think that's going anywhere. But I think this is a fantastic distraction, because look, it's our lead story tonight. We're talking about something that probably won't happen.

      "utterance": "It's quite serious actually. I mean, that's the thing about land is that God isn't making any more of it, so it's usually a good investment. Real estate has paid off well for the United States. The Louisiana Purchase, the annexation of Texas, California, obviously Alaska. And another point that sector of state Pompeo pointed out is that if the diarist warnings about global warming do come true, then, you could be looking at new trading routes that are being opened up through the Arctic. And this could be in his words, the Suez or the Panama Canal of the 21st century. So, I do think it's a serious thing to mention. Obviously, we tried to buy it in 1946 for $100 million the price might be going up. But I don't think it's totally off of the table. And from a geostrategic point of view, I think it's totally worth bringing up. To the question of whether or not Donald Trump is merely distracting, it is true that Donald Trump is the king of controlling the media narrative. But he has this knack of bringing up actually serious concepts. And because he is the one who's bringing it up, people dismiss it out of hand, I think it's a brilliant idea, and I think we should look forward to it. If Denmark says it's not for sale, that seems to me like the beginning of a real negotiation. Perhaps, we will actually see the art of the deal."

And that was sort of shutdown by the United States. So, there are definitely, Russia, China, the United States are all expressing some interest in this part of the world. And I think whenever that's happening, you have to sort of look at it, at least, with an analytic serious eye in terms of the strategic implications of it. And it looks, you know if it's true that Denmark is having some financial difficulties with their commitment to Greenland, that also is an open question as well. But I also think that they are interested in -- I think this is good for Greenland, Robin. Because it's -- you know, today, and yesterday, everybody is Googling Greenland. And looking at it and looking at pictures of Greenland. And it -- and it strikes me that everybody's been going to Iceland, right? I mean, Iceland is like the tourist capital of the world."

He says, Israel was very respectful and nice to Representative Rashida Tlaib allowing her permission to visit her grandmother as soon. As she was granted permission, she grandstands it and loudly proclaimed that she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup, he writes. Israel acted appropriately. Guy?"

They were not interested in meeting with any members of the Netanyahu government or the opposition. They were going to be feted and sponsored by a very radical organization that was bringing them. And of course, we know their background with BDS which is fundamentally anti-Semitic. So the Israelis said nope, you're not welcome here. Tlaib then tried to make it about her grandmother. She's getting very old. I may never have a chance to see her again. Israel said, that's fine. Keep your BDS stuff at home. Come see your grandmother, permission granted. And she said, oh wait, never mind. Let me dump on Israel for a new reason. It's very cynical. I think it's very transparent.

They can you know, take on people who disagree with them. It's a mistake to target members of Congress because of their views or their viewpoints. I think it was a mistake in initially for the president to even tweet that they should not be allowed to go to Israel. I have faith in Israel's ability to listen to two members of the United States Congress. So I think it's been a huge mistake.

They didn't reach out to meet with any members of the Israeli government or even the opposition in Israel. You know, it seems to me like they could have struck some kind of deal and said you know, we see your itinerary.

They could have projected more confidence and openness. After all the new information that we have, I actually still think it's a strategic mistake but maybe for a different reason. They're the gang that can't shoot straight Omar and Tlaib. She has completely embarrassed herself with this grandmother episode. Imagine how much damage she would do to her own cause on Israeli soil with the bright lights on her. They might welcome them in and say do your very best.

And now the work of the FBI, the DOJ's inspector general, and the Bureau of Prisons will be going forward to try to crack this case. Chief Breaking News Correspondent Trace Gallagher joins us tonight with the very latest in this case. Hi, Trace!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha! Normally when we get autopsies, they have diagrams, descriptions, and definitions so non-medical people can decipher the findings and at some point, we may get that. But so far, all the medical examiner is saying is that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that the cause was hanging. Further, The Daily Beast is reporting that the marks on Epstein's neck looked like those from fabric which squares with the information that Epstein died or tied a bedsheet around his neck and then secured it to the top bunk which is about five-and-a-half feet off the ground. There are reports that Epstein was found kneeling forward as if he lunged forward similar to the way that Robin Williams killed himself a few years ago in Tiburon, California. We don't know if Williams broke his hyoid bone near his Adam's apple but several medical examiners say lunging forward is as a rule not enough force to break the hyoid. And they add that just because Epstein was found on his knees doesn't necessarily mean he did not throw himself off the top bump bunk or roll himself off. Needless to say, this report has not satisfied critics who call this the perfect suicidal storm. Remember, he's placed on suicide watch, then surprisingly removed from the watch six days later. He's in a cell with no cameras but it's supposed to be checked on every 30 minutes. Yet on the night of his death, the guards reportedly fall asleep and leave Epstein alone for three hours, and then try to falsify records to cover it up. Finally, the injuries to Epstein's neck appear to be more severe than what normally happens in a suicide. As you said, the DOJ and congressional investigations may uncover more evidence but experts say they are unlikely to contradict the medical examiner. And breaking right now from the New York Times they say three of Epstein's lawyers are planning to challenge the autopsy report going forward. Martha?"

Central to those discussions is a possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region in exchange for a promise from the Taliban that Afghanistan will never again become a safe haven for terrorists. The president's close confidant in the Senate Lindsey Graham warning this. Mr. President, learn from President Obama's mistakes, he writes. A bad agreement puts the radical Islamist movement all over the world on steroids. Be smart, take your time, and listen to your national security team, says Senator Graham.

And we all want peace. In fact, today is the 10th anniversary of Sergeant Brian Woods -- one of my Green Berets that I lost in Afghanistan. Here are my concerns and Senator Graham and others like Liz Cheney in the House. Number one, half the world's terrorist organizations still exist there and can attack the United States. And if you believe the Taliban's promises which I don't, but if you believe them, how do they have the capability to keep a lid on these groups that the American army has struggled with in a 300,000 men Afghan army. Number two, the first to pull out, my understanding, will be the advisors. The advisors with the Afghan army is our long-term strategy. We have been advising the Korean -- South Korean army, for example, for 70 years. And we -- I'd rather use their soldiers than our soldiers. And then the final piece that a lot of people aren't talking about right next door to Afghanistan is Pakistan with seven times the population and the potential of loose nukes. And if Afghanistan devolves into chaos Pakistan will go with it. So, I guess my message is, Mr. President please, look, do not be to Afghanistan, please, what President Obama was to Iraq. A no deal is better than a bad deal. Let's fight these wars in places like Kabul."

You don't hear about productivity increasing for the first time in a decade or wages rising at over 4, 4.5 percent. Those things are very encouraging. But look, let's connect the dots here. President Trump was elected and immediately consumer and business sentiments went through the roof. Heights we had not seen in a decade. What does that mean? It means consumers start to spend and businesses start to invest. The liberal media knows very well if they can shake consumer confidence. Make people begin to doubt this recovery has legs, people will begin to retrench. And the good news is we just had really excellent consumer spending numbers, and frankly, I was very cheered by Walmart. Walmart had the best comp store sales in 10 years. So, whatever they are saying out there on the media, people just aren't buying it. Instead they are going to the stores and buying what they want."

I mean, some of the confidence that the president encouraged via tax cuts and deregulation, we've seen a reversal of that because they really don't know what's going to happen in China. I really hope for a trade truce because I think that kind of puts those issues behind us. And by the way, businesses are scurrying around repositioning their supply chains to avoid problems there. But that clearly has hurt the economy. Another area though I think of interest is the whole home building sector which is not doing very well. But that's something that I think will start to come back. Maybe in the second half. But probably next year. Mortgage rates are incredibly low and we need housing. The problem right now is that house prices are high and inventory is low. So, I have think if you begin to see that very large sector of the economy participating, you know, we might -- you might see a pretty surprising number next year on GDP."

And it looked at all of the instances that we have watched with horror over the last months, years, essentially. But also, some of these recent shootings and talked about the men who swept in as heroes. And it sort of juxtaposes that whole idea with the toxic masculinity argument and sort of beating up on men in a number of ways in recent history too. She writes \"This is a noble side of masculinity that we once would perpetuate in folklore and stories passed down from father to son about what it means to be a real man. But in the new era of toxic masculinity young men are taught to ignore their heroic instincts and learned to be weak. They are instructed to always be on guard against the monster within.\" Lisa?"

So, I'm not sure -- I don't understand why there is this concept somehow that men aren't noble, that men aren't good and somehow women are more noble and you know, are better people, it just doesn't hold water. So, I don't understand that. But I do appreciate the fact that we should be raising up good men and also talking about them.

      "utterance": "So, this week marks the 75th anniversary of Operation Dragoon often called the forgotten invasion of World War II. The mission was intended to coincide with D-Day but it got delayed due to lack of resources. About two months later, 350,000 French and American troops landed on the French Riviera, ultimately joining forces with Operation Overlord and helping to liberate most of Southern France in only four weeks. My guest was part of that mission, flying into Nazi occupied land in a daring daylight jump in August of 1944. And he has an incredible story about making it out alive. World War II paratrooper Roland Barhyte joins me now. He also served in the Battle of the Bulge as a member of the 551st parachute infantry battalion. Roland, thank you for being here with me tonight. Tell me a little bit about that mission and what it was like when you landed in the middle of the day there."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARHYTE",
      "utterance": "Because I was wondering if I could deal with jumping out of an airplane. But I had been afraid of heights before that. But it's different jumping out of an airplane. When you are standing on something solid that is attached to the surface that you are headed for, it's different. Up in the air there is just space. It seems. And you go out and it's kind of great."

Get on this truck and it will take you back to a battalion aid station. And there were several of us who were in the same condition. I was one of the volunteers that got on the truck. We went back to the battalion aid station. And the medical officer for the battalion got on the truck and he went down one side and up the other, asking what's your problem? And we were all talking about frozen feet. He said it was like walking on bowling balls."
