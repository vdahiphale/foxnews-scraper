Congressman Kevin McCarthy and Jim Banks will be here in moments with their exclusive reaction to Pelosi's January 6 hatchet job. Plus, Candace Owens, Mollie Hemingway, and Raymond Arroyo. But first, Nancy, the insurrectionist. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, while Nancy Pelosi licks designer ice-cream in Pacific Heights, she still fights like a gutter rat from Baltimore. She uses her speaker's gavel like a hammer against any dissent. And Republicans who don't bow down are pounded as heartless Nazis. When she calls for bipartisanship, what Nancy really is saying is I need more GOP peers who hate Trump. It's not an exaggeration at all to say that loathing Trump is the glue that holds her caucus together.",

True to form she stacked it with vicious Trump hating Democrats like Adam Schiff and Trump-hating Republican, Liz Cheney. Now, Pelosi gave House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy his own chance to propose committee members, which he did. But because Pelosi wants total control over the proceedings, she vetoed the two most effective Republican members, people who know how to get to the truth, Congressman Jim Jordan and Jim banks. I say it's all a badge of honor. Oh, Kevin McCarthy made the smart move today to pull every Republican member off the committee denying Pelosi the sheen of bipartisanship for what's obviously a purely political exercise.",

Chapter one, Trump incited the insurrection. Chapter two, Trump supporters on social media helped drive the violence. Chapter three, the Capitol Police infiltrated by Trump's supporters missed obvious signs. Chapter four, must flag potential threats online before they even act on those threats. Number five, must spend billions to beef up security and limit public access to the Capitol if at all possible. Now, for some time, it's been obvious to most fair minded Americans that Democrats need January 6 and 2022 as much as they needed the pandemic in 2020. They're not problems to be solved. They're crises to exploit. Don't you remember all the promises, vote for Joe and he'll end COVID and restore calm. He'll unite the country. Of course, anti-Americanism in schools and racial politics are killing his unity pledge. Their fearmongering about the Delta variant and their dumb defund the police stuff is spurring a crime wave. Whoops, no calm there. Instead of bringing the country together, Democrats are choosing to rip it wide open. With this death grip they have on January 6 and their obsession with rooting out domestic extremism, they're proving themselves to be wholly unworthy of governing. They are not advancing the interests of America, they're dragging us down and weakening us on the world stage, which Biden talked about tonight. Now for its part, the Biden administration is doing a lot to already harass and intimidate Americans who supported Donald Trump and who just happened to be at the Capitol that day. PAUL HUEPER, TARGETED BY FBI OVER JAN 6 ATTENDANCE: I get up, come around the corner, and I hear somebody barking hands up, FBI. Come around the corner I've got six or seven guns pointed right at me.

Now, while America is experiencing a surge of devastating violence nationwide, our DOJ is devoting millions and millions of dollars and hundreds of agents to keeping that story of January 6 alive. Now, as THE ANGLE has repeatedly said, we've reiterated, criminal activity should be punished, whatever the politics of the people carrying it out. But the Democrats rather blase attitude toward last summer's BLM rights expose their true motivations. Now, let's not forget what was done by the bail fund backed by Kamala Harris. The difference, of course, is that January 6 happened to be a huge gift to the Democrats. So they intend to milk it for every last ounce of political benefit they can get. And their implicit message throughout all of this is Republicans who supported Trump are terrorists. Democrats who oppose Trump are patriots. Well, so far in their dragnet, they've arrested 535 people, issued 900 search warrants, have 15,000 hours of surveillance and body-worn camera footage, confiscated 1600 electronic devices, and issued 80,000 reports. Now they've issued sophisticated (inaudible) facial recognition technology and poured over thousands of exhibits.

But now they want to lock us into the January 6 narrative for as long as possible, like nothing else is happening in the world. During the campaign, THE ANGLE repeatedly warned that if Democrats won the election, they'd become more, not less radicalized. And that is precisely what we're seeing happening. They know that they're probably going to lose the house in 2022, so right now they're trying to force through every item on Bernie Sanders' wishlist with the help of a few GOP collaborators. They hope the ghost of January 6 will save them though. It won't. No reasonable person thinks that what happened on January 6 was, as Biden said, the worst attack in the Capitol since the Civil War. Come on, guys. Buffalo head guy was poised to take over the U.S. government, are you kidding me? We've had many protests, many riots in American history, we had many last year that were far worse than this. There was never any change that the government - chance that the government would be overthrown, that democracy was going to be stopped by these people. But the Democrats don't care about the facts. They lied about how Police died there. They covered up who shot Ashley Babbitt, and they're still refusing to release thousands of hours of video from inside and outside the Capitol. Now, we don't know why, perhaps because some of it may frustrate their preferred narrative. We don't know. Democrats' credibility though, is shot, for many reasons. Their four-year witch hunt against the Trump presidency, as they showcase their own slime balls like Eric Swalwell, please. Their ongoing efforts to undermine U.S. border security by allowing a million migrants into the country during a pandemic, but they're supposed to be all for law and order. In their grand conspiracy claims, my personal favorite was this alleged Republican plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer. More on that in a moment. Tonight, Biden's team set Biden out to do his Uncle Joe act on CNN where he bragged about how his determination to reach out to both sides and get back to normal. But that rhetoric has no connection to the reality on the ground in Washington. Here on the nation's Capitol, the Democratic Party has no interest in bipartisanship. They're following Nancy Pelosi and her efforts to poison the well, to accuse Republicans of fascism, and otherwise drive their opponents from public life. By standing up to Pelosi and her efforts to pack the January 6 commission, House Republicans with the usual exception of Liz Cheney, struck a blow for common sense and show that commission for the kangaroo court. It undoubtedly will be. Republicans have to keep showing that Democrats have a radical agenda to change this country forever. And we have to mobilize for new elections that will shut down that agenda once and for all. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy; and Indiana Congressman Jim Banks, who was slated to be the GOP Chair of the January 6 committee until earlier today. Congressman Banks, you actually held a call I understand with your Democrat counterpart last night. But tonight you're out.",

And the FBI was nowhere to be found in this operation. They weren't infiltrating leftist groups like Antifa that were organizing these things across the country. They did nothing to stop it. They - everyone stood down. If anybody tried to do anything about it, they were treated horribly by the powers that be. And then when this happens on January 6, it turns out we have all sorts of tools to go after people and destroy their lives and keep them in confinement before their trial, and then do these very high sentences after the fact and dramatic - make dramatic claims about it. It's not that people don't want people held accountable for any riot, it's that we can see how if you're on the left, you can get away with pretty much anything. Anything.

Now, in it they included recommendations on how schools should spend billions of dollars from that American rescue plan that we didn't need. Now, among the plans promoted, well, the abolitionist teaching networks guide for racial justice and abolitionist's social and emotional learning. Now, it advocates for teachers to \"disrupt whiteness\", and other forms of oppression. Now when they got caught the DOE released a statement that the citation was included in error, but who the heck believes that. Here now is Candace Owens, founder of Blexit, host of the Candace Owens Show. Candace, your reaction to this? I think - I thought I had seen it all, Candace, but I hadn't. CANDACE OWENS, \"THE CANDACE OWENS SHOW\" HOST: Absolutely, have not seen it all. And there will be more to come, I can promise you that, Laura. Listen, the Biden administration got caught red handed and I want to be very clear about what their intentions are, because we all know that Joseph Biden does not care about race. His record when he was a senator tells us everything that we need to know about him and his opinion about black people. And his true opinion of black Americans is that we are the dumbest part of the population. He believes that black Americans are the easy pawns. His administration believes that they keep stroking racial tensions, they can turn Black Americans into permanent soldiers for their policies. And what they're really trying to do is replace hard academics. I'm talking about engineering, mathematics, all that stuff is now a form of white supremacy. They don't want kids to get the right answer, they want them to focus on, you said it, Laura, emotional learning, right? Because emotional learning is not rational learning. People that learn emotionally don't tend to go off and become successful individuals, rather, who that learn emotionally turned to become angry, radical Antifa, throwing BLM burning individuals. And those people are very easily targeted by the government. That is what Biden regime wants. They really want people to do whatever they say, to be angry pawns for their government schemes.",

It's a ridiculous policy that people are doing to really capitulate with the Black Lives Matter radical movement that went after all of these businesses. I think that will stop. But I don't think this watering down of the education system is going to stop. Actually I think we're just seeing the beginning of it. And it's unfortunate. People need to realize that right now in American society, and this is a fact, I read it in a Thomas Sowell book, we've never handed out more degrees ever in American society, and yet we've never produce kids that are this dumb. And I mean this by statistic. I'm talking about by standardized test scores, these kids are not becoming smarter, and yet they are getting more and more degrees, and that's by design. They want these kids to be convinced of their own rationality, be convinced that they are so smart, and then be shocked when they can't make any money, because he actually can't make that money as a gender studies or an LGBT studies major for four years. That's just not what society needs. I need somebody to fix my A.C., not to come over and tell me that there are 26,000 genders and you can be nonbinary.

Target has cut back to its hours at five stores. Why? Because management does not want to accost shoplifters for fear that they will be accused of racial profiling, and it knows that even if it does try to apprehend these shoplifters, the system will not respond because the criminal justice system does not want to be accused of racial disparate impact.

But a civilization that doesn't have the will to enforce basic norms of decency and respect is not going to remain civilized for long. It's going to descend into a state of anarchy. And let me just add this, Laura, because the left keeps telling us these are crimes of poverty and need. None of this is a crime of poverty. These are crimes of greed and entitlement. All of these thieves, all of these gangbangers, all of these drive-by shooters, have smartphones that they use to flash their gang signals on. And they are also crimes of violence.

Congressman Kevin McCarthy and Jim Banks will be here in moments with their exclusive reaction to Pelosi's January 6 hatchet job. Plus, Candace Owens, Mollie Hemingway, and Raymond Arroyo. But first, Nancy, the insurrectionist. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, while Nancy Pelosi licks designer ice-cream in Pacific Heights, she still fights like a gutter rat from Baltimore. She uses her speaker's gavel like a hammer against any dissent. And Republicans who don't bow down are pounded as heartless Nazis. When she calls for bipartisanship, what Nancy really is saying is I need more GOP peers who hate Trump.

True to form she stacked it with vicious Trump hating Democrats like Adam Schiff and Trump-hating Republican, Liz Cheney. Now, Pelosi gave House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy his own chance to propose committee members, which he did. But because Pelosi wants total control over the proceedings, she vetoed the two most effective Republican members, people who know how to get to the truth, Congressman Jim Jordan and Jim banks.

Chapter three, the Capitol Police infiltrated by Trump's supporters missed obvious signs. Chapter four, must flag potential threats online before they even act on those threats. Number five, must spend billions to beef up security and limit public access to the Capitol if at all possible. Now, for some time, it's been obvious to most fair minded Americans that Democrats need January 6 and 2022 as much as they needed the pandemic in 2020. They're not problems to be solved. They're crises to exploit. Don't you remember all the promises, vote for Joe and he'll end COVID and restore calm. He'll unite the country. Of course, anti-Americanism in schools and racial politics are killing his unity pledge. Their fearmongering about the Delta variant and their dumb defund the police stuff is spurring a crime wave. Whoops, no calm there. Instead of bringing the country together, Democrats are choosing to rip it wide open. With this death grip they have on January 6 and their obsession with rooting out domestic extremism, they're proving themselves to be wholly unworthy of governing. They are not advancing the interests of America, they're dragging us down and weakening us on the world stage, which Biden talked about tonight. Now for its part, the Biden administration is doing a lot to already harass and intimidate Americans who supported Donald Trump and who just happened to be at the Capitol that day. PAUL HUEPER, TARGETED BY FBI OVER JAN 6 ATTENDANCE: I get up, come around the corner, and I hear somebody barking hands up, FBI. Come around the corner I've got six or seven guns pointed right at me.

Now, as THE ANGLE has repeatedly said, we've reiterated, criminal activity should be punished, whatever the politics of the people carrying it out. But the Democrats rather blase attitude toward last summer's BLM rights expose their true motivations. Now, let's not forget what was done by the bail fund backed by Kamala Harris. The difference, of course, is that January 6 happened to be a huge gift to the Democrats. So they intend to milk it for every last ounce of political benefit they can get. And their implicit message throughout all of this is Republicans who supported Trump are terrorists. Democrats who oppose Trump are patriots. Well, so far in their dragnet, they've arrested 535 people, issued 900 search warrants, have 15,000 hours of surveillance and body-worn camera footage, confiscated 1600 electronic devices, and issued 80,000 reports.

But now they want to lock us into the January 6 narrative for as long as possible, like nothing else is happening in the world. During the campaign, THE ANGLE repeatedly warned that if Democrats won the election, they'd become more, not less radicalized. And that is precisely what we're seeing happening. They know that they're probably going to lose the house in 2022, so right now they're trying to force through every item on Bernie Sanders' wishlist with the help of a few GOP collaborators. They hope the ghost of January 6 will save them though. It won't. No reasonable person thinks that what happened on January 6 was, as Biden said, the worst attack in the Capitol since the Civil War. Come on, guys. Buffalo head guy was poised to take over the U.S. government, are you kidding me? We've had many protests, many riots in American history, we had many last year that were far worse than this. There was never any change that the government - chance that the government would be overthrown, that democracy was going to be stopped by these people. But the Democrats don't care about the facts. They lied about how Police died there. They covered up who shot Ashley Babbitt, and they're still refusing to release thousands of hours of video from inside and outside the Capitol. Now, we don't know why, perhaps because some of it may frustrate their preferred narrative. We don't know. Democrats' credibility though, is shot, for many reasons. Their four-year witch hunt against the Trump presidency, as they showcase their own slime balls like Eric Swalwell, please. Their ongoing efforts to undermine U.S. border security by allowing a million migrants into the country during a pandemic, but they're supposed to be all for law and order. In their grand conspiracy claims, my personal favorite was this alleged Republican plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer. More on that in a moment. Tonight, Biden's team set Biden out to do his Uncle Joe act on CNN where he bragged about how his determination to reach out to both sides and get back to normal. But that rhetoric has no connection to the reality on the ground in Washington. Here on the nation's Capitol, the Democratic Party has no interest in bipartisanship. They're following Nancy Pelosi and her efforts to poison the well, to accuse Republicans of fascism, and otherwise drive their opponents from public life. By standing up to Pelosi and her efforts to pack the January 6 commission, House Republicans with the usual exception of Liz Cheney, struck a blow for common sense and show that commission for the kangaroo court. It undoubtedly will be. Republicans have to keep showing that Democrats have a radical agenda to change this country forever. And we have to mobilize for new elections that will shut down that agenda once and for all. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy; and Indiana Congressman Jim Banks, who was slated to be the GOP Chair of the January 6 committee until earlier today. Congressman Banks, you actually held a call I understand with your Democrat counterpart last night. But tonight you're out."

I met with the head of the Capitol Police Union today, Laura, and I talked to him about his views on January 6. He said they weren't prepared for that day by their leadership, they weren't equipped and given the right equipment to take care of what would happen on that day, they weren't trained for what happened that day. I called on Bennie Thompson, the chairman of this committee to bring the head of the Capitol Police Union to the hearing next Tuesday and hear from him, someone who represents the ranking file Capitol Police officers.

Was their decision made by the speaker not to have the National Guard at the Capitol that day? When they found the IEDs earlier in the day, why didn't they bring the FBI in and others? Why were the riot gear stuck in a bus, locked in a bus away from the Capitol Police officers who needed them? They put them in harm's way. And why is this speaker so afraid of the tough questions?

Instead, they had a hand in nearly every aspect of the alleged plot, starting with its inception.\" But it gets even worse. The FBI at the center of the plot was just accused of jumping on his wife in bed and smashing her head against a nightstand after a dispute stemming from a swingers' party that occurred. Oh, my gosh, just happened on Monday. It was just reported today. Here now Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at the Federalist, Fox News contributor. Mollie, given the FBI's track record of politicizing investigations we saw with Donald Trump, and now with this, and this place in this case being looks like a sham setup.

It's not good. You should never agree to do anything bad even if you're being so led by a rogue, or by an FBI agent. But that's a big difference than actually detecting threats and disrupting them, and we have had so many instances in recent years where the FBI was told about people who ended up shooting up a school, or causing another mass murder where they didn't do anything. And meanwhile, they're the bulk of these plots that are ludicrous that are announced just before an election in a very fraught year.

What is so difficult for people to understand right now is that all of America endured a summer of unspeakable violence, where the White House was besieged, where federal courthouses were under attack, where Police precincts were taken over, where people's houses and businesses were burned to the ground, dozens of people were killed. And the FBI was nowhere to be found in this operation. They weren't infiltrating leftist groups like Antifa that were organizing these things across the country. They did nothing to stop it. They - everyone stood down. If anybody tried to do anything about it, they were treated horribly by the powers that be. And then when this happens on January 6, it turns out we have all sorts of tools to go after people and destroy their lives and keep them in confinement before their trial, and then do these very high sentences after the fact and dramatic - make dramatic claims about it. It's not that people don't want people held accountable for any riot, it's that we can see how if you're on the left, you can get away with pretty much anything. Anything. And if you're on the right, you can have this situation that, like the previous leader was just talking about, Nancy Pelosi was responsible for security there. She didn't provide the security.

Now, among the plans promoted, well, the abolitionist teaching networks guide for racial justice and abolitionist's social and emotional learning. Now, it advocates for teachers to \"disrupt whiteness\", and other forms of oppression. Now when they got caught the DOE released a statement that the citation was included in error, but who the heck believes that. Here now is Candace Owens, founder of Blexit, host of the Candace Owens Show. Candace, your reaction to this? I think - I thought I had seen it all, Candace, but I hadn't. CANDACE OWENS, \"THE CANDACE OWENS SHOW\" HOST: Absolutely, have not seen it all. And there will be more to come, I can promise you that, Laura. Listen, the Biden administration got caught red handed and I want to be very clear about what their intentions are, because we all know that Joseph Biden does not care about race. His record when he was a senator tells us everything that we need to know about him and his opinion about black people. And his true opinion of black Americans is that we are the dumbest part of the population. He believes that black Americans are the easy pawns. His administration believes that they keep stroking racial tensions, they can turn Black Americans into permanent soldiers for their policies. And what they're really trying to do is replace hard academics. I'm talking about engineering, mathematics, all that stuff is now a form of white supremacy. They don't want kids to get the right answer, they want them to focus on, you said it, Laura, emotional learning, right? Because emotional learning is not rational learning. People that learn emotionally don't tend to go off and become successful individuals, rather, who that learn emotionally turned to become angry, radical Antifa, throwing BLM burning individuals.

But I don't think this watering down of the education system is going to stop. Actually I think we're just seeing the beginning of it. And it's unfortunate. People need to realize that right now in American society, and this is a fact, I read it in a Thomas Sowell book, we've never handed out more degrees ever in American society, and yet we've never produce kids that are this dumb. And I mean this by statistic. I'm talking about by standardized test scores, these kids are not becoming smarter, and yet they are getting more and more degrees, and that's by design. They want these kids to be convinced of their own rationality, be convinced that they are so smart, and then be shocked when they can't make any money, because he actually can't make that money as a gender studies or an LGBT studies major for four years.

When she was a grad student, she was a member of the environmental group Earth First. That's linked to an ecoterrorism case back in 1989. The Biden administration has named domestic terrorism as a great threat facing the nation. So you'd think that maybe would put Stone-Manning's nomination and deputy. Well, not quite."

All right, Senator, Stone-Manning lied about this incident and her confirmation hearing, and still the so-called moderates, Manchin, Sinema, Kelly, it looks like they are going to vote yes."

      "utterance": "She is unfit to oversee the public lands of the United States. She was involved as a ringleader in this eco-terrorism, this tree-spiking, 500 pounds of spikes into trees in a national forest. And you say, what do these spikes look like. Here is one of them right now. This is what these spikes look like. They are big, long, can do significant damage, and especially if one of these is struck by a logger or a firefighter, or even a sawmill, where a blade, a saw, a blade would strike this, that could break, kill the person. People have been terribly injured with this sort of thing. So here she is, she covered it up for four years until she was caught. And then she caught a plea deal and testified against others who went to prison. But spikes like this are still in trees in the national forest. People are still at risk. And since she testified, folks have come forward to say she lied under oath to the United States Senate. She is not trustworthy."

Tonight at his town hall and on CNN, he talked about his old friendship with Strom Thurmond and invoked Arlen Specter, and so forth. He is a real bipartisan guy, Senator Barrasso. Do you think in what you've seen, this nomination been one of the examples, that this is a real bipartisan administration that really wants to work with you all? Is that what you think?"

      "speaker": "BARRASSO",
      "utterance": "No, not at all. If we're going to vote on this in committee tomorrow, every Republican is voting no. Every Republican sent President Biden a letter to say withdraw her nomination. Democrats are going to have to decide by themselves. You mentioned Mark Kelly from Arizona, Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada, another senator from a state with lots of public lands. Everyone is going to be held accountable for their vote. And Tracy Stone-Manning continues to try to cover up what she's done. But the people that have come forward, one is the special agent, federal investigator, who did this case, who has received death threats as a result of it, and he has come forward to say, she lied. The other person that came forward to say she lied was one of the criminals who went to jail. So we have both the cop and the criminal saying she lied."

This is not who we are. Everybody talks about now this virus, this -- Not a joke, not a joke. Now, you may not like me, and that's you're right. Let me finish the question -- the answer."

It was almost as if he took all of the old lines and campaign slogans that he had rehearsed over 48 years, shook them in a bag, and just dumped them on Don Lemon and this audience. By the way, there were protests at this Mount St. Joseph University, a Catholic university, where Joe Biden appeared. Not everybody was happy about him being there."

You have to admit, it's better than the Donald Trump animatronic, which bears a striking resemblance to Hillary Clinton after shock treatments. Or perhaps that's Hillary upon seeing the 2016 election results."

They may want to spend more time coordinating their game rather than planning their public protest. People don't watch the Olympics for stage protests. They watch for the sport. And this team, you can see, they were not happy. Megan Rapinoe looked like someone had stolen her purple hair dye. She was not happy today."

A 2014 referendum called Prop 47 lowered criminal sentences on crimes such as shoplifting, and with police forces either depleted or just beaten down by anti-cop rhetoric, the cases have exploded. Many of the same people who probably supported this at the time, they're finally speaking out."

HEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR, \"THE WAR ON COPS\": Here is the perfect symbol of where California is right now, Laura. Walgreens in San Francisco has closed 17 stores. Target has cut back to its hours at five stores. Why? Because management does not want to accost shoplifters for fear that they will be accused of racial profiling, and it knows that even if it does try to apprehend these shoplifters, the system will not respond because the criminal justice system does not want to be accused of racial disparate impact. So you have the good guys, those who are providing vital services, those who are providing jobs, rolling over, playing dead, and ceding territory to the bad guys. But a civilization that doesn't have the will to enforce basic norms of decency and respect is not going to remain civilized for long. It's going to descend into a state of anarchy. And let me just add this, Laura, because the left keeps telling us these are crimes of poverty and need. None of this is a crime of poverty. These are crimes of greed and entitlement. All of these thieves, all of these gangbangers, all of these drive-by shooters, have smartphones that they use to flash their gang signals on. And they are also crimes of violence. Last week, an employee at Rite Aid in Los Angeles was killed trying to apprehend two shoplifters. So this is going completely out of control."

And there was a debate between a bunch of people, and one woman said, well, what's your problem, to this guy. It was an outrage. And she said, this is our moment of reparations. Is that fueling some of this as well?"

There is no question that this is viewed as retaliation for the ongoing white supremacy. That white supremacy idea, Laura, is completely falls. There's not a single mainstream institution in this country that is not bending itself into knots trying to hire and promote as many minorities as possible. Nevertheless, white supremacy, fighting it is the theme of the Biden administration. Things are going to get worse before they get better unless people stand up and defend the basic decency of this country and defend the rule of law."
