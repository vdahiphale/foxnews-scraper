Things are breaking very fast on three big major stories we're covering tonight. We have new developments in the Uranium One scandal, the phony Russia propaganda dossier story that Hillary Clinton and the DNC, of course, they paid for all of this garbage. And conservatives tonight a huge win, the IRS now admitting that groups were in fact targeted by the Obama administration, Tea Party groups. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, tonight these massive scandals can no longer be ignored. Tonight, we will demand answers from all of the people directly involved and that means it's time for Hillary Clinton and, yes, President Obama to come clean about colluding with the Russians and explain why in anybody's vast thinking they could ever give Vladimir Putin 20 percent of America's uranium supply. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, Hillary Clinton her top campaign officials, high ranking DNC executives all conveniently playing dumb when it comes to the phony salacious dossier, we'll cover that in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right. Before we get into all of the new information -- and there's a ton of it tonight -- I want to remind you that for over a year, Democrats, members of the biased abusively biased press, all breathlessly talking about Russia Trump collusion, hysteria breaking out almost every night. They were acting like the worst scandal in American history. Meanwhile, there were so many prominent Democrats and former Obama officials, in spite of all it they were saying there is smoke, but there is no fire.

They knew in 2009, that was one year before Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration approved this corrupt Uranium One deal. And what we've learned this week is that the FBI, the Department of Justice, all knew in 2009 that this was happening inside our country and they did nothing to stop it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So the same Democrats, the same media outlets that was screaming bloody murder for a year, lying to you every day for a year about Donald Trump, are giving next to zero coverage to this story. Now, keep in mind, we have an FBI informant in this case who infiltrated this Putin network right here in America. He has evidence. He has emails. He has personal recordings. He has documents. He has insider knowledge of all this, that America's national security was in fact compromised at the highest level. Our country was sold out, right in front of our faces. They let it happen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, of course, you have the explosive new details about the phony, fake, salacious news dossier. Now, we now know that the Clinton campaign, the DNC, paid over $9 million to help fund these lies, this propaganda hit piece that the Russian government sources gave them. Now, make no mistake. This was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election. And we have the proof. Also, we have to point something out: since everyone is so worried about Russian collusion, isn't it interesting that at no point did any Democrats, my overpaid liberal media friends or Robert Mueller or members of his team, none of them -- they want to get to the truth? None of them asked the one man on this earth that knows the truth. That would know the truth. And I'm talking about the WikiLeaks founder, that's Julian Assange. He is the person, the one individual that posted the information about the DNC emails. No one ever took the time to do what we did and talk to Julian Assange. I've talked to him now on air five times. Now, because they knew what his answer would be and they didn't like it. He was telling us again and again, it was never Russia, it was never a state, that it was never a state party. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, all these scandals and the ensuing cover-ups add to what I am telling you now is the biggest betrayal of you, the American people that I can think of in my lifetime. The American people have now been regularly lied to. You have been misinformed. You have been propagandized by a political party and abusively biased liberal media that have literally no interest in helping the people in this country or telling you the truth. To them, everything obviously is about politics and about advancing their rigid, radical left-wing ideology. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, with all that said, here is all the new information we have tonight. On the fake news dossier, Hillary Clinton has been completely silent. So far Clinton has yet to say anything publicly about financing a document that used current and former Russian government sources to create the most obscene, salacious, completely fabricated accusations about Donald Trump. Now, since Hillary Clinton is refusing to talk about her role in the dossier, we decided to reach out to Clinton's spokesperson for comment. Big surprise, they referred us to other people, including the law firm that the Clinton campaign used to fund Fusion GPS. In a statement we did get from them it said in part, quote, \"Hillary for America and the DNC complied with all campaign finance laws.\" Well, that's informative. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Hillary's silence on this is beyond telling. Now, sources have told the New York Times that Hillary Clinton only learned about the dossier when BuzzFeed published it back in January. Really? Hillary has such a great track record of telling the truth. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the current DNC chairman, he is running as far away as he can and claiming he knew nothing about it. And disgraced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she is saying she had no idea what was going on. And according to a report, Clinton's Campaign chairman John Podesta told Congress that he wasn't aware of any of these payments, nobody knows nothing. How is it possible then that over $9 million went out the door and people in charge had no idea that that money was being spent? But meanwhile, so many Democrats regurgitated the lies, just like the media. Now Speaker of the House Paul Ryan announced today that the FBI will cooperate with the House document request about this dossier. This is a huge development and we're going to be following that closely. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight, Fox News has learned that congressional hearings with the FBI informant who is the key witness in this Russian bribery scheme will also be with the chairman and ranking members of the committees only. And Fox News is also told that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley, he rightly is pushing for public hearings with the FBI informant. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we have to remember that in each of these scandals, laws were broken. Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has put together a list for us. Take a look at the side of the screen. These are all the laws that were potentially broken by the Clinton campaign and the DNC in the fake news dossier scandal. And there is the Uranium One scandal. Oh, Gregg Jarrett back at work. You have federal statutes involving crimes like bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, racketeering, beyond serious stuff. This is go-to-jail type of things. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we also forgot about the Clinton email server scandal. By the way, they are now up on the side of your screen. Two House committees finally this week are looking into how the FBI and the Department of Justice during the Obama administration handled these issues and for good reason. James Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook, despite the overwhelming amount of evidence of wrongdoing. So with all this new information, the big question tonight is who knew what and when? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } With Uranium One, the FBI had mountains of evidence of Russian bribery. Did President Obama know about this? Was it in President Obama's daily presidential briefings? Apparently, that might have been told to the lawyer of the FBI informant. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what did Hillary Clinton know? And when did she know? Did she know that her husband Bill Clinton was being paid double his speaking fees for a speech in Moscow? Did she know that Bill asked for permission while in Moscow to meet with Russian nuclear officials? Did she know that eventually Bill met with Putin during the trip and advocated -- this is important -- he also advocated that in fact the Uranium One deal be done and also was paid by a bank that had a financial interest in Uranium One. So how could both of them, Obama and Clinton, ever think ever, it's a good idea to give 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin? Now, by the way, that's the foundational material for nuclear weapons. We need to hear from key Obama administration officials. For example like Eric Holder, what did he know and when did he know it? He was in charge of the DOJ. They're in charge of the FBI. Did he know about the evidence of Putin's network right here inside the United States, all the crimes being committed in 2009 before this Uranium One deal was approved in 2010? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now remember, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, they were part of the committee that signed off on this deal personally. Eric Holder did. Hillary did. And there is Robert Mueller. He was the FBI director back in 2009. How inconceivable is it that he didn't know that Russian operatives were in our country, trying to break into the uranium market on behalf of Vladimir? Now, how can he possibly oversee any investigation into any Russian collusion? Next, we've got Rod Rosenstein. He was in charge of the investigation into this Russian bribery plot. Does he not have a conflict of interest? Then we have to ask James Comey, what did he know and why didn't he act. And there are also questions about the phony dossier. How was it possible these same people didn't think it was necessary to tell you the American people, tell Congress that the Clinton camp and the DNC paid for it? You know what? We are working hard day and night. You deserve answers to every one of these questions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But one other important thing that we have to tell you about tonight before we bring in our guest, we now have proof that intelligence wasn't the only powerful government entity that was weaponized by the Obama administration. Now you may remember, I talked about five forces against the President. One of them is the deep state. They weaponized the power of intelligence to use against this president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Just a few hours ago, the Department of Justice announced they reached a settlement with multiple Tea Party groups that were targeted, specifically by the Obama IRS because of their political ideology. Now, the settlement includes payouts to several Tea Party groups and an official apology from the IRS which now admits that their actions during the Obama years was, quote, \"wrong.\" Do you think so? Using the IRS targeting people that you don't like or agree with? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now remember, much of this IRS weaponization occurred under the oversight of Lois Lerner while many of these Tea Party groups were in the critical initial stages of forming a resistance to the policies of Obama. That stopped them dead in their traps. And many of the Tea Party groups were prevented from organizing and instead were spending all of their time, all of their resources, all their money to combat what was persecution from a politically inspired IRS. OK. The apology and settlement, great, but a day late and a dollar short, and Obama got a free ride in 2012 as a result. So ultimately, the Democrats got everything they wanted. The Tea Party became distracted, ultimately fractured. And President Obama was reelected for a second term in 2012. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have a lot more. We have so much new information tonight.

      "utterance": "All right. Tucker, thank you, and you're not going to want to miss a minute of the show. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News alert. Things are breaking very fast on three big major stories we're covering tonight. We have new developments in the Uranium One scandal, the phony Russia propaganda dossier story that Hillary Clinton and the DNC, of course, they paid for all of this garbage. And conservatives tonight a huge win, the IRS now admitting that groups were in fact targeted by the Obama administration, Tea Party groups. Now, tonight these massive scandals can no longer be ignored. Tonight, we will demand answers from all of the people directly involved and that means it's time for Hillary Clinton and, yes, President Obama to come clean about colluding with the Russians and explain why in anybody's vast thinking they could ever give Vladimir Putin 20 percent of America's uranium supply. Also, Hillary Clinton her top campaign officials, high ranking DNC executives all conveniently playing dumb when it comes to the phony salacious dossier, we'll cover that in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. All right. Before we get into all of the new information -- and there's a ton of it tonight -- I want to remind you that for over a year, Democrats, members of the biased abusively biased press, all breathlessly talking about Russia Trump collusion, hysteria breaking out almost every night. They were acting like the worst scandal in American history. Meanwhile, there were so many prominent Democrats and former Obama officials, in spite of all it they were saying there is smoke, but there is no fire. For a year, no evidence, but there's thousands of hours of television coverage. We knew by listening to people, it was never true. Watch this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"FACE THE NATION\"/CBS, MAY 7: Have you seen anything that suggests any collusion between the Russians and Trump campaign?"

People that might have said they were involved, to what extent they were involved, to what extent the president might have known about these people or whatever, there is nothing there from that standpoint that we have seen directly linking our president to any of that. WOLF BLITZER, CNN, MAY 18: The last time we spoke, Senator, I asked you if you had actually seen evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. And you said to me, and I'm quoting you now, you said, \"Not at this time.\" Has anything changed since we spoke last?"

      "speaker": "SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIF.",

    {
      "speaker": "REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.",

And despite the destroy Trump media and their desperate attempt with no evidence, they did not stop breathlessly, hysterically, reporting these lies, the so-called Trump-Russia collusion. Watch them. CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC, MARCH 21: We have a president's campaign and their criminal investigation for dealing with a foreign adversary. Historian Douglas Brinkley says, \"There's a smell of treason in the air.\" UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, MSNBC, MARCH 28: You tell the Washington post last week that, quote, \"There is a smell of treason in the air\" when it comes to this investigation."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now tonight, one of the most important things sadly we conclude is that the media and the Democrats in this country and their attacks were purely, purely political. They never wanted the truth. Now, we even have real evidence that the FBI uncovered a Russian plot that involved -- we have real evidence -- bribery, extortion, blackmail, money laundering, racketeering. They knew in 2009, that was one year before Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration approved this corrupt Uranium One deal. And what we've learned this week is that the FBI, the Department of Justice, all knew in 2009 that this was happening inside our country and they did nothing to stop it. So the same Democrats, the same media outlets that was screaming bloody murder for a year, lying to you every day for a year about Donald Trump, are giving next to zero coverage to this story. Now, keep in mind, we have an FBI informant in this case who infiltrated this Putin network right here in America. He has evidence. He has emails. He has personal recordings. He has documents. He has insider knowledge of all this, that America's national security was in fact compromised at the highest level. Our country was sold out, right in front of our faces. They let it happen. And then, of course, you have the explosive new details about the phony, fake, salacious news dossier. Now, we now know that the Clinton campaign, the DNC, paid over $9 million to help fund these lies, this propaganda hit piece that the Russian government sources gave them. Now, make no mistake. This was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election. And we have the proof."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Also, we have to point something out",
      "utterance": "since everyone is so worried about Russian collusion, isn't it interesting that at no point did any Democrats, my overpaid liberal media friends or Robert Mueller or members of his team, none of them -- they want to get to the truth? None of them asked the one man on this earth that knows the truth. That would know the truth. And I'm talking about the WikiLeaks founder, that's Julian Assange. He is the person, the one individual that posted the information about the DNC emails. No one ever took the time to do what we did and talk to Julian Assange. I've talked to him now on air five times. Now, because they knew what his answer would be and they didn't like it. He was telling us again and again, it was never Russia, it was never a state, that it was never a state party. Now, all these scandals and the ensuing cover-ups add to what I am telling you now is the biggest betrayal of you, the American people that I can think of in my lifetime. The American people have now been regularly lied to. You have been misinformed. You have been propagandized by a political party and abusively biased liberal media that have literally no interest in helping the people in this country or telling you the truth. To them, everything obviously is about politics and about advancing their rigid, radical left-wing ideology. Now, with all that said, here is all the new information we have tonight. On the fake news dossier, Hillary Clinton has been completely silent. So far Clinton has yet to say anything publicly about financing a document that used current and former Russian government sources to create the most obscene, salacious, completely fabricated accusations about Donald Trump. Now, since Hillary Clinton is refusing to talk about her role in the dossier, we decided to reach out to Clinton's spokesperson for comment. Big surprise, they referred us to other people, including the law firm that the Clinton campaign used to fund Fusion GPS. In a statement we did get from them it said in part, quote, \"Hillary for America and the DNC complied with all campaign finance laws.\" Well, that's informative. Now, Hillary's silence on this is beyond telling. Now, sources have told the New York Times that Hillary Clinton only learned about the dossier when BuzzFeed published it back in January. Really? Hillary has such a great track record of telling the truth. Now, the current DNC chairman, he is running as far away as he can and claiming he knew nothing about it. And disgraced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she is saying she had no idea what was going on. And according to a report, Clinton's Campaign chairman John Podesta told Congress that he wasn't aware of any of these payments, nobody knows nothing. How is it possible then that over $9 million went out the door and people in charge had no idea that that money was being spent? But meanwhile, so many Democrats regurgitated the lies, just like the media. Now Speaker of the House Paul Ryan announced today that the FBI will cooperate with the House document request about this dossier. This is a huge development and we're going to be following that closely. Also tonight, Fox News has learned that congressional hearings with the FBI informant who is the key witness in this Russian bribery scheme will also be with the chairman and ranking members of the committees only. And Fox News is also told that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley, he rightly is pushing for public hearings with the FBI informant. Now, we have to remember that in each of these scandals, laws were broken. Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has put together a list for us. Take a look at the side of the screen. These are all the laws that were potentially broken by the Clinton campaign and the DNC in the fake news dossier scandal. And there is the Uranium One scandal. Oh, Gregg Jarrett back at work. You have federal statutes involving crimes like bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, racketeering, beyond serious stuff. This is go-to-jail type of things. Now, we also forgot about the Clinton email server scandal. By the way, they are now up on the side of your screen. Two House committees finally this week are looking into how the FBI and the Department of Justice during the Obama administration handled these issues and for good reason. James Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook, despite the overwhelming amount of evidence of wrongdoing. So with all this new information, the big question tonight is who knew what and when? With Uranium One, the FBI had mountains of evidence of Russian bribery. Did President Obama know about this? Was it in President Obama's daily presidential briefings? Apparently, that might have been told to the lawyer of the FBI informant. And what did Hillary Clinton know? And when did she know? Did she know that her husband Bill Clinton was being paid double his speaking fees for a speech in Moscow? Did she know that Bill asked for permission while in Moscow to meet with Russian nuclear officials? Did she know that eventually Bill met with Putin during the trip and advocated -- this is important -- he also advocated that in fact the Uranium One deal be done and also was paid by a bank that had a financial interest in Uranium One. So how could both of them, Obama and Clinton, ever think ever, it's a good idea to give 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin? Now, by the way, that's the foundational material for nuclear weapons. We need to hear from key Obama administration officials. For example like Eric Holder, what did he know and when did he know it? He was in charge of the DOJ. They're in charge of the FBI. Did he know about the evidence of Putin's network right here inside the United States, all the crimes being committed in 2009 before this Uranium One deal was approved in 2010? Now remember, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, they were part of the committee that signed off on this deal personally. Eric Holder did. Hillary did. And there is Robert Mueller. He was the FBI director back in 2009. How inconceivable is it that he didn't know that Russian operatives were in our country, trying to break into the uranium market on behalf of Vladimir? Now, how can he possibly oversee any investigation into any Russian collusion? Next, we've got Rod Rosenstein. He was in charge of the investigation into this Russian bribery plot. Does he not have a conflict of interest? Then we have to ask James Comey, what did he know and why didn't he act. And there are also questions about the phony dossier. How was it possible these same people didn't think it was necessary to tell you the American people, tell Congress that the Clinton camp and the DNC paid for it? You know what? We are working hard day and night. You deserve answers to every one of these questions. But one other important thing that we have to tell you about tonight before we bring in our guest, we now have proof that intelligence wasn't the only powerful government entity that was weaponized by the Obama administration. Now you may remember, I talked about five forces against the President. One of them is the deep state. They weaponized the power of intelligence to use against this president. Just a few hours ago, the Department of Justice announced they reached a settlement with multiple Tea Party groups that were targeted, specifically by the Obama IRS because of their political ideology. Now, the settlement includes payouts to several Tea Party groups and an official apology from the IRS which now admits that their actions during the Obama years was, quote, \"wrong.\" Do you think so? Using the IRS targeting people that you don't like or agree with? Now remember, much of this IRS weaponization occurred under the oversight of Lois Lerner while many of these Tea Party groups were in the critical initial stages of forming a resistance to the policies of Obama. That stopped them dead in their traps. And many of the Tea Party groups were prevented from organizing and instead were spending all of their time, all of their resources, all their money to combat what was persecution from a politically inspired IRS. OK. The apology and settlement, great, but a day late and a dollar short, and Obama got a free ride in 2012 as a result. So ultimately, the Democrats got everything they wanted. The Tea Party became distracted, ultimately fractured. And President Obama was reelected for a second term in 2012. We have a lot more. We have so much new information tonight. Joining us now from the American Center for Law and Justice and, of course, one of the president's counsels Jay Sekulow and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. I got so much for both of you. You, Jay, need the first pick of victory lap."

      "utterance": "Because the ACLJ, your group where you're the chief counsel, you led this case in the IRS. They did weaponize the IRS. They did turn them against anybody that was conservative, Tea Party oriented. A big win, but Obama kind of also got what he wanted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Yeah, well, I mean look, it took three and a half years of litigation to get there. Our team did a fantastic job of litigating this. And the end result is not only an acknowledgment of the wrongdoing, but also a complete change of policies. There will be an order signed by the court in the week or 10 days. That's going to include declaratory relief, meaning that the policies will go forward and they will not be able to do what they did, which is violate the first amendment. And whether you're right, left or center, the idea that the government would target somebody because of the name of the organization or the political position they were espousing violates the fundamental aspects of freedom of speech, freedom of association and we've now got an agreement with that. So it's a very good day for our clients, but, Sean, it was three and a half years. A lot of those groups as you know were not able to continue to activate. And by the way, it wasn't just Tea Party groups. There were groups where -- just because of the name that they had in their organization that were targeted for this, and really beyond the pale, but the end result was a good settlement."

His own words, but ask this question, why was the FBI considering paying for it at some point in this process? So that question has to be asked. And I go back to this whole concept, which is something we've been talking about for a long time and that is, if this dossier was a political creature which we now know it is, no question about it. They call it opposition research. But if Christopher Steele was utilizing Russian assets to get this information and then of course it's been as James Comey said, unverified and they went to court to get FISA warrants, you're raising a whole host of civil liberty issues and who knows what they did and what they said to that court."

Before we get everyone's reaction, we did reach out to the American lobbying firm, APCO Worldwide, mentioned in Sara's report ing. This was last Thursday.

And we kept to that, and their in kind work for the Clinton Global Initiative. I also stated their position that their work was unrelated to the acquisition of Uranium One, which is what they claimed by their parent company and their client. I just laid out the facts.

That's a typical legal maneuver that you do -- I shouldn't call it a maneuver, it's a typical legal request that you make when you alert somebody that they may be an adversarial party, you see you keep all of the evidence because if you destroy it, it's obstruction."

Four very important lucrative decisions for the Russian nuclear industry. The first we know about is Uranium One, it has been written about a lot. The second one was the establishment of a commercial agreement. It was a U.S.-Russia Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. It really opened the door to a lot more business and a lot more dialogue between the United States and Russia. The third was approval of a deal involving the United States enrichment Corp, opening the door for them to do direct business with Rosatom, the big nuclear company. All these things are going on. On the face they may seem fine to people unless you know the company involved in it is engaged in this wrongdoing. That's the part that is such great concern to congress.

But previous to 2009, that the FBI had gathered enough evidence to show that it was happening either before 2009, this was a long, well thought methodical plan by Vladimir Putin to penetrate the U.S. market.

I'll say it's very interesting to see what this witness is going to tell us about bribery, because it's worth recalling that Uranium One, this company started in 2005, and it started when the Clintons helped this Canadian billionaire acquire uranium assets in Kazakhstan. Bill Clinton went over there. He sweet talked the dictator, Nazarbavev. What was Hillary Clinton's role? Well, we've actually have testimonies in a form of a deposition from the guy running the cause uranium program at the time and he says that the Kazak prime minister went to the U.S. senate, wanted to meet with Hillary Clinton who's on the senate arm services committee, and she refused to meet with him until the uranium concession was granted. So we already have this case of pressure and then after he got this uranium concession, he gave $30 million to the Clinton Foundation."

We know that as soon as Giustra out this uranium concession, he said his first donation ever $30 million to the Clinton Foundation, and it sort of took off from there.

The president probably had it, Obama and his presidential daily briefings. I cannot believe the degree of lying, hypocrisy and, frankly, they put this country in danger."

      "utterance": "When you think about it, Sean, going back to the '90s, I had like a flashback of all the dirty politicking and the dirty campaigning, and the use of private investigators the Clintons utilized back in the '90s. Remember the name Terry Linzer? He was the guy who was like going through people's garbage. This is what."

      "utterance": "This is what they do. This is what they've always done. And now they've taken it to an international intrigue degree involving the former Soviet Union. And when you have a Kremlin written dossier that is compiled by the Christopher Steele, fellow, and he puts it altogether. But all the dirty lurid fake details are provided by Russia. The idea that the highest level of the Clinton campaign, and perhaps, even Hillary herself didn't know about its provenance? Didn't know where it came from? That's just doesn't pass the straight face test. I mean, I guess we have to hear from Mrs. Clinton. I want a real interview with her. Not an interview with a favorable journalist. But she should come on and talk to a serious journalist about what she knew."

I want to get your take on Uranium One. Under any circumstances would any smart person ever give Vladimir 20 percent of our uranium? And then you look at, they knew he had Russian operatives in the country, and that was their goal to corner the market, and they had an informant inside telling them about everything they're doing, bribery, kickbacks, extortion, all of those. How could this possibly happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "All of that that you just said, Sean, and then add the fact that we have this committee on foreign investments. The CFIUS board, which includes pretty much the entire cabinet of the Obama administration. Obviously, Hillary sits on it, and the department of justice, secretary of state, they all sit on this committee. Now, you could pull -- ten people right across the street at Union Station, the train station in Washington, who don't know anything about politics, but if you ask them, OK, we could approve or disapprove of Russia getting 20 percent of our uranium that could be used for nuclear weapons, nuclear power, do you think that's a good idea? I bet, 10 out of 10, maybe 9, if you consider a drunk guy on the street."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "But what you have here is they knew Vladimir Putin had infiltrated the country, had spies in the country, was doing illegal activities in the country, and top of them never being smart enough not to do it ever, but they all approved it anyway. And then the money comes back. I don't understand -- at least understand liberal logic. There's nothing here that makes any sense except that they sold out the country, a massive appeasement mentality, and that they're corrupt."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, it's corrupt to the core, perhaps other financial interests that we don't know about. I think there's a lot that we just don't know. I think there're a lot of pieces to this puzzle, Sean, that we still don't know. We did not have a justice department that really wanted to be transparent in the way they handled this case, a case that has many different aspects to it. They didn't want an informant to testify to congress. There was no real congressional oversight in this deal. Again, on its face it's ludicrous that we ever would have approved it. Just on its face. But the fact that they're accusing Trump of collusion when all this was happening? That is what truly makes, I think, Americans were tuned into this, really sick."
