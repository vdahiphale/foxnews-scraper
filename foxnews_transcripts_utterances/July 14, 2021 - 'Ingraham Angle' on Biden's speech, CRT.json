Now, it was kind of an odd choice of venue given that it's the place where Democrats believe all those white racist men got together during the racist constitutional convention.

Enforcing poll watchers to stand at such a distance that they couldn't reasonably observe the process would be a criminal offense, you get to have eyes on potential cheating. Now this Texas proposal makes total sense given what happened in some states last November. Remember poll watchers who were kept on the other side of the room behind the rope unable to conduct any meaningful oversight that can't happen. But as usual, liberals are at war with the facts.

The Texas bills expand voting hours for all registered voters and the bill has even lower the population threshold needed for counties to provide additional early voting hours, oh terrible. Now notice that none of these Democrats ever mentioned the actual specifics of the legislation. Well, we know why, because to do so would expose their phony complaints. I want to get right to the point here. Democrats want to rig every election going forward to make it nearly impossible for a conservative to win again. They're now effectively arguing that the very voting rules that delivered two, two term victories for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are essentially just like Jim Crow 2.0. There weren't months of early voting back then there was no flood of unsolicited mail in ballot applications arriving at your home, there was no ramp and ballot harvesting. Obviously no same day voter registration, and yet Democrats somehow still managed to win under those old rules. But 5.5 years after Obama left office, Democrats are seeing their edge with minority voters starting to wane. More Hispanics, entrepreneurial and optimistic, are recognizing the left wing war against prosperity. Black men are also beginning to recognize that liberal pandering doesn't help their kids' education or job prospects. These trend lines are terrible for Democrats. They know that their policies aren't going to deliver results to entry level working class Americans, not in urban areas, not anywhere. So this leaves them really with only one option in their mind, which is to promote racial fear-mongering. And pretty much everything around them. So we already know what they're doing in our schools, to our workplaces, the military, even to now our system of voting.",

The fact is Democrats used COVID to change the way we all voted, all along with the intent of making those new rules permanent, the new voting normal.

They did that remember in Florida and Georgia and you think that police were firing water cannons at voters heading to the polls the way they described it?

Therefore the people act that they were touting today is more accurately described as for the liberals act, it would mandate same day or automatic voter registration, which obviously opens up the door to ramp and fraud possibilities and vote by mail would be a staple. They even want to force the Supreme Court to change its ethics rules, if they end up hearing any election challenge. So fast forward now, would you to the day after the 2022 election, and Republicans have, let's say retaken the House, they made the added a few Senate seats. Democrats who railed against Trump for not accepting the outcome of the last election will I promise you spend the next two years claiming the midterms were illegitimate. Then we'll get the same tired acts leading up to 2024. The three ring circus it was only exciting when the talent could deliver oohs and ahhs. But the Democrats have become just one big overpriced clown show hardly worth our high price of admission. And that's THE ANGLE. Here now is Horace Cooper Project. 21 Co-Chair, Dinesh D'Souza, Conservative Author, Filmmaker, Host of the Dinesh D'Souza Podcast and Harmeet Dhillon, Co-Chair of the Republican National Lawyers Association. Horace, the justification from Biden to these Texas downs who fled to mommy and daddy in D.C. is that the GOP just wants to disenfranchise Black and Brown voters. Is there any evidence of that happening anywhere, but especially where you are in Texas? HORACE COOPER, PROJECT 21 CO-CHAIRMAN: W.C. Phil's once said there was a sucker born every day. And apparently, our president believes that he can tell some of the boldest, baseless lies and that people are going to buy it. Here's a true fact. When he was vice president, they prosecuted more voter fraud cases than they did income tax fraud cases. They prosecuted more voter fraud cases than they did bank fraud cases. Now, are we going to conclude as they tried to imply that the number of prosecutions tells us about the seriousness of the violation? Everyone knows that in Texas in 2020, more Blacks voted for Conservatives and Republicans, more Latinos voted for Conservatives and Republicans. In fact, the legislature picked up seats on the right rather than losing seats. There is no claim whatsoever truth, no truth whatsoever to this claim.",

You know, I think that Biden in a way have missed a huge opportunity, because what he needed to do, I think, is lay out the argument and say, look, we need to have laws that on the one hand, make it easier to vote, but harder to cheat. I mean, presumably that is going to be the criteria for any decent voter integrity law. Now he needed to go down the laws one by one starting with voter ID and show for example, make the case that voter ID for example. It makes it harder to vote.

JULIE KELLY, \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\" SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR: So, as far as people who are being detained in Washington, D.C., jail -- now, this is a jail that was set up specifically to hold Trump supporters, January 6th protesters. As you said, there are people who have been there since January, now six months and counting. I believe last count, there's more than three dozen, with more on the way. And the government continues -- Joe Biden's Justice Department continues to seek pretrial detention for even nonviolent offenders. I listened to a hearing today. A federal judge actually denied the government's pretrial motion because this certain defendant had not committed any violent crimes. But to your point, Laura, they are holding people behind bars for months on end. These trials won't start until early next year. And they are doing it before one moment of their trial has even started, before they even have a trial date. They are punishing Trump supporters, keeping them behind bars. You'll be happy to know, maybe Heather Mac Donald will be happy to know that the FBI took an entire crime family off the streets in Texas today, arresting a family of five for trespassing and creating and picketing in the Capitol, trying to destroy their lives.

Well, we got our hands on the document and we're going to bring you the details you're not going to see anywhere else. But first, the lamest show on earth, not us by the way. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, ever since the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus shut down after 146 years in business, there hasn't really been anything close to replacing it, the excitement or the drama but today, Biden tried to fill that void when he stepped on stage in Philadelphia."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Perhaps you should consult Merriam Webster on the meaning of hyperbole. It's an assault on democracy to allow an extra hour of required early voting in Texas, two to three hours longer by the way than Joe's home State of Delaware. The White House invited fraudster Al Sharpton an assorted racial activists to participate in its voting rights performance in Philadelphia. Now, it was kind of an odd choice of venue given that it's the place where Democrats believe all those white racist men got together during the racist constitutional convention. President Biden spoke for 25 minutes or so and told about the same number of lies about the suppose that impediments to voting in the United States, all of course created or tolerated by Republicans."

They want to make it so hard and convenient, that they hope people don't vote at all."

But for the record, the Texas legislation gives poll watchers free movement, except of course contrary to what Biden alleged, not when voters are filling out ballots. Enforcing poll watchers to stand at such a distance that they couldn't reasonably observe the process would be a criminal offense, you get to have eyes on potential cheating. Now this Texas proposal makes total sense given what happened in some states last November. Remember poll watchers who were kept on the other side of the room behind the rope unable to conduct any meaningful oversight that can't happen. But as usual, liberals are at war with the facts. Joe's just reading whatever script his writers handed him desperately trying to get people to step into their big top."

The Texas bills expand voting hours for all registered voters and the bill has even lower the population threshold needed for counties to provide additional early voting hours, oh terrible. Now notice that none of these Democrats ever mentioned the actual specifics of the legislation. Well, we know why, because to do so would expose their phony complaints. I want to get right to the point here. Democrats want to rig every election going forward to make it nearly impossible for a conservative to win again. They're now effectively arguing that the very voting rules that delivered two, two term victories for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are essentially just like Jim Crow 2.0. There weren't months of early voting back then there was no flood of unsolicited mail in ballot applications arriving at your home, there was no ramp and ballot harvesting. Obviously no same day voter registration, and yet Democrats somehow still managed to win under those old rules. But 5.5 years after Obama left office, Democrats are seeing their edge with minority voters starting to wane. More Hispanics, entrepreneurial and optimistic, are recognizing the left wing war against prosperity. Black men are also beginning to recognize that liberal pandering doesn't help their kids' education or job prospects. These trend lines are terrible for Democrats. They know that their policies aren't going to deliver results to entry level working class Americans, not in urban areas, not anywhere. So this leaves them really with only one option in their mind, which is to promote racial fear-mongering. And pretty much everything around them. So we already know what they're doing in our schools, to our workplaces, the military, even to now our system of voting."

And to imply that they're not savvy enough somehow to make a photocopy of their own ID, Madam Vice President. The fact is Democrats used COVID to change the way we all voted, all along with the intent of making those new rules permanent, the new voting normal. With states getting wise though, to their sleight of hand, liberals are growing more desperate, and sloppy. The act, it's just not that convincing anymore."

They even want to prevent the regular scrubbing of dead voters or voters who moved from the rolls. They did that remember in Florida and Georgia and you think that police were firing water cannons at voters heading to the polls the way they described it? So as usual Democrats, they're going for stunts over substance to get you to believe the fantasy that voter ID is just as discriminatory as poll taxes and literary literacy tests. They have to drown you in hype and phony emotion, complete with their own score. But singing on key is of course optional."

They want rules that give them unlimited time to count and deliver votes, days, weeks, and even months after the polls close. Therefore the people act that they were touting today is more accurately described as for the liberals act, it would mandate same day or automatic voter registration, which obviously opens up the door to ramp and fraud possibilities and vote by mail would be a staple. They even want to force the Supreme Court to change its ethics rules, if they end up hearing any election challenge. So fast forward now, would you to the day after the 2022 election, and Republicans have, let's say retaken the House, they made the added a few Senate seats. Democrats who railed against Trump for not accepting the outcome of the last election will I promise you spend the next two years claiming the midterms were illegitimate. Then we'll get the same tired acts leading up to 2024. The three ring circus it was only exciting when the talent could deliver oohs and ahhs. But the Democrats have become just one big overpriced clown show hardly worth our high price of admission. And that's THE ANGLE. Here now is Horace Cooper Project. 21 Co-Chair, Dinesh D'Souza, Conservative Author, Filmmaker, Host of the Dinesh D'Souza Podcast and Harmeet Dhillon, Co-Chair of the Republican National Lawyers Association. Horace, the justification from Biden to these Texas downs who fled to mommy and daddy in D.C. is that the GOP just wants to disenfranchise Black and Brown voters. Is there any evidence of that happening anywhere, but especially where you are in Texas? HORACE COOPER, PROJECT 21 CO-CHAIRMAN: W.C. Phil's once said there was a sucker born every day. And apparently, our president believes that he can tell some of the boldest, baseless lies and that people are going to buy it. Here's a true fact. When he was vice president, they prosecuted more voter fraud cases than they did income tax fraud cases. They prosecuted more voter fraud cases than they did bank fraud cases. Now, are we going to conclude as they tried to imply that the number of prosecutions tells us about the seriousness of the violation? Everyone knows that in Texas in 2020, more Blacks voted for Conservatives and Republicans, more Latinos voted for Conservatives and Republicans. In fact, the legislature picked up seats on the right rather than losing seats. There is no claim whatsoever truth, no truth whatsoever to this claim."

You know, I think that Biden in a way have missed a huge opportunity, because what he needed to do, I think, is lay out the argument and say, look, we need to have laws that on the one hand, make it easier to vote, but harder to cheat. I mean, presumably that is going to be the criteria for any decent voter integrity law. Now he needed to go down the laws one by one starting with voter ID and show for example, make the case that voter ID for example. It makes it harder to vote. I mean, the same voter ID that people - ID that people can obtain in every other sphere of life, apparently, is not available when it comes to voting. But voter ID does make it harder to cheat. But for the Democrats, it's all about making it easier to vote.

Yesterday's news reports, taking a look at the number on the plane itself, trace that to a Lebanese American hedge fund magnate out of Nevada who actually represents the country of Lebanon as a Consulate General. So you have to ask the question, what is he expecting in exchange for his largest and did they decide to raise some money and pay him back after this became a national scandal also, who is paying for their hotel room help in D.C., they could do some singing lessons too, by the way, and who's paying for their food and drink and that Miller lie? Whose pool sprung for the classy Miller lie that they had on board as well? Laura this whole thing stinks. And if I were, you know, in a way, it would actually be better if taxpayers were paying for it because it would be accountable. We don't know what dark money forces are paying for this or what they're expecting in return. So this is thoroughly corrupt, it stinks. And it flies in the face of the fact that 78 percent of voters in the United States support voter ID, clean voter rolls, verification, bipartisan observers and chain of custody 78 percent it's not even close. So these people are being hysterical, over nothing. And they're claiming and Joe Biden would have was next going to say that requiring people to vote in the district that they registered in is like Antietam, you know, so it's completely unbelievable.

Only one of them is now facing charges yet another example of the scourge of light touch policing. But instead of pushing a course correction here, Biden is letting the agitators drive the conversation. Now, if that continues, it won't take much to reignite the bloody riots we saw last summer, especially with the rhetoric about voting that we just covered in the previous segment. Joining me now is Heather Mac Donald, Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute Author of \"The war on cops that predicted much of this\".

And so the Democrats are furiously backpedaling and tried to present themselves as the pro police party. It's not going to work. It's not going to fool the American public. And it's not going to bring real substance in the law and order back to the city unless they start retracting their long history of anti-cop statements and say actually, we believe the cops are doing the best they can. They're the police. They're the government agency most dedicated to protecting black lives."

They're now coming down on the January 6th attendees. It seems like they're picking up the pace of what some are saying is harassment most of whom were nonviolent. Now remember these people haven't even been convicted of a crime. Some have been held for months since January while repeatedly being denied bail, since they could pose potential future threats. Others reportedly sit in sells for 23 hours a day. Joining me now is Julie Kelly, senior contributor for \"American Greatness\" who has been one of the only journalist staying on this story. Julie, do we even know how many people they're holding, and on what basis? JULIE KELLY, \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\" SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR: So, as far as people who are being detained in Washington, D.C., jail -- now, this is a jail that was set up specifically to hold Trump supporters, January 6th protesters. As you said, there are people who have been there since January, now six months and counting. I believe last count, there's more than three dozen, with more on the way. And the government continues -- Joe Biden's Justice Department continues to seek pretrial detention for even nonviolent offenders. I listened to a hearing today. A federal judge actually denied the government's pretrial motion because this certain defendant had not committed any violent crimes. But to your point, Laura, they are holding people behind bars for months on end. These trials won't start until early next year. And they are doing it before one moment of their trial has even started, before they even have a trial date. They are punishing Trump supporters, keeping them behind bars. You'll be happy to know, maybe Heather Mac Donald will be happy to know that the FBI took an entire crime family off the streets in Texas today, arresting a family of five for trespassing and creating and picketing in the Capitol, trying to destroy their lives. So the dichotomy just keeps getting darker and broader every single day and this Justice Department and FBI hunt down Americans who protested against Joe Biden on January 6th, while our cities, as you say devolve --"

To me, this is much like the hyperbole and the racial fearmongering over legitimate voter integrity rules and laws, because that's a big set up for protesting the election in 2022 and 2024, in my view. I think they know they're going to lose. It has got to be all illegitimate. In this case, they want to send a message. If you think you are going to petition the Biden administration or show up at any great rallies, we're going to have our drones or whatever flying. We're going to identify you. You're going to be in a database. You might not be able to get on a plane. I think they're trying to intimidate people away from exercising their First Amendment rights.

This man is an Army Ranger, he had three tours in Afghanistan, he graduated from Penn State University, and he is now a high school teacher.

Take \"New York Magazine,\" for instance. They are just now reporting that it's time to rethink COVID protocol for children, noting that fewer kids die from COVID then from pneumonia, heart disease, suicide, homicide, car crashes, or drownings. The left has covered up the truth that this virus is not lethal for children. But never one to let the facts get in the way, Tony Fauci is still pushing the line."

The CDC, NIH, FDA, they are so far behind on the data now. You're right, we've had national history experiments. Schools open, schools closed, it doesn't matter.

Now, Doctor, what is this? Why is natural immunity not a thing?"

There was a fantastic study out of the Cleveland Clinic that found the same thing, that people who had recovered from COVID were actually quite well protected against severe disease and reinfection. I don't understand why they've done that. It actually discriminates against all of the working class people who have come down with COVID, recovered from it because we deemed them essential, didn't protect them, while protecting the laptop class. And now we say, OK, that natural immunity doesn't count for anything. You don't have the vaccine, so you can't go to a restaurant or to a ballgame or something. It makes no sense. It's bad for public health, and it is contrary to the science. Again, I'm at a loss for words to explain how you can continue to ignore the vast amount of evidence on this, and then make policy around that. It's just a mistake."

We are going to have a slight rise with the Delta variant, but the Delta variant really is not responsive at all, or protected at all by the vaccines. So 42 percent of 90,000 proven Delta cases in the U.K. have been vaccinated. In Israel, the estimate right now from the Israel health authorities that the vaccine efficacy rate is only about 60 to 70 percent. So we expect Delta cases and in fully vaccinated individuals. It will be a mild rise. It's easily treatable in high-risk patients. There is no reason right now, no clinical reason to go get vaccinated."

A presentation delivered a few months after that by then president of the National Council for Social Studies, Tina Heafner, in it, she laid the groundwork for an overhaul. She said \"Social studies can be an educational space to teach antiracism, to confront the history of racist ideas associated with harmful social economic, cultural, and political disparities, and to champion human rights and antiracist policies.\" Just a few months later, in front of the American Historical Association, she went further."

And of course, this is extremely detrimental. Now, some of them claim this is not actually being taught in schools and grade schools or high schools, it's only been taught in law schools. Clearly, that is not the case, and that's why so many of the parent groups are upset. And this is actually a good thing, a good thing that they are pushing so hard that it is actually waking people up. Before, it was sort of like simmering slowly in the thought span, and the frog gets cooked. But now they turned the heat up too high, and people are waking up quickly, which is a good thing.

And trying to relate everything back to slavery, think about the fact that slavery has been parts of society since the beginning of civilization, and there are more slaves today than there were in 1863 with the Emancipation Proclamation, and we fought a war to get rid of them.
