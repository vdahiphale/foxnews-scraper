His name, Mark Zaid. He was on \"Hannity and Colmes\" apparently in 2006. I have no idea, I don't remember. He's a hyper-partisan, obviously, he's deranged, Trump-hating political operative from the swamp, the sewer in D.C. He has clearly been plotting impeachment and this coup as he says, from day one. Just look at your screen. Thanks to foxnews.com, this is what we know. On January 30th, 2017, the president has only been in office 10 days, and guess what? He tweeted #coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachmentwillfollowultimately. #lawyers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then he kept going throughout the year. July 1, 2017, tweeting, we will get rid of him and this country is strong enough to survive even him and his supporters, we have to. And there's more. For months, he tweeted incessantly about President Trump's impeachment, comparisons to Nixon, tweets fantasizing about life after the president being impeached. And, of course, there is even a tweet highlighting how fake news CNN is going to help take Trump down. Quote: I predict CNN will play a key role in President Trump not finishing out his full term as president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, it shouldn't come as a surprise that he has appeared on fake news CNN a whopping 11 times since he started obsessing and fantasizing about impeachment, on Twitter. He gave us a statement saying: Those tweets were reflective and repeated the sentiments of millions of people, that he was referring to a perfectly legal process. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK. A totally reasonable impeachment coup attempt he started ten days after the president was sworn in. Sure. And then, by the way, he is a sort of the face of this Trump derangement syndrome. Last night in Monroe, Louisiana, the president had this to say about, well, Mr. ten days into office impeachment mania. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And with the upcoming public hearings imminent, House Republicans, guess what? They are going to subpoena the non-whistle-blower whistle-blower hearsay whistle-blower to testify. And they also plan to call the, yes, the compromised, the corrupt, coward, congenital liar Schiff to testify under oath. He is a fact witness in this case. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the whistle-blower and his handler -- yes, that would be Adam Schiff and people in his office apparently, they got to answer some very serious questions. We will lay out a few. Now, we know that Schiff's office was in fact in contact with the hearsay whistle-blower before filing the complaint. So, did Schiff or members of his office collude with the attorney? Did they -- what role did Schiff's office have in orchestrating the complaint? Did they recommend the attorney? And the non-whistle-blower is apparent -- you know, a deep state holdover from the Obama administration. We got a lot of questions for the hearsay whistle-blower. Ties to Joe Biden, look at tonight's \"Washington Examiner\", reporting he's actually a guest of sleepy, creepy, crazy Joe at a glitzy lunch in October 2016 to honor the prime minister of Italy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, what was the relationship to John Brennan? Number one Trump hater of them all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Did anyone from the Obama administration encourage him to file this complaint and maybe get involved in these activities? Where did he get the third-hand material? I think it's perfectly obvious what is going on here, we -- you know, it's not our first rodeo. Russia, Russia, Russia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The whistle-blower is not some kind of concerned government employee. No, to me, he looks very partisan. He looks like a hack who hired a hack, partisan Democrat, hate, rage Trump attorney with reported ties to Biden and Schiff in his office, and worked for Trump hater Brennan and other top Democrats. This is not hard to figure out. Maybe that's why he hired the impeach- Trump-after-ten-days attorney to be his attorney, maybe that's why he coordinated with the congenital liar, the compromised, corrupt Adam Schiff from the beginning in his office. And maybe and likely, that's why he and Schiff desperately don't want him to testify because they would have to answer those questions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the congenital liar Adam Schiff, three years of lying about Trump Russia -- we got all the evidence, all of it! Now, he had none of it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, he's not on a fact-finding mission. His first witch hunt failed and now he's begun the second witch hunt. Remember, three years, lies, Russian collusion, collusion, collusion, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment. Anyway, and get this -- even if the so-called whistle-blower was a real whistle-blower, the facts are the statute protecting anonymity doesn't exist. Now, he is protected against retribution, retaliation, nobody guaranteed anonymity in the statute. That means if they claim that you better not reveal the name of the non-whistle-blower, you are in deep trouble. No, you're not. Plenty of people have named the non-whistle-blower already. I know the name of the non-whistle-blower. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Our new guest, by the way, Gregg Jarrett, his best-selling book just out, \"Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History\". if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is really sort of just like the next chapter which he should probably start writing the book now.",

To be honest -- I have no idea how to pronounce her last name, I never talked to Secretary Pompeo or anybody at the State Department about her or anything else, a I don't know anything about her.

You might want to lash out at that guy, that prosecutor guy in the video that John Solomon was interviewing. The Ukraine story is zero experience Hunter Biden, 49-year-old son of the vice president, he gets millions of dollars. As the vice president learns his son is being investigated from even \"The New York Times\", and then lo and behold, Joe goes to Ukraine. He's leading up the efforts on behalf of the Obama administration for Ukraine. And then we get the quid pro quo Joe -- simple. He says, you've got six hours, you got six hours -- fire the prosecutor, I'll give you a billion dollars. You got six hours. If you don't fire him, you're not getting the $6 billion. You have six hours. So, when it comes to Ukraine, you idiots in the media mob, I have been laser-focused on the Bidens. That's the real Ukrainian corruption. There is a real quid pro quo Joe. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Speaking of which, the transcript from George Kent, who I've never heard of also, reveals a major bombshell about Joe and Hunter Biden. Look at this, according to Kent, the Obama administration actually tried to partner with Ukrainian oil and gas giant Burisma Holdings, they are the ones paying no experience Hunter all of those millions on a U.S. aid project until Kent, I guess to his credit, objected and he cited the firm's alleged corruption. Then, later, Hunter Biden's sketchy, very -- no experience profitable connection -- it happened in other countries, too, to Burisma in this case. So at this point, how is it even possible for the mob and the media to defend Joe and Hunter Biden? #quidproquoJoe. There is now damning evidence that paints a vivid picture of, oh, I think that would be corruption, certainly trying to buy favor, some might call it influence peddling, I call it quid pro quo Joe.

That would be Brennan, Clapper, Comey, and McCabe those people are squealing the most right now and I think are going to take at the hardest in the shorts in this report.",

DAVID LIMBAUGH, \"GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY\" AUTHOR: I sure hope they are uncovering every stone to prove the points you are making Sean. Listen, there's a common thread with Ukraine. Both cases are based on fraudulent sketchy evidence, that's the common thread for the Democrats. Look, they went after Trump not disclosing that this was opposition research paid for by Hillary, that Steele had an Anti-Trump agenda, that he was fired by the FBI that he presented a news article to the FISA court that was also sourced to Steele that was corroborative evidence, what a fraud? We don't realize how serious a matter this is. The FISA court involves extraordinary circumstances you have to have strong evidence because of the extraordinary privacy concerns that are involved in these kinds of warrants. As you said, the Grassley memo showed that most of this warrant application was based on the Steele dossier, the Democrats - that so to the never Trumper now we come out and find out if totally true.",

      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "sentences": "All right, look. First of all who's ever heard of a whistleblower who is someone who is backed by the establishment? Normally you have a whistleblower who challenging the establishment, challenging in the system, you have the entire establishment, the media, the Democratic Party, part of the Republican Party back in the Senate backing the whistleblower. I've really never seen anything like this, it's really bizarre. The reason you have whistleblower protections is because the whistleblower is going against the system. In this case we have the President going against the system and the whistleblower going against the President of the United States. I want to explain to the American people in a way that even Joe Scarborough can understand with the law is because you are hearing a lot of lies from Schiff and the Democrats in these phony legal analysts. Andy McCarthy did a good job in the national review I've talked about this radio too. The whistleblower statute does not apply to the President of the United States, does not apply to conversations the President of the United States has with leaders of other country, and it does not apply to foreign policy. So the whistleblower statute does not apply to the President or this phone call. Number one, I hope Richard Burr is listening, the Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee which really is not a very intelligent committee. Number two, the so-called whistleblower does not have statutory protection. He doesn't meet the statutory elements. He was not an official who reports on intelligence activities within the purview of the Director of National Intelligence. He was serving temporarily on the National Security Council reporting to the President. Number three, the law does not - hello! Does not guarantee anonymity to the whistleblower, only the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community is to keep it confidential with certain exceptions. The President can release the name, Congress can come of the media is not bound and interestingly enough, the intelligence committee did release his name - Adam Schiff did release his name by accident last night in that transcript. So I guess we should arrest Adam Schiff for that in a thousand other reasons. Congress has never provided overarching legal protection to any whistleblower, certainly not in the context of launching an impeachment investigation, so why are they hiding this guy from me, we the people? We know his name, we know all about him and yet the same newspapers that put out the Pentagon papers and everything else, they are keeping it secret. How can you impeach a president a process to be triggered by this guy who was a political hack, a political hack without the House, the Senate, the President and the public scrutinizing his motives, his credibility and his veracity? It's not that his substance of the complaint his is determinative, it's the fact of his complaints. This is the second impeachment document they have put together. His lawyers, that's right \"Coupster\" a new word, the coup. I'm sure that Adam Schiff's staff was involved we want to know who was involved? The Democrats, the media, feckless Republicans, they would have us impeach a President without knowing who this guy is? He's a political hack yet we reportedly know who he is, right? Now this cover-up, that's what it is, it's intended to protect the Democrat Party, the Obama Administration, this guy worked in the Obama Administration, Adam Schiff who knows all about this guy. Adam Schiff hired a couple old NSC staffers, took them out of the Trump Administration they are on his staff now. I have no doubt they are involved in this process, who else they want to protect? Joe Biden! Nobody has asked to Joe about this guy, this guy knows Joe Biden, and Joe Biden knows this guy. So we have to protect him and we have to Brennan. So infected pretend - in fact all these people and his hacked lawyers who have been running around saying we are independent, we have no axe to grind, we even represented Republicans. His coup leading slip and fall lawyers, now we know all about them. The problem is Adam Schiff like a good mobster has decided you can't call this guy as a witness. You can't call me as a witness Republicans because you need my approval and I'm not going to give you the approval. So the head mobster of this operation says I'm in charge of who the witnesses can be and I'm not going to let you call these people so it's a grand cover-up. Adam Schiff is also the guy in charge of the cover-up. Here's the thing I want the American people to understand, the laws on the President's side, the facts from the President's side and what they are attacking is the transition of power. They have never supported the transition of power from the Obama Administration to a Trump Administration and I want to remind Adam Schiff and all the slow learners on MSNBC and CNN, the President sets foreign policy, it doesn't make a difference if you don't agree with it. I don't care whether they are a Former Obama Ambassador from the Ukraine. Oh, they forced me out, too damn bad. We elected this President, he appoints whoever he wants and if he wants to treat Ukraine in a certain way, he is free to do it. Meanwhile Ukraine got the military aid Obama wouldn't give, meanwhile the President of the Ukraine said what quid pro quo? There is a quid pro quo we should not be involved in it. Our President says no quid pro quo, so what do they do? They go to bureaucrats who never heard of in the State Department who say \"Well, I don't think the President should have done that\" did you talk? No. Did you witness anything? No. Did you have any firsthand? No. Did you listen in the phone call? Yes, but I don't think the transcript is right. What the hell is going on here? This is another hoax being perpetrated by the Democrats, a phony impeachment effort, like the phony Russia effort, Mr. President, stay strong, this will collapse eventually but we do need the whistleblower to testify, Schiff to testify because the whole House of cards will collapse and the American people will see what - this was an outrageous attack by them on the President.

Just look at your screen. Thanks to foxnews.com, this is what we know. On January 30th, 2017, the president has only been in office 10 days, and guess what? He tweeted #coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachmentwillfollowultimately. #lawyers. And then he kept going throughout the year. July 1, 2017, tweeting, we will get rid of him and this country is strong enough to survive even him and his supporters, we have to. And there's more.

They say, January 2017, a coup has started and the impeachment will follow ultimately. It's all -- it's all a hoax, it's a scam. You know the whistle-blower, the one who came out with this, oh, Trump said this, and the Trump said that, and when they heard the real phone call, the whistle-blower disappeared. Shifty Schiff, he's a corrupt politician, Schiff didn't want to have the whistleblower anymore because nobody thought I was going to release the phone call."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, that point the president is right on, and remember, there's eight quid pro quos the congenital liar Schiff was telling us. And with the upcoming public hearings imminent, House Republicans, guess what? They are going to subpoena the non-whistle-blower whistle-blower hearsay whistle-blower to testify. And they also plan to call the, yes, the compromised, the corrupt, coward, congenital liar Schiff to testify under oath. He is a fact witness in this case. Now, the whistle-blower and his handler -- yes, that would be Adam Schiff and people in his office apparently, they got to answer some very serious questions. We will lay out a few. Now, we know that Schiff's office was in fact in contact with the hearsay whistle-blower before filing the complaint. So, did Schiff or members of his office collude with the attorney? Did they -- what role did Schiff's office have in orchestrating the complaint? Did they recommend the attorney? And the non-whistle-blower is apparent -- you know, a deep state holdover from the Obama administration. We got a lot of questions for the hearsay whistle-blower. Ties to Joe Biden, look at tonight's \"Washington Examiner\", reporting he's actually a guest of sleepy, creepy, crazy Joe at a glitzy lunch in October 2016 to honor the prime minister of Italy. And, by the way, what was the relationship to John Brennan? Number one Trump hater of them all. Did anyone from the Obama administration encourage him to file this complaint and maybe get involved in these activities? Where did he get the third-hand material? I think it's perfectly obvious what is going on here, we -- you know, it's not our first rodeo. Russia, Russia, Russia. The whistle-blower is not some kind of concerned government employee. No, to me, he looks very partisan. He looks like a hack who hired a hack, partisan Democrat, hate, rage Trump attorney with reported ties to Biden and Schiff in his office, and worked for Trump hater Brennan and other top Democrats. This is not hard to figure out. Maybe that's why he hired the impeach- Trump-after-ten-days attorney to be his attorney, maybe that's why he coordinated with the congenital liar, the compromised, corrupt Adam Schiff from the beginning in his office. And maybe and likely, that's why he and Schiff desperately don't want him to testify because they would have to answer those questions. Now, the congenital liar Adam Schiff, three years of lying about Trump Russia -- we got all the evidence, all of it! Now, he had none of it. Well, he's not on a fact-finding mission. His first witch hunt failed and now he's begun the second witch hunt. Remember, three years, lies, Russian collusion, collusion, collusion, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment. Anyway, and get this -- even if the so-called whistle-blower was a real whistle-blower, the facts are the statute protecting anonymity doesn't exist. Now, he is protected against retribution, retaliation, nobody guaranteed anonymity in the statute. That means if they claim that you better not reveal the name of the non-whistle-blower, you are in deep trouble. No, you're not. Plenty of people have named the non-whistle-blower already. I know the name of the non-whistle-blower. Our new guest, by the way, Gregg Jarrett, his best-selling book just out, \"Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History\". This is really sort of just like the next chapter which he should probably start writing the book now."

There is one narrow provision that gives discretion to the inspector general to disclose or not disclose the name, but that has no application to anyone else. Let's assume for the sake of argument that, A, whistle-blower deserves anonymity. This one doesn't because he doesn't qualify as a whistle-blower under the law. You have to meet two conditions -- he doesn't meet either one of them and don't take my word for it, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, as well as the acting director of national intelligence both said he is not a whistle-blower under the law.

And, by the way, that's what the fired prosecutor said. He was closing in on Burisma and Hunter Biden, and that's why he was fired by Biden."

Oh, now it makes sense. Thank you, this has been so hard and so difficult and so complicated. Gregg Jarrett, great work. Now, let's turn to some more breaking developments. Newly released transcripts from the, you know, top-secret, Schiff, Soviet-style impeachment coup attempt -- bad news for Democrats. Look at this, career State Department official George Kent -- George, by the way, you me an apology. We're going to be talking about this soon. Testified he had no knowledge that U.S. aid to Ukraine was ever connected to an investigation request and he said the government of Ukraine had no idea there was a temporary hold on aid until a month after the president's phone call with Ukraine. And, by the way, they got the money without doing anything. And that's not all. Kent also raise concerns about the Bidens and Burisma Holdings, even mentioned yours truly, I will accept the guy's apology. In fact, Kent also testified I was talking to the State Department about the former ambassador to Ukraine. I'm going to spell it out for all of you one more time, I suggest you read my Twitter account. I don't know anything about that lady. To be honest -- I have no idea how to pronounce her last name, I never talked to Secretary Pompeo or anybody at the State Department about her or anything else, a I don't know anything about her. I would advise you all very strongly -- I'm saying this in a nice way. All of you had better stop lying about me, you now have been told the truth again. Stop lying. In fact, according to our own research, she was mentioned in passing four times on this show, including by John Solomon, he will join us in a minute. And he was reporting on an interview conducted with a top Ukrainian justice official who claimed that this U.S. ambassador gave him a \"do not prosecute\" list, filled with Obama allies. That's like the A.G. of the United States saying it, blame him -- take a look."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. To the media mob and those testifying, you want to a lash out at anyone? You might want to lash out at that guy, that prosecutor guy in the video that John Solomon was interviewing. The Ukraine story is zero experience Hunter Biden, 49-year-old son of the vice president, he gets millions of dollars. As the vice president learns his son is being investigated from even \"The New York Times\", and then lo and behold, Joe goes to Ukraine. He's leading up the efforts on behalf of the Obama administration for Ukraine. And then we get the quid pro quo Joe -- simple. He says, you've got six hours, you got six hours -- fire the prosecutor, I'll give you a billion dollars. You got six hours. If you don't fire him, you're not getting the $6 billion. You have six hours. So, when it comes to Ukraine, you idiots in the media mob, I have been laser-focused on the Bidens. That's the real Ukrainian corruption. There is a real quid pro quo Joe. Speaking of which, the transcript from George Kent, who I've never heard of also, reveals a major bombshell about Joe and Hunter Biden. Look at this, according to Kent, the Obama administration actually tried to partner with Ukrainian oil and gas giant Burisma Holdings, they are the ones paying no experience Hunter all of those millions on a U.S. aid project until Kent, I guess to his credit, objected and he cited the firm's alleged corruption. Then, later, Hunter Biden's sketchy, very -- no experience profitable connection -- it happened in other countries, too, to Burisma in this case. So at this point, how is it even possible for the mob and the media to defend Joe and Hunter Biden? #quidproquoJoe. There is now damning evidence that paints a vivid picture of, oh, I think that would be corruption, certainly trying to buy favor, some might call it influence peddling, I call it quid pro quo Joe. Joining us now with more, FOX News contributor John Solomon. All right. You've got breaking news tonight. Very quickly."

      "utterance": "Yes, very important. George Kent, that State Department official testified in the '16, the summer of '16, he learned the U.S. State Department's foreign aid bureau, the USAID, had created a partnership with Burisma and Hunter Biden, to do a clean energy project and he put a stop to it because he was concerned that Burisma had a reputation of being corrupt. Why did that happen? We know this from something earlier I reported on your show, Sean. Back in December, Hunter Biden's partner, Devon Archer, texted an American lawyer and said, we just came back from USAID, they are going to give us a project and we are going to announce it. It's going to take the stain of \"The New York Times\" article calling is corrupt away. So, here's another piece of proof, U.S. State Department trying to help Hunter Biden steer the narrative or Hunter Biden's company steer the narrative. And sure as heck, they get the project and that's only because of George Kent's interference that it stopped at the last minute."

But here's what isn't in dispute. George Kent testified, like state officials told me three months ago, no matter what happened in the Yovanovitch meeting, yes, on several occasions, the U.S. embassy did put pressure on Ukraine prosecutors not to pursue certain prosecutions, mostly of people that were allies of either the embassy or George Soros. George Kent confirmed that today. He confirmed signing a letter saying back off the George Soros group. He confirmed multiple names that Lutsenko gave me as people that he and the embassy raised that the prosecutors saying back off."

We haven't talked enough about this. Look at the numbers we are talking about. Hundreds of trillions of dollars, with a T, trillions, in new spending. Very few specifics, except they want to legalize stealing from the rich on how they are going to pay for all of this. Remember Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal dream? That came at a price tag of $93 trillion. Now, we got Elizabeth Warren's $52 trillion Medicare-for-All plan. You add it together, you got $145 trillion in new spending, in ten years. Let me see. We take $4 trillion a year, four times 10 is 40. We're only taking $40 trillion. Oh, we're $105 trillion short. Everyone with a brain knows that would mean new taxes for everybody, wealth confiscation, not just for the wealthy, pretty much everybody. And everybody knows that plan would destroy the United States of America, the economy in less than a week, deplete your 401(k), the lifeblood of our economy, oil and gas, is gone, We would have a national socialist Venezuela nightmare on our hands.

So, the allegation is a quid pro quo, with this for that, you know, give me information on Hunter Biden or I withhold military aid from you, right? That's the allegation, correct? Nobody has confirmed this allegation yet. As a matter of fact, let's look at the players they've interviewed. Gordon Sondland who was our ambassador over there picked by Trump, ambassador to the E.U. over there, in a text message specifically states the charges d'affaires in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, that the president was, quote, Sean, crystal-clear, there's no quid pro quo. Even worse, Sondland states he spoke to the president of the United States, who was in a bad mood, which is irrelevant and asked about what he wants from Ukraine, the president says to him, nothing, I want nothing.

We know it's unverifiable because the author didn't stand by it himself under oath. So how is that not premeditated fraud on a court, why would it take 400 years to get the report? DAVID LIMBAUGH, \"GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY\" AUTHOR: I sure hope they are uncovering every stone to prove the points you are making Sean. Listen, there's a common thread with Ukraine. Both cases are based on fraudulent sketchy evidence, that's the common thread for the Democrats. Look, they went after Trump not disclosing that this was opposition research paid for by Hillary, that Steele had an Anti-Trump agenda, that he was fired by the FBI that he presented a news article to the FISA court that was also sourced to Steele that was corroborative evidence, what a fraud?

The FISA court involves extraordinary circumstances you have to have strong evidence because of the extraordinary privacy concerns that are involved in these kinds of warrants. As you said, the Grassley memo showed that most of this warrant application was based on the Steele dossier, the Democrats - that so to the never Trumper now we come out and find out if totally true."

If I lied to a judge or let's say I deleted subpoenaed emails, cleaned up my hard drive, beat up my devices, remove the Sim cards I would go to jail. If I committed premeditated fraud on the courts to spy on a presidential candidate, transition team and President and I think I would go to jail, I don't know why would think that but I just do."

And at some point the court has actually got a standard for itself and actually go after some people, you can't just lie to the court."

They haven't been held to account for lying about the Trump- Russia hoax, think about that. They just pivoted to Ukraine, none of this ever matters nobody ever stings them back. It's time that these counter reports that these counter investigations by Durham and by the IG yield some fruit because the public demands accountability. This cannot continue to go on. Jason has been great on this. This has got to stop as a deterrent for future conduct like this."

He's going to be on the show and give us behind the scenes in a minute. You've got this whistleblower non whistleblower lawyer, Mark Zaid blatant Anti-Trump bias ten days after the President is sworn in he's talking about impeachment. Anyway, with all of that said, there's only one guy we can bring that could tear this up. By the way his show number one on Sunday nights at 10 well, now has been moved to 8:00 starting this weekend, \"Great One\" and there is his book \"Unfreedom of the press\".

    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "All right, look. First of all who's ever heard of a whistleblower who is someone who is backed by the establishment? Normally you have a whistleblower who challenging the establishment, challenging in the system, you have the entire establishment, the media, the Democratic Party, part of the Republican Party back in the Senate backing the whistleblower. I've really never seen anything like this, it's really bizarre. The reason you have whistleblower protections is because the whistleblower is going against the system. In this case we have the President going against the system and the whistleblower going against the President of the United States. I want to explain to the American people in a way that even Joe Scarborough can understand with the law is because you are hearing a lot of lies from Schiff and the Democrats in these phony legal analysts. Andy McCarthy did a good job in the national review I've talked about this radio too. The whistleblower statute does not apply to the President of the United States, does not apply to conversations the President of the United States has with leaders of other country, and it does not apply to foreign policy. So the whistleblower statute does not apply to the President or this phone call. Number one, I hope Richard Burr is listening, the Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee which really is not a very intelligent committee. Number two, the so-called whistleblower does not have statutory protection. He doesn't meet the statutory elements. He was not an official who reports on intelligence activities within the purview of the Director of National Intelligence. He was serving temporarily on the National Security Council reporting to the President. Number three, the law does not - hello! Does not guarantee anonymity to the whistleblower, only the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community is to keep it confidential with certain exceptions. The President can release the name, Congress can come of the media is not bound and interestingly enough, the intelligence committee did release his name - Adam Schiff did release his name by accident last night in that transcript. So I guess we should arrest Adam Schiff for that in a thousand other reasons. Congress has never provided overarching legal protection to any whistleblower, certainly not in the context of launching an impeachment investigation, so why are they hiding this guy from me, we the people? We know his name, we know all about him and yet the same newspapers that put out the Pentagon papers and everything else, they are keeping it secret. How can you impeach a president a process to be triggered by this guy who was a political hack, a political hack without the House, the Senate, the President and the public scrutinizing his motives, his credibility and his veracity? It's not that his substance of the complaint his is determinative, it's the fact of his complaints. This is the second impeachment document they have put together. His lawyers, that's right \"Coupster\" a new word, the coup. I'm sure that Adam Schiff's staff was involved we want to know who was involved? The Democrats, the media, feckless Republicans, they would have us impeach a President without knowing who this guy is? He's a political hack yet we reportedly know who he is, right? Now this cover-up, that's what it is, it's intended to protect the Democrat Party, the Obama Administration, this guy worked in the Obama Administration, Adam Schiff who knows all about this guy. Adam Schiff hired a couple old NSC staffers, took them out of the Trump Administration they are on his staff now. I have no doubt they are involved in this process, who else they want to protect? Joe Biden! Nobody has asked to Joe about this guy, this guy knows Joe Biden, and Joe Biden knows this guy. So we have to protect him and we have to Brennan. So infected pretend - in fact all these people and his hacked lawyers who have been running around saying we are independent, we have no axe to grind, we even represented Republicans. His coup leading slip and fall lawyers, now we know all about them. The problem is Adam Schiff like a good mobster has decided you can't call this guy as a witness. You can't call me as a witness Republicans because you need my approval and I'm not going to give you the approval. So the head mobster of this operation says I'm in charge of who the witnesses can be and I'm not going to let you call these people so it's a grand cover-up. Adam Schiff is also the guy in charge of the cover-up. Here's the thing I want the American people to understand, the laws on the President's side, the facts from the President's side and what they are attacking is the transition of power. They have never supported the transition of power from the Obama Administration to a Trump Administration and I want to remind Adam Schiff and all the slow learners on MSNBC and CNN, the President sets foreign policy, it doesn't make a difference if you don't agree with it. I don't care whether they are a Former Obama Ambassador from the Ukraine. Oh, they forced me out, too damn bad. We elected this President, he appoints whoever he wants and if he wants to treat Ukraine in a certain way, he is free to do it. Meanwhile Ukraine got the military aid Obama wouldn't give, meanwhile the President of the Ukraine said what quid pro quo? There is a quid pro quo we should not be involved in it. Our President says no quid pro quo, so what do they do? They go to bureaucrats who never heard of in the State Department who say \"Well, I don't think the President should have done that\" did you talk? No. Did you witness anything? No. Did you have any firsthand? No. Did you listen in the phone call? Yes, but I don't think the transcript is right. What the hell is going on here? This is another hoax being perpetrated by the Democrats, a phony impeachment effort, like the phony Russia effort, Mr. President, stay strong, this will collapse eventually but we do need the whistleblower to testify, Schiff to testify because the whole House of cards will collapse and the American people will see what - this was an outrageous attack by them on the President. Yes, sir."

I wish they would've shown a little bit of the same amount of outrage when my family opened up a white powdery substance in an exploding envelope that showed up at my house. These guys are full of it Sean. And the thing is they aren't outrage that he was out, they're outraged that now in his name is out there, everyone is able to realize this is a guy that's tied to Brennan, this is a guy that's tied to Susan Rice, this is a guy who worked for Biden with the Ukraine nonsense and this is a guy whose lawyer has been tweeting since January of 2017, the coup has started, impeachment is next, we are going to get Trump out of there. This is just a joke and they realize they got caught in the act again because they wanted this innocent public servant whistleblower that is doing the right thing instead of just another one of the coup cabal of those clowns who have been doing this for three years. The reality is the American public gets it Sean, they see through this nonsense, they are sick of it as I am and they should be. Because if it's going on here in America in 2019, we should all be ashamed of ourselves that they are trying to overthrow a duly elected President because they didn't get the results they wanted and they want to promote their socialist leftist policies and that's the only thing that matters, that's disgusting.
