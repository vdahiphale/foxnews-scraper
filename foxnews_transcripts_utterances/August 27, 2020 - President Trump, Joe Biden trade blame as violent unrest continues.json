They had a terrorist master in Abu al-Baghdadi running it. He let our military atrophy going forward.

And when you look at what we have done, we reacted when Assad used sarin nerve gas in its citizens, we reacted.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's not surprising that Joe Biden would be lying about what Kellyanne Conway actually said because he's been lying about this as part of a centerpiece of his campaign where he had been falsely accusing Donald Trump of saying something he didn't say about the Charlottesville riots. He's been lying and saying that he praised white supremacists when he explicitly denounced them, and that's actually like a centerpiece of his campaign. What's interesting about this is that the Republican Convention is fighting back hard against this charge. It's very common for race-baiting to be something that is done in the -- at the end of an elections. But Republicans usually cower. Instead what you've seen with this convention is night after night of prominent black speakers talking about some of those lies that have been told and responding to them, and also making the case for voting for Trump based on actual policy substance, not just platitudes, but saying he is the guy who did criminal justice reform, he's the guy who is getting funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. He's the guy who achieved historic gains in job growth and wage growth for black men and women. And it's almost like Republicans are really excited to talk about it, and it's very much neutralizing what Biden thought, I think, would be a typical Republican race where you get to just accuse people of racism and the Republicans don't fight back. This time they're fighting back and they are working hard for that black vote. And it's been unlike he we've seen in a Republican convention going back decades.",

Protesters gathered and marched once again but this time peacefully as they and the entire city of Kenosha seem to take stock of the tragic events of the previous night when an armed vigilante, one of several who said they were protecting businesses clashed with protesters.  This video obtained exclusively by Fox News and shot from a drone shows the first of the shootings in which the gunman off to some sort of confrontation shoots a protester in the head. Other video then shows him being chased and tackled by protesters before he fires several more times. Court documents identified the alleged shooter, a 17-year old Kyle Rittenhouse.  DANIEL MISKINIS, POLICE CHIEF, KENOSHA, WISCONSIN: The voice of those people was not calling upon deaf ear. We are hearing what is being said and the mayor has spoke to his commitment involving myself to usher in change where that's possible.  HUNT: And the Wisconsin Department of Justice has now identified the officer who shot Jacob Blake as Rustin Chesky. Investigators also say they found a knife on the driver's side floor of Blake's car. Across the country, protests and riots continue.

      "speaker": "KELLOGG",
      "utterance": "That's correct. Yes, Bret. Look, this is an election on contrast and I think the contrast as commander-in-chief between Joe Biden and President Trump is significant. Look, let's just go down a couple of them right now.  Joe Biden in the Obama administration let ISIS grow. Grow to the size geographically, the size of Great Britain. They had a terrorist master in Abu al-Baghdadi running it. He let our military atrophy going forward. They allowed Syria to use chemical weapons sarin nerve gas against its citizens after they said very, very clearly that that was a red line they would not let the Syrians cross as they want forward. And you had a Secretary of Defense from the Obama administration. Secretary Gaetz say that in public and in his book, that Joe Biden has been nearly wrong on every major national security decision in the last 40 years and I think that's true. And when you look at what we have done, we reacted when Assad used sarin nerve gas in its citizens, we reacted. This president eliminated the ISIS caliphate, killed al-Baghdadi in an operation called Operation Kayla named after American woman that he had killed Kayla Mueller. He's let the military grow significantly going forward. But look, here's the one that is not really mentioned and I think this one is pretty important. When one of the most critical decisions made in the Obama administration was to go after the architect of 9/11 Osama bin Laden, after they had found him, the individual in the room that recommended that operation do not take place was Joe Biden. And our president is going after Baghdadi, he went after Soleimani and got him. Soleimani, the same individual from Iran, who had been a mastermind on killing the hundreds of American servicemen in Iraq. So, I think the contrast were quite clear. And I am very, very proud of our record than compare to his."

I have been with him through Mike Flynn is the national security adviser. H.R. McMaster. I've been through John Bolton and Robert O'Brien, who I believe happens to be the best national security adviser this president has had. John Bolton, I believe is actually an architect of failure. He had his own agenda. He pushed his own agenda, and when it didn't work, he tried to basically to stifle the discussion going forward or lie to the president of the United States. I was in there when it happened. I saw him when he fabricated information and nearly caused us to commence military operations in Iran because of a loss of a drone that we knew he had incorrect information, and he passed that incorrect information to the president. I saw him on several occasions do that. I saw John Bolton single handedly destroy Afghan negotiations, a year ago, up at Bedminster, after we thought we had the Afghan negotiations on track. And he happened to just ruin them. And I was there in the room when it happened. So, is John Bolton a liar? Yes, he is.

Bret, you and I have talked about this for some time, that we really weren't seeing any signs of a backlash against this urban violence and rioting. I think now we're beginning to see it. And to what extent it leaks into the presidential race is unclear, but when you see Joe Biden after not speaking about it at all at his convention last week, almost no one did mention it at all, starting to talk about it now, trying to blame it on the president, you know something is happening out there. And this looks to be real, and it remains to be seen how far it will go."

Byron, the issue obviously is going to a focus for the president tonight. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Yes. The president thinks that after a long bad period, things are beginning to move his way a little bit. Certainly, he's going to criticize Joe Biden a lot for everything Biden has ever done for the last 50 years. He is going to hit on this violence stuff. And I think on the coronavirus and the economy, he's basically going to say, look, we were doing great. We got hit by this terrible thing. You know what happened. But now we're coming back fast, and it won't happen under Joe Biden."

But I think Kellyanne Conway was intimating, and probably threatening that the see political advantage in the perception that Democratic based cities -- violence.

      "utterance": "Chuck, your audio is just cutting out just a little bit there. Mollie, let me go to you about this Biden charge. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's not surprising that Joe Biden would be lying about what Kellyanne Conway actually said because he's been lying about this as part of a centerpiece of his campaign where he had been falsely accusing Donald Trump of saying something he didn't say about the Charlottesville riots. He's been lying and saying that he praised white supremacists when he explicitly denounced them, and that's actually like a centerpiece of his campaign. What's interesting about this is that the Republican Convention is fighting back hard against this charge. It's very common for race-baiting to be something that is done in the -- at the end of an elections. But Republicans usually cower. Instead what you've seen with this convention is night after night of prominent black speakers talking about some of those lies that have been told and responding to them, and also making the case for voting for Trump based on actual policy substance, not just platitudes, but saying he is the guy who did criminal justice reform, he's the guy who is getting funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. He's the guy who achieved historic gains in job growth and wage growth for black men and women. And it's almost like Republicans are really excited to talk about it, and it's very much neutralizing what Biden thought, I think, would be a typical Republican race where you get to just accuse people of racism and the Republicans don't fight back. This time they're fighting back and they are working hard for that black vote. And it's been unlike he we've seen in a Republican convention going back decades."

And it seems pretty evident from what he said, which is one of those things where you inadvertently say something out loud you might later wish you said in a different setting, that they're seeing it in the polling so all of a sudden now we Democrats have got to come out and try to quell the violence, or at least urge people to stop it. So that's really where we are. And of course, it feeds right into what we're talking about earlier, this is beginning to sink in with people. You look at this stuff, Bret. A guy standing in front of a big fire in the middle of an urban center and saying this is mostly peaceful just doesn't compute. You almost can't make this stuff up. And I think people see this. It's got to be alarming. It would be to anybody, certainly to me, just as an ordinary American citizen. And it's beginning to take hold around the country. Democrats can only hope it dies down or that they are able to do something to quell it."

Secondly, the president has it within his power, he's the leader of this country, to call for calm, to call for unity, to call for people to come together and -- not go over the brink of violence. He has the whole world watching and listening to him tonight, and I'd say it's amazing nobody here expects that he would do that. And maybe we'll be wrong, but it's extraordinary. He has that opportunity tonight to try to calm --"

It happens time and time again that people with limited information, such as last night Minneapolis was looted because people falsely believed that someone was killed by police when he actually committed suicide. I don't think the full facts have been told even about Kenosha where a guy was resisting arrest. They were calling because a woman had said that he was in her house and he was not supposed to be. He was not responding to police orders. And this is something where the media have a responsibility not to fan the flames, but to accurately report things if they genuinely care about interactions with the police. We're not getting that, and its' spiraling out of control where you have athletes now trying to sabotage their own seasons because on false information that was reported in the media."
