He said he wasn't involved in any of the decision making specifically in regards to that well and he wanted to wait for investigations to come out and see exactly what the reason was behind the explosion. This with, of course, criminal investigations and civil trials pending.

I have talked about this before where they take a virgin to the top of a mountain, and everyone goes home happy except for, of course, the virgin. Here, because we have a scarcity of virgins, we send a CEO instead and they whack him around for a whole day and everybody goes home happy. The only difference is our procedure has let blood, but a lot more talking. I'm not sure which is preferable. Nobody expects anything out of these.

You don't express sympathy for a corporation that's soiled and destroyed the Gulf coast. What you can do is you can say we don't like the precedent of the federal government using its leverage and threats of prosecution to force companies into acting against what might be their own interest. It's not a good precedent. We had to do it in this case because we want to protect the income of the people in the Gulf who suffered, but it's been done in the case f the nationalization of the auto companies. It started in the Bush administration when Henry Paulson brought in the head of the six banks and said I'm now your partner and you will do as I say, and they had to, the way it's done in banana republics, except we didn't have a gun on the table.

What did he say? I want to get my life back. That was his way to sympathizing with the people of the Gulf.

The oil spill and response, 18 percent, and dissatisfaction with government or lack of leadership 14 percent. About the stimulus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month said since the stimulus was passed about 400,000 public sector employees have been added, those jobs. Public sector employers added jobs, 400,000 while the private sector shed 2.65 billion jobs. What about this push by the White House, Charles?"

This is the difference that that stimulus money made. And he is also making the case on the Hill for additional spending.
