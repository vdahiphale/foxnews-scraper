The president is not saying, look, I think this deal is not in the vital national interests of the United States as it is presently negotiated and constructed. I am prepared to actually give time and space to fix that deal. But I will walk away from this deal in the deal is not fixed, if our allies don't come on board, if Democrats don't join Republicans in locking in tough conditions into U.S. law. And I'm willing to give that time and space as well because I want to roll out a comprehensive strategy using all of these instruments of national power to really target Iran's destructive behavior, regionally and globally."

They don't want it to go away. They think it's - Iran is actually honoring the terms of that agreement. But they did give a little wiggle room at the end of that statement to say, we are happy to talk about, look into maybe strengthening some of the terms. How do you read their reaction?"

      "speaker": "DUBOWITZ",

I think Europeans have really gotten from a posture of \"keep it\" to a posture of \"fix it\" in order to prevent Donald Trump from taking the posture of \"nix it.\" I think that has been an interesting movement in the debate. Right? The Europeans, President Macron, of France, has actually said on three occasions, I'm willing to look at strengthening the deal, complementing it, supplementing it, I'm willing to look at sunset provisions and missiles and, obviously, Iran's regional behavior outside the deal. That is a significant shift in the European position. And I think they are shifty, Paul, because they are terrified that Donald Trump could walk away from this deal. It's giving him a lot more negotiating leverage."

And I've talked to some Senators who have been working on this, and what they are saying are things like intercontinental ballistic missile development, how many centrifuges they can have, try to get rid of the sunset provision that begins as early as eight years from now. What odds do you think exists for that getting 60 votes in the Senate and passing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUBOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Well, Paul, it has not been a successful legislative session, so I think -- I wouldn't be betting my strategy on getting 52 Republicans and eight Democrats to come on board these days, except maybe renaming the cafeteria in the Senate. But I would say is this, is that the president is giving them an opportunity to come on board, show bipartisan support, lockdown these conditions, which he has said the United States will not accept, establish a framework where sanctions would not be snapped back immediately, with the only snap back in six or eight or 10 years if Iran violates that conditions. But of course, the president retains executive authority, so if Congress does not do this, I imagine he has a backup plan where he could do this on his own using executive authority and moving forward with the Europeans on the diplomatic track. GIGOT: How do you think Iran is going to respond to this because, obviously, their initial response is going to be this violates the terms of the deal, we are not violating the deal and we won't change it. Do you think they will eventually -- I mean, could they make a decision to say that this nixes the deal, we're going to sprint to a nuclear weapon?"

I think the Iranians - the smart play for the Iranians is not to get hysterical, is to say that they are going to keep the deal and try to divide that Europeans from the Americans, the West with the Chinese and Russians, and continue getting all of the benefits of the deal. The thing about this deal is this deal was never about Iranian compliance. This deal was about the delusion of the deal, because it provided patient pathways to nuclear weapons and ICBMs for the Iranians by complying."

The president later announced he would halt subsidy payments to insurers who sell coverage under ObamaCare, a move that could fundamentally reshape his predecessor's signature health care law. Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman, and editorial page writer, Kate Bachelder Odell.

    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

Now, the other issue is the larger reform of the insurance market through new association health plans health care plans that they are going to try to promote and the small plans, so-called small plans. What's that about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ODELL",
      "utterance": "The White House executive order takes these modest steps to try to salvage an individual market. One of them is short-term health insurance that the Obama administration limited to 90 days because people were using it as a cheaper backdoor to avoid having to buy expensive plans on the exchanges. Traditionally, there hasn't been an incredibly high demand for this product, but it could change now that ObamaCare has wiped out the individual market. The second question is on association health plans. Those would potentially allow small businesses, trade groups to band together to form really large pools so they can enjoy economies of scale and get better insurance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "And the idea here, Dan, is to provide more alternatives in the individual marketplace so that not everybody has to pay these really high prices with really comprehensive plans. You'd think it would make sense. If you are young, you need a plan, you're in between jobs, you need a plan for a year, why not? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: That's exactly right, Paul. Look, ObamaCare, 2000 pages long, the Affordable Care Act was a flawed piece of legislation. In the year 2015, 6.7 million young individuals opted to take the penalty rather than join the plan, 6.7 million. What you had was the basic idea to make ObamaCare work was that all of the younger underinsured and no insured had to be forced into the exchanges to make the risk pool work. The population resisted that. And now somebody has to clean up the mess. And that is exactly what President Trump is doing by trying to create these alternatives with choices that would allow some of those six million people to say, I did not like ObamaCare, but I have a choice now, a plan that suits me."

I think -- President Obama said he wanted to rule by pen and phone.

      "speaker": "ODELL",

Bannon said it's necessary to drain the D.C. swamp to get President Trump's stalled agenda moving on Capitol Hill. But does the strategy put the Republican majority at risk? We're back with Dan Henninger, James Freeman, and columnist, Bill McGurn. So, Dan, what does Steve Bannon want? He says it's Trump's agenda but is that really it?"

The enemy is not other Republicans. And one of the things I think is a problem is I think Steve Bannon may be overreaching because -- if he doesn't do this. Anyone can go in, if you have some backing, and make it difficult with the primary candidate.

And the end result was it didn't get done. They never got to the 51 with Mike Pence that they needed. So I think it is very reasonable to expect that there is going to be a response, a revulsion among the Republican base, given all the promises.

That's what happened to Luther Strange down there in Alabama. Secondly, there's a question of policy. What are they going to run on? Now this campaign is being funded by Bob Mercer and his daughter, Rebecca. It's possible they could create some policy shops to pull that into the game. And, finally, there is donor confusion. What about the other Republican donors out there who fund Republican candidates? What are they going to make of something like this? I don't think too many of them are going to get behind the Bannon crusade here.

So the president says 20 percent, that is as high as he's going to go on the corporate tax rate, no more. Are you firm with that, too? REP. KEVIN BRADY, R-TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS & MEANS COMMITTEE: I absolutely am. Look, that's what it takes for companies to be competitive, whether they are competitive on Main Street or competing around the world. We want them to win. We want them to bring the earnings back to be reinvested in America. If we do that right, which we will, paychecks will grow, jobs will grow, and a lot more opportunity will grow than what we have today."

One of them concerns the state and local tax deduction, which is crucial to getting the money by eliminating that to finance the lower rates. But you are getting some criticism from Republicans and Democrats in high-tax states. Are you willing to compromise on total elimination?"

Secondly, we know having a simpler code where we protect more of the first dollars families earn, including in high-tax states, there is consensus there. So what we are looking at are the incredibly high rates of taxes that taxpayers pay in some of these states. We want to lower those tax rates for everybody. And so we are listening, one, and making sure that we understand just how burdensome those taxes are. But, secondly, there is a reason we haven't set the rates or the brackets so that we can make sure we let people keep more of what they earn regardless of where they live."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Right. One of the things I am hearing is, particularly in New York and California, when you have a lot -- believe it not, you have a lot of Republican members, including enough that they could kill your reform if they wanted to, I'm hearing them say, in particular, you have to do something to ease that burden on some middle-class taxpayers. And I'm hearing that they are talking about some kind of property tax deduction for middle-class families, middle-class taxpayers in those states. Is that true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "So we have had a number of ideas. One, where we set the rates and the bracket are incredibly important. How we address issues like child tax credits, incredibly important for middle class families. But also how we address those tough local issues, like property taxes, that aren't based on your ability to pay. They are just painful. They brought us ideas on how we can address issues like that. We are having the discussions. We had some at the end of the week, this week as well. We will continue to stay at the table with them. Because, again, Paul, at the end of the day, we want every American to keep more of what they earn regardless of where they live."

      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "We are listening very carefully to their ideas. Look, I don't know how families in these high0tax states make it. The rates are just stunning. In some states, the government has a greater claim over your earnings than you do, which is, to me, it's hard to believe that happens."

What is your response to that?"

      "speaker": "BRADY",

      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "There is no question tax reform, done right, will grow the economy. We've seen this in the Kennedy years. We saw this with the Reagan tax cuts. So we know the current tax code holds us back. So growth is going to help us bounce back over time. But that, alone, won't do it. You have to eliminate the special-interest deductions and exclusions and lobbyist loopholes in order to do that. That is why we are working so hard on simplifying the code, both on the business and the family side, so we can lower the rates for everybody. You've got to do both, growth and knock that underbrush of just special-interest provisions out of there."

      "utterance": "Yes, it is all accelerating. It all pivots off the budget. When the House and Senate, together, vote, sign, seal and deliver the budget, we will immediately move to committee action. I will lay out what is called the chairman's mark, which is the Ways and Means Committee comprehensive tax reform plan. We will do it immediately, listen, and begin committee action.

We are back with Dan Henninger, James Freeman, and columnist, Bill McGurn. So, James, this is the big test here in the post- Trump era. Ed Gillespie, I know him well. You guys know him well.

Didn't -- came up a little short at the end. But a very good campaigner, very savvy guy. I think for people who know him, what's exciting is the possibility that you get a guy who is not just a political expert, but has real intellectual horsepower.

It's not is not quite true that all Democrats are going to vote for Northam, because one of the issues in there is that, down in the southwest part of the state, which is coal country, Democrats down there are talking about voting for Gillespie. They think they have been abandoned by the Democratic Party, which now, instead of thinking about basically white people that work in coal mining, the Democrats are trying to assemble minority voters, and then that upper-class cosmopolitan vote in northern Virginia."

      "utterance": "That's 33 percent. The Girl Scouts are getting hit harder. But this is still terrible. And the Boy Scouts were looking around and said, how can we expand. This seems to be a natural way. But I don't think it's that simple. You also the media pieces and the spattering of lawsuits, and girls who said, why can I can't I do what my brother does. They learned, after getting beaten up about gay Scouts and transgender Scouts for years, I think they saw this as a compromise. You can let them in, but we're going to set things up on our terms."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

I don't think we can blame the Scouts. One of the things, one of the reason for this drop, the Scouts have been public enemy number one to a lot of left-wing groups that have pushed them off the public square."

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "-- gay Scouts issue, really because of the left's objection to anything that celebrates boys and masculinity. Let's face it, that's what it is. That's why the Girl Scouts are made. The Girl Scouts have gone down the social justice warrior path. And they are worried that maybe more traditional families might find the Boy Scouts more attractive. Look, it is just this war on boys and masculinity. We complain about guys like Harvey Weinstein, and that there's no character, and then we need those organizations that have been very good with trying to -- I think it's -- I think maybe the Scouts didn't have any choice, but it's sad."

    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Adam, to Bill's point, I've seen some writing since the move from the left and they are very critical of this. They're not giving the Boy Scouts a lot of credit somehow. And it does tend to reinforce Bill's point."

    {
      "speaker": "O'NEAL",
      "utterance": "They don't like the word \"Boy Scouts.\" And how long are we to keep that? Look, there are aspects of programs for boys that boys love. We're talking about computer programming, and at a time when we are trying to get kids off of their Xboxes and cell phones, there is something that comes. We have all been camping, learning some resilience and some things done as boys."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'NEAL",
      "utterance": "That's harder to say. I think the way that they've set it up in saying, if you don't want to have girls in your pack, in your troop, you don't have to. If they can keep that and they can stay strong on that, I think, internally, there will not be a ton of resistance. It doesn't hurt me if a girl gets to Eagle Scout. I think that's great. Most of the Eagle Scouts -- I called some of my friends. I was shocked at how my Eagle Scouts friends I have. They did not really care. They thought, that's fine, you know, when I explained that that's how it's going to be."

But Marvel comics has broken a prospective tie-in with Northrup Grumman, who make these high-tech planes and so forth. And why did they do that? Because some of Marvel Comic books' current fans, super hero fans on television, started a media campaign objecting to the fact that Marvel was connecting to a military contractor. What do these -- these people apparently think, Paul, all of the wars American fought were actually won by the Fantastic Four and Captain America. It's too much."

You can kind of forget when you look at what looks like a modern economy that it is still an old-fashioned Communist dictatorship. But they are reminding us by their demand that the government get ownership and board seats at some of the biggest, fastest-growing tech companies in China. They don't like that these sorts of private firms have gotten bigger than state-owned enterprises. And now Tony Soprano wants a piece."

He served as a combat medic in Laos with the Special Forces Unit, fighting the North Vietnamese. In 1970, he found himself in this horrible firefight, including the shooting down of his helicopter. He saved a lot of lives. So a big salute to Mr. Rose and the many Vietnam vets that fought beside him, and those who are alive today because of this good man."
