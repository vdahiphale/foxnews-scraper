      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\", this Friday night. What happened to Roger Stone, by the way, is a travesty. That needs to be thrown out, like yesterday. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Breaking now as we come on, 9:00 in the East, 6:00 in the West Coast -- we can confirm, FOX News can confirm a full-scale federal investigation into the origins of COVID-19 is now underway. That means investigators are now focused on a biological testing lab in Wuhan, China. That's the province where according to our own Bret Baier and his exclusive reporting, patient zero apparently contracted that virus from a bat. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Officials do not at this time believe the outbreak was linked to any kind of manmade biological weapons program. They're saying they do not believe the contamination was intentional, and instead, what Bret sources are reporting is that China was so desperate to compete with American scientists that the Wuhan lab cut corners, relaxed safety measures, and as a result, one of their workers was apparently, accidentally, they say, infected and then spread the highly contagious disease all throughout the province of Wuhan. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, in the days and the weeks that followed, this is where it gets even worse, China's government engaged in what is now a deadly cover-up to -- that led to widespread carnage all over the world. That U.K. study said 95 percent of those could've been prevented. What the Chinese Communist Party did is unforgivable. China erased data, doctors, scientists, they just disappeared, some frontline doctors tried to warn the world, they're dead from COVID-19. China shut down the city of Wuhan from all domestic travel. If you lived in China, you couldn't travel in and out of Wuhan. If you live in Wuhan, you couldn't travel anywhere else in China. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Think about this -- in what is a reckless, deadly act, China continued international flights to and from the city. They protected themselves, but not the rest of the world. If these reports are all true, you know what that means? The Communist Chinese government has blood on their hands, and must pay for this vile, inhumane conduct. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Two Republican lawmakers have now unveiled legislation that would allow Americans to sue China's government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, I'll take it a step further. The United States should now consider withholding all debt payments until we recoup our losses from China's deadly virus and reckless behavior. They protected themselves, nobody else. They knew how bad it was. Now, of course, China will never be able to repay the colossal loss of life, the indescribable suffering, sickness, death all over the globe that their actions cause. And the World Health Organization -- Health Organization, really? Well, they too have blood on their hands. It was a WHO, and its director general acting as a propaganda arm for the communist Chinese, and according to reports, actively, knowingly, helped China cover their tracks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the WHO might as well pack up and move to Beijing because it's not seeing another dime, should not see another dime from we, the American people. As long as President Trump is in office, I tend to think they won't. Here now with his -- he's the host of \"Special Report\", Bret Baier. All right. Bret, now, officials, what they are saying, they don't believe the outbreak was linked to any kind of manmade biological weapons program, according to your report. They don't believe the contamination was intentional. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do we know this for certain, or is there a possibility that it was manufactured? Is there a possibility the spread was intentional? You confirmed in your recording they protected their country, but they left the rest of this world get this virus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

OK, do it. Instead of demands, call testing companies, call thermometer companies, it's not that hard. I've already offered the Hannity plan what I think we should do to open New York City. That's the smallest geographical area, largest number of people, some days 11 plus million people there. Now, masks, gloves, temperature checks to get into any building.

Yankees, I talked to Randy Levine, one of their top executives today. It they will do anything that is asked of them, anything. They want to do it, and do it safely. They will work with the governor. They will work with the president. It they can open Citi Fields to the Mets. We can open the Meadowlands to the Jets and Giants. How do you do it? Well, here's my idea. Test all the employees who serve the public at these events. That means the players, the coaches, the trainers, the ticket takers, all food handlers. They've got to a positive COVID ID test. We can do that, thanks to Abbott. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Randy Levine rightly pointed out, I can report the Yankees will go all in and do whatever is needed to keep every fan safe. I'm sure every MLB team, every NFL team, every college team, they will do what's needed. They will do the right thing, they will follow the rules. If it means, OK, I want to go to the game, you got to put on a mask. It's not ideal. You can eat popcorn, but you can probably go like this and eat a -- take a bite of your hot dog and chew it with your mask on, and then take a straw and drink your beer. You'd probably do -- I would rather do that than stay home, myself. That's the Hannity plan. Now, Governor Cuomo, you don't have to do any of this, you have your opportunity, you are the governor. It if it's a good plan, I will support you. It's doable, inconvenient, it's thankfully, only temporary. Now, there are reports tonight of a group of liberal northeastern governors apparently working on a way to ignore the administration's reopening guidelines all while smearing the president who did more than anyone else. The biggest help, mobilization in the history of the world, that's what we are now living through. Now, by the way, got a lot of for say -- for having the travel ban quarantined, and then subsequent travel bans. If they want to go the governors alone, OK, you are right.

That's it. If you fail, at least fail in your terms. Again, the anti-Trump politicization in this, not helping anybody.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\", this Friday night. What happened to Roger Stone, by the way, is a travesty. That needs to be thrown out, like yesterday. Breaking now as we come on, 9:00 in the East, 6:00 in the West Coast -- we can confirm, FOX News can confirm a full-scale federal investigation into the origins of COVID-19 is now underway. That means investigators are now focused on a biological testing lab in Wuhan, China. That's the province where according to our own Bret Baier and his exclusive reporting, patient zero apparently contracted that virus from a bat. Officials do not at this time believe the outbreak was linked to any kind of manmade biological weapons program. They're saying they do not believe the contamination was intentional, and instead, what Bret sources are reporting is that China was so desperate to compete with American scientists that the Wuhan lab cut corners, relaxed safety measures, and as a result, one of their workers was apparently, accidentally, they say, infected and then spread the highly contagious disease all throughout the province of Wuhan. Now, in the days and the weeks that followed, this is where it gets even worse, China's government engaged in what is now a deadly cover-up to -- that led to widespread carnage all over the world. That U.K. study said 95 percent of those could've been prevented. What the Chinese Communist Party did is unforgivable. China erased data, doctors, scientists, they just disappeared, some frontline doctors tried to warn the world, they're dead from COVID-19. China shut down the city of Wuhan from all domestic travel. If you lived in China, you couldn't travel in and out of Wuhan. If you live in Wuhan, you couldn't travel anywhere else in China. Think about this -- in what is a reckless, deadly act, China continued international flights to and from the city. They protected themselves, but not the rest of the world. If these reports are all true, you know what that means? The Communist Chinese government has blood on their hands, and must pay for this vile, inhumane conduct. Two Republican lawmakers have now unveiled legislation that would allow Americans to sue China's government. Now, I'll take it a step further. The United States should now consider withholding all debt payments until we recoup our losses from China's deadly virus and reckless behavior. They protected themselves, nobody else. They knew how bad it was. Now, of course, China will never be able to repay the colossal loss of life, the indescribable suffering, sickness, death all over the globe that their actions cause. And the World Health Organization -- Health Organization, really? Well, they too have blood on their hands. It was a WHO, and its director general acting as a propaganda arm for the communist Chinese, and according to reports, actively, knowingly, helped China cover their tracks. Now, the WHO might as well pack up and move to Beijing because it's not seeing another dime, should not see another dime from we, the American people. As long as President Trump is in office, I tend to think they won't. Here now with his -- he's the host of \"Special Report\", Bret Baier. All right. Bret, now, officials, what they are saying, they don't believe the outbreak was linked to any kind of manmade biological weapons program, according to your report. They don't believe the contamination was intentional. Do we know this for certain, or is there a possibility that it was manufactured? Is there a possibility the spread was intentional? You confirmed in your recording they protected their country, but they left the rest of this world get this virus."

      "speaker": "BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, Sean, good evening. There is really zero confidence in people I've talked to, publicly that this was a man-made virus. It you heard it Tony Fauci ask this question in a way about the lab in the White House task force briefing tonight, he said there were a lot of studies that showed it was transmitted from animal to human and that it was not genetically altered. That match what our sources had said and what reported at the beginning, that they didn't think based on the structure of the genome of the virus that -- that it was man-made. Now, there are -- the thing that is inconclusive is exactly about the lab. But more and more dots, both open source and classified, point right to the lab. That's why we are increasing in confidence. What there is 100 percent confidence of, and we reported this, and now, more and more officials are saying it publicly, is the level and extent of the cover-up China went to, and part of those dots fit into why there is such a point at looking at this lab. Secretary Pompeo talking about it publicly today with Hugh Hewitt on the radio."

That's what our sources are saying. That's what matches some of the reports that were out from the University of South China and others, that there were author's to study the virus in the very lab. And basically that the non-manmade part is pointing specifically to the genetic mapping of this virus right now. And that it hopped from an animal to human, and it was not altered in its genetic sequence. That's what we get (ph)."

We need to know about their safety regulations. What we really need to know is something about patient zero who got this whole thing started. And I think that our country is getting a good lesson right now in Chinese propaganda. It exists to obfuscate the truth. Their regime security depends on it.

He says officials don't believe the outbreak links any kind of man-made bio weapons program. That might be provable because of the similarity sequence breakdown with SARS, also a coronavirus. And they don't believe it was intentional, but it certainly speaks volumes that they allowed no travel out of Wuhan into any other part of China, or no travel from China into Wuhan, but they let the travel out of Wuhan to the rest of the world. GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Yes, the story gets even worse, Sean, because China admitted for the first time that this disease was transmissible human to human, H2H, on January 20. But Doctors and Wuhan knew by the second week of December that it was H2H, which meant that Beijing knew about it just a few days later. And, you know, when you start to think about this, if China had said nothing about H2H for those five and a half, six weeks, that would've been irresponsible. But Beijing deliberately tried to tell the world there was no H2H, and they enlisted the World Health Organization in that, which means, people around the world, health officials around the world were lulled into not taking precautions that they otherwise would have adopted because of the deliberate falsification from Beijing, which was amplified by the WHO."

And if, in fact, he wanted to deliberately spread this, he would have done exactly what in fact he did. So, that's the only explanation that I can come up with."

They obfuscated the truth, lots of propaganda and disinformation, all designed to ensure that they would remain in power.

OK, Mao, China, communism, fascism, Nazism, and Imperial Japan, the killing fields, Cambodia, (INAUDIBLE) over 100 million humans killed in the last century. You don't think evil happens? It does, sadly. It's sick, it's ugly. It is repulsive. We need to get the truth. Now, some positive developments, if we can say anything is positive surrounding our country's fight against COVID-19. Researchers at Stanford University, they were combing the local population there to find residents with antibodies. Remember, two weeks ago, we didn't have the antibody tests. Now, we have millions of them thanks to Abbott. Now, they discovered that the infection rate may be 85 times higher than reported. In other words, a significant amount of the population may have been exposed without getting sick enough to report symptoms. That would suggest, again, we are looking at the numbers here, exponentially the possibility that the death rate could be as low, or even lower than the seasonal flu. We'll continue to monitor, time will tell. Now, the situation in New York continues, thankfully, to improve. Hospitalizations have now declined for the fourth straight day. That graph has been what we are hoping for, leveling, falling off, now we're looking for the precipitous drop. Incubations are also on the decline, that continues. The death rate appears to have flattened, and thanks to the president's numerous actions, New York never ran data ventilators, never ran out of hospital beds. Received millions and millions of masks, and gloves, and gowns, and shields from the federal stockpile. The USNS Comfort, the emergency 3,000-bed hospital at the Javits Center are still operational. Both were modified to accept COVID-19 patients, not an easy task to change the ventilation system. All workers in both the facilities were manned by our great military, at the request of the president, to help out New York and New Jersey. Also at the direction of the president, the federal government directed what amounted to a massive amount of resources to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut. And in spite of -- well, my efforts, I've been trying to bridge the gap between the governor of New York and the president, clearly it's not going to work. It's not happening. Today, Governor Cuomo is complaining, I need, I need, I need. Why doesn't he make this call private? Governor Cuomo, make the calls request privately. You do that, he's given you all this stuff, you are provoking a fight. It's not good. You got to save the people of New York. Watch."

He said 11 times, I don't want to get involved in testing, it's too complicated, it's too hard. No one can take the posture, we'll just say thank you for what I've done and I'm now out.

Ask for help rightly, especially since he told me yesterday, he delivered it big time for New York. If he keeps using these press sessions as public venting sessions and demand sessions from everything from the federal government, this relationship is not going to work. I'm trying to be a peacemaker here. Now, why couldn't he just say he's working with the federal government to get more testing and other resources? Because it's not as simple as snapping your fingers, I need 1,000 ventilators. He said the president does respond quickly every single time, all the things he wanted, they've all asked for the decision to -- they want to make them themselves -- OK. The president gave it to you. Then you can't demand that the present do anything when you got what you wanted. You are in charge. Governor Cuomo wants to be in charge of reopening his state. OK, do it. Instead of demands, call testing companies, call thermometer companies, it's not that hard. I've already offered the Hannity plan what I think we should do to open New York City. That's the smallest geographical area, largest number of people, some days 11 plus million people there. Now, masks, gloves, temperature checks to get into any building. Wearing a mask in the building, half the workforce should continue to work remotely, from home, so you have more social distancing in every New York City building. Also, open -- let's think about reopening -- you see that, that's Yankee stadium. Yankees, I talked to Randy Levine, one of their top executives today. It they will do anything that is asked of them, anything. They want to do it, and do it safely. They will work with the governor. They will work with the president. It they can open Citi Fields to the Mets. We can open the Meadowlands to the Jets and Giants. How do you do it? Well, here's my idea. Test all the employees who serve the public at these events. That means the players, the coaches, the trainers, the ticket takers, all food handlers. They've got to a positive COVID ID test. We can do that, thanks to Abbott. Now, Randy Levine rightly pointed out, I can report the Yankees will go all in and do whatever is needed to keep every fan safe. I'm sure every MLB team, every NFL team, every college team, they will do what's needed. They will do the right thing, they will follow the rules. If it means, OK, I want to go to the game, you got to put on a mask. It's not ideal. You can eat popcorn, but you can probably go like this and eat a -- take a bite of your hot dog and chew it with your mask on, and then take a straw and drink your beer. You'd probably do -- I would rather do that than stay home, myself. That's the Hannity plan. Now, Governor Cuomo, you don't have to do any of this, you have your opportunity, you are the governor. It if it's a good plan, I will support you. It's doable, inconvenient, it's thankfully, only temporary. Now, there are reports tonight of a group of liberal northeastern governors apparently working on a way to ignore the administration's reopening guidelines all while smearing the president who did more than anyone else. The biggest help, mobilization in the history of the world, that's what we are now living through. Now, by the way, got a lot of for say -- for having the travel ban quarantined, and then subsequent travel bans. If they want to go the governors alone, OK, you are right. There's the 10th Amendment, good luck. Your bat, your ball, and as somebody said to me early in my career, you've got to decide, you can do it the way the experts or the researchers tell you, or you can do it your way, your bat, your ball, your ass. That's it. If you fail, at least fail in your terms. Again, the anti-Trump politicization in this, not helping anybody. What thing that can happen is cities that were in debt, that were running deficits, before all of this, don't ask the American taxpayers to bail you out of your reckless and irresponsible spending. And to Republicans in Washington, I have a message for you tonight. COVID- 19 spending bills only. That's it. No more money for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, Kennedy Performing Arts Center, no changes in voting laws or immigration laws, health workers that need money. Hospitals that need whatever they need. Help small business and big business, that's it. That's a big enough task. Also, for all of you in Washington, time to turn around and get your rear ends back in Washington, D.C. That means the House and the Senate, go to work. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are fed up with her governors. Look at Michigan, protests erupting against Governor Whitmer, because, why, issuing lockdown orders. You're preventing residents from visiting their own family members, cutting their own grass, buying seeds, fishing? You can't be any more socially distant than fishing. So, how did Whitmer respond? Oh, she goes on conspiracy TV, Roswell Rachel Maddow show and it's sort of like an out-of-control tyrant vowing vengeance, how dare they protest against me. People should be allowed to cut the lawn and fish. It should be a rule. Take a look."
