They've even said that the Chinese Communist government quashed the scientific community, made them destroy lab samples, lied to the WHO about how contagious this was, and then smeared the U.S. military for planting this virus in China.

There is a dynamic that's going on with the press and the president where the president will say we don't know if it's going to work, we don't know if it's not going to work, drugs, the recovery, vaccine or anything. But I'm optimistic about it and I have hope. And then the press says, you are giving the American people false hope by being hopeful. How do you explain that?"

And sometimes you make a mistake here and you correct it quickly but there is actually good news on the drug and treatment front. But you don't want to run on the drugs which is why you always have to be cautious about what you are saying. I looked at the research, there is research out there on this antimalarial drug that is promising. So, that's good news. And we're seeing unity on all fronts that people who don't normally unite. You're seeing mistakes corrected, you've seen people looking forward and not backward. And the upside I think that, you know, I'm thinking a lot about this economic problem. It's artificial, noncyclical, it's unnatural which means we created it through this shutdown, and we can uncreate it. Now the negative part for me as if we go too far into it, it's going to be harder to climb back out. I have -- I'm confident that it will roar back but overall, if we continue -- this is not -- it's wrong to accuse people of being insensitive if they are worried about the economy because the economy affects 340 million people."

And I think right now we bought ourselves time. I think we did a great job slowing the spread, but we now must consider the ramifications of extending this kind of shut down for long periods of time. I don't want to have -- guess what I'm saying is I don't want to have lasting damage that might really, really harm people. I'm hoping that we pull back and we can get back on our feet."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

Juan, it's a very tough balance to strike and the governors of California and New York they've taken matters into their own hands because those are the two real hot spots right now for the virus. They are calling for a full-on shutdown for the foreseeable future, a week or two weeks, we don't know. Where does the rest of the country respond?

      "utterance": "I think the president even had praise for Governor Newsom of California and Governor Cuomo of New York and being proactive and I think we are seeing a lot of proactive steps being taken by local leadership. But to your point, you know, we got to, you know, sort of get back on the saddle and ride the horse. The problem is Dr. Fauci said today, it's not going to be a matter of two weeks, it's going to be several weeks or possibly a month. I don't know how. You know, it's hard to somehow say, well, here's how we make sense of this because you don't want people to get sick and you can't take the risk of having a rapid spread. This week what we seen in Italy has just been devastating. So, there's a real health issue. But I would say that, you know, I think the president is now taking it seriously. I saw today poll numbers that show his approval rating in terms of people saying he's doing a better job of handling the coronavirus is now a majority to the American people. So, from my perspective he's taking this seriously. Now the pivot has been made and I think the American people appreciate it, from my perspective I wish he might have done it a little sooner. But he's done it. And I think that once we have confidence in our leadership, I think it's then, it's not that we can lay out the road map at this juncture but I think we are such a proactive and self-reliant people. That's our nature as Americans. We can make this happen. Just don't fall -- don't fall into your cups and start crying. You might sigh like me a little bit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Dana, to Juan's point, I mean there has been a pivot from in tone and in aggressive action from the White House. It's hard to say how far you push it and that's really the balancing act that they have to deliver on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And it's hard for us to -- it's hard for me I should say, to comment on it, because we don't have the full information. Dr. Fauci on Bill Hemmer show today said that they are briefing the president every single day. They have a lot more information than we do. However, I do think they are giving as much information to us as they possibly can. I mean, two-hour briefings every day that's like almost unheard of. So, we're getting a lot of information. But we don't have the full perspective. And we know that next week is going to be tough. It's going to be really tough because that's -- now if you are working from home and now your kids are there at the second week and like the first week is a little bit of a novelty and everyone is figuring it out, the second week it could be like, OK. Mom, can you stop being so loud when you are on your conference call? The dogs are annoying, everybody -- like everyone is going to get tired. But also, we know because there's more testing, the numbers are going to go up, we're going to see hospitalizations, we're going to see some increase in numbers. So, I think that the White House, you know, in terms of preparing everybody for another rough week on the health side is something. To the point Greg was making on the economy, it's not something that we are going solve here on The Five. There are really smart people in Washington, in New York, and across the country trying to figure this out, but you cannot have the country not go back to work for seven months."

But I don't think he was saying that you are going to have to stay in your homes for seven months, that wasn't the intention. This initial 15-day period is to try to do what we need to do which is to flatten the curve so it's for a longer period of time, so that we look more like South Korea and not Italy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

So, there are estimates that about 60,000 of their homeless population would be infected with this, 12,000 of which will require hospital beds. And that's the kind of population, to your point, Jesse, that they can't -- they don't really engage in those mitigation fundamental things that we're all doing, like hand washing and social distancing. So that's the kind of thing that could really lead to an eruption that Seattle also has a similar problem too. And to your guy's point about the economy, the biggest thing I am seeing here in Seattle is a decimation of the businesses."

California averages 2,000 a day, yesterday they saw 80,000. And just in terms of kind of a quick specificity on this, the restaurant industry that's a $900 billion industry. So, for the criticisms we're hearing of the GOP's stimulus bill from the Democrats saying, look, it's all about the corporations not the worker, what does it matter if you invest in an individual if there is no job for them to return to? Tis is literally 5 percent of our GDP that we need to keep afloat somehow."

What do you think?"

He sold the least amount of stock. Feinstein says, you know what, it was a blind trust, it was my husband's doing. I wasn't even at the briefing on the virus either and it was just one company. But it was $6 million in a biotech company, we don't really know much else about that that. Now Loeffler, her husband is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange."

She bought a stock which benefits from a software that helps teleworking. People that work from home. It doesn't look very good. Perfectly timed. Also perfectly timed, Richard Burr liquidated almost his entire portfolio. And he has all the intel because he is the top intel guy on the Senate and he was telling people privately that this pandemic was going to be as bad as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Also perfectly timed it right for the market dropped and he said, well, I traded it before because I saw some news on CNBC.

The top two are the worst and Senator Burr is the worst by far. It's worse than Loeffler and here's why. Because his reported net worth two years ago was 1.7 million. And as you just said he sold off between 600,000 and 1.7 million. So nearly all of his reported net worth, and of course, the disparity between his public and his private comments and his vote in 2012 against a rule in Congress banning insider trading --"

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, the media is a narrative- driven industry and the fact is most narratives aren't true. Because in order to create a story you have to -- you have to play with things and you shape it into something that's interesting. And sometimes I don't even believe they are aware that they are doing it. The problem is now the people just want facts and they want hope. So, this narrative that they are now shifting to was created by clever editors who were removed from the reality on the street. So, they actually I don't even know the harm that they are doing. So, like and I would even include like we are all getting paychecks right now. The media is -- the media is not going to suffer through this. No matter what happens out there we'll going to get our paychecks. And I think -- that's why it's like, their narratives about China have little effect on their jobs. It's not going to hurt them. But it may hurt other people who are going to be out of work and struggling in the next two weeks. And I think we have to start thinking about those people and the kinds of stories that will help them. If that makes sense."

But this is what I would say to journalists everywhere. And I think they're instinctively think to do this, don't always look here in America for the story. Look there. Look to help the Chinese journalists who are trying to figure out a way to get around the censors because they care about their citizens. It's not the Chinese people themselves."

I mean, Dana said it right. They forced labor to fight this virus. They use their surveillance state to invade people's privacy and facial recognition technology to monitor where it went. They held people at gunpoint in quarantine in a city of 11 million people. So, if the U.S. media wants to praise that, I mean, fine, but that's crazy. And Dana's point, again, is accurate. If you just read the media in the United States' own reporting on China, why don't they listen to their own reporting. They've even said that the Chinese Communist government quashed the scientific community, made them destroy lab samples, lied to the WHO about how contagious this was, and then smeared the U.S. military for planting this virus in China. And now they're just showering the rest of the world with propaganda and soft money to separate the word virus from China. It's so clear. I just -- I don't know why, as Greg said, why they didn't see that they're being used by the Chinese government."

But it doesn't take away from the damage that they've done. I mean, as we sit here this Friday afternoon, we don't know so much about how this started, how many people were infected. We don't know about treatment plans, we -- you know, and they could be providing us with data that would help us in our struggle going on right now. They're not dealing with us in that way. I think they're trying to again improve their image here in places like Africa, but it's -- and even in Europe, but they're not being straight to this moment. And so, to my mind, I think it would be good if they somehow were to change. I find it very frustrating to deal with the Chinese government in all circumstances, but right now, I think they're a threat to all of our health."
