      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, you may have seen was arrested this morning in London, dragged from his longtime refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy there and thrown into a police pen. Assange's arrest is a remarkable new development in a long and fascinating story. One that tells you a lot about our leaders and their priorities. We will have that story for you in just a minute. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first tonight for details on what exactly happened to Assange today, we're joined by Fox's chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The indictment alleges that Assange engaged in a bride conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army to access classified information on Defense Department computers. WikiLeaks eventually posted thousands of classified defense and State Department records. Assange's lawyer issued a statement this morning defending his client as a reporter and publisher quote, \"The U.K. courts will need to resolve what appears to be an unprecedented effort by the United States seeking to extradite a foreign journalist to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Former U.S. government officials and legal experts predict a protracted legal battle for Assange and the Justice Department over a host of issues including extradition that may go well beyond the Trump presidency, Tucker.",

      "sentences": "Thanks a lot, Catherine, for that summation. Appreciate it. Well, if you watch a lot of the coverage of this story today on television, you likely came away with the understanding that Julian Assange is some kind of Russian spy who is in trouble tonight because he stole classified documents from the U.S. government. That is not true. It's factually incorrect and saying so it's not a defense of Assange, we're not here to promote him or excuse any number of things he said over the years that we disagree with quite a lot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But just so it's clear, whatever his sins, Assange did not steal documents from the United States government. He did not hacked the DNC servers. He didn't break into John Podesta's Gmail account. There is no proof that he is working for the Russian government or ever has worked for the Russian government. Assange has never been charged with any of that and wasn't today, no matter what they tell you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you're upset about the theft of classified documents from the U.S. government, and there is reason to be, we already know who did that. A 22- year-old army private named Bradley Manning, now called Chelsea Manning. In 2013, Manning pleaded guilty to stealing secret material and got 35 years in prison for it. Shortly after that Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence, this allowed Manning to leave jail decades early, go back on television as a commentator, and then run for political office. So if your real concern is America's national security, you have someone to be angry at -- Barack Obama. And yet strangely, nobody is. Instead they're furious at Julian Assange for printing the documents that other people stole. Quote, \"Julian Assange has long been a wicked tool of Vladimir Putin and the Russian intelligence services,\" wrote professional moralizer Ben Sasse who also serves in the U.S. Senate. \"He deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.\" Wicked? The rest of his life in prison? Idi Amin ate people and never faced this kind of scorn. Not even close, nor for the record was Amin ever extradited. He died at 78 years old in his own bed leaving behind 43 loving children. So what's going on here? A couple of things. First, Julian Assange embarrassed virtually everyone in power in Washington. He published documents that undermined the official story on the Iraq War and Afghanistan. He got Debbie Wasserman-Schultz fired from the DNC. He humiliated Hillary Clinton by showing that the Democratic primaries were in fact rigged. Pretty much everyone in Washington has reason to hate Julian Assange. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Rather than just admit that straightforwardly, he made us look like buffoons, so now we're sending him to prison. Instead, they're denouncing him as, you guessed it, a Russian agent. Watch Senator Richard Blumenthal explain.",

But that has not stopped virtually every politician in Washington from repeating Senator Blumenthal's line including many Republicans. Robert Mueller nearly killed the Russia collusion hoax. Julian Assange is allowing them to keep it alive. You think journalists would say something about this. Assange is after all, one of them. What do you call a man who publishes news for a living?

But that was before the Trump election and the total war that followed, a war in which the media have definitively chosen a side. Press Freedom? Sure, as long as we agree with your politics. The First Amendment? Well, that all depends, who did you vote for? The guardians of speech or now the enemies of speech. The people charged with policing power are now colluding with power. There's a reason you see John Brennan on NBC all the time. They're all on the same team now. We're not saying any of this to defend Julian Assange.

Lawmakers and the public have been asking a lot of serious questions about what they let you say on the platform, and the posts they let you see on the platform. In response to that pushback, Facebook has come up with a new idea that heads in a totally wrong direction. It wants the government to step in and start policing your online speech for it and look, outsourcing government censorship -- outsourcing censorship to the government isn't just a bad idea, it's a violation of the First Amendment, so I'm a no on that.",

You hear it from lawmakers and journalists and economists and college professors. They tell us we need massive amounts of immigration to replace the children that Americans aren't having. For some reason, this is always taken as an immutable fact. Americans just don't want to have kids or they can't have kids. We need more abortion to assure they don't have kids. Well, here's something no one ever says, but it's worth suggesting. Why aren't we trying to help American citizens have kids? It's not that they don't want them, they want them. They want to be having more than they're having. According to Gallup polling, the average American wants about three kids in a family. That figure is actually higher than it was 30 years ago. People are more pro-children than they were. The average American woman, though, is having fewer than two kids. Among those who reach their 40s without having any children, more than half regret it and wish they'd had at least one child. So why isn't government trying to help Americans have the one thing they really want, which is children? It's not impossible. There are a lot of ways they could do that. Deflate the student loan bubble, reduce housing prices so young people can actually buy a home, give big tax cuts to bigger families so that middle class couples feel secure about having a third or fourth child. Other countries do it. It's not crazy. Is there anything more important? If so, what is it? But none of this occurs to anybody in Washington. They look at an America where citizens are broke and depressed and killing themselves at record levels and therefore failing to reproduce the species. And they see only one option, only one answer to that. Import new children from Honduras and Bangladesh to satisfy the labor needs of Silicon Valley, big Ag and private equity. And by the way, if you disagree with that, you're the immoral one. Well, not so long ago, it was considered normal for Americans to like America, why else would they be here? Imagine that. Now thinking that gets you denounced as a bigot, a xenophobe, a white nationalist, whatever that is. There's a new view in Washington. It has a simple ethos recently expressed by President Obama's former Attorney General, Eric Holder, \"America was never a great country.\"",

Ten years ago, the student loan industry was nationalized under Barack Obama. Almost all loans now come from the Feds. If we want to fix this problem, government action is necessary, but don't get your hopes up. Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California chairs the House Financial Services Committee.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, you may have seen was arrested this morning in London, dragged from his longtime refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy there and thrown into a police pen. Assange's arrest is a remarkable new development in a long and fascinating story. One that tells you a lot about our leaders and their priorities. We will have that story for you in just a minute. But first tonight for details on what exactly happened to Assange today, we're joined by Fox's chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, thanks, Tucker. This seven-page Virginia indictment was filed in March 2018 and unsealed earlier today as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested in London after Ecuador withdrew asylum. Assange spent seven years in their embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation. The indictment alleges that Assange engaged in a bride conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army to access classified information on Defense Department computers. WikiLeaks eventually posted thousands of classified defense and State Department records. Assange's lawyer issued a statement this morning defending his client as a reporter and publisher quote, \"The U.K. courts will need to resolve what appears to be an unprecedented effort by the United States seeking to extradite a foreign journalist to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information.\" Former U.S. government officials and legal experts predict a protracted legal battle for Assange and the Justice Department over a host of issues including extradition that may go well beyond the Trump presidency, Tucker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Thanks a lot, Catherine, for that summation. Appreciate it. Well, if you watch a lot of the coverage of this story today on television, you likely came away with the understanding that Julian Assange is some kind of Russian spy who is in trouble tonight because he stole classified documents from the U.S. government. That is not true. It's factually incorrect and saying so it's not a defense of Assange, we're not here to promote him or excuse any number of things he said over the years that we disagree with quite a lot. But just so it's clear, whatever his sins, Assange did not steal documents from the United States government. He did not hacked the DNC servers. He didn't break into John Podesta's Gmail account. There is no proof that he is working for the Russian government or ever has worked for the Russian government. Assange has never been charged with any of that and wasn't today, no matter what they tell you. If you're upset about the theft of classified documents from the U.S. government, and there is reason to be, we already know who did that. A 22- year-old army private named Bradley Manning, now called Chelsea Manning. In 2013, Manning pleaded guilty to stealing secret material and got 35 years in prison for it. Shortly after that Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence, this allowed Manning to leave jail decades early, go back on television as a commentator, and then run for political office. So if your real concern is America's national security, you have someone to be angry at -- Barack Obama. And yet strangely, nobody is. Instead they're furious at Julian Assange for printing the documents that other people stole. Quote, \"Julian Assange has long been a wicked tool of Vladimir Putin and the Russian intelligence services,\" wrote professional moralizer Ben Sasse who also serves in the U.S. Senate. \"He deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.\" Wicked? The rest of his life in prison? Idi Amin ate people and never faced this kind of scorn. Not even close, nor for the record was Amin ever extradited. He died at 78 years old in his own bed leaving behind 43 loving children. So what's going on here? A couple of things. First, Julian Assange embarrassed virtually everyone in power in Washington. He published documents that undermined the official story on the Iraq War and Afghanistan. He got Debbie Wasserman-Schultz fired from the DNC. He humiliated Hillary Clinton by showing that the Democratic primaries were in fact rigged. Pretty much everyone in Washington has reason to hate Julian Assange. Rather than just admit that straightforwardly, he made us look like buffoons, so now we're sending him to prison. Instead, they're denouncing him as, you guessed it, a Russian agent. Watch Senator Richard Blumenthal explain."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Okay, so once again, just to be totally clear, no one has ever shown that Julian Assange is a Russian agent. The indictment against him today does not say that, it doesn't mention Russia at all. But that has not stopped virtually every politician in Washington from repeating Senator Blumenthal's line including many Republicans. Robert Mueller nearly killed the Russia collusion hoax. Julian Assange is allowing them to keep it alive. You think journalists would say something about this. Assange is after all, one of them. What do you call a man who publishes news for a living? Assange is no sleazier than many journalists in Washington, he's definitely not more anti-American. He's broken stories the \"New York Times\" would have won Pulitzers for, and yet many of his colleagues have disowned him. \"Oh, please,\" wrote Alexia Campbell of Vox, \"Assange is no journalist. We know who he works for,\" meaning Russia. \"Julian Assange is not a journalist,\" explained Jelani Cobb of \"The New Yorker\" without actually explaining. Ken Dilanian of NBC who doesn't so much cover the national security state as he write memos on its behalf noted that quote, \"Many believe that if Assange ever was a journalist, those days ended a long time ago.\" At NBC when they tell you many believe something, it means they believe it. So why all the hostility to Julian Assange? Well, we'll let former Democratic staffer and current CNN anchor Jim Sciutto explain. Assange's real sin was preventing Hillary Clinton from becoming President."

      "speaker": "JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "He is central to several cases. He is central to Russian interference in the election. The U.S. intelligence views him as a middleman, a cutout that he was in effect part of this interference. He's central to questions about what the Trump administration or Trump campaign, I should say, knew prior to the release of those materials, right? What were the communications between Roger Stone, et cetera? It's possible that this has something President Trump himself is not particularly excited about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's remarkable to watch this. It's bewildering actually. There was a time not so long ago, really when reporters didn't applaud the arrest of other journalists for publishing information. In 1971, \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" published a trove of stolen classified documents about the Vietnam War. It was called the Pentagon Papers. Remember that? Liberals loved it. Books were written celebrating their bravery. As recently as 2011, \"The Washington Post\" saw the connection, quote, \"A conviction of Julian Assange would also cause collateral damage to American media freedoms.\" A post op-ed said that year, quote, \"It is difficult to distinguish Assange or Wikileaks from \"The Washington Post.\" And that's true. But that was before the Trump election and the total war that followed, a war in which the media have definitively chosen a side. Press Freedom? Sure, as long as we agree with your politics. The First Amendment? Well, that all depends, who did you vote for? The guardians of speech or now the enemies of speech. The people charged with policing power are now colluding with power. There's a reason you see John Brennan on NBC all the time. They're all on the same team now. We're not saying any of this to defend Julian Assange. We just want to be absolutely clear about who hurts this country more, and it's not him. Author and columnist, Mark Steyn joins us tonight. Mark, thanks a lot for coming on. Whatever you think of Julian Assange or the material that he published, is it a little strange to see journalists who laud \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" for publishing stolen classified documents during Vietnam applaud his imprisonment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, Tucker. I mean, I agree 100 percent with what you've just said, but I hadn't seen that Jim Sciutto CNN clip, and I'm shocked at the idea that because he thinks somehow Julian Assange knows something about the Trump campaign in 2016 that gives the U.S. government the right to demand that London extradite an Australian to Washington to go to jail. I mean, even if you take everything that Jim Sciutto said as true, there is absolutely no -- there is absolutely no basis for what the government is proposing to do to Assange, except that he made everyone in Washington look like chumps."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Is it a little odd to have a former Democratic official who worked in the Obama administration now on CNN with a microphone, telling us that we're immoral if we don't believe the pronouncements of the permanent bureaucracy here in Washington. Does it seem like an inside game a little bit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think so. I think this is all an inside game. It's the duty -- basically, it's the duty of the government to keep its secrets, and if the most lavishly funded, quote, unquote, \"intelligence community\" on the planet, can't keep it secrets, the idea that it has the right to go to war against the people who publish those secrets is something that as you said, 20, 30, 40 years ago, the press would be up in arms about. Now, to see the American media serving as lickspittles of the Deep State is a deeply bizarre transformation. This is basically -- the stuff that Julian Assange published, this indictment is extremely weak. The idea that he somehow goaded and encouraged Manning to steal this stuff. The line he used was -- Manning tells Assange, \"That's all I've got left to give to you.\" And Assange says, \"Curious is never run dry in my experience.\" The idea that a corrupt Federal criminal justice system could extradite and convict him a man on the basis of those words, or to disturb every American, actually, anyone who believes in liberty."

If this was a real and if this was an intelligent intelligence community, Bradley Manning - Chelsea Manning wouldn't been able to walk out with all that stuff, just download it and take it out. There are four million people with top secret intelligence clearances in this country. That's a population the size of New Zealand. If you gave top secret clearances to four million people, you're not that intelligent an intelligence community in the first place."

      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "No and you shouldn't feel safe and just -- I listened to Blumenthal and/or Ben Sasse saying this guy should be going to jail forever. Americans flip it the other way around. Americans would be up in arms if the government of Australia were demanding that London extradite a U.S. citizen to Australia for publishing Australian intelligence secrets.

The indictment says Stormy's former lawyer also took another client's $2.5 million settlement and bought a private jet. Yesterday that plane was seized. And so the man who had his eyes on the White House may have to settle for the big house. If convicted, Stormy's former lawyer is looking at 333 years in prison. Good behavior, maybe he's out in 100 and his response to all this is quoting, \"For 20 years, I have represented Davids versus Goliaths and relied on due process and our system of justice. Along the way, I had made many powerful enemies, I am entitled to a full presumption of innocence, and I am confident that justice will be done once all the facts are known.\" But don't forget, that's just his West Coast David versus Goliath battle.

Now, to most people that seems insane and to female athletes, it is of course grossly unfair. But now it's orthodoxy. Science and common sense are irrelevant, the orthodox will not be questioned.

      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "I think there's a long-term effect. First of all, puberty blockers which you start with like an anti-estrogen or an anti-androgen that followed by hormone therapy as they enter adolescence can lead to neurological problems, problems with bone growth and sterility later on. So that's just the physical issues. There's also the psychological impact and the neurological impact of having to transition someone that may decide later on that they want to go back the other way. Of course, we should support transgender children. Of course, we should support a child's choice, and that's what the American Academy of Pediatrics says. But when they talk about giving these drugs, these hormones, I get very nervous. And I think to myself, \"Who is super imposing their will here? Is it doctors or is it parents?\" Because again, a child is someone that I want to watch develop? There's no reason to be questioning sexuality and sexual choice in a nine-year-old. We have to wait and see which way it goes."

      "utterance": "Well, 1,100 adults wrote a letter saying, \"We don't agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics,\" and by the way, your point about Munchausen by proxy, I think is excellent because I think parents have guilt. They think, \"Wait a minute, maybe I'm not doing enough. Maybe we really aren't going --\" This is our culture now, right? We have to listen to every word.

Doctors are varied on this issue, and I think a lot of doctors would agree with me, \"Do no harm.\" We are not dealing with a disease, we're dealing with a developing child. Let them develop, support their psychological development. And by the way, to your earlier point, when we're talking about athletics, I believe it's a competitive advantage to allow someone that is born a male, and then -- and had all these years of testosterone building up muscle, right, building up bone and then we allow them to compete with women -- that's giving them a competitive advantage.

I can tell you this that the Fraternal Order of Police, three months -- two months ago brought a plan to the Superintendent about linking police officers with churches and we are trying to mend fences. We are trying to get out in the community to make sure that there is direct community and police involvement. We're the ones that are doing that. We're the ones that are trying to make sure that people have confidence in the police and know that we're going to be there and protect them.

There's going to be problems with recruiting and they're going to wind up lowering the standards, and then they're going to have more problems. So you know, it is going to be a Catch 22. And so the city and the Police Department need to work with the FOP to try and make sure that the people in the City of Chicago are protected. And they really need to get on board with us and make sure that we can protect the people of the city, and that seems to have been falling by the wayside, certainly at operation push with Congressman Bobby Rush."

So if you think about it, Facebook has been under mounting scrutiny recently for a number of its practices -- how it protects your online data, how it shares that data, and most directly now, how it moderates online speech. Lawmakers and the public have been asking a lot of serious questions about what they let you say on the platform, and the posts they let you see on the platform. In response to that pushback, Facebook has come up with a new idea that heads in a totally wrong direction. It wants the government to step in and start policing your online speech for it and look, outsourcing government censorship -- outsourcing censorship to the government isn't just a bad idea, it's a violation of the First Amendment, so I'm a no on that."

And their job is just to let people say what they want as long as it's not illegal, they're not selling drugs, right? Or guns or peddling kiddie porn? Why don't we go back to that?"

It's invited regimes, not just the government here in the U.S., but abroad to step in and start shutting down ideas that it doesn't like under the rubric of it being harmful speech. One example that Mark Zuckerberg gave was speech on immigration. He said that speech on a divisive political issue, and if you're online advocating an issue position on immigration, the government should start regulating that speech. And look, Mark Zuckerberg has a very loud platform, a big platform to express his own views on immigration and hot button issues."

For some reason, this is always taken as an immutable fact. Americans just don't want to have kids or they can't have kids. We need more abortion to assure they don't have kids. Well, here's something no one ever says, but it's worth suggesting. Why aren't we trying to help American citizens have kids? It's not that they don't want them, they want them. They want to be having more than they're having. According to Gallup polling, the average American wants about three kids in a family. That figure is actually higher than it was 30 years ago. People are more pro-children than they were. The average American woman, though, is having fewer than two kids. Among those who reach their 40s without having any children, more than half regret it and wish they'd had at least one child. So why isn't government trying to help Americans have the one thing they really want, which is children? It's not impossible. There are a lot of ways they could do that. Deflate the student loan bubble, reduce housing prices so young people can actually buy a home, give big tax cuts to bigger families so that middle class couples feel secure about having a third or fourth child. Other countries do it. It's not crazy. Is there anything more important? If so, what is it? But none of this occurs to anybody in Washington. They look at an America where citizens are broke and depressed and killing themselves at record levels and therefore failing to reproduce the species. And they see only one option, only one answer to that. Import new children from Honduras and Bangladesh to satisfy the labor needs of Silicon Valley, big Ag and private equity. And by the way, if you disagree with that, you're the immoral one. Well, not so long ago, it was considered normal for Americans to like America, why else would they be here? Imagine that. Now thinking that gets you denounced as a bigot, a xenophobe, a white nationalist, whatever that is. There's a new view in Washington. It has a simple ethos recently expressed by President Obama's former Attorney General, Eric Holder, \"America was never a great country.\""

I mean, it's incredible to me. You said earlier in the show, 20 years ago, if you said America is great, you might get a fist bump. Just to give you some perspective as to how fast things are tumbling out of control. You know, I was in college, probably -- I was in college not even 10 years ago and you could say -- I was at a very liberal school, probably one of the most liberal in the country. You could still chant \"USA, USA\" at parties. You could still even fly your colors. You can't do that anymore. I mean, you do that, they're going to come after you. They're going to try to hang you in the streets for that."

And I came to the conclusion that it was the latter when they started calling me a white nationalist. There's some logistical problems there."

And it's really cynical because you have someone who is a Trump supporter or maybe, you know, actually who has got and wears the \"Make America Great Again\" hat. I mean, Hillary Clinton says the Make America Great Again is a white nationalist slogan and she never lies. So I mean, that's -- but you tell someone your neighbor is a white nationalist, that starts to be -- then you start to say, \"Okay, well, you know, I don't want to be around that person.\" And it really divides the country when you think you are living amongst white supremacist and white nationalists and Nazis.

Now a lot of their money goes to paying off tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. Colleges benefit greatly from this, but the loans come from the U.S. government. Ten years ago, the student loan industry was nationalized under Barack Obama. Almost all loans now come from the Feds. If we want to fix this problem, government action is necessary, but don't get your hopes up. Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California chairs the House Financial Services Committee. She is the top financial regulator in the entire U.S. House of Representatives. Yesterday, Waters revealed that she didn't know the government control student lending. Watch this."
