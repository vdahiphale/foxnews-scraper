      "sentences": "Jesse, good afternoon to you. You know we sort of saw that the writing was on the wall two few days ago when the president was asked about this as he was walking across the south lawn after talking to the press on his way to the helicopter as he was traveling to Indianapolis for his first tax reform speech. The president was asked are you going to fire Tom Price, and he paused for a second and he turned over his shoulder and he said, we'll see. And he just had that look like I'm angry at this person, and the, we'll see, was, you betcha, just not today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as the president was leaving this afternoon to head up to Bedminster, New Jersey, he was asked a lot about Tom Price, it was clear that he was very, very angry and upset over what Price had that done in terms of taking those charter flights because now the figure, I believe, is up over a million dollars for the cost of the flights that he took. He says it's out of keeping with the tone and tenor of the Trump administration. We're trying to save taxpayer's money, not spend more. And we really sort of knew the writing was on the wall when we said, are you going to fire Tom Price, and he said we'll have an announcement later today. That typically means it's a done deal, we just have not been made it public yet. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the fact that we found out from statements from press secretary Sarah Sanders, and I know you've spoke with her earlier this afternoon. I don't know if you talked about this with her or not. But she said that Secretary Price actually offered his resignation earlier this morning and the president accepted it, so it's just a matter of getting the communication team together to make the official announcement this afternoon. But when the president said this afternoon, we'll make an announcement he had already made the decision. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You know we sort of saw that the writing was on the wall two few days ago when the president was asked about this as he was walking across the south lawn after talking to the press on his way to the helicopter as he was traveling to Indianapolis for his first tax reform speech. The president was asked are you going to fire Tom Price, and he paused for a second and he turned over his shoulder and he said, we'll see. And he just had that look like I'm angry at this person, and the, we'll see, was, you betcha, just not today. And as the president was leaving this afternoon to head up to Bedminster, New Jersey, he was asked a lot about Tom Price, it was clear that he was very, very angry and upset over what Price had that done in terms of taking those charter flights because now the figure, I believe, is up over a million dollars for the cost of the flights that he took. He says it's out of keeping with the tone and tenor of the Trump administration. We're trying to save taxpayer's money, not spend more. And we really sort of knew the writing was on the wall when we said, are you going to fire Tom Price, and he said we'll have an announcement later today. That typically means it's a done deal, we just have not been made it public yet. And the fact that we found out from statements from press secretary Sarah Sanders, and I know you've spoke with her earlier this afternoon. I don't know if you talked about this with her or not. But she said that Secretary Price actually offered his resignation earlier this morning and the president accepted it, so it's just a matter of getting the communication team together to make the official announcement this afternoon. But when the president said this afternoon, we'll make an announcement he had already made the decision."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Well, right. So be fair. And the bottom line is -- look, I agree with the president, you know. He made a promise to really drain the swamp and reform Washington, D.C. and politics as we know it. So therefore, when you see a situation like this, which at least suggests that there was an abuse, that these charter flights shouldn't been taken, that this was too much, you know, largess and waste of taxpayer money, I'm right up that alley in that lane. I think that's 100 percent true, it's a fair criticism, it was improper. Obviously, the president would be upset with something like this. You know, wouldn't you? And so, Tom Price offering the resignation was the right thing to do. He offered it. The president accepted it. That's that. So let that be a lesson learned. Let's see if that's good enough for some people or they're going to criticize anyway."

JUAN WILLIAMS, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: No. And, you know, to pick up on what Kimberly said, I think there's a lot of pressure on this president at this moment given that he just submitted a tax plan that -- you know, people on the Democratic side are arguing it benefits the rich. So, here he has people on his team and it looks like they're just living like, you know, the high and mighty and they don't really care. They're not in touch with the grassroots. I mean, the other thing to say is here, I think the failure of the Obamacare repeal did not help Tom Price with President Trump."

      "utterance": "He tried. And he also said that he would repay the federal government for his portion of the flight. It's basically -- it got out of control. And when a secretary, not a press secretary, when a cabinet secretary embarrasses the president, it becomes like the story and you're off of a legislative failure. You know, Tom Price is probably right to submit the resignation. I would add one other thing that it wasn't fake news. Politico, the reporters track this down. They did the reporting. And I'm not saying that they were proud, they've got a scalp, but this is what happens in Washington when you have reporters that's, sort of, gets outside the White House briefing room, stop focusing on everything that the president is tweeting, and look at what's happening across the federal government, you might find stories like this."

Perhaps the NFL is realizing the protests are bad for business.

Reports are in very bad damage. And then, of course, medical situation like I've been talking about with our chief of our medical team, Dr. Manny Alvarez, was one of the first to go down there to offer help and assistance for the medical crisis. We know the people -- things like chemotherapy being flown out by the singer, Pit Bull, who donated his plane so that they can continue their treatment. Can you imagine that having to evacuate people so that they don't die? That they can get their cancer treatment. That's how serious it is there. And how much need, real need, substantive need there is in Puerto Rico. And it's something that's not going to be fixed very quickly.

They talk about the retirement homes, senior citizens centers now is becoming human cages, because they have no air conditioning. We know what happened in Florida in that kind situation. But it's become political, because you have, especially on the left, people saying that President Trump is not performing here.

So then you have Elaine Duke, the acting homeland security secretary, saying, \"You know what?

People are dying.\" And she said, you know, the president had called San Juan and she said, \"Thank you, Mr. President, but there's 77 other towns that are still underwater.\" So at that point, it's just like, you know, how much can you do and is the president, in fact, not responding in the way that he should be to help Americans?"

If this is, indeed, somehow Trump's responsibility, then look at the two impeccable responses to the previous disasters. OK, if you're just looking at experience, and you're saying, this is what happened here and this is what happened here, and this is different. What's the variable? What's the variable? It's the same man. So maybe you might want to consider that it's the area that is different. That it is an island. It's a location. You've got to get ships there. It takes longer for ships to get there. That's not Trump's fault. No. 2, infrastructure. This is not like a U.S. state. They're U.S. citizens, but the infrastructure pales in comparison. This place was a mess. We know it's a mess. It's been a victim of 20 years of corruption. So this -- You've got to go back. There were two examples of excellent response. This one is slower. The inclination to blame Trump is because he is Trump. And to bring up race and to say that he's not doing enough because they're Puerto Ricans. That's just B.S. You have two perfect examples of a perfect response to two disasters. This one is different. Why? The variables are location and infrastructure. How simple is that to understand? They don't want to understand it. The media doesn't want to understand it, because see this as a way to tar Trump."
