      "utterance": "But how do we know? And are there steps in place? He is saying I don't need to prepare. It's all attitude. You've got to lay out, what are the deliverables out of this meeting that you are going to get from him, not just their word, but are you going to be able to go around their country, find where their nuclear weapons are? Are you come to an agreement on monitors? Is he just going to trust that Kim Jong-un's word, and then what happens after that?"

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "I can't imagine they get to that level of detail in this first meeting, so maybe it is about the relational aspect of trying to get to those."

      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Just quickly remember what John Bolton did at the State Department. He did arms control. And I am so appreciative that he is there. I guarantee that he's going to be in the president's ear every single moment and is making sure we can do exactly what you described."

      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "But it's important, just on the preparation question, it's important for a world leader, particularly the leader of the world's superpower, to go into a meeting knowing the history of these negotiations, knowing the history of the relationship so that when he hears something that's been said time and again, he's not hearing it for the first time and it's not tempted to believe something that has been the basis of lies for three decades. That's a concern."

      "utterance": "I have said here before, I will say again I am happy that John Bolton is on one side of Donald Trump. I'm happy that Mike Pompeo is on the other side of Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "And the president tweeting today up a storm today, as he often does. \"Isn't it ironic? Getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on trade. We have the worst trade deals ever made. Then off to Singapore to meet with North Korea and the nuclear problem. But back home we still have the 13 Angry Democrats pushing the witch hunt!\" I think he's going to have to trademark that. There are capital A and capital D on \"Angry Democrats.\" We are going to talk about that angle after this. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
