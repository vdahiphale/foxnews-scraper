People argue about these questions every day. You watch it on TV. And so it seems like, the parties are divided on the matter. But on a deeper level there really is no debate, there is instead consensus. Virtually everyone in the political system knows as an article of faith that mass immigration is good for our economy. Immigrants make us richer. The Chamber of Commerce tells us that often.

Well, this is not a new talking point as you could tell from the aging video we showed you, but like everything in this country, it has accelerated dramatically the past couple of years. The left's new position is that immigrants are not just good for America, they are better for America than you are. They don't complain, they don't file H.R. complaints. They don't get expensive long-term diseases like diabetes or opioid addiction, they just do what they're told. They are the noble workers our leaders have always wanted. Just two days ago, Senator Kristen Gillibrand of New York who by the way is running for President explained that every single immigrant in America is good, no matter how they got here or why, just by virtue of the fact that they are immigrants.

Well in some cases, it is true. Plenty of immigrants have done a great job in this country. They are highly patriotic. They are successful in business. They are great neighbors and friends.

Now, don't tell Kirsten Gillibrand, but they are not all the same. Our current immigration system treats them like they are. It treats people like widgets. Our government does virtually nothing to separate the good from the bad. A system like that is not designed to help America, it is designed for the benefit of foreigners, and by that measure, it has been wildly successful. A new study shows that just last year, immigrants living in the United States send at least $120 billion in remittances to the countries they came from. Even in the age of expanding cost, $120 billion is a lot of money. It is more for example then we spent on the first Gulf War. It is more than the entire Russian military spends every two years. That's enough money to buy Costco, not the stuff on the shelves, but the entire company and still have $15 billion left over. It is a lot of money and all of it could be going to Americans, many of whom badly need it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But instead, Mexico received $33 billion in remittances just last year. That country's own President admits the Mexican economy would go under without those remittance payments. In Guatemala, remittances from the United States amounted to a full 11% of their entire GDP. In El Salvador and Honduras, that is 18% and 20% respectively. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In the past decades, those three countries have received a total of $120 billion in remittances from the United States. And by the way, it's not just Latin America that is benefiting from this. China which hardly needs it gets $15 billion a year in remittances. India $10.5 billion; Vietnam, $7 billion; Nigeria, $5.5 billion; Russia, $300 million. We could go on and on. Now, none of this is an attack on immigrants. In most cases, they are just helping their families back home and good for them, it's not their fault. It is our fault. Much of this money has never been taxed at any level. More than 10 million illegal aliens are believed to be working in this country under the table. And that is part of the reason that between 2012 and 2016, an estimated 39 million Social Security numbers were stolen from Americans for fraudulent use. A fact that's rarely reported. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But legal or not, immigrants send their earnings abroad and they pay nothing when they do it because remittances are untaxed. It is a pretty good deal for Mexico and Guatemala. When was the last time, you made a financial transaction that wasn't taxed? Can you even remember? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At one point, the Trump administration proposed a remittance tax. Lobbyists from Mexico didn't like the idea. The idea went nowhere. We can't fix that on this show, what we can do is be honest about what is happening. Immigration is good for the economy, sure, it can be good. Immigration is always good for our economy? More immigration is always better for our economy? No. That is a lie. There is nothing to support that claim. There is a lot of evidence to disprove it. Anyone who tells you that and that's pretty much everyone you see on television either doesn't understand the subject or is lying to you purposely and may be both, just so you know. Steven Camarota does understand this subject. He is the Director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies and he joins us tonight. Mr. Camerota, thanks very much for coming on. $120 billion in remittances and they are not taxed, I can't think of anything in American life that is not taxed, except remittances, why is that? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Remember, for Mexico and Central America, more than half of immigrants from those regions live in or near poverty in the United States and they are still sending a large fraction of that money from those immigrants from there.

Marijuana is not what people out there think it is because the active ingredient that causes problems in the brain, psychiatric symptoms is now 20 to 30 times more powerful than it was in the 1970s when we were teens -- 20 to 30 more times THC in marijuana now and THC is what's causing all this.

The Trump administration is planning to issue an executive order designed to protect freedom of speech on American college campuses. Public schools are supposed to protect the First Amendment. By definition, it's in the Bill of Rights. But increasingly, they trample on it with impunity in order to protect the sanctity of their dogma. Now, the administration's executive order will allow every Federal agency to deny grants to public colleges and universities if they are found to contravene the First Amendment, if they are hostile to free speech. Amen. The other half of the executive order will do something different. It will help protect students from economic exploitation. Currently, there are countless programs that charge students a lot in tuition, but offer no reasonable job prospects in return. Schools know that, of course, but students don't know it a lot of the time. Now, the administration will require all public colleges to make that information public. Every program will have to disclose what its graduates actually earn and students can decide whether a degree is worth it or it's a scam as so many degrees are. Student loans are still the biggest problem for the young people in this country and more will have to be done to fix that. We're going to have more on that topic later in the week. But this is a start. Google is, you know, is the single most powerful company in the history of the world, almost every day, there are new reasons to be suspicious of that much power concentrated in that few hands. Tonight, we can report an internal Google e-mail obtained by this program. In it, an employee says a manager told him the company would fight so called hate speech and fake news because he blamed hate speech and fake news for the election of Donald Trump, whom he hates. Other leaked internal documents revealed that a Google Vice President banned a Christian video from advertising on YouTube because it promoted conventional marriage. So while Google tramples your freedoms here in the United States, Google enhances the power of tyrants abroad. Last week, testifying before Congress, General Joseph Dunford accused Google of empowering China by doing research work over there while simultaneously refusing to support America's own Department of Defense. Hard to believe that's true, but it is. Harmeet Dhillon is an attorney and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thanks very much for coming on. To the second point first, Google helping China - - really are the only global rival we face -- but refusing to help the Department of Defense. Am I overstating that?",

And so on top of that, China has its own sort of government-run business operations, and those are staffed with and owned by the children and the princes of the people who are in power in China.

He got that gig after being hooked up by Paul Manafort, who of course also worked the Ukrainian government. Like so many foreign lobbyists in Washington, Craig apparently did not disclose his work to the Federal government, even as he was making millions from Ukrainian oligarchs. According to \"New York Times,\" Craig could face charges for failing to register under FARA, the Foreign Agent Registration Act, that's a 1939 law that until recently went essentially unenforced. Okay, so it looks like both sides will now have FARA indictments, but let's not lie about it. If failing to register foreign lobbying is a crime, there are a lot of felons walking free tonight in the nation's capital. How many of them will ever face indictment? Well, all of them should. Virtually, none of them ever will. That's not an argument against upholding the law, we should. But selective enforcement is not justice. It's persecution. And that's true even when they indict someone you don't like. Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder Morris Dees was canned under mysterious circumstances. Dees' organization exists to tar all enemies of the Democratic Party as hate groups, racist, sexist, bigots, and should not be allowed to speak in this country or make a living. They should be disappeared. So it does seem a little fitting then that apparently Dees was fired amid allegations that his own organization was rife with racism and sexism. But it turns out this is nothing new. All the way back in 1994, the Montgomery Advertiser, the paper in town reported on a hostile racial climate inside the SPLC.

People argue about these questions every day. You watch it on TV. And so it seems like, the parties are divided on the matter. But on a deeper level there really is no debate, there is instead consensus. Virtually everyone in the political system knows as an article of faith that mass immigration is good for our economy. Immigrants make us richer. The Chamber of Commerce tells us that often. Libertarian think tanks produce studies claiming to prove it's true. In the Democratic Party, it is a bedrock principle. America would collapse without a steady torrent of new arrivals from the developing world. That is what they tell us. Immigration does not just improve the economy, we wouldn't have an economy without it."

They don't get expensive long-term diseases like diabetes or opioid addiction, they just do what they're told. They are the noble workers our leaders have always wanted. Just two days ago, Senator Kristen Gillibrand of New York who by the way is running for President explained that every single immigrant in America is good, no matter how they got here or why, just by virtue of the fact that they are immigrants. Ever heard anybody say that about American citizens? No, don't hold your breath. But Gillibrand clearly meant it about immigrants. Watch."

      "utterance": "Falsest person in Washington, but she is saying something that everyone else believes. Immigrants makes our economy stronger. Okay, that's the claim. It is it true? Well in some cases, it is true. Plenty of immigrants have done a great job in this country. They are highly patriotic. They are successful in business. They are great neighbors and friends. Everybody knows people like that and everybody is glad they are here. But not every immigrant is like every other immigrant. Now, don't tell Kirsten Gillibrand, but they are not all the same. Our current immigration system treats them like they are. It treats people like widgets. Our government does virtually nothing to separate the good from the bad. A system like that is not designed to help America, it is designed for the benefit of foreigners, and by that measure, it has been wildly successful. A new study shows that just last year, immigrants living in the United States send at least $120 billion in remittances to the countries they came from. Even in the age of expanding cost, $120 billion is a lot of money. It is more for example then we spent on the first Gulf War. It is more than the entire Russian military spends every two years. That's enough money to buy Costco, not the stuff on the shelves, but the entire company and still have $15 billion left over. It is a lot of money and all of it could be going to Americans, many of whom badly need it. But instead, Mexico received $33 billion in remittances just last year. That country's own President admits the Mexican economy would go under without those remittance payments. In Guatemala, remittances from the United States amounted to a full 11% of their entire GDP. In El Salvador and Honduras, that is 18% and 20% respectively. In the past decades, those three countries have received a total of $120 billion in remittances from the United States. And by the way, it's not just Latin America that is benefiting from this. China which hardly needs it gets $15 billion a year in remittances. India $10.5 billion; Vietnam, $7 billion; Nigeria, $5.5 billion; Russia, $300 million. We could go on and on. Now, none of this is an attack on immigrants. In most cases, they are just helping their families back home and good for them, it's not their fault. It is our fault. Much of this money has never been taxed at any level. More than 10 million illegal aliens are believed to be working in this country under the table. And that is part of the reason that between 2012 and 2016, an estimated 39 million Social Security numbers were stolen from Americans for fraudulent use. A fact that's rarely reported. But legal or not, immigrants send their earnings abroad and they pay nothing when they do it because remittances are untaxed. It is a pretty good deal for Mexico and Guatemala. When was the last time, you made a financial transaction that wasn't taxed? Can you even remember? At one point, the Trump administration proposed a remittance tax. Lobbyists from Mexico didn't like the idea. The idea went nowhere. We can't fix that on this show, what we can do is be honest about what is happening. Immigration is good for the economy, sure, it can be good. Immigration is always good for our economy? More immigration is always better for our economy? No. That is a lie. There is nothing to support that claim. There is a lot of evidence to disprove it. Anyone who tells you that and that's pretty much everyone you see on television either doesn't understand the subject or is lying to you purposely and may be both, just so you know. Steven Camarota does understand this subject. He is the Director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies and he joins us tonight. Mr. Camerota, thanks very much for coming on. $120 billion in remittances and they are not taxed, I can't think of anything in American life that is not taxed, except remittances, why is that?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMAROTA",
      "utterance": "No, it probably doesn't. You're right. It is money flowing out of the United States so it can't be taxed in the way it would. It's not here for savings or investment. It does not spur consumer spending here, and the other problem is, it is often flowing out of many of the poorest communities in the United States. Remember, for Mexico and Central America, more than half of immigrants from those regions live in or near poverty in the United States and they are still sending a large fraction of that money from those immigrants from there. So that is a big concern, in other words, it's poor people, in effect making themselves somewhat poor, but they are choosing to do it, but it's also flowing out of communities that really could use the resource, and that is one of the disadvantages of immigration."

So the question is, does anyone believe this or do people just write it off as the transparent propaganda that it is? Well, we have a new poll that answers those questions. The poll asked voters what issue was most important to them. The number one issue -- immigration. What percent picked global warming? That imminent threat? Two percent. So voters know which issue is radically changing their country and which is a totally abstract distraction and excuse for another power grab? Joe Bastardi is a meteorologist. He is the author of \"The Climate Chronicles: Inconvenient Revelations You Won't Hear From Al Gore and Others,\" and he joins us tonight. Joe, thanks a lot for coming on tonight. Is it surprising to you that after 25 years of really relentless propaganda, beginning in children's cartoons going all the way up probably until the moment of death that Americans rate climate change at 2% concerned, 2% are most concerned about climate change.

I think it's because they don't look at everything. I've said hundreds of times that if all I looked at and all I was told was the global warming issue, I'd say, \"Well, I believe it too. CO2 is causing this.\" But when you start looking at the entire picture, the totality of the picture and you put some perspective into it that the last 40 years is the equivalent of six seconds out of an 80-year-old man's life, you realize that there is a very, very different story here. It's like one scene in a movie for five seconds determining the whole movie. That's not the case here at all. The foundation you stand on today was built yesterday to reach for tomorrow. It's the same thing with weather and climate, folks, what happens is you have to go back and look at the big picture. In our business, and what I do at Weather Bell is we need to supply accurate forecast for energy companies that includes wind and solar retail companies.

But since I come from that kind of background from an old Democratic background, I knew who H.L. Mencken was. So I think that's what's involved here.

If you go -- if you put -- if you do away with that and you just elect your Presidents by whoever lives in New York and California, then -- and you just erase all of those boundaries, then you truly are for open borders, then you are no longer the United States of America.

Where was President Trump today? In Ohio. What was he talking about? Manufacturing jobs and the economy. What have we been talking about? This is Wednesday. We've been talking about the Electoral College for an almost an entire week. So they are missing the opportunity. He's basically saying, \"Come over to my turf. You want to talk about the economy? Great, I'd like -- I'm here.\" He's ready to take the slings and arrows, but instead they're talking about the Electoral College and the Green New Deal.

That's after the cameras stopped rolling with CNN. What CNN didn't tell people is that they allowed and invited politicians to come up on stage and electioneer. Scott Israel was able to make a big old electioneering speech before this even began, in which he already started deflecting blame, by putting it on me.

They were questioned -- the same people -- simply because they thought differently. What they did, what this Town Hall did was set dialogue back by - I don't know how much. I mean, it pushed dialogue back. It was an embarrassing display of bias and they should feel ashamed instead of back patting themselves for this.

      "utterance": "Oh, Cory and Beto are for weed. Of course they are. In the midst of the greatest and most fatal drug epidemic in the history of this country, marijuana is entering a golden age. Democratic presidential candidates compete to show how cool they are and how much they love it. Ten states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana, most of the rest tolerate medical marijuana, often on flimsy pretexts. Every year, the drug becomes more prevalent. Nationwide legalization seems inevitable. Just probably just a few years away. What will happen? Well, a couple of companies will get very rich, but as marijuana becomes more common, what will happen to the people who smoke it? We're not supposed to ask that question, but we think it's interesting, so we do. A new study in \"The Lancet,\" the British Medical Journal finds that daily marijuana use substantially increases an individual's chance of having psychotic episodes or developing schizophrenia. No big deal, just schizophrenia. Dr. Marc Siegel is a Fox News medical contributor and he joins us tonight. Doctor, thanks very much for coming on. This -- I mean, I can't think of a disease more serious than schizophrenia. Do you take this study seriously?"

      "utterance": "This was an extremely well done European study, Tucker, and it looked all across Europe, and it found three big cities -- London, Amsterdam and Paris -- all had up to 50% cases, new cases of psychosis were linked to marijuana use. Now, why would that be? Let me tell you a little biology lesson here, Tucker. Marijuana is not what people out there think it is because the active ingredient that causes problems in the brain, psychiatric symptoms is now 20 to 30 times more powerful than it was in the 1970s when we were teens -- 20 to 30 more times THC in marijuana now and THC is what's causing all this. It's causing depression. It's causing anxiety, it's causing psychosis and in places that have legalized pot, fully legalized it recreationally like Colorado, like Washington, like those 10 states you mentioned, like Canada, the amount of cannabis induced psychosis is doubled or tripled. It's a real rampant problem."

      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, it's beyond debate from a medical perspective. This study absolutely proves it. Fifty percent -- and that's just psychosis. We're not even talking about anxiety and depression and you mentioned schizophrenia. You know what's really troubling, there are people out there who are at risk of schizophrenia. We give them a lot of regular use of pot. We're talking about regular heavy use of pot. They get a schizophrenic break. They may never come back. We may never be able to treat them out of it with anti-psychotic medication. I don't want to scare people out there. You could stop smoking pot. You could use anti-psychotic medication. And in some cases, the paranoia goes away. The suspicion goes away. You come back to reality. In some percent of cases. Tucker, you don't come back to reality. And you stay as a schizophrenic and this may be the reason. This is really, really a disgrace that this is not being considered and I'm really glad you brought it up. It's becoming a worse and worse problem, the more powerful pot gets, and you know, when it gets legal, that it gets more powerful. It's in food. It's in juices. It's in cosmetics even and it's more powerful than what they smoke, what people smoke."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Amen. We have an exclusive report tonight based on information from the White House. The Trump administration is planning to issue an executive order designed to protect freedom of speech on American college campuses. Public schools are supposed to protect the First Amendment. By definition, it's in the Bill of Rights. But increasingly, they trample on it with impunity in order to protect the sanctity of their dogma. Now, the administration's executive order will allow every Federal agency to deny grants to public colleges and universities if they are found to contravene the First Amendment, if they are hostile to free speech. Amen. The other half of the executive order will do something different. It will help protect students from economic exploitation. Currently, there are countless programs that charge students a lot in tuition, but offer no reasonable job prospects in return. Schools know that, of course, but students don't know it a lot of the time. Now, the administration will require all public colleges to make that information public. Every program will have to disclose what its graduates actually earn and students can decide whether a degree is worth it or it's a scam as so many degrees are. Student loans are still the biggest problem for the young people in this country and more will have to be done to fix that. We're going to have more on that topic later in the week. But this is a start. Google is, you know, is the single most powerful company in the history of the world, almost every day, there are new reasons to be suspicious of that much power concentrated in that few hands. Tonight, we can report an internal Google e-mail obtained by this program. In it, an employee says a manager told him the company would fight so called hate speech and fake news because he blamed hate speech and fake news for the election of Donald Trump, whom he hates. Other leaked internal documents revealed that a Google Vice President banned a Christian video from advertising on YouTube because it promoted conventional marriage. So while Google tramples your freedoms here in the United States, Google enhances the power of tyrants abroad. Last week, testifying before Congress, General Joseph Dunford accused Google of empowering China by doing research work over there while simultaneously refusing to support America's own Department of Defense. Hard to believe that's true, but it is. Harmeet Dhillon is an attorney and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thanks very much for coming on. To the second point first, Google helping China - - really are the only global rival we face -- but refusing to help the Department of Defense. Am I overstating that?"

    {
      "speaker": "HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "No, not at all, Tucker. And it's actually even worse than that. A lot of people don't understand that. To do business in China, you have to agree to basically be in bed with the Chinese government, you have to keep your data and your business over there in China, you have to respond to their data requests, and you have to, you know, have them looking over your shoulder in everything you do, and perhaps taking the stake of what you have. And so on top of that, China has its own sort of government-run business operations, and those are staffed with and owned by the children and the princes of the people who are in power in China. So there's no doing business in China without being intertwined closely with the Chinese government and that's what Google is doing."

      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "You would be naive, in fact, I would say stupid to believe that. I think there is ample evidence even going back to a couple of years ago. I filed this lawsuit, as you know, against Google. And then similar documents to the one that you mentioned in that e-mail. Google has been punishing conservatives and hounding them out and criticizing people who support anything conservative for the couple of years ever since the election, actually. So it's been almost three years now. And now that they are openly -- and Twitter and Facebook as well to a certain degree -- openly banning and cracking down on conservative speech because they think it is dangerous and they want to protect people from these conservative ideas. They are absolutely going to wheel that in favor of Democratic candidates. I mean, we've already seen Google banning ads from the President on immigration issues, Marsha Blackburn on abortion issues and other issues like that. Sometimes they're called on it and they back off, but that's happening, and you know, interestingly, Tucker --"

I mean, so the old technology, the FCC doesn't allow sort of traditional broadcasters to ban ads from political candidates, but these social media companies can and they do, we have evidence to that. So if we allow this to continue, if we allow this to happen in 2020, it is game over for conservatives in this country and for competition in our politics."

We'll be right back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "According to a new report, former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig may soon face criminal charges stemming from the Mueller investigation. Craig is one of the most prominent Democrats in Washington and has been for decades. He was a lawyer in the Clinton White House. Craig, it turns out was also an unregistered lobbyist for Ukraine. He got that gig after being hooked up by Paul Manafort, who of course also worked the Ukrainian government. Like so many foreign lobbyists in Washington, Craig apparently did not disclose his work to the Federal government, even as he was making millions from Ukrainian oligarchs. According to \"New York Times,\" Craig could face charges for failing to register under FARA, the Foreign Agent Registration Act, that's a 1939 law that until recently went essentially unenforced. Okay, so it looks like both sides will now have FARA indictments, but let's not lie about it. If failing to register foreign lobbying is a crime, there are a lot of felons walking free tonight in the nation's capital. How many of them will ever face indictment? Well, all of them should. Virtually, none of them ever will. That's not an argument against upholding the law, we should. But selective enforcement is not justice. It's persecution. And that's true even when they indict someone you don't like. Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder Morris Dees was canned under mysterious circumstances. Dees' organization exists to tar all enemies of the Democratic Party as hate groups, racist, sexist, bigots, and should not be allowed to speak in this country or make a living. They should be disappeared. So it does seem a little fitting then that apparently Dees was fired amid allegations that his own organization was rife with racism and sexism. But it turns out this is nothing new. All the way back in 1994, the Montgomery Advertiser, the paper in town reported on a hostile racial climate inside the SPLC. This group has been rotten for years. Why are people just now noticing? Tyler O'Neil is a senior editor at PJ Media and he joins us tonight. Tyler, thanks so much for coming on."

      "utterance": "That's an excellent question. The story actually is really, really bad. You had 13 black former employees of the SPLC interviewed; 12 of them said they witnessed racist incidents in their time there and three of them called the organization a plantation for its black workers."

Two years ago in 2017, we had former employees go on to the website, Glassdoor and talk about their experiences facing racial discrimination. There are apparently 100 lawyers and advocates of the SPLC, only five of them are black. There were black employees who worked there for 12 years, and yet none of them were elevated to senior leadership."

At this point, knowing what we know, can they continue to do that?"

    {
      "speaker": "O'NEIL",
      "utterance": "It's the liberal bias. They can't see it and that's actually one of the positive things if the SPLC hires more black leaders, there's a possibility because blacks tend to be more Christian and believe evangelical beliefs at a higher rate than whites do. There's a chance that some of those new black leaders could know that Christianity is not anti- LGBT hate."

He did just that. Now why is that a record? Well, Zuby explained quote, \"P.S. I identified as a woman while lifting the weight. Don't be a bigot.\" One of the prevailing wisdom right now, in fact under mandatory belief systems that you must adopt or be punished, he's absolutely right.
