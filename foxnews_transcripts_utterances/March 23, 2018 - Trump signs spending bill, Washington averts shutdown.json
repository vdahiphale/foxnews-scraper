I hope that's true because now the deficit hits $1 Trillion with this budget. And while people are cheering the $650 for the defense department and the enhanced military, I remember when I worked at 20-20 doing a series of exposes about the defense department when it's flush with cash doesn't really spend it with prudence in a reasonable fashion. I exposed toilet seats, for instance, that was selling for $640. Screws, single screws, like $37 to the defense department, a coffeemaker selling for $7,353, you know. So, $650 billion, I hope this goes to the right -- goes to the right kinds of weapon. You've mentioned at 35 enhanced F-18's, 30 new naval vessels.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A government shutdown has been averted. A new spending bill has been signed, but things were uncertain earlier when President Trump threaten to veto the measure because it didn't include protection for dreamers or enough money for his promise border wall. The president reluctantly approved it, but warned he's never going to sign legislation like this again."

So I will never sign another bill like this again. I am not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old.

Bill Clinton wants it, and the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. Why? Because it's up to the legislative branch to determine spending, not the president. He signs on or off, but he doesn't determine the line item -- you know, he can't veto things line- by-line as much as every president would like that kind of control. You know, Dick Cheney famously said that Reagan proved that deficits don't matter to politicians whether they're going to be reelected or not. I hope that's true because now the deficit hits $1 Trillion with this budget. And while people are cheering the $650 for the defense department and the enhanced military, I remember when I worked at 20-20 doing a series of exposes about the defense department when it's flush with cash doesn't really spend it with prudence in a reasonable fashion. I exposed toilet seats, for instance, that was selling for $640. Screws, single screws, like $37 to the defense department, a coffeemaker selling for $7,353, you know. So, $650 billion, I hope this goes to the right -- goes to the right kinds of weapon. You've mentioned at 35 enhanced F-18's, 30 new naval vessels. That's all good, but, you know, money doesn't mean security, necessarily."

This was a huge defeat for the president on a signature issue. It's really, really bad. There's no way to spin it. I know he wanted more money for the military, and that's incredibly important, but he sacrificed everything else to get it. And I hate to do this. I hate to quote Rand Paul.

But the border is a mess. And crying Chuck Schumer gets all the money he wants for a tunnel from New Jersey to New York, and there's no border wall funding. I saw some of these other pork, I mean, Planned Parenthood a half billion dollars. The John F. Kennedy Center is getting $40 million. Stuff -- they wanted to cut the budget for the EPA. EPA budget at a historic high. It's really insulting, and he said it's never going to happen again. I don't see how he's going to change the dynamic in Congress to have this never happen again.

He won a massive public debate with Congress in a stand down when the Democratic Party tried to shutdown Congress over DACA.

Sadly, as a conservative it is dead. $1.3 trillion, that's a lot of dining room sets for Ben Carson. So, we know -- we know, Donald Trump is a deal maker, right? In this case, the deal wasn't that great. But it's like a kidney stone. He had to pass it and it hurts, but you still got to pass it. The problem is, you've got to make -- it's like when you vote -- if you voted for Donald Trump you accepted the flaws for the bigger benefit. In this case, the budget is like that.

He's very learned. Anybody who actually opens their mind and ears to listens to what he has to say when he speaks, he's very learned. And by the way, why is it that the left and the Democrats aren't applauding the fact that he's very tough on Russia? And this will be no cake walk for Putin. He is not a fan.

But a funny thing happened after I finished writing it. We had all the turmoil here at Fox News. The publisher cancelled my first contract because it was sympathetic to Roger Ailes, our founder.

Here, let me give them out."
