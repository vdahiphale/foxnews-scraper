So at this point it looks like we have to be tough on Russia. I don't want to get involved militarily, but we've been warning about this for a long time.

I know he would never do that and say you know what, Beyonce, why don't you pay your people more, why don't you pay your team more. He would never go after her because he likes to pick and choose.

And he directed episodes of TV hit shows: ‘Empire,' ‘American Horror Story' and ‘Billions.' I met him once when he tried to buy the rights to one of my books.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Dramatic images coming from the streets of Venezuela. Chaos breaking out after opposition leader Juan Guaido called for a military uprising to end the socialist regime of Nicolas Maduro. Thousands of protesters clashing with security forces in the capital city of Caracas. We've seen teargas being fired, rocks being thrown, and gunshots ringing out. Listen to this."

He says he won't back down. And his government is calling the demonstrations a, quote, terrorist act that is, quote, bound to fail. President Trump is monitoring the situation and saying that the U.S. fully supports the people of Venezuela. So, Jesse, at some point this was going to come to a head, but one of the big concerns and Senator Rick Scott talked about it this morning is that you have Russia and China, in particular, Russia, and the Cubans, basically, they're negating our efforts using sanctions to try to push out the regime."

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It's a proxy war between America and Russia right now, and strangely the Democrats are siding with Russia, although maybe not so strangely if you think about it. But, I mean, Russia has interfered in Syria, interfered in Ukraine, and now they're interviewing in our own hemisphere, Venezuela, so we have to do something about it. But if we can just take a step back here and be honest about what Latin America is like, we go from one decade it's our guy, the next decade you have the socialist takeover, and then each side steals from the people, and then we have to get involved. So it's a total mess, but at the same time when you have a socialist back regime that's shooting people, that's cutting out electricity, and cracking down on freedom of assembly and the media, you can't allow that to happen. And right now people like Bernie Sanders, or Omar, or even CNN seem to be going along with Russia propaganda, not condemning the guy in charge right now, and acting like we're doing something bad, while all we're trying to do is maintain democracy and maintain some semblance of order. So at this point it looks like we have to be tough on Russia. I don't want to get involved militarily, but we've been warning about this for a long time. If you confiscate people's weapons, if you seize their private property, if you raid the natural resources of a country, and then all of a sudden there's no peaceful transfer of power, this is exactly what happens."

They don't just say, hey, you know what, things didn't work out. My mistake. Try this free market stuff. That -- the cruel joke of socialism is that if you give them what they want, which is power, then everything goes to hell, which is why the clever socialist wants to be protected from themselves. The smartest socialist is a capitalist, I.E. like a Bernie Sanders. Be in America where you can be a socialist because the capitalist market -- the capitalist system and the free markets will bail you out. They're the adults, right? And you can be the socialist child that plays around. But once the child gets control of the toys, everything is gone. And the lesson -- and I always try to bring this up, the lesson why this fails is centralized government means that there's one failure, the whole thing falls apart, right? The entire cake gets poisoned. Decentralized government, pre-market prevents that, so if one part fails, 49 others can succeed. That's why in the United States we have a lot of great cities and a lot of terrible ones, or a few terrible ones, and it's kind of odd how the ones that are really bad are actually closest to the model of socialism."

      "utterance": "Juan, I won't ask you to carry on that metaphor, but what do you think about the administration response so far? John Bolton, today, the national security advisor at the White House, was very specific in calling out three officials there in Venezuela who had already said that they would support Guaido, and he's basically calling on saying you've got to step up and do that. That also maybe puts a target on their backs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST",
      "utterance": "Right, and in specific the military, because the military is key here. So what really set things off today was that Guaido was able to stand with some members of the military and say it's time for Maduro to get out. And if it, in fact, was evidence that the military was siding with him, then Maduro said this is a coup, it's unfair, and all the rest. But, so to me what's key here is understanding that we, the United States, support not only democracy but stability. I mean, this is a real threat because it impacts immigration. I mean, people trying to break in and get out of there, get to another country. You have not only Russians but Cubans who are heavily present inside and supporting Maduro, which brings us to the point, Bolton says, our national security advisor, nothing is off the table. Well, wait a second. I don't think most Americans think that Venezuela should be the next Afghanistan that we should be sending military troops."

Venezuela has the largest proven reserve of oil in the world, Dana. And if they think they can come in and dominate the economics of that oil supply, that's a threat to us and it's a threat to our hemisphere. So we have to do something -- the question is do you want to become militarily involved? I think Bernie Sanders is right in saying no."

      "speaker": "DAGEN MCDOWELL, HOST",
      "utterance": "Not -- you didn't really see this dramatic reaction because I want to point out, something that Greg was talking about, this is an ideology that has been preached. And to quote Mary Anastasia O'Grady at the Wall Street Journal editorial page who is a student of Latin America, this is -- so it's a country that's been corrupted by the vast oil reserves, number one. But it's also ideological. It is, as she said, it is -- they -- throughout the entire 20th century for the most part, that the intelligence, you have the intellectuals, the academics, the educators, the politicians have basically swamped the population with socialist pap. That is her phrase. She said that if -- they preach that if you stick it to the rich, that's the path to paradise. It is -- as the government intervened in the economy, particularly through price and exchange controls, it damages living standards. And the danger is that the Venezuelans still voted for more of it because they have began or been taught to hate success, hate entrepreneurs in the name of -- what is the phrase? Social justice. And they were setting up the country to fail, and now you have basically people eating garbage, individual starving to death, and basically a dystopian society."

He disbanded the national assembly and put in place his puppets."

So why the return to global scare tactics? I blame Trump. America's economy is booming, unemployment for everyone is at a historic low. Manufacturing jobs returned by the hundreds of thousands.

Prices are collapsing. This energy industry has created millions of jobs but I'm going to wipe all of that away just for a campaign slogan. Good luck on that.

But I think that you know going back to something, Dana what she was talking about, the bump he got was significant, he's now 20 points ahead of Bernie Sanders and what this says to me is that so often, the way that we view Democrats, especially when I say we I mean, you know talking from my Republican conservative perspective you say, oh, they're pushing everybody the far, they're a bunch of socialists, they're wacky, they're -- hey, wait a second, looks to me like Democrats are more middle of the road, older and wider than you would guess and they're the ones who say we like Steady Eddie in terms of Biden.

Disney has stated this that their 90% of Bob Iger's compensation is performance based. Here is a little warning to Bernie Sanders. Don't go after things folks like. This is a person's happy place, this movie. This brings them joy and pleasure and you're basically again Bernie Sanders never met a dollar earned by a private citizen or a private company that he didn't want to confiscate because you know what, at the end of the day, a socialist believes they spend your money better than you spend your money.

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

Bernie could get in on the action and he can vote at the next shareholder meeting if he wants to but I agree, don't go after Mickey Mouse. I mean that is like -- that's holy territory for most Americans and Bob Iger is not a villainous, corporate evil CEO. I mean, it's not like he needs to - there's other examples you could use besides that. Why doesn't he go after let's say, who else made $60 million last year? Beyonce. Why doesn't he go after someone like Beyonce? She made the same amount as Bob Iger. I know he would never do that and say you know what, Beyonce, why don't you pay your people more, why don't you pay your team more. He would never go after her because he likes to pick and choose. But if you go out to Disney hard and you get shamed and you know slapping another $20 an hour on your employees, what's going to happen? They're going to have to pass those on to the customers. The customers are going to Disneyworld is not in my budget this year. Then stock price drops, they might have to lay off workers so then Bernie ends up hurting the same people he's trying to help, the middle class."

If since 1978, it's gone up 937% so you see a disproportionate amount of the revenue not only going to the shareholders because sometimes the companies do buy backs, they increase the value of the stock but that then the shareholders pump up the CEO's salary while he pumps up their revenue."

Abigail Disney is the granddaughter, I believe of the founder and she's been an activist and she's an agitator saying that Bob Iger's salary is outrageous. And so I think that Bernie is tucking in but side her so that he can draft off of that but - I guess that the - if he were to lose the primary and if he were to write another book, then he should tell his publisher, I don't need an advance. I think that we should just all - I'm going to write this book and work really hard on it. And I could live another 25 years but I don't want an advance. I don't want any of the profits come to me.

Because these - this is logic that's not even worthy of a second grader. You know, the left - the hard left only has one game and that is to take because they don't understand how to create. They - as you said in the A block, they dismiss innovation and creativity and so wealth isn't for the making, it's for that taking because they think that this money comes from somewhere that they don't understand. Then why not take it? And to your point about young people, I want to ask them, young people, now I sound old, why would you trust the government over an individual in deciding anything like this?

So here's a tribute to Hollywood director, John Singleton who died yesterday at 51 after suffering a stroke. Singleton made history as the first black nominee, also the youngest Academy award nominee ever for Best Director. He was recognized for the ground breaking film, ‘Boys in the hood.' His other major films included one of the ‘Fast and Furious' films as well as the romantic story, ‘Poetic Justice.'"
