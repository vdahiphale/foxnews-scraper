      "speaker": "LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST",
      "sentences": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” back in Washington tonight. We have a lot to get to. At any moment, we are expecting the text of the actual border compromise. Well, it's the bill and it's going to drop any moment. We're also awaiting word on whether the President will actually sign it. So, you want to stay with us right through this hour. We're going to be analyzing it line by line for you and you got to know what's in this thing, plus the failure of the high-speed rail project in California. It's one of my favorite issues ever. I've been tracking this for years. It's just the latest in a long line of liberal pie-in-the-sky disasters. My ANGLE will explain what politicians have lied to you along the way and what lessons you can take from this. And also tonight, the revenge of the Esmonde (ph). Why am I having to say this? We told you about this last week. A lot of you apparently are interested in this, okay, and I have a question. Are you celebrating Galentine's Day? This is so disturbing. Raymond Arroyo is with us in a very wild Seen and Unseen tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, I want all of you to understand what's at stake and what's going on here tonight. No matter what anyone tells you, this so-called border deal is a complete abdication of responsibility by Congress. It has nothing, zero, nada to do -- it doesn't do anything to stem the crush of humanity that we're seeing at our southern border right now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There has been a 290 percent increase in the number of so-called family units illegally crossing into America just in the first four months of this fiscal year. As The Washington Post reported, \"After surrendering to authorities, the families are driven to Border Patrol Stations, where they typically state a fear of deportation and a desire to seek asylum in the United States.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In most cases, the families are released after a few days and assigned a court date. Last month, an unprecedented 59 percent of all the border apprehensions were comprised of migrants travelling in family groups. Well, what The Post didn't tell you is that 90 percent of these migrants are not really eligible for asylum, but instead have been coached by immigration activists or lawyers or by the other family members or friends already in the United States, and their claims will ultimately be rejected by immigration judges. But, it doesn't matter because most never show up for their hearings and many, during that interim period, have children here. So then, they're never going to be sent back. Democrat lawmakers will invariably say that border crossings are down, they're not up. Well, guess what, don't fall -- don't fall into that trap. That's irrelevant. It's a red-herring. When 1,800 adults and children crossed illegally into the U.S. on Monday alone, including two groups of more than 300 just in El Paso, we have a full-blown border crisis. Smugglers get rich, cartels and infiltrate the caravans and hardworking Americans get stuck with the tab. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Education costs, healthcare costs, housing and court-appointed interpreters just to lay out a few budget items. Of course, this could all stop tomorrow if Congress did what it should do tonight, all asylum applications should be filed outside of America. This itself removes the incentive to both storm border checkpoints and to cross illegally. Secondly, the law must be changed to allow for immediate border turn backs. In other words, you come here from Honduras or Guatemala, and you're sent immediately back, which is what we do now with Mexicans who cross illegally. Third, one illegal border crossing and you're out. You're back home and that means back to zero tolerance. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meaning once we caught you, you're deported and you may not apply to return legally to the United States. That would have a powerful deterrent effect to people who want to come, maybe they'll actually apply to come legally. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And finally, prosecute more adults for child endangerment. American parents, they're thrown in jail for letting their kids walk home from school alone, let alone putting them in situations where they don't have proper food or water. So, why do illegal aliens get special treatment? Dragging kids through very dangerous territory, the desert; food, water limited; cartels, coyotes, people who will prey on them. That is irresponsible. Those are just a few of my ideas. What are yours? Congress, what are you going to do? Here now, Mark Morgan, Obama's former Border Patrol Chief; Luis Miranda, who's the former Communications Director for the DNC; and Dan Bongino, former -- excuse me, not former, Fox News Contributor. Mark, you've been at the helm of an important enforcement agency in all of this; what did I leave out in my prescriptions? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And from a border security perspective, this proposal is an absolute failure. They not only didn't listen to the experts on the tools and resources, they needed they have absolutely rejected that. And one thing I want to add that's very important, the American people need to understand what they're doing with ice beds. So think about this. This proposal reduces the ICE beds and I'm not a mathematician, but reduces the ICE beds. As you just point out, the legal aggression is skyrocketing. Again, you don't have to be a mathematician; what does that mean? Catch and release 2.0. They're going to have to release them.",

Well now, a lot of states smartly turned down the seed money, knowing full well that the final cost could be a lot more, it could be double or even triple the original projections. So, they didn't want to be left holding the bag. But two of the most reliably Democrat states in America, Hawaii and California, gladly took the money. California received grants of $3.5 billion to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, meaning 100 plus miles of high-speed rail had to go through the Central Valley's beautiful farmland. And as with so many liberal pipe dreams, a myriad of problems dogged this project from the start. The original cost projection for the San Fran to LA track was $45 billion. But soon, the estimate jumped to $77 billion. Now, two years ago, The LA Times diagnosed this situation accurately, saying the California system is being built by an independent authority that has never built anything, and depends on a large network of consultants and contractors for advice. Even after five years of effort to buy property, the rail authority still lacks 25 percent of the parcels for a 29 mile stretch from Madera to Fresno and just over half of the parcels needed for the 118 miles in the Central Valley. And another fun fact, it keeps getting better, to achieve their Nirvana of high-speed rail, Democrats were even willing to throw their other religion under the bus, environmentalism. So, huge opposition to the project developed from greeniacs and also farmers, and that led to mongo delays. So, my friends, this was a joke from the start, and the only people who benefited were the countries that bought our debt to fund it and the consultants who lined their pockets selling this as a panacea for congested roads. Now, this is no different, though, from so many other unnecessary and unwanted liberal projects that require billions to fund and just end up driving us further into debt. I think of Vermont's idea for the single payer dream in 2011 before -- it ended basically before it began when Governor Peter Shumlin realized it had become too costly to implement, and then he just called the whole thing off. Who can forget Obama's solar energy grants to Solyndra and Fisker Automotive, just to name a few. There were five defaulted loans that American taxpayers were on the hook for as a result of that boondoggle. And of course, none of these examples of waste, fraud, and abuse ever mattered to the fanatics on the left. Their goals of their Green New Deal, oh, my God, what does that tell us? It tells us that they are actually doubling down on all the failures of the past. In fact, yesterday, California Governor Gavin Newsom lowered expectations for the project, kind of yanked it from under its feet, but he kept insisting that he won't return the $3.5 billion that his state wasted on this nightmare.",

And Newsom responded in the last few minutes that this is California's money, and, quote, \"We're not giving it back.\" Typical liberal, thinks it's their money -- other people's money is their money. It's the taxpayers' money, Gavin. You know what I was thinking. Think of all of the Congressional Democrats who tonight are opposed to spending $5 billion on a wall that will help the entire country, something that can actually be built under budget and will actually be effective. Radical Congressman Juan Vargas, who by the way represents areas in the extreme southern portions of California, he's actually even opposing the measly $1.375 billion border deal, saying \"We shouldn't give him a penny for his wall. It was a political stunt. It's a total waste of money.\" Waste of money, coming from California. What a travesty.

      "speaker": "LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST",
      "utterance": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” back in Washington tonight. We have a lot to get to. At any moment, we are expecting the text of the actual border compromise. Well, it's the bill and it's going to drop any moment. We're also awaiting word on whether the President will actually sign it. So, you want to stay with us right through this hour. We're going to be analyzing it line by line for you and you got to know what's in this thing, plus the failure of the high-speed rail project in California. It's one of my favorite issues ever. I've been tracking this for years. It's just the latest in a long line of liberal pie-in-the-sky disasters. My ANGLE will explain what politicians have lied to you along the way and what lessons you can take from this. And also tonight, the revenge of the Esmonde (ph). Why am I having to say this? We told you about this last week. A lot of you apparently are interested in this, okay, and I have a question. Are you celebrating Galentine's Day? This is so disturbing. Raymond Arroyo is with us in a very wild Seen and Unseen tonight. But first, I want all of you to understand what's at stake and what's going on here tonight. No matter what anyone tells you, this so-called border deal is a complete abdication of responsibility by Congress. It has nothing, zero, nada to do -- it doesn't do anything to stem the crush of humanity that we're seeing at our southern border right now. There has been a 290 percent increase in the number of so-called family units illegally crossing into America just in the first four months of this fiscal year. As The Washington Post reported, \"After surrendering to authorities, the families are driven to Border Patrol Stations, where they typically state a fear of deportation and a desire to seek asylum in the United States.\" In most cases, the families are released after a few days and assigned a court date. Last month, an unprecedented 59 percent of all the border apprehensions were comprised of migrants travelling in family groups. Well, what The Post didn't tell you is that 90 percent of these migrants are not really eligible for asylum, but instead have been coached by immigration activists or lawyers or by the other family members or friends already in the United States, and their claims will ultimately be rejected by immigration judges. But, it doesn't matter because most never show up for their hearings and many, during that interim period, have children here. So then, they're never going to be sent back. Democrat lawmakers will invariably say that border crossings are down, they're not up. Well, guess what, don't fall -- don't fall into that trap. That's irrelevant. It's a red-herring. When 1,800 adults and children crossed illegally into the U.S. on Monday alone, including two groups of more than 300 just in El Paso, we have a full-blown border crisis. Smugglers get rich, cartels and infiltrate the caravans and hardworking Americans get stuck with the tab. Education costs, healthcare costs, housing and court-appointed interpreters just to lay out a few budget items. Of course, this could all stop tomorrow if Congress did what it should do tonight, all asylum applications should be filed outside of America. This itself removes the incentive to both storm border checkpoints and to cross illegally. Secondly, the law must be changed to allow for immediate border turn backs. In other words, you come here from Honduras or Guatemala, and you're sent immediately back, which is what we do now with Mexicans who cross illegally. Third, one illegal border crossing and you're out. You're back home and that means back to zero tolerance. Meaning once we caught you, you're deported and you may not apply to return legally to the United States. That would have a powerful deterrent effect to people who want to come, maybe they'll actually apply to come legally. And finally, prosecute more adults for child endangerment. American parents, they're thrown in jail for letting their kids walk home from school alone, let alone putting them in situations where they don't have proper food or water. So, why do illegal aliens get special treatment? Dragging kids through very dangerous territory, the desert; food, water limited; cartels, coyotes, people who will prey on them. That is irresponsible. Those are just a few of my ideas. What are yours? Congress, what are you going to do? Here now, Mark Morgan, Obama's former Border Patrol Chief; Luis Miranda, who's the former Communications Director for the DNC; and Dan Bongino, former -- excuse me, not former, Fox News Contributor. Mark, you've been at the helm of an important enforcement agency in all of this; what did I leave out in my prescriptions?"

And from a border security perspective, this proposal is an absolute failure. They not only didn't listen to the experts on the tools and resources, they needed they have absolutely rejected that. And one thing I want to add that's very important, the American people need to understand what they're doing with ice beds. So think about this. This proposal reduces the ICE beds and I'm not a mathematician, but reduces the ICE beds. As you just point out, the legal aggression is skyrocketing. Again, you don't have to be a mathematician; what does that mean? Catch and release 2.0. They're going to have to release them."

But, I say tonight, they are failing this nation and they are failing to enact the Trump agenda. And then they put him up against the wall saying, \"You're going to shut down the government.\" And this was planned to go this way all along, in my view. Dan?"

You know, here's the problem, Laura. We're dealing with a political party in the Democrats; it has given up on America completely. They've committed to the destruction of our borders, our economy, with this Green New farce and all this other stuff out there. We're having ridiculous arguments like, do walls work? These aren't even sane arguments. We're not dealing with a rational party anymore, so we have one party committed to the destruction of the country as we know it and another party, not all Republicans but a good swath of them, let's be candid, who've abandoned the President and are complete cowards. They were afraid of the media. What do you want the President to do? Hey, guy is in the corner. He's sitting there fighting the swamp sometimes, almost entirely by himself; it's embarrassing."

I mean I'm not going to debate that. I was actually there instead of hearing these people in Washington telling me what I saw with my own eyes. But, this is what the new polling is saying. Fox News poll just out today for support for the border wall; it's up 3 percent from last month. So now, it's up at 46 percent; September, it was 39 percent. But, what they're -- what people are hearing I think is, \"Oh, well, Trump wants to build a wall from sea to shining sea.\" Of course, he has never said that. He wants to build a wall where a wall makes sense. Why? When we see all the waste, fraud and abuse in Washington, D.C., why wouldn't people want to come to our country legally -- we say, good, we want to make you feel more secure about your country. If a wall makes you feel more secure, it's fine with us because we're going to come legally."

    {
      "speaker": "MIRANDA",

And I agree with you, what you said earlier, like let's create points for them to be able to request asylum along the way and let's assign more judges to be able to adjudicate those cases more quickly."

      "utterance": "35 states have accepted high-speed intercity rail money. If there's more money made available, they're ready to get in. When you look at our budget that we hope that we can turn into a transportation bill, $550 billion over six years. I don't know of another time in the history of transportation any President has been so bold to put forth such a plan and such a big vision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, he had blurry vision. Okay, Obama's 2009 stimulus bill dangled billions to states to get them to invest in this high-speed rail. Well now, a lot of states smartly turned down the seed money, knowing full well that the final cost could be a lot more, it could be double or even triple the original projections. So, they didn't want to be left holding the bag. But two of the most reliably Democrat states in America, Hawaii and California, gladly took the money. California received grants of $3.5 billion to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, meaning 100 plus miles of high-speed rail had to go through the Central Valley's beautiful farmland. And as with so many liberal pipe dreams, a myriad of problems dogged this project from the start. The original cost projection for the San Fran to LA track was $45 billion. But soon, the estimate jumped to $77 billion. Now, two years ago, The LA Times diagnosed this situation accurately, saying the California system is being built by an independent authority that has never built anything, and depends on a large network of consultants and contractors for advice. Even after five years of effort to buy property, the rail authority still lacks 25 percent of the parcels for a 29 mile stretch from Madera to Fresno and just over half of the parcels needed for the 118 miles in the Central Valley. And another fun fact, it keeps getting better, to achieve their Nirvana of high-speed rail, Democrats were even willing to throw their other religion under the bus, environmentalism. So, huge opposition to the project developed from greeniacs and also farmers, and that led to mongo delays. So, my friends, this was a joke from the start, and the only people who benefited were the countries that bought our debt to fund it and the consultants who lined their pockets selling this as a panacea for congested roads. Now, this is no different, though, from so many other unnecessary and unwanted liberal projects that require billions to fund and just end up driving us further into debt. I think of Vermont's idea for the single payer dream in 2011 before -- it ended basically before it began when Governor Peter Shumlin realized it had become too costly to implement, and then he just called the whole thing off. Who can forget Obama's solar energy grants to Solyndra and Fisker Automotive, just to name a few. There were five defaulted loans that American taxpayers were on the hook for as a result of that boondoggle. And of course, none of these examples of waste, fraud, and abuse ever mattered to the fanatics on the left. Their goals of their Green New Deal, oh, my God, what does that tell us? It tells us that they are actually doubling down on all the failures of the past. In fact, yesterday, California Governor Gavin Newsom lowered expectations for the project, kind of yanked it from under its feet, but he kept insisting that he won't return the $3.5 billion that his state wasted on this nightmare."

      "speaker": "GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "Abandoning the high-speed rail entirely means we will have wasted billions and billions of dollars with nothing but broken promises, partially fulfilled commitments, and lawsuits to show for it. And with all due respect, I have no interest in sending back $3.5 billion of federal funding that was allocated to this project to President Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, shazam. Isn't that a neato trick? Newsom is basically shutting down huge parts of the high-speed rail project, but he's keeping all of the money. Just moments ago, we had a little tweet-off. The president telling Newsom and California that he wants the money back for the American taxpayers. And Newsom responded in the last few minutes that this is California's money, and, quote, \"We're not giving it back.\" Typical liberal, thinks it's their money -- other people's money is their money. It's the taxpayers' money, Gavin. You know what I was thinking. Think of all of the Congressional Democrats who tonight are opposed to spending $5 billion on a wall that will help the entire country, something that can actually be built under budget and will actually be effective. Radical Congressman Juan Vargas, who by the way represents areas in the extreme southern portions of California, he's actually even opposing the measly $1.375 billion border deal, saying \"We shouldn't give him a penny for his wall. It was a political stunt. It's a total waste of money.\" Waste of money, coming from California. What a travesty. If the new and improved, more socialist Democrats get their hands on the reins of power in 2020 you can bet your bottom dollar that we are all going to be hurtling down the tracks to fiscal ruin and feeling a bit like this."

Now, if the media had bothered to do any homework, be responsible in any way, they would've realized that Phillips was full of it, as behind the scenes video we played on THE INGRAHAM ANGLE showed."

And to make amends, they hired an independent team to reach their own conclusions. Get a load of the wasted resources that came as a result of jumping to conclusions. Four investigators who spent a whopping 240 man hours on this case, they watched 50 hours of videos, interviewed 43 students, sent multiple requests to interview Nathan Phillips, which went ignored, and sat for six hours outside of Phillips' home. After all of that, the report concluded, quote, \"We found no evidence of offensive or racist statements by students to Mr. Phillips or members of his group.\" All this as a result of a leftist mob who wanted so badly to ruin the life of this white kid because it fit their preferred narrative. I would hope that there are some lessons to be learned here. Stop jumping to conclusions. Take a breath before you tar everybody with the worst pejoratives. And unfortunately we know all too well, though, that the mob wonders move on to the next target. Also tonight, the Trump family fighting back against the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who they claim is on a mission to destroy them."

Everything that she does now will be against the public interest because she has created the belief in the public mind that she will abuse her power in order to accomplish her goal. That is a disgraceful message for a public official with law enforcement power to send to the people of the state of New York. And I hope the people who elected her paying attention to the embarrassment that she is bringing to this office. This is like Comey squared, Comey squared. If you can put in your mind a dirty cop coupled with a woman who, I think her language so awful, for a law enforcement official, an attorney general of the state, I think that Trump family has great, great motions against her activities and the lawsuit if she files any.

She can do whatever she wants. That's what courts of appeals are for. If she's abusing her power, we will find out. If she's right, God help Paul Manafort. But she could be wrong. And no federal judges are perfect. Believe me, after watching what the FISA court didn't do and how they were snookered, I would be very careful about paying homage to federal judges these days."

Believe T rather than M?\" Any man that uses three question marks, I guess we all do that. Trump probably uses three question marks. My response. \"This is the same guy,\" Bromwich, \"who represented Blasey-Ford\" in that tour de force performance, \"and represents Andrew McCabe. Obama partisan.\" New podcast dropped today.
