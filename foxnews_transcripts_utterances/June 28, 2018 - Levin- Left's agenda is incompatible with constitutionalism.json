Now, we still don't know if the shooter had a problem with the paper as a whole or with individual employees at the paper. But police says this was a targeted attack and this shooter came in around 2:30 today with a shotgun and smoke grenades. He walked through the first floor of the building, which is this brick building just behind me, and he went through shooting and killing five people, injuring about two more. The police responded, just a ridiculous response time, one minute, maybe just over 60 seconds. Police were there. They went in and they were able to take that shooter into custody without firing a single shot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Just a horrible day here, but police across the board are saying this could have been so much worse if the first responders did not respond as quickly as they did. Now, a little bit more about the shooter as they did. As I said, he's in custody and police say that they are in the process of interviewing him but he has been very uncooperative. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, there was a press conference about half an hour ago. In that press conference, the Anne Arundel deputy police chief could not confirm what I'm about to tell you but Fox has confirmed with a separate Maryland law enforcement official that they were able to identify the gunmen using facial recognition software because -- they had to do that because he mutilated his fingertips in an apparent attempt to make it very difficult to identify him. He didn't have any ID on him. He wouldn't tell the law enforcement what his name was, so they had to use facial recognition software to identify him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, that's why police are saying that he was very well-prepared for this attack. He had it well-planned. He thought it through. Now, police are going through the process of securing his house and getting search warrants so that they can search for the -- search his property. As for this paper, Sean, one reporter said that I can tell you this, quote, we are putting out a damn paper tomorrow, Sean.",

The Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the FBI Director Christopher Wray appearing before the House Judiciary Committee where they were grilled by members of Congress. It was a beat down.

Others are calling for the complete abolition of ICE. Meanwhile many in the media, well, as we predicted, a full mental psychotic breakdown over the news that Justice Anthony Kennedy is retired.

      "sentences": "First of all, I want Americans to understand that the progressive ideology which you hear on the left is incompatible with constitutionalism. And so they've turned the Supreme Court, for them, into a politburo, into a all-powerful, centralized political operation where they want to control a majority of the seats. You notice they don't talk about upholding the Constitution as written. You notice they don't talk about this article or this provision or this section or this clause of the Constitution. When you hear them yuck away on the other networks they are talking about abortion on demand. Same sex marriage, Obamacare and open borders. They give you the same left wing agenda as if they are running for president or running for the Senate that they want in a judicial nominee. That's not how it works. So we don't want a conservative. We don't want a liberal. We want a constitutionalist. A constitutionalist is somebody who has sworn to uphold the Constitution. Look at the Constitution, look at the words. Takes them this context. Tries to figure out what the original intent was and applies it. And the parties before the Supreme Court have a right to expect that that's what the justices will do. But the Democrats are telling the president of the United States, as if you don't nominate Ruth Bader Ginsberg in one form or another, we are going to oppose whomever you nominate. So the Republicans are going to have to steam roll the Democrats. And that's OK. The Democrats have politicize this process where they don't even make any sense. They used to support filibustering it, now they oppose filibustering it. They used to oppose a nomination with one year left in the presidency, now they support it or they support it, now they oppose it in mid-term elections. In other words, forget about Schumer, forget about the Democrats, forget about their agenda and let us uphold the Constitution with our nomination. And I think this president more than most understands that. He ran for office. He had a list. He was extremely transparent. Hillary Clinton didn't have a list because the nation collectively would have puked quite frankly. But this president had his list. He has tremendous candidates on this list. And he said I'm going to choose from this list. So the left has had every opportunity to dig up whatever they can on these various candidates and the president is sticking to the list. And this is very, very important. The Supreme Court is not supposed to be more powerful than the other two branches of government. It's supposed to be independent from them. Justices are appointed for life because they're not to be political. It's gotten way out of whack. And under the left it will be more out of whack. Here's the attitudes of the progressives who really used to attack the Constitution, you know, as written by a bunch of white men who owned slaves. Now they pretend to support it. Here's the position of the left basically. They want to enshrine their ideology into the Constitution. When they say you have to support precedent, they don't really believe that. Dred Scott upholding slavery, that was precedent. Plassy versus Ferguson segregation, that was precedent. Korematsu, the internment of Japanese-Americans, that was precedent. Did they support that precedent? No, what they mean is the most radical decision of the Supreme Court that's what they want to compel, that's what they believe in. Not the Constitution. But the leftist direction that leftist courts have taken the Constitution.",

The -- today, ICE is divided into the homeland security investigations and the enforcement and removal operations. The homeland security investigation are the guys that go after the gang bangers and the drug cartels. The majority of them wrote a letter to the boss today, to the homeland security secretary suggesting that ICE be split in two. That the guys that go after the gang bangers be separated. Men and women be separated from those who remove the citizens, otherwise, law-abiding undocumented immigrants. Hard working like from the gardening company here in Ohio. A 146 of them were arrested.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" My opening monologue in just a few minutes. But, first, as you know, from all the reporting today, tragedy strikes a Maryland. Earlier today, an armed gunmen killed and seriously injured multiple individuals at a newspaper office. This in Annapolis, Maryland. Joining us now with the very latest on this is Kristin Fisher. Kristin, tough day for everybody there. Can you update us on what's going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Sean. Well, police are now confirming that this was indeed a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper. Now, we still don't know if the shooter had a problem with the paper as a whole or with individual employees at the paper. But police says this was a targeted attack and this shooter came in around 2:30 today with a shotgun and smoke grenades. He walked through the first floor of the building, which is this brick building just behind me, and he went through shooting and killing five people, injuring about two more. The police responded, just a ridiculous response time, one minute, maybe just over 60 seconds. Police were there. They went in and they were able to take that shooter into custody without firing a single shot. Just a horrible day here, but police across the board are saying this could have been so much worse if the first responders did not respond as quickly as they did. Now, a little bit more about the shooter as they did. As I said, he's in custody and police say that they are in the process of interviewing him but he has been very uncooperative. Now, there was a press conference about half an hour ago. In that press conference, the Anne Arundel deputy police chief could not confirm what I'm about to tell you but Fox has confirmed with a separate Maryland law enforcement official that they were able to identify the gunmen using facial recognition software because -- they had to do that because he mutilated his fingertips in an apparent attempt to make it very difficult to identify him. He didn't have any ID on him. He wouldn't tell the law enforcement what his name was, so they had to use facial recognition software to identify him. So, that's why police are saying that he was very well-prepared for this attack. He had it well-planned. He thought it through. Now, police are going through the process of securing his house and getting search warrants so that they can search for the -- search his property. As for this paper, Sean, one reporter said that I can tell you this, quote, we are putting out a damn paper tomorrow, Sean."

And it looks like they saved a lot of lives. All right. We turn to our opening monologue. And we'll start with today's huge showdown on Capitol Hill. The Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the FBI Director Christopher Wray appearing before the House Judiciary Committee where they were grilled by members of Congress. It was a beat down. We have so many highlights to bring you tonight, including the worst moments from the very short tempered, extremely pompous Rod Rosenstein, who I'm told who doesn't like me. Now, the deputy A.G. is continuing to obstruct the U.S. House of Representatives and their subpoenas in its effort to check and do their constitutional duty and investigate actions by the FBI and DOJ. Now, House Republicans are fighting back hard, contempt, impeachment, tonight is very much on the table. And also tonight, America's left is ramping up, as I predicted, their disgusting rhetoric, political tactics ahead of the 2018 midterms, and some are actually trying to forcibly shut down Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices across the country. Others are calling for the complete abolition of ICE. Meanwhile many in the media, well, as we predicted, a full mental psychotic breakdown over the news that Justice Anthony Kennedy is retired. Now, it's been a very bad week for Democrats. Sit tight.

We know she committed felonies. We know she obstructed justice. And also, the ongoing Russia collusion witch hunt and the FISA abuse, lying to FISA court judges is by an opposition party candidates in an election year. Now, sadly their efforts, their document requests, their subpoenas, they have been met with nothing but obstruction and hatred, antipathy, and animus from the deputy A.G., who has a bad temper, Rod Rosenstein. And today, some of these House members had a rare opportunity to hold Rosenstein accountable right to his face.

And, by the way, the president can demand at some point everything be handed over, and that will then be a matter of law. Now, although in terms of -- the president has that power. One of the issues at play here, the House investigation into possible coordination between the Clinton campaign and the FBI's initiation of that so-called Trump-Russia, which we now know to be witch hunt. One of the small part of the scandal surrounds Bruce and Nellie Ohr. Look right there, 2016, Nellie was conducting the oppo research for the Clinton campaign. Remember Fusion GPS? Right alongside ex-foreign spy, foreign national Christopher Steele. This of Fusion GPS, all while her husband, Bruce, a high-ranking DOJ official, was the federal government's point of contact for the same Christopher Steele.

If you have evidence that this president acted inappropriately, present it to the American people. There's an old saying that justice delayed is justice denied. I think right now, all of us are being denied. Whatever you got, finish it the hell up, because this country is being torn apart."

Now, Rod Rosenstein, really, when is this witch hunt end? And, Rod, it's your constitutional duty, checks and balances, coequal branches, to provide members of Congress with the subpoenaed documents and information they need so they can do your job -- their job and check your department. In seven days from today, if the DOJ continues this obstruction, I urge every single member of the House to now take action to, yes, move to contempt, and he has, impeachment. Enough is enough. Trey Gowdy was right. And, of course, many Democrats are perfectly fine with DOJ obstruction. Their friends in the deep state have a lot to hide. Now, meanwhile, as Robert Mueller's witch hunt is producing literally zero evidence that the president ever did anything wrong, well, the people on the left -- they are now predictably beginning to unravel. And their favorite new target, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, it's doing the job that Congress passed, their laws. Now, throughout the week, hundreds of left-wing protesters, they, quote, occupied ICE offices all across multiple cities, forcing some to temporarily close their doors on these demonstrators blocked entrances, they obstructed ICE employees, they attempted to camp out in front of the building. \"The Hill\" reported many protesters celebrated the news that their occupation actually prompted delays and some operations at the center, but, quote, this may result in some immigrants being detained for weeks longer than expected. Great job. Now, this all culminated in Washington, D.C., where 575 people were arrested after literally storming the center building. Multiple Democratic lawmakers were in attendance, including one congresswoman from Washington, who was arrested. Now, sadly, this anti-ICE rhetoric from the left, on TV, he's even far worse.

And, of course, they want to make sure that you get paid less. They are campaigning and saying publicly, they want to repeal the Trump tax cut and raise your taxes. And, of course, as you see, they want open borders. They do not want a wall. And number five, they want to destroy whoever the president picks to replace Justice Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. No vision, no betterment of the American people at all. Democrats have no agenda, no real plan for improving this country, helping the forgotten men and women. So, their playbook is all too predictable. It's the one they use every two and four years. A campaign to smear, slam, and, besmirch, assassinate the character of any Trump Republican.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": I don't like this line that I as a Democrat, or an independent or whatever, is trying to take away anything for me. I'm trying to hold onto my personal rights so that you can have the rights you want, because if you take mine, I feel like you're the one with the problem. If you take my right away for me to judge what I do for my family and my body, I got a little problem with that. You got a problem? You don't want people take your guns -- get out of my behind. Get out of my vagina. Get out."

And if you look at the I.G. report, I want to go back to that really quick. We look at Strzok himself, I was looking at a more detail and talking with some sources tonight, and, you know, there is one point where Strzok tried to explain the insurance policy question. Remember, in August, that text message that he sent to Lisa Page about having an insurance policy and talking with Andy McCabe, and he explains it away as saying, well, we were talking about how aggressively were going to be or how overt we were going to be with this investigation. And when I was talking to FBI sources about this, they said, that is so telling, because at that moment in time, when he left that out to Horowitz, when he made that statement, he was basically saying, we are going to go after Trump, even if it means going after the people around him, even if it means putting this information out there in the media, even if it means arresting people for crimes that were committed 10 years ago or maybe they're not even crimes, but just giving that aura around the president.

The DOJ tried to hide the fact that two of the most important investigative investigators on both the Hillary and Russia probes were vehemently anti- Trump. He didn't that out either.

They want to ignore separations of powers, co-equal branches, they side foreign law, and they literally want things legislated from the bench. You have you been way ahead of the curve. But this president wants to choose an originalist. I want you to go through their reaction to this opening now and what it means for the country."

      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "First of all, I want Americans to understand that the progressive ideology which you hear on the left is incompatible with constitutionalism. And so they've turned the Supreme Court, for them, into a politburo, into a all-powerful, centralized political operation where they want to control a majority of the seats. You notice they don't talk about upholding the Constitution as written. You notice they don't talk about this article or this provision or this section or this clause of the Constitution. When you hear them yuck away on the other networks they are talking about abortion on demand. Same sex marriage, Obamacare and open borders. They give you the same left wing agenda as if they are running for president or running for the Senate that they want in a judicial nominee. That's not how it works. So we don't want a conservative. We don't want a liberal. We want a constitutionalist. A constitutionalist is somebody who has sworn to uphold the Constitution. Look at the Constitution, look at the words. Takes them this context. Tries to figure out what the original intent was and applies it. And the parties before the Supreme Court have a right to expect that that's what the justices will do. But the Democrats are telling the president of the United States, as if you don't nominate Ruth Bader Ginsberg in one form or another, we are going to oppose whomever you nominate. So the Republicans are going to have to steam roll the Democrats. And that's OK. The Democrats have politicize this process where they don't even make any sense. They used to support filibustering it, now they oppose filibustering it. They used to oppose a nomination with one year left in the presidency, now they support it or they support it, now they oppose it in mid-term elections. In other words, forget about Schumer, forget about the Democrats, forget about their agenda and let us uphold the Constitution with our nomination. And I think this president more than most understands that. He ran for office. He had a list. He was extremely transparent. Hillary Clinton didn't have a list because the nation collectively would have puked quite frankly. But this president had his list. He has tremendous candidates on this list. And he said I'm going to choose from this list. So the left has had every opportunity to dig up whatever they can on these various candidates and the president is sticking to the list. And this is very, very important. The Supreme Court is not supposed to be more powerful than the other two branches of government. It's supposed to be independent from them. Justices are appointed for life because they're not to be political. It's gotten way out of whack. And under the left it will be more out of whack. Here's the attitudes of the progressives who really used to attack the Constitution, you know, as written by a bunch of white men who owned slaves. Now they pretend to support it. Here's the position of the left basically. They want to enshrine their ideology into the Constitution. When they say you have to support precedent, they don't really believe that. Dred Scott upholding slavery, that was precedent. Plassy versus Ferguson segregation, that was precedent. Korematsu, the internment of Japanese-Americans, that was precedent. Did they support that precedent? No, what they mean is the most radical decision of the Supreme Court that's what they want to compel, that's what they believe in. Not the Constitution. But the leftist direction that leftist courts have taken the Constitution."

Maryland law enforcement they've identified him. I won't give the name out, Geraldo. But here's what we know tonight that we did not know earlier. He lost a defamation case that he brought against this newspaper in 2015. And over a 2011 column he contended defamed him. So, obviously, disgruntled with the paper. The column provided an account of his guilty plea to criminal harassment of a woman on social media. By the way, police were there in 60 seconds, Geraldo. That's how great they are. He was not cooperating with investigators. He had canisters and smoke grenades he used inside the building. He was prepared. He obviously premeditated this evil to shoot people. I mean, just as evil. Look, Geraldo, I want to say one thing. It really is infuriating. It's harsh as I've been against Maxine Waters, these are separate issues and her call to confront people.

And yet if two minutes had gone by or three or four or if the cops chickened out the way they did down in Parkland high school it would have been far worse massacre. So God bless the cops in Maryland who did what they had to do. Also shame on everybody, right and left who blamed what happened today in Maryland on the civility dispute, the debate over this one saying you do this. You bad -- you. It had nothing to do with that. It was a guy with a beef, a guy with a grudge of specific grudge who warned the newspaper over social media, threaten them and then carried out his hideous attacks. So it had nothing to do with political philosophy. This was a beef between a deranged, despicable, murderous SOB who went and vented against the newspaper he claimed had defamed him."

You went through great lengths to put, of what, five or six caveats that you were not connecting the two. You were making a point. I was there. That yes, the rhetoric has gotten hot. And I said in response we could all take the temperature down. There's no doubt about it. But of course, what happens, instead of trying to solve the problem they jumped down your throat, they write the ridiculous op-eds and what happens, nobody talks, Sean, ever. It just becomes a shouting match in both directions. It's really sad this obsession with narratives over facts. You know, Twitter, I had to log off. I'm not -- I haven't tweeted in two hours. I can't take it."

      "utterance": "That's absolutely right true. There is no governor on social media. It's puke coming out of too many mouths. It's really -- it's really disgusting. I have to say this about ICE, though. The story we were booked to talk about. It is not merely the hundreds of protestors who were arrested today around the country who want to, if not abolish then severely reform ICE. The -- today, ICE is divided into the homeland security investigations and the enforcement and removal operations. The homeland security investigation are the guys that go after the gang bangers and the drug cartels. The majority of them wrote a letter to the boss today, to the homeland security secretary suggesting that ICE be split in two. That the guys that go after the gang bangers be separated. Men and women be separated from those who remove the citizens, otherwise, law-abiding undocumented immigrants. Hard working like from the gardening company here in Ohio. A 146 of them were arrested. I think the agency could conceivably be split because the backlash for that horrible family separation is not just among civilians. It is even among the agents themselves, Sean."

And then evil manifests itself in so many forms. We pray for the families tonight. Those who lost loved ones and those who are healing in hospitals tonight. Thank you for being with us.
