We talked about Justice Gorsuch a lot and some of these lower court nominees that have confirmed from the president that are very good. And then, tomorrow or the next day, the president is going to sign a terrific tax reform bill that's going to cut taxes for 80 percent of the American people and make our international position, in terms of the corporate rate much more competitive than it has been.

Exactly how President Obama refused to allow the Bush tax cuts for the middle-class to expire in 2012. He made them permanent. It's the same dynamic. It's misleading argument.",

President Trump's top aide on national security issues, Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters point blank in recent days that everywhere you find turmoil around the world, Iran has its hands all over it. A much different approach from former President Barack Obama who allegedly cut back drastically on what was known as Operation Cassandra, a massive effort to stop cocaine shipments into the U.S. by Hezbollah. A terror group, of course, closely aligned with Iran. Based on interviews with dozens of participants familiar with the Obama administration's dealings, Politico reports, \"When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Obama justice and Treasury Departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.\" Now, allies of the former president have responded by insisting he was tough on Hezbollah with sanctions.

U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley agrees, pointing to recent seizures of weapons in the Gulf of Oman that are of Iranian origin. Ambassador Haley calls it a flaming red siren.

You know, when you hear Nancy Pelosi say it's the worst bill she has ever seen because families will actually have more money in their pockets, because they can do a lot more with it than what Washington might do. It shows you the divide here in this country. I want to be on the side of the people who want to actually put more money back in the pockets of workers, and finally get our economy moving again. And that's what this bill will do. We're going to pass it, finally, to the president's desk tomorrow morning.

It's going to be hard for Democrats to take that away. And if you look at tax cuts in the past, because of Senate rules, they can't all be made permanent. But at the end of the day, I feel very confident they will ultimately be able to make them permanent because you're going to see how well this economy does with this kind of tax relief for families and the simplification. Don't under estimate the power of simplifying the tax code in a way that under our bill 90 percent of Americans will be able to do their taxes on a postcard. So, those are all great components of the bill -- making our country competitive, bringing all those jobs back that we have seen leave over the last decade.

You got to go back to Reagan to find something anywhere close to this, and that worked really well for our economy. But look, as the speaker said this morning, there is a lot more work to do. 2018's going to be a busy year not only seeing the economy move again, but now we're going to actually go and help improve the lives of even more people by doing welfare reform. We're going to need workers. When you see all of these companies hiring tens of thousands of people, you know, you're going to see unemployment dip down, but all those people that gave up looking for work under those last eight years of President Obama's failed policies, they're going to be able to get back into the workforce."

Those two things combined, save over $230 billion of taxpayer money over the long term -- that's real money. And then, if you look at welfare reform, Medicaid reform.

Let's reform this broken welfare system that traps people and denies them opportunity. Let's reform Medicaid which is our most broken form of healthcare. And if you start with those two, look at what you can do not only to help people get more opportunities but to save hundreds of billions of dollars in money that's right now not being spent the right way.

So, people like me who had issues with him as a candidate, we have to move forward with the new reality, which is he's the leader of the free world and praise and criticize as we see fit. And there have been a number of things, especially recently, to praise. We talked about Justice Gorsuch a lot and some of these lower court nominees that have confirmed from the president that are very good. And then, tomorrow or the next day, the president is going to sign a terrific tax reform bill that's going to cut taxes for 80 percent of the American people and make our international position, in terms of the corporate rate much more competitive than it has been. So, I think it serves no purpose for Trump skeptics like myself to sit here and pretend like when he does things that are good, it's not good. Just because of some sort of personal animus.

I mean, he has tasked historic tax reform for the first time in three decades since Ronald Reagan was in office. He is clawing back the regulatory state in this country, getting rid of regulations that have been a wet blanket on the economy at a rate faster than Ronald Reagan -- and the results are very clear. We've had two quarters of plus three percent growth in the New York fed just announced that they're expecting almost four percent growth in the fourth quarter. He got where he could put Justice Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and he's filling the Appellate Courts which end up making the final say on tens of thousands of decisions with young, conservative judges who are going to be there for decades. This is revolutionary stuff, and that's just domestic policy. There is foreign policy I could get in to, too. But, he is accomplishing a record of massive achievement.

And so, the one line that the Democrats love to repeat is, oh, by 2027, by which point the average American family would have gotten $7,000 of tax relief by 2027 it might expire. I think every Democrat should be asked every day will you pledge not to allow the Republican middle-class tax cuts to expire in 2027?

There is the hallway and here he comes as he is -- is this from earlier today or is this live? That's earlier today. But we are waiting for him to leave the room. It's been going on for hours and hours. No doubt he is being grilled by the likes of Congressman Trey Gowdy, Congressman Peter King on the Hipski Committee as we call it -- the House Select Intelligence Committee. They have a lot of question for Andrew McCabe, and as you know Trey Gowdy spoke with us last week and said that he'd be a little surprised if Andrew McCabe was still in his job at the FBI this week. He is. He did he show up to testify today. Last week, he said he had a scheduling conflict and couldn't make it, but he did show up today, and he's been in that room as I say for many hours, and we're watching for him to exit as we wait this evening at 7:21 Eastern Time. So, he is on the hot seat as I said. Highly anticipated moment on Capitol Hill. He's really the man at the center of so much of what we've been talking about. He knows the inner workings of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, of her exoneration. He was there side by side with James Comey at the time. He then moved right from that into the heart of the Russia probe. And we now know that members of his team were so biased against the president that they had to be removed from the special counsel's team -- part of this whole thing. So, what happens now? Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley says that he believes that McCabe, \"ought to be replaced because of all of this.\" And we also know that today they were discussing, no doubt, the cryptic text messages of the former fellow investigator Peter Strzok. Here's Congressman Jim Jordan laying in to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week. Watch this."

And Mr. Strzok says this, I want to believe the fact you threw consideration in Andy's office. Then, there's a break, dash, it says that there is no way he gets elected, no way Trump gets elected. He says, I want to believe that. You said that in a meeting in Andrew McCabe's office, I want to believe that, but then he goes, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. This goes to intent."

Jordan and other Republicans are demanding subpoenas for Strzok, for his lover, Lisa Page, also Bruce and Nellie Ohr who are married. Bruce Ohr has been demoted in his role in the special counsel investigation. His wife Nellie worked for Fusion GPS. So, as you can see it's a pretty tangled web that has been woven here. Here now Congressman Andy Biggs and Matt Gaetz, both are on the House Judiciary Committee and both have called for the resignation of Robert Mueller in this investigation. Gentlemen, welcome. Good to have you here tonight. Let me start with you Congressman Gaetz. You know, your thoughts on what likely transpired in there today. It's a classified briefing. So, it's limited in terms of what we know at this point."

And then as you correctly noted, the very scheme that was hatched by Peter Strzok and his mistress Lisa Page seems to have been hatched in Andy McCabe's presence. So, this is a very critical witness for us to be able to get to the bottom of this information. I don't want this testimony to just occur behind closed doors. One of the things Congressman Biggs and I are fighting for are subpoenas so that before the judiciary committee and all of the American people, we can get answers to these questions, expose the bias that we know exists and ensure that we have a rule of law that we can rely on again in this country."

And the reality is, we need them to come in. The American people need to them to come in because the bias is so palpable, it's so real. And, you know, when that happenings, nobody believes that the -- anybody's going to get a fair investigation in any level. So, it's just begins stinking from top to bottom. And that's not the way for this good agency to be. We need to get rid of the bad apples in there and we need them to come testify how they were trying to influence whether it's the Hillary's investigation and that goes back years as well as the election itself."

The judiciary, obviously, has oversight of the Justice Department and the FBI, which is an integral part of that as well. You know, are you going to be speaking with him further about moves that you would like to see take place at the FBI so that they can remove this cloud from over their organization?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, absolutely. This is about more than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. We need to ensure that we have an FBI going forward that is transparent, that is subject to sufficient oversight and redundancies to ensure that we know what is going on. We never again want to be in a situation where you get an ego maniac FBI director like James Comey who can totally depart from standard procedures in one investigation and then can concrete an environment where a pro-Hillary bias can exist. And then right on the back of it, the very people executing on the pro-Hillary bias, end up working on the investigation, persecuting President Trump with this very anti-Trump bias that is totally indefensible. It's one of the reasons why the American people agree with us. Harvard University just released a poll showing that 54 percent of Americans agree that the Mueller probe is biased and these people were acting on plans to discredit the duly elected president of the United States. That's what we have to stop."

Very interesting contrast that as President Trump was unveiling his national security strategy over the last 24 hours that was tough on terror and based on his America first campaign platform, \"\"Politico\"\" was breaking a major exclusive charging the Obama administration actually protected that drug ring run by the terror group Hezbollah all to save its controversial nuclear deal with Iran. President Trump's top aide on national security issues, Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters point blank in recent days that everywhere you find turmoil around the world, Iran has its hands all over it. A much different approach from former President Barack Obama who allegedly cut back drastically on what was known as Operation Cassandra, a massive effort to stop cocaine shipments into the U.S. by Hezbollah. A terror group, of course, closely aligned with Iran. Based on interviews with dozens of participants familiar with the Obama administration's dealings, Politico reports, \"When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Obama justice and Treasury Departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.\" Now, allies of the former president have responded by insisting he was tough on Hezbollah with sanctions. And that the Politico story notes itself there is no direct evidence that the Obama administration undermined Project Cassandra directly in order to save the Iran deal. But conservatives jumping on a comment in that article by Obama CIA director John Brennan who asserted the administration was just trying to build up moderate elements within Hezbollah."

You know, obviously when you look at terror organizations around the globe, drug trafficking is one of the main ways that they raise money to fund their operations. So you would want to go after to cutting that off in order to do that, but it looks, Mollie, as if according to this report in \"\"Politico\"\" that the Obama administration wanted to look the other way in order to get the Iran deal signed."

Looking at how all these people in the DEA were chasing down leads on the massive influx of cocaine into the United States and not just that. I mean, that's one big part of it. Also about how a major Hezbollah operative who was indicted by U.S. courts for trying to kill American government employees was allowed to skate free. This is a guy who a lot of people believed reports directly to Vladimir Putin. And for people concerned about collusion with Russia or Putin to advance bad aims, this seems just like part of a pattern of sublimating everything in our foreign policy agenda to push forth a nuclear deal with a state sponsor of terror where we gave them $150 billion in concessions for very little to nothing in return.

I think that the Obama administration officials pushing back are doing exactly what they should be doing, talking about the kind of higher principles of all of this and also saying that they didn't actually just abandon Project Cassandra, the name of it, to do this. But we all know that there are things that you have to do if you want to get diplomatic things done when you are working with someone that you think it's better to be in bed with than just openly opposing, which is what we have done with Iran. No one is pretending that Iran is our best friend. We know they chant death to America, but we also know that as of now they are complying with the deal. Rex Tillerson has said that. Nikki Haley last week or maybe just yesterday, and said that there was evidence that they weren't, but defense officials pushing back on that.

There are some parallels here to perhaps to what the Trump administration wanted to do to open up the conversation, the dialogue, they were believers to some extent, right or wrong that a better relationship with Russia was worth some of that.

And the Obama administration unfortunately and I'm sure they had good motivation, but they worked to apiece this very dangerous nefarious force that has destabilized the entire region. It was a huge foreign policy blunder and we're now having to re-orient ourselves and the entire region. You are always playing with bad actors when you are focused on the Middle East, but they chose the worst of the bunch, a group that is a state-sponsor of terrorism. And this is not appropriate.

The missile intercepted on its way to the royal palace in the capital city of Riyadh is the second projectile in two months fired deep inside the Saudi kingdom. In November, the Houthi rebels in Yemen also fired a missile at Saudi Arabia's international airport targeting civilians. Saudi officials say that missile was intercepted as well but some believe there is evidence the missile may have hit near its intended target. Even though Yemen is flooded with both small arms and heavy weapons, Saudi Arabia believes this latest attack is proof positive that Iran is continuing to support the Houthi rebels and continuing to supply them with missiles. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley agrees, pointing to recent seizures of weapons in the Gulf of Oman that are of Iranian origin. Ambassador Haley calls it a flaming red siren. Watch."

It will continue to grow unless we raise the cost of defying the international community.

The Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the rebels for three years. Saudi crown prince Salman is also trying to lead his country in anti-corruption and austerity drive, hoping to revive an economy hammered by falling oil prices, though it's notable two weeks ago the crown prince did scrape together about $450 million to buy Leonardo da Vinci's \"Portrait Of Christ,\" the most money ever spent for a single piece of art.

      "utterance": "You remember Sally Yates, she was fired as acting attorney general by President Trump early really in the administration after she refused to defend his administration's travel ban executive order back in January that was. And now she is sounding off in a new op-ed, and though not naming the president directly, she is clearly taking digs at him as she questions the direction of our country. And without apologies to Thomas Jefferson, she offers her own annotated version of the constitution or the preamble. She writes this quote, \"We the people of the United States, we are a democratic republic not a dictatorship -- in parenthesis -- in order to form a more perfect union, her notes, we are a work in progress dedicated to a noble pursuit, establish justice, we revere justice as the corner stone of our democracy, insure domestic tranquility, we prize unity and peace and not divisiveness and discord, provide for the common defense, and she writes, we should never give any foreign adversary reason to question our solidarity.\" She went on from there, but you get the idea. Here now, Jonathan Turley, George Washington University law professor and a constitutional attorney. Good to have you with us. So, with no apologies to Thomas Jefferson, she just wants to make some, you know, corner of the page notes to sort of update all of us on how we should understand these words, Jonathan."

      "utterance": "I much prefer the original. It just seems to flow better. It is sort of funny we are having this pattern. You know, James Comey has been responding to every bad story against Trump with sort of celebratory quotes as a way of not directly commenting and then you have this. It's like the next op-ed will be, you know, strategy in bridge and how to avoid the Trump and your opponent. The meaning is obviously there and all these metaphors and analogies really aren't hiding anything. So, the question really is whether she should be the messenger of this particular message. You know, she talks about the need of the department to be apolitical and yet she is widely been criticized for what she did at the Department of Justice at the very end of her career."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. She says, \"The rule of law depends on apolitical law enforcement. We need strict separation between the Justice Department and the White House,\" she writes, which is interesting on a number of notes. And I just want to remind everyone that as we said in the beginning, she refused to defend the president's travel ban when she was acting as his attorney general and then she was fired for that. She got an email from Andrew Weissmann applauding her decision to not back the travel ban. Andrew Weissmann, I would remind everybody at home is now part of the special counsel team. He said, \"I am so proud and in awe. Thank you so much. All of my deepest respects, Andrew Weissmann.\" Which is fine for him to, you know, let her know how he feels except that he is now part of this investigation, Jonathan."

      "utterance": "Well, you know, the action that she took I thought was unwarranted. I was very critical of it. It's unprecedented for an acting attorney general or attorney general to order the entire agency to stand down and not assist the president. Ultimately, judges divided on the issue. The Trump administration recently secured a major victory in the Supreme Court. But that doesn't mean that the people that were opposing the ban were acting in bad faith. It was a close question. But that actually undermines what Yates did. I mean, she told basically all the Justice Department attorneys including those that believed the president had the law on his side, that they couldn't help the president of the United States. Now, if you want to be apolitical, you can resign if you think that you are being asked to do something unconstitutional. She wasn't. But you don't order an entire department of the federal government not to assist the sitting president of the United States."

They're going to put themselves on the same slippery slope that we've seen in Facebook and what we have seen on college campuses is that people tend to be very subjective in what they consider to be hateful."

Here is his response to the 8-year-old. \"Dear Michelle, I was about to get your letter about trying to stop the Russians from bombing the North Pole and risking the life of Santa Claus. I share your concern about the atmospheric testing of the Soviet Union not only for the North Pole but for countries throughout the world. However you must not worry about Santa Claus. I talked to him yesterday and he is fine. He will be making his rounds again this Christmas. Sincerely, John Kennedy.\" That is our story for tonight. Thanks for being with us.
