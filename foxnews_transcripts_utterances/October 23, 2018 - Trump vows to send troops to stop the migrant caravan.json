They always keep saying that the caravan is blooming like it's some kind of natural event or that is spontaneous. But, no, it's actually quite organized. It's organized by, actually, Mexican advocacy groups. And then, when you get to the sizable group of people in which you can't tell who's in the group and who isn't, which is why you need a process, because there could be terrorists and, obviously, there could not be terrorists, but who's going to know? So, the media then takes the narrative and they twist it. So after helping the onslaught multiply, right, the accused Trump of seizing it as an issue when beforehand, it was the media and the advocacy groups who had seized on this spectacle to begin with to create an ugly political issue. And then they go, but look what Trump is doing. They're a bunch of hypocrites. And you know what's even sadder? Avenatti is telling the Democrats to grow a spine.

They're going to assume that the president is saying incorrect things. And some of the reporting coming out of there is very interesting, 80 percent of those people in the migrant caravan are males under the age of 35, and they're not fleeing violence. These are economic refugees. And you know what they told the Washington Post? When they get there and start making money in America, they're going to wire the money back to El Salvador. Some of these people are gang affiliated. A lot of these people also have been previously deported, and that's been confirmed.

Or this 600 migrants that were found dead in Texas because of the choke hold the cartels have on -- not only those governments south of us but also those people, including the fact that an entire police office was arrested for corruption in Jalisco. So this -- the border security is a small portion of the absolute crisis that is going down south. And the humanitarian crisis aspect of it is because of the porous border and the lack of the laws that we have to keep strong. And then, secondly, about the military and about these military comments, you need to understand that the National Guard comes under state authority, obviously, with federal funds. The president can federalize them. Active-duty military, the exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the fact that it's active duty military is a support, not in law enforcement role, and that's how that is legal.

Joe Biden is all about himself. And so I feel like that transparency is so obvious, and it just reminded me of the fatigue I've had during the last administration. I think moving forward, the most important thing is the messaging in those last two weeks and also the fact that we need to galvanize on both sides what gets people to the midterm elections is being galvanized for a specific issue, obviously. And the GOP cannot remain complacent or victorious after the Kavanaugh hearings given the fact that the Democrats have sworn to move for impeachment if they take control of the house, plus a whole host of other issues. But I do feel it's important for the GOP, should they want to maintain the lead, that they remain galvanize and impassioned about it because otherwise the blue wave -- some have said that the blue wave, by calling it that, it leads to complacency.

You know, other Republican presidents have tiptoed around branding the Democrats. And Donald Trump has just gone in there and just gone all in. And it's very refreshing to see a president so unafraid to label Democrats as soft on crime, open borders, socialists. And in the age of television, and twitter, and social media, these tightly round political slogans go viral lightning fast and just have overwhelms the Democrats, have overwhelmed the media. And it's just an overwhelming onslaught that the president has unleashed on his political enemies. And if you're not even the political viewer, as like an advertising executive or a communications director, it's just amazing to watch the raw talent on display while he smothers yet brands his political enemies so effectively the Democrats can't even come up for air.

You've got families here, looking for food, looking for water. The Mexicans have been very generous to them and provided them with this kind of stuff. Tomorrow morning, 5 a.m., they leave here for the next time. That's a 42- mile walk, we are told. You know, immigration from Central America is somewhat discretionary. Remember that when President Trump was elected in that March of '17, there were 16,000 immigrants apprehended. Last month, that was over 50,000. So the message down there for these individuals -- and I've talked to them -- is you can get into the United States. But it's remarkable, Jesse, the amount of naivety and how uninformed a lot of people are as to what they're going to say when they get to the border. When they might get there or what city they're going to go to. They're remarkably uninformed. That, of course, often changes when you get up to, say, Tijuana, and they start talking to American lawyers about what they might say. But I mean, I literally talked to about a dozen women today about their families and saying, \"Listen, what are you going to say? Where are you going to go?\" And they simply said, \"I'm leaving poverty, and I need a better life.\" There was no even word mentioned of asylum. That's the kind of thing I'm hearing. But that could all change. The trip to Tijuana is about 2400 miles. That could be two to three months, rather, traveling by foot. They've got a lot of kids here.

But the U.N. secretary general has put reinforcements down in Mexico ad working with agencies down there to help that government, along with other member-nation states, deal with the crisis. And he said specifically that -- he called for the principle of full respect for countries' rights to manage their own borders. So globally, there's an agreement here that it isn't just about us.

And what the Dems have done is, any issue in which you ask for a process, you are deemed as hateful, intolerant, or racist. So whether it's borders, national security. Like, if you're anti-terror, well, obviously, you're Islamophobic. If you're pro-borders, you hate -- you hate everybody down south. Law & order, you're pro-brutality. So you look at all these. You look at borders, national security, and law and order. These are the things that create a prosperous, free, secure country.

Who called it a caravan? How is the event being managed? Who are the people managing it? They always keep saying that the caravan is blooming like it's some kind of natural event or that is spontaneous. But, no, it's actually quite organized. It's organized by, actually, Mexican advocacy groups. And then, when you get to the sizable group of people in which you can't tell who's in the group and who isn't, which is why you need a process, because there could be terrorists and, obviously, there could not be terrorists, but who's going to know? So, the media then takes the narrative and they twist it. So after helping the onslaught multiply, right, the accused Trump of seizing it as an issue when beforehand, it was the media and the advocacy groups who had seized on this spectacle to begin with to create an ugly political issue. And then they go, but look what Trump is doing. They're a bunch of hypocrites. And you know what's even sadder? Avenatti is telling the Democrats to grow a spine. When Michael Avenatti becomes your voice of reason for your party, you're in trouble?"

Right now, I think the only people who've sent reporters down to embedded in the caravan, Fox News, we have Sarah Carter down there."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "And William La Jeunesse as well. The Washington Post has someone down there. And Judicial Watch even has someone down there. There's just not a lot of interest in the mainstream media, so when Trump says something about the caravan, there's no way for them to fact-check it. They're going to assume that the president is saying incorrect things. And some of the reporting coming out of there is very interesting, 80 percent of those people in the migrant caravan are males under the age of 35, and they're not fleeing violence. These are economic refugees. And you know what they told the Washington Post? When they get there and start making money in America, they're going to wire the money back to El Salvador. Some of these people are gang affiliated. A lot of these people also have been previously deported, and that's been confirmed. So, if they're really that upset about the conditions in their country, instead of marching up north to America, march against your own corrupt government. That would solve a lot of problems in my opinion."

I read today where Stephen King, the horror film -- horror book writer said, you know, that the Republican campaign theme here is be afraid. Don't be brave, be afraid. And therefore, even today the president, who suggested, oh, guess what, there could be Middle Eastern terrorists among these people. They're all gang members. Today, he said, well, we don't have proof but they could be, couldn't be."

      "utterance": "No. And I also want -- I want to point out two things here. Number one, that this humanitarian crisis pre-existed this caravan. And to me, the mixed messaging and hypocrisy is coming from the left who are ignoring the fact that 16 journalists were killed this year alone in Mexico, and all of the attention is on Khashoggi. Or this 600 migrants that were found dead in Texas because of the choke hold the cartels have on -- not only those governments south of us but also those people, including the fact that an entire police office was arrested for corruption in Jalisco. So this -- the border security is a small portion of the absolute crisis that is going down south. And the humanitarian crisis aspect of it is because of the porous border and the lack of the laws that we have to keep strong. And then, secondly, about the military and about these military comments, you need to understand that the National Guard comes under state authority, obviously, with federal funds. The president can federalize them. Active-duty military, the exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the fact that it's active duty military is a support, not in law enforcement role, and that's how that is legal. So the conflating of the issue and the hyperbole from the left, they're saying that they're going to start shooting people is absolutely offensive and totally incorrect."

And they highlight -- they try to get away from the divisiveness while totally doing the same thing themselves. Obama referenced himself, what was it? Ninety-two times in 38 minutes. Joe Biden is all about himself. And so I feel like that transparency is so obvious, and it just reminded me of the fatigue I've had during the last administration. I think moving forward, the most important thing is the messaging in those last two weeks and also the fact that we need to galvanize on both sides what gets people to the midterm elections is being galvanized for a specific issue, obviously. And the GOP cannot remain complacent or victorious after the Kavanaugh hearings given the fact that the Democrats have sworn to move for impeachment if they take control of the house, plus a whole host of other issues. But I do feel it's important for the GOP, should they want to maintain the lead, that they remain galvanize and impassioned about it because otherwise the blue wave -- some have said that the blue wave, by calling it that, it leads to complacency. The same can happen with the GOP as well. That it's messaging it's important."

Then he's also said we plan to change the rules on lesbians, gays, transsexuals, so that people are defined by who they are registered as at birth.

These are really withering attacks that no other previous Republican president has ever really unleashed on the Democratic Party. You know, other Republican presidents have tiptoed around branding the Democrats. And Donald Trump has just gone in there and just gone all in. And it's very refreshing to see a president so unafraid to label Democrats as soft on crime, open borders, socialists. And in the age of television, and twitter, and social media, these tightly round political slogans go viral lightning fast and just have overwhelms the Democrats, have overwhelmed the media. And it's just an overwhelming onslaught that the president has unleashed on his political enemies. And if you're not even the political viewer, as like an advertising executive or a communications director, it's just amazing to watch the raw talent on display while he smothers yet brands his political enemies so effectively the Democrats can't even come up for air. And when it comes to Barack Obama taking credit for the economy, remember he said, oh, yeah, it's like someone has a magic wand and thinks they can bring all the jobs back.

Every day we were talking about Hillary Clinton here. President Obama is a better campaigner. The race is very close in the midterms. If in the next two weeks we are talking about left-wing mobs and the caravan, then the fertile ground could go to the Republicans.

They used the same messaging about fear and race and everything on Mitt Romney, on McCain, on Bush, on Paul Ryan. They've done -- this is a different time. That's king of bogus. The Democrats were like a fat boxer and they hoping that the clinches will safe them. So they've to get close and they got to get intense, but they're miserable. I saw an ad that was made by the Democrats featuring the resistance, the Kavanaugh hearings, Alyssa Milano, it galvanize me.

But the other thing that I don't like about lottery, and I say this every time we do this, you have greater odds of being murdered or dying of a disease, so why root for something that has less odds than your own miserable death? Why? Because if you're going to rely on luck, means you can't curse luck if something bad strikes, right? If you're rooting for something that's really rare, something equally bad can happen to you.

What's going on down there, William?"

      "utterance": "Well, Jesse, let me say they are -- they spent last night here. I'm in the town of Huixtla. Obviously, there's a lot of garbage here. They're trying to clean that up. You can see this is -- they've taken over pretty much the entire town square. Seven thousand people, all these other side streets, as well. You've got families here, looking for food, looking for water. The Mexicans have been very generous to them and provided them with this kind of stuff. Tomorrow morning, 5 a.m., they leave here for the next time. That's a 42- mile walk, we are told. You know, immigration from Central America is somewhat discretionary. Remember that when President Trump was elected in that March of '17, there were 16,000 immigrants apprehended. Last month, that was over 50,000. So the message down there for these individuals -- and I've talked to them -- is you can get into the United States. But it's remarkable, Jesse, the amount of naivety and how uninformed a lot of people are as to what they're going to say when they get to the border. When they might get there or what city they're going to go to. They're remarkably uninformed. That, of course, often changes when you get up to, say, Tijuana, and they start talking to American lawyers about what they might say. But I mean, I literally talked to about a dozen women today about their families and saying, \"Listen, what are you going to say? Where are you going to go?\" And they simply said, \"I'm leaving poverty, and I need a better life.\" There was no even word mentioned of asylum. That's the kind of thing I'm hearing. But that could all change. The trip to Tijuana is about 2400 miles. That could be two to three months, rather, traveling by foot. They've got a lot of kids here. I saw a lot of people today with foot injuries, going in for medications. Dehydration. Several people collapsed from heat stroke. So it's not an ideal situation, especially for the children. Back to you."

And we have, in fact, done much. We need comprehensive immigration reform at the moment to deal with people who are inside the United States. But even with this caravan, it's not the case like anybody thinks these guys could run over the border and just do they want to do. They have to go through -- this is a popular republican phrase of the moment -- due process in applying for asylum or whatever. And as William La Jeunesse just said, I thought that report was terrific, because he's talking about families and people who are fleeing economic disaster. And he's not talking about anybody from the Middle East or any MS-13 gang member. So I mean, you know, get it straight, folks. Wake up. You're being used."

I want to point out the fact that a lot of coverage has been kind of -- and national conversation has been about the duality of the United States and Mexican governments, that it's incumbent upon these two governments to somehow fix or address the problem. But the U.N. secretary general has put reinforcements down in Mexico ad working with agencies down there to help that government, along with other member-nation states, deal with the crisis. And he said specifically that -- he called for the principle of full respect for countries' rights to manage their own borders. So globally, there's an agreement here that it isn't just about us. But also that border security should be respected in that, and I'm curious know, too, how many of those -- the members of the caravan are seeing that, is seeing any type of international presence?"

And they could be refugees. They could be non-refugees. They could be gang members. What kind of word would be useful here to figure it out? A process. And what the Dems have done is, any issue in which you ask for a process, you are deemed as hateful, intolerant, or racist. So whether it's borders, national security. Like, if you're anti-terror, well, obviously, you're Islamophobic. If you're pro-borders, you hate -- you hate everybody down south. Law & order, you're pro-brutality. So you look at all these. You look at borders, national security, and law and order. These are the things that create a prosperous, free, secure country. So now you have a prosperous, free and secure country, and what do the Democrats want to do? They want to take those things that made that country what it is. And if you disagree with it, if you disagree with it, you are a racist, just like Barack Obama was ten years ago when he said that, because apparently, according to the logic of Juan today, what Barack Obama said there today is clearly racist."
