The question is, first of all, the Senate parliamentarian decided that, no, you can't put in immigration reform or a pathway to citizenship in a budget bill. Then you have the moderates versus the progressives. This is how the A.P. writes, \"A budget bill reopens moderate versus progressive divide for Dems. One side is energized by the prospect of the greatest expansion of government support since the Dew Neal nearly a century ago. The other is fearful about dramatically expanding Washington's reach at an enormous cost. The finished product could alienate centrists who say it goes too far or frustrate those on the left who argue it's too timid at a moment of great consequence.\" With that, let's start with our panel, expanded tonight, FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina, and Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Brit, let me start with you.

It's kind of the skipping the step, how many licks does it take to get to the center of the tootsie pop. And I think that unfortunately here, by trying to cram so much into this package, they have created a scenario where there are many moderates, not just the ones that we know about publicly, who are not going to go along with something this massive. And the other side, as you suggested, the left is really not satisfied with this. It doesn't do as much as they want it to do. So I think, unfortunately, this thing is rolling towards really hard brick wall politically, and it's probably going to be the last major piece of legislation they are able to get through or get to this point before the midterms.",

      "utterance": "Well, the $3.5 trillion bill, is it in jeopardy? The question is, first of all, the Senate parliamentarian decided that, no, you can't put in immigration reform or a pathway to citizenship in a budget bill. Then you have the moderates versus the progressives. This is how the A.P. writes, \"A budget bill reopens moderate versus progressive divide for Dems. One side is energized by the prospect of the greatest expansion of government support since the Dew Neal nearly a century ago. The other is fearful about dramatically expanding Washington's reach at an enormous cost. The finished product could alienate centrists who say it goes too far or frustrate those on the left who argue it's too timid at a moment of great consequence.\" With that, let's start with our panel, expanded tonight, FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina, and Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital. Brit, let me start with you. It seems like always Speaker Pelosi has pulled a rabbit out of a hat when it comes to legislation. But these majorities are slim for Democrats. Tied essentially in the Senate, and only four in the House. It seems like a heavy lift what we are hearing so far."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Yes, it does, Bret. I think all of these problems they are running into with this massive bill are a function of trying to act as if you have a massive mandate when you have basically no mandate at all. This is really -- they really have a staggeringly ambitious spending agenda, also social agenda with a tied Senate and a tiny handful of votes in their majority in the House. It was probably never going to work, and it looks like it is not going to work. And the decision by the parliamentarian was obvious and obviously correct. So I think that's where we are, big bill, no mandate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Ben, where does this go? You have got the House essentially holding the other bill, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, hostage until they deal with the $3.5 trillion, or at least that's how it sets up right now. BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think this is looking like a rolling disaster, and it's very unfortunate for the Biden administration given that the White House is really only going to get one bite at the apple here. It's kind of the skipping the step, how many licks does it take to get to the center of the tootsie pop. And I think that unfortunately here, by trying to cram so much into this package, they have created a scenario where there are many moderates, not just the ones that we know about publicly, who are not going to go along with something this massive. And the other side, as you suggested, the left is really not satisfied with this. It doesn't do as much as they want it to do. So I think, unfortunately, this thing is rolling towards really hard brick wall politically, and it's probably going to be the last major piece of legislation they are able to get through or get to this point before the midterms."

Now is the time to start representing working families on all of these issues."

      "utterance": "So, good to be with you. I think Democrats in the Congress have to remember that for 40 years Democrats controlled the Congress until 94. Newt Gingrich and Republicans brought in a revolution. And over the last 28 years, the country has enamored themselves with wanting results, and they've changed the majority four times. Democrats in the majority now. Democrats should take the victory that's in front of them. It's time to reset here. I listen to liberals, I listen to the moderates. But, more importantly, I listen to the country. Joe Biden was elected to unify the country and help stabilize and bring us around an agenda that could advance the country. Democrats would be good to look to that. And once you get a victory, then you figure out the next victory. But Democrats, liberal and moderate alike, should realize you could lose this majority and you would deserve it if you don't take the victory right in front of you and live to fight and advance another day."

But I guarantee you she is not going to get Senator Sinema in order. Harold is right, it's a 50-50 country. Bernie Sanders was too crazy to even be the nominee of the Democrat Party. So why would the entire country let him set the agenda? It's a narrow majority. And Republicans would be wise to ask, why is Elizabeth MacDonough having to save the republic? Because you can't win a Senate seat in Georgia, that's why."

It is said of military generals that they are always fighting the last war. I guess you could say the same for law enforcement officials involved in this effort over the weekend. They were fighting the last war, and what they got was some pale imitation of that, a pathetic little paltry turnout unsupported by most Republican or most conservative organizations, not even supported or endorsed by Donald Trump. It was a fiasco."
