It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" This is a Fox News alert. You are looking live at a massive fire engulfing the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France. The spire of the over 850 year old landmark collapsing, the city's mayor ordering those living close to the burning cathedral to evacuate in case of a possible collapse. Crews working to put out the flames which have been raging for the past several hours, and it appears the fire was caused by ongoing construction, but authorities have not yet determined an official cause. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } French President Emmanuel Macron is threatening -- I'm sorry, treating the situation as a national emergency.

      "sentences": "Hi, Dana. Just after 6 PM, Paris time, witnesses say a very small amount of smoke was visible from the Notre Dame Cathedral coming from right around the spire that was in the process of being renovated. But within minutes, the smoke got blackened, the flames were visible. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Firefighters said they were on scene very quickly and were helping to get some of the workers out of the building, but in the early minutes, witnesses say the resources did not appear very strong, including a noticeable lack of water which is odd, considering Notre Dame sits on an island and a river runs right alongside the property. But it's also notable that the fuel feeding this fire is extraordinary, 800-plus years ago, the cathedral was built using 52 acres of timber, so much wood that the inside of the cathedral was nicknamed the forest. And over the centuries, the wood, of course, became tinderbox dry. The loss of the cathedral itself is devastating but the inside was filled with priceless artwork and artifacts, including architectural drawings of not just the cathedral but of the city of Paris, itself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, it's unclear if those documents were damaged or destroyed in the fire or may be destroyed in the fire. If there is any glimmer of hope in all this it's that 16 copper statues, including the statue of St. Andrew were taken away before the renovation. So those have been spared. Notre Dame is the cathedral of the Paris archdiocese, and it was expecting maybe 100, 100-plus thousand Catholics to celebrate Easter services this Sunday. But the building has long been a symbol of beauty, peace, love, and faith for more than just Catholics. And that was evident as people of all faiths gathered outside the burning cathedral and sang songs like the Hail Mary. Notre Dame has more visitors each year than the Eiffel Tower, and firefighters in France say they're not sure right now if they can put this fire out. It took almost a century and a half to build. It is unclear how long and how much it would cost to rebuild.

Number one, if you had to teach a course on Marxism or Leninism, how would you address the 100 million plus dead that they left behind. What caused it beyond administrative error? Number two, socialist bring up small successes in Europe without mentioning that economic growth is miserable compared with the United States. Why hide that? Number three, you live in the greatest economic system in history, yet you see in socialism a system rejected by nearly every nation that has tried it is somehow better given the previous questions I just asked why. Four, do you see equality of opportunity and equality of outcome as the same thing. Should there been a cap on the book royalties which made you a millionaire. Should you only have one home instead of three. Also, can you give me an example of economic inequality that exists after you factor in age experience and education. Older people tend to have higher incomes and more wealth. You are older and richer than most. Aren't you proof of economic mobility, not inequality? Five, since you became a millionaire, you've trained your sights on billionaires. There are 585 of them in the United States. If we took all their money would our problems be solved. It's been said that if you aren't a liberal when you're young you have no heart, but if you aren't a conservative when you're old, you have no brain. What's your excuse?

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" This is a Fox News alert. You are looking live at a massive fire engulfing the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France. The spire of the over 850 year old landmark collapsing, the city's mayor ordering those living close to the burning cathedral to evacuate in case of a possible collapse. Crews working to put out the flames which have been raging for the past several hours, and it appears the fire was caused by ongoing construction, but authorities have not yet determined an official cause. French President Emmanuel Macron is threatening -- I'm sorry, treating the situation as a national emergency. We brought in Trace Gallagher to get us up to speed with the latest. Trace?"

      "utterance": "Hi, Dana. Just after 6 PM, Paris time, witnesses say a very small amount of smoke was visible from the Notre Dame Cathedral coming from right around the spire that was in the process of being renovated. But within minutes, the smoke got blackened, the flames were visible. Firefighters said they were on scene very quickly and were helping to get some of the workers out of the building, but in the early minutes, witnesses say the resources did not appear very strong, including a noticeable lack of water which is odd, considering Notre Dame sits on an island and a river runs right alongside the property. But it's also notable that the fuel feeding this fire is extraordinary, 800-plus years ago, the cathedral was built using 52 acres of timber, so much wood that the inside of the cathedral was nicknamed the forest. And over the centuries, the wood, of course, became tinderbox dry. The loss of the cathedral itself is devastating but the inside was filled with priceless artwork and artifacts, including architectural drawings of not just the cathedral but of the city of Paris, itself. Now, it's unclear if those documents were damaged or destroyed in the fire or may be destroyed in the fire. If there is any glimmer of hope in all this it's that 16 copper statues, including the statue of St. Andrew were taken away before the renovation. So those have been spared. Notre Dame is the cathedral of the Paris archdiocese, and it was expecting maybe 100, 100-plus thousand Catholics to celebrate Easter services this Sunday. But the building has long been a symbol of beauty, peace, love, and faith for more than just Catholics. And that was evident as people of all faiths gathered outside the burning cathedral and sang songs like the Hail Mary. Notre Dame has more visitors each year than the Eiffel Tower, and firefighters in France say they're not sure right now if they can put this fire out. It took almost a century and a half to build. It is unclear how long and how much it would cost to rebuild. Dana."

And it's just -- something like this, when you see it, and the spire collapses in real time, and that images is beamed out to everybody in the world, it's sad but it's also a time to reflect on, you know, what brings us together, and that's religion, the Catholic faith. And I think if you're a Catholic, if you're Episcopalian, or Buddhist, whatever, you look at this and you can recognize the historic importance of it, and hopefully not focus on what divides us and instead what brings us together."

She's got to be sitting at home thinking what the hell did I just see? And -- from what I know about AOC, she's going to come for the throne, because this is not the first time this happened. Remember, Nancy Pelosi mocked her Green New Deal, said green dream or whatever you call it. And so it's more important to have more votes than twitter followers. So at this point it looks like Nancy didn't really have to handle it that way. She could have said, you know what, I'm a Democrat, I'm a progressive, and we have moderates, and we have young up-and-coming Democratic socialists, but we all want health care and we all hate Trump. But she didn't do that. She was cold on purpose. And that tells me a few things. It tells me there's a lot of bad blood between AOC and Nancy. It tells me the civil war is real.

But, I also have 31 House districts that -- where Trump won but Democrats won in 2018, and she's got to try to protect those in 2020 so I think she's trying to do her best. From what I can see, AOC has kept her -- held her fire against Pelosi, but that might not last forever. And pretty soon if you see President Trump taunting them, right, driving a wedge between the two of them and suggesting, hey, AOC, why can't Pelosi get anything done? Don't you want to like turn the fire inwards? Or as President Obama explained to us last week, a circular firing squad, remember that Greg."

These are just some little -- this is a cool kid phenomenon, you know? The loudest kids they come in, they make the noise, but will they be around like Nancy? Who knows? I actually for once sympathize with her because she's not battling her party or even Republicans. She's battling a consensus activist media who falsely enlarge the footprint of three newcomers, the young upstarts if you will. So they've mistaken -- the media -- they've mistaken the bluster on twitter and the twitter exchange for impact when you know that the real work is being done somewhere else. So there's an illusion of influence based on twitter footprint and intersectionality that Nancy is like going, you know what, that's not what this party is. And they've got to listen to Nancy because if they do chase the beliefs of the upstarts, you might get -- if you get a candidate who's running against Trump on reparations and socialized health care and the new green deal, you're going to lose."

Number two, socialist bring up small successes in Europe without mentioning that economic growth is miserable compared with the United States. Why hide that? Number three, you live in the greatest economic system in history, yet you see in socialism a system rejected by nearly every nation that has tried it is somehow better given the previous questions I just asked why. Four, do you see equality of opportunity and equality of outcome as the same thing. Should there been a cap on the book royalties which made you a millionaire. Should you only have one home instead of three. Also, can you give me an example of economic inequality that exists after you factor in age experience and education. Older people tend to have higher incomes and more wealth. You are older and richer than most. Aren't you proof of economic mobility, not inequality? Five, since you became a millionaire, you've trained your sights on billionaires. There are 585 of them in the United States. If we took all their money would our problems be solved. It's been said that if you aren't a liberal when you're young you have no heart, but if you aren't a conservative when you're old, you have no brain. What's your excuse?

      "utterance": "Yes, I have a question just about the location because I think it's super interesting that this - where you are that there was a 13-point swing. These were Obama voters in 2012, but by 13 points Trump voters in 2016. And just curious and I'm sure you're going to ask him if Bernie Sanders thinks that districts like those, states like those that he thinks he can flip back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "I think it's one of the reasons he's doing this. I mean Pennsylvania is one of the swing states at this particular region even more so as you point to the points. There are many Trump voters who switched over. They were Democratic voters for a long time, and they went to Trump in 2016. And I think that that's one of the reasons he's here."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's also very interesting if you look at the voters who were Bernie supporters in the primary process. 11 or 12 percent of them ended up voting not for Hillary Clinton but for Donald Trump. Now President Trump. So, these are the areas that he needs to come to. I think it's very politically astute of him to know that this is where he needs to be if he wants to start to flip those voters in places like Pennsylvania."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Trades definitely a topic that will come up, Donna. It is key to this region. We are in the shadow of Bethlehem Steel, a plant that closed down in 1995. This area was devastated when it did. It's a key issue for voters here and throughout really this entire region. You look at those states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio. I think that's really the battleground for 2020 as you look at the map now."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, a lot of those people are the category that we're looked upon as the forgotten voters. And both Bernie Sanders and President Trump tried to tap into that. And what we've heard from Bernie Sanders in recent weeks is that he believes that the President has failed those forgotten voters. Now did the voters feel that way. That's going to be the big question as we move forward."

      "utterance": "Yes, I'm sure they're going to do that, Greg. I just have a lot of respect for Bernie Sanders. I think the fact that he's doing this Fox News town hall this early in the race and while he's a top, many of the polls shows a lot of political intelligence because he's signaling to his competitors in the Democratic primary that I'm not here to hit softballs. And he's also showing that he's got a general election mindset. He's going to look for his many voters wherever they are and to a wide his audience as possible. You're not going to listen to any of my questions because you've probably all got them nailed down. But are you going to have a moment question? You know like the boxers or briefs question or something like that like ask him about Tiger Woods or Game of Thrones or something like that."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that you know almost every poll has him in the lead as a declared candidate. We know that Vice President Biden is not yet in here and he leads many polls. But you're right, he is. He went from Think of the evolution here from the outsider who was pressing Hillary Clinton and came very close to now the front runner who has the most money in the Democratic field is getting the biggest crowds and now in some polls is leading and is leading as a declared candidate."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And I don't think that the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is of the world right now would exist or be as accepted as they are if it weren't for the ground that Bernie Sanders laid down. So, his story really is extraordinary because he's forced a conversation in America that I never thought I would live to see whether or not we should be a capitalist or a socialist nation. And that's a question that is you know very fundamental to where we are in this race right now, which is an interesting place to be in this country."

John Rich is going to give us a one of a kind tours of Nashville but that's going to be full of surprises if you want to come. No tickets are necessary. The doors open at 11 AM. Remember it's 4 PM in that time zone. OK. But 5 PM Eastern if you want to watch us on the show. Jesse and I are also going to take place in the 18th Annual Waiting for Wishes Benefit. This is the Kevin Carter Foundation and Make A Wish Middle Tennessee. Last year we did this. I think they raised $125,000 and this year we'll be there with Little Big Town. OK. I'm excited.

Try to be slow on the trigger finger people. Second one. This is called The Cat Black Hole where is the cat? It's in there. It's very, very scary. Look at that again.
