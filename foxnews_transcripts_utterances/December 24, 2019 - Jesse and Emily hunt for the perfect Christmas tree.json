      "utterance": "Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Emily Campagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. This is \"The Five.\" Merry Christmas Eve, everyone. We're excited to have you join us for our celebration. We have tons of fun for you tonight, including reaction to our first ever Christmas grab bag of stories making headlines, a special Christmas edition of Supermarket Showdown. And, we are squaring off to see who will be crowned The Quiz Show champion. Plus, we've been waiting all year for our Secret Santa gift exchange. It's our biggest one yet. Don't miss the annual tradition. But first, there's no better way to get into the Christmas spirit than by cutting down your own Christmas tree. So Jesse and Emily went out on a little adventure to a local tree farm to show us how it's done. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Well, what you're going to realize when you get done is it's not so much about the tree, it's about the memories and about the spirit of Christmas when you come out to a real Christmas tree farm. So we're going to take a drive out to the fields, and take a look at some of the trees. Jesse, we'd like you to drive the tractor. Do you know how to drive a stick shift? Emily, how about you? Do you know how to drive a stick shift?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Juan Williams",
      "utterance": "The other thing that I love about this is, when you put it in that plastic wrapping thing because, you know, initially, they -- like when they -- sometimes they do a fresh cut so that when you get it home, the tree can still absorb water."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Juan Williams",
      "utterance": "But what they do right at the end is they stick it in this plastic thing, and it reminds me of a wood chipper."

    },

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "What?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Emily Compagno",
      "utterance": "One of those net things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Yeah, the wrapping, the wrapping tube. They should apply that to other things. Like imagine just putting anything in that tube, and it comes out all wrapped up like your gym stuff. Like you're going to the gym, you just throw all your crap, and it goes \"whoop splokkk\" into this like little kind of mesh thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Juan Williams",
      "utterance": "Well, then what it reminds me of the most is at the airports now, they have luggage things that are like that."

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },

      "utterance": "Super cute, Dana?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dana Perino",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it was super cute. So it just wouldn't feel like Christmas in New York City without indulging in some delicious deserts. There -- two people here at this table went with me to Serendipity. They have really big sweet tooths, all right? Unforgettable tasty treats. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dana Perino",

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "I was busy. I'm not a big fan of watching people eat. Sorry. It's like kind of grosses me out. It's like you know in movies, whenever they have scenes -- or it's usually like they're -- people go to lunch, and they're all talking when they're eating, it's like, \"You don't need that. Just don't have -- Jesse Watters: Well, they tell politicians, \"Never eat on camera.\""

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",

      "speaker": "Dana Perino",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Appreciated that. I mean, it is an amazing place, Serendipity. And they actually have their own line of ice cream, and they gave us some here. I got the Outrageous Banana Split. You can get these in lots of stores."

It's like, \"Yeah, we go through this.\" It's like going to the Thanksgiving Day parade here in New York where there's these big crowds and it's sometimes cold and windy, and even icy or snowy.
