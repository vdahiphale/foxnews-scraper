Of course they don't believe in open borders, who would believe in that? And of course they don't think everyone, minors or adults, bring them across the border should be allowed to stay. But let's take a look at what's really going on. Here's a story from NPR from back in 2015. It notes that at one point President Obama was detaining 2,000 women and their children who crossed the border illegally. But what happened? International migration activists and the ACLU filed law suits and ultimately courts shut down one of the largest family detention centers. The centers that we're now supposed to believe that the Democrats want up and running again? As we've been pointing out, this is all related to that 1997 Flora Settlement and subsequent court rulings that prohibit the federal government from holding children longer than 20 days. So if families aren't separated and can't be housed together? Well we have one humongous catch and release nightmare on our hands. Basically it means any alien with a child will get a fast pass into the country. The Democrats now decry the separation of families at the border, in demand, okay, that families be kept together. But where exactly would we do that since all the family detention centers have been shut down by that 2015 court ruling. A decision the far left night circuit affirmed in 2016. In fact three years ago, 136 House Democrats opposed the Obama administration's detention of families, keeping them together. I'm saying detention of families again, not of children, of families who had been kept together as their case was adjudicated.",

President Trump tried to send a strong message that America was not going to tolerate border crashers and began to prosecute anyone who violated federal law. That's entering the country without permission, not coming through a regular port of entry. Well part of his reason was to discourage people, again, from making that harrowing journey northward, putting themselves and children in danger. But of course after nonstop media coverage of the family separation and the public outcry that followed, Trump ended up relenting. He signed an executive order today that would allow families to remain together as they await adjudication of their cases.

So for years they've advocated for restrictive court rulings that tie the government's hands and limit our capability to protect our own people, control our own immigration, who comes and who goes and in a serious way. It's a transnational push for the free movement of people and it requires essentially amnesty for all but perhaps the most violent criminal offenders. And even a few of them, as we've seen in recent months, might slip through the process. As for you, American citizens and all of you illegal immigrants watching, you're just supposed to basically just pick up the pieces. Deal with it, deal with all the fall out, pay the money that you're going to have to pay to cover all these bills, and get ready to welcome whoever comes for whatever motivation, no matter how they get here.

In March I was in McAllen, Texas and that's in the Rio Grande Valley there, it's the busiest center for border crossings. And I was shocked to find out what the system actually is and I don't think Americans realize when families come cross the border illegally, they're processed, most of them claim asylum, their processed by ICE. And when they're released, ICE in McAllen just drives them to a Greyhound station and drops them off there. And then Catholic Charities, which is just a few blocks away, brings busses and vans over and picks them up brings them over to a respite center and helps them call relatives and friends and family members in the United States. Makes sure they get bus tickets to get them where they're going and sends them on their way later that night. Most of the men in this facility had electronic ankle monitors and many of them told me that as soon as they got to wherever they were going, which is all over the country, they just cut the monitors off and throw them away. That's the system. And if you look at federal records, you see that the number of asylum seekers that have their cases go through the system and are adjudicated, a large number of them are decided in absentia, which they just never show up for them. And that's the system that we have in place today and I think that's the system that the Trump administration is trying to fix. Yeah exactly.",

You can't compare the two. One is their daily job, the other is their private life. And you don't want us to open that door. If I were to open that door, should conservatives go to the restaurants that Democrats eat? You don't want anybody to do that.",

Of course they don't believe in open borders, who would believe in that? And of course they don't think everyone, minors or adults, bring them across the border should be allowed to stay. But let's take a look at what's really going on. Here's a story from NPR from back in 2015. It notes that at one point President Obama was detaining 2,000 women and their children who crossed the border illegally. But what happened? International migration activists and the ACLU filed law suits and ultimately courts shut down one of the largest family detention centers. The centers that we're now supposed to believe that the Democrats want up and running again? As we've been pointing out, this is all related to that 1997 Flora Settlement and subsequent court rulings that prohibit the federal government from holding children longer than 20 days. So if families aren't separated and can't be housed together? Well we have one humongous catch and release nightmare on our hands. Basically it means any alien with a child will get a fast pass into the country. The Democrats now decry the separation of families at the border, in demand, okay, that families be kept together. But where exactly would we do that since all the family detention centers have been shut down by that 2015 court ruling. A decision the far left night circuit affirmed in 2016. In fact three years ago, 136 House Democrats opposed the Obama administration's detention of families, keeping them together. I'm saying detention of families again, not of children, of families who had been kept together as their case was adjudicated."

We encouraged more minors to be trafficked, more deaths in the desert, more illegality, and yes, more strains on you, the American tax payer. Nice going guys. President Trump tried to send a strong message that America was not going to tolerate border crashers and began to prosecute anyone who violated federal law. That's entering the country without permission, not coming through a regular port of entry. Well part of his reason was to discourage people, again, from making that harrowing journey northward, putting themselves and children in danger. But of course after nonstop media coverage of the family separation and the public outcry that followed, Trump ended up relenting. He signed an executive order today that would allow families to remain together as they await adjudication of their cases. He's asking the Defence Department to work with Homeland Security to house the families. We're going to see how that executive order, of course, is greeted but the courts."

The well-funded organizations that work overtime to gum up our border enforcement efforts and push for what ends up being essentially, a borderless world. Here are some of the non-profits funded by billionaire globalists for their grassroots activism and well-orchestrated media campaigns. Of course, not big surprise, the ACLU, then there's the American Immigration Council, who could forget the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. Then there's the Refugee and Immigration Center for Legal Services that are known as RAICES. And then the Detention Watch Network, and then finally the group formally known as LERASA, UNIDOS US.

But look, when you listen to the activists and the politicians today, after the president signed his executive order, they revealed themselves. Their goal is simple, they want to show the American people that borders themselves are fundamentally unjust. They're a violation of human rights, free movement, free peoples, you've heard it. So for years they've advocated for restrictive court rulings that tie the government's hands and limit our capability to protect our own people, control our own immigration, who comes and who goes and in a serious way. It's a transnational push for the free movement of people and it requires essentially amnesty for all but perhaps the most violent criminal offenders. And even a few of them, as we've seen in recent months, might slip through the process. As for you, American citizens and all of you illegal immigrants watching, you're just supposed to basically just pick up the pieces. Deal with it, deal with all the fall out, pay the money that you're going to have to pay to cover all these bills, and get ready to welcome whoever comes for whatever motivation, no matter how they get here. And that's the Angle. Let's discuss this now with John Davidson, senior correspondent for The Federalist and immigration attorney Francisco Hernandez. It's great to have both of you on, we're going to be joined in a few minutes by Dave Brat for the congressional update on all of this. John let's start with you, I think there's so much misinformation out there on how this process works. But we have created this nightmare at out border, over many years, refusing to enforce the laws that are books. John you wrote a phenomenal piece Federalist laying this out. Where are we tonight on this issue?"

      "utterance": "Thank you for having us. Well we're in a lot different place than were just a few months ago. In March I was in McAllen, Texas and that's in the Rio Grande Valley there, it's the busiest center for border crossings. And I was shocked to find out what the system actually is and I don't think Americans realize when families come cross the border illegally, they're processed, most of them claim asylum, their processed by ICE. And when they're released, ICE in McAllen just drives them to a Greyhound station and drops them off there. And then Catholic Charities, which is just a few blocks away, brings busses and vans over and picks them up brings them over to a respite center and helps them call relatives and friends and family members in the United States. Makes sure they get bus tickets to get them where they're going and sends them on their way later that night. Most of the men in this facility had electronic ankle monitors and many of them told me that as soon as they got to wherever they were going, which is all over the country, they just cut the monitors off and throw them away. That's the system. And if you look at federal records, you see that the number of asylum seekers that have their cases go through the system and are adjudicated, a large number of them are decided in absentia, which they just never show up for them. And that's the system that we have in place today and I think that's the system that the Trump administration is trying to fix. Yeah exactly."

And I'm saying that because I know you, you're a great person, but this system now put children in jeopardy, it puts women in jeopardy and it enriches the cartels because they're making big bucks. The border patrol last night down in the San Diego sector, chapter and verse they said, \"The people profiting are the cartels and the human traffickers\". Francisco"

It costs about $10,000 per person to be smuggled from Central America and Ma Ingraham, you may not know this, but by the time they get to the border, it's the point of no return, they're not going back. The problem here is the administration tried to send a message to tell people, \"Don't come\", because we're going to separate you from your children, but the people were already three to six months into their trek. They're not exactly getting Wi-Fi in the desert and they're not checking their Twitter account. They're already on their way up here and the smugglers have already been paid so as soon as the smugglers get them here, they just want to dump them on us and we've got to deal with what it is. Now we have to admit that as bad as our political asylum process is, it is a legal way of trying to get here. Why don't we try to change it to where we give yearly renewable work permits for only the breadwinner is going to risk their life coming up here an then we don't have all these people fleeing their source country. Honduras is a lawless nation, it's the Somali of Latin America and mothers know that they're probably going to be separated from their child, it's the baby mother syndrome."

Or it's separating the families which is harrowing thing, images are terrible, nobody likes to see. So John I want to go back to you, the President came out today and the media was blaring it, \"President back tracks, reverses course\". At the same time he says they're not getting rid of his zero tolerance policy, correct John?"

The Trump administration rightly or wrongly, and I think they were not prepared to do this when they did, they're saying we're going to prosecute every single person that crosses the border illegally. That's an insane thing to do if you have the system we have right, but the executive order keeps that in place and says, \"We're going to keep the families together while their asylum claims and their immigration status is adjudicated\". Now that runs against the 1997 Flores Agreement which says you can't keep kids for more than 20 days, even if they're with their parents. And so the Trump administration has sort of provoked a show down now, it's like a challenge to Congress. This is going to get struck down so how is Congress going to act?"

His new Executive Order criminalizes asylum-seekers and seeks to indefinitely detain their children. Locking up whole families is no solution at all\". Back to the point I made in the Angle Francisco, it was never really about family unification, it was about having no detaining at all.

Let me just give you a couple, `May 2018, border control apprehended an adult male who was travelling with his supposed one year old son, he's a known MS-13 gang member, previously removed from the country in 2012. His minor child was released to an uncle'. This goes on and on, a rape convict of MS-13, female MS-13 apprehended last month. Goes on and on and on. With children, because why Congressman?

It all started Monday when an unoccupied Wall Street account supposedly humorous instructions on how to assassinate ICE agents. The tweet has since been deleted. Then yesterday the radical leftist group ANTIFA tweeted out a database with the addresses of 1,500 ICE agents and their families. Might this lead to real violence and where is the condemnation? Well let's examine that with former Chuck Schumer aide Chris Hahn and former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer. It's great to see both of you. Chris let's start with you. I know you don't condone any of this stuff and both sides can get wild and wacky. After spending down time at the border and I've been there, I think the last time that I was really there was like 1997 during a report on the border, all those years ago. So being there last night and talking to the border agents, these are just great people, they're just trying to their job and Washington just seems so far away for them.

I know myself, I have been very upset by what I have been seeing from the border but there's no reason to start calling people Nazis and there's definitely no reason to provoke violence. And look, it happens to me all the time from the right. I got lots of hate emails, I got dozens of them after my appearance this week. It happens all the time, it's not good.

So it doesn't bother me at all but Ari these are people doing their jobs day and day out. You also had Kristin Nielson, obviously a public figure, she was in a Mexican restaurant last night and she was just trying to get some dinner and, I think we have the video and this is what happened to her.

There's no shaming of them, there's no sense of a probe to them that you've crossed a line. The only people that really blow the whistle are Fox News and Conservatives and I assure you if it was done in reverse, if a Conservative engaged in that type of behavior, the New York Times, CBS, CNN, ABC, they would all collectively blow a gasket because they want to draw a line on what's acceptable and what's not acceptable.

The 302, the report that the FBI uses, is meant to take down investigation, things that are happening, activities of the investigation. And also when you sit there and interview, like when they were interviewing Secretary Clinton, they would have generated one 302 as a result of the interview. Now, they can't go back and make changes. And if they lied about it to the OIG, that, in and of itself, is a criminal offense, subject to prosecution. It's very, very serious, serious business."

The deputy assistant director was led out of the building and escorted out of the building. And then you look at the lawyers and how Michael Horowitz, the I.G., who is a tough nut, he is a hardnosed prosecutor, and I believe truly that he is going to get to the bottom of this.

In the goodwill speech to the troops, it's important to keep the morale up because the vast majority of these agents and support personnel are doing a great job. But as far as talking to the general public, the public wants to have confidence in the FBI. If I could make any suggestions to the director, it's time to face the public directly and say, mistakes were made. I am working at cleaning up the mistakes so that you can have confidence, not say everything's fine because right now, it isn't. Public perception is bad."

But Guy, on its issue of extracting texts, why is it that the DOJ will not get these text messages to members of Congress and obviously the OIG in a timely fashion? They had to go to the Department of Defense, the inspector general's office had to go there to get the texts. What is that about?"

You can't come out and say, look, I'm conducting this investigation, the Russia investigation. I've conducted this investigation, the Clinton investigation, and I closed it out.
