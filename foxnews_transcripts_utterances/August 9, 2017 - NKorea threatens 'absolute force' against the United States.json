Just moments ago, the hermit regime throwing another log on the fire; their military calling President Trump's threat a load of nonsense, adding that only absolute force can work on the president. This, as NBC report, our military is ready to carry out a pre-emptive strike if ordered. That's \"The Story.\" I'm Dana Perino, in for Martha MacCallum. The new threats follow comments today from Defense Secretary James Mattis, warning the North Koreans that conflict could lead to \"the end of its regime and the destruction of its people. The defense secretary's statement coming just hours after President Trump said our nuclear arsenal is more powerful than ever. We told you last night that Kim Jong-un threatened the U.S. territory of Guam, and tonight they added a timeline. Within the last hour, the North Korea says, they will carry out strikes on the U.S. territory in a matter of days.

The North Korean statement goes on to indicate that President Trump isn't getting it saying, \"Sound dialogue isn't possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him.\" Of course, Guam is not only a U.S. territory but also a vital military facility for the U.S. Navy and Air Force. It sits a little more than 2000 miles from North Korea, well in the range of the North ballistic missiles. Meantime, here at home, we're on kind of a roller coaster of rhetoric.

Until then, we progress to -- they're going to have the capability next year in 2018, to now suddenly they have it. So, either -- so either something dramatically changed over in North Korea and their capabilities and accelerated, or our assessments have been a bit off.

Right now, Kim Jong-un believes that he must have a nuclear program capable of hitting the United States, Japan, and South Korea in order to ensure his survival, in order to prevent him from being the next Saddam Hussein or the next Qaddafi. And we need to make him understand that if he achieves that capability, his regime will fail and he will not survive. We also have to importantly change the Chinese calculus. You know, right now, the thing that they most fear is a unified Korean Peninsula that's friendly to the United States and the West right on their borders, or a failed North Korean state and they have to deal with a 25 million refugee problem. And we have to make the Chinese understand that war on the peninsula is a very real possibility, that we will not accept a nuclearized East Asia, and that that would be a worse outcome so that the Chinese begin to take meaningful action."

And the administration had a win over the weekend at the U.N. by getting the Chinese and the Russians to sign on to very tough sanctions resolution. But now with this new war of words, we've kind of pushed off of that strategy, it seems to me, and tried to go back to threats, which are only going to get the North Koreans to pursue their weapons programs and missile program more aggressively. So, I think we should lower the temperature a bit and get back to what the secretary was doing before this last round of words."

I mean, this has been a -- basically 25-year period where the North Koreans have pursued both nuclear and missile programs. And now, I mean, their end goal, which as we have all established, is nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States is tantalizingly within reach. And they're very real doubt as to whether we're going to be able to do anything to actually forestall that. So, I think right now we want to sort of retard the progress; we want to limit any further progress. Ultimately, stopping the position in its tracks are -- or stopping the program in its tracks seems like a pretty tall order at this point."

But North Korea is much further ahead than our intelligence had actually shown up to now. Where do you think that breakdown is? And I know that it's very difficult for us to get assets to North Korea, so is it possible that we just might not know what they're capable of doing?"

      "utterance": "Well, keep in mind, right, these are Intel assessments. And depending on our access and placement, you know, in the targeted area or country -- depends on how accurate they are. But I do find it very interesting and curious of, you know, why over the last few months we've gone from President Obama telling incoming President Trump that the North Koreans are going to have this capability before the end of his term, so four to five years. Until then, we progress to -- they're going to have the capability next year in 2018, to now suddenly they have it. So, either -- so either something dramatically changed over in North Korea and their capabilities and accelerated, or our assessments have been a bit off. So, I think that's something worth looking into. And to the other point, you know, in terms of kind of cooling things down, I absolutely agree. We have to work through cyber, covert, tougher sanctions. But the North Koreans and the Chinese need to believe that the military option is for real this time, which I don't think they believed in the past, and that's the only way they're going to back off this program."

But the North Koreans are not going to magically wake up one morning and choose to disarm. They're only going to do that through some process of negotiations and we need to get the Chinese on board to do that. I think the U.N.

But my sense from the South Koreans is they're fairly calm about it. And one of them made a very good point which I'll now proceed to plagiarize essentially, which is that there's a certain sort of strategic ambiguity that the Trump administration is pursuing right now. It sort of seems like Rex Tillerson is saying a different thing than what President Trump is saying. But my diplomat friend made the point that this is actually can be useful said this could be useful. The North Koreans learned to a tee what to expect from, for example, the Obama administration. They knew exactly how Obama would react to any of their provocations, and probably knew the same about George W. Bush and Clinton's administrations as well. The fact that they're kind of guessing, and they're sort of on their back feet right now, I think, is an asset that we should condemn -- we should, you know, congratulate the Trump administration for achieving that."

I think that was one problem.

And I think yesterday, perhaps, meant, what he was trying to do is speak directly to Kim Jong-un, and Secretary Tillerson said in language that he would understand, and that perhaps he needs to think a little bit more about the other audiences because the initial reaction was one of fear. But I actually think some people might think, well, actually it's good to have somebody that is in office that is surrounded by the national security team that he had, and that is willing to fight fire with fire."

And it's obvious that a lot of Americans across the country are thinking at the same time. He's talking about excessive expectations. What McConnell is talking about is the American people have excessive expectations, apparently, because the American people certainly expected Congress would've been able to find that Republicans control everything, that they ought to be able to repeal Obamacare. And the troubling thing about it is, I think that it suggests that Republicans in Congress still haven't learned the lesson of Trump's election. The reason that he beat the most entrenched Democratic machine in Democratic politics for the past 25 years, and the reason he beat 16 Republicans in the field is because he intended to keep the promises that he was making on the campaign trail, and people believed that.

The challenge is that a lot of the legislation that's going through congress including the Gorsuch confirmation is stuff that McConnell likes, and he's worked with Trump, and there's that alliance of convenience in that respect. But where it gets kind of tricky is when you have these blow-ups, these dust-ups, when Trump isn't happy that the legislation -- you know, the healthcare, taxes aren't going at the pace that he's expecting.

So now Hollywood is taking a knee for him, that fiery debate ahead. Plus, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's home the subject of a predawn raid by the FBI last month. Ron Hosko was assistant director of the FBI, and he's here to tell us why this happened in the middle of the night, and what this might mean for Mr. Manafort, that's next."

      "utterance": "breaking tonight, a shocking twist to the Russia investigation as today we learned for the first time that FBI agents raided a home of former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort in a predawn operation late last month, reportedly waking the former Trump campaign manager as he slept. Chief national correspondent Ed Henry is live at the White House with this story. Ed?"

      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Dana, that's right. Fox News has confirmed that this predawn raid occurred in late July. Very recently, at the Virginia home of Paul Manafort. Remember, for a brief time in 2016, he ran the president's campaign. And they picked up documents and material related to the investigation of Russian interference, of course, in the 2016 election. This suggests special counsel Robert Mueller is turning up the heat on Manafort, because federal agents, as you mentioned, went -- not just in predawn, but they had a search warrant. They went into his Alexandria home one day after Manafort had met voluntarily with members of the senate intelligence committee. The timing significant because people familiar with the investigation told the Washington Post the search warrant was an indication that investigators may have had reason to believe Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all of the records requested in response to a grand jury subpoena. Now, a spokesman for Manafort pushed back on that. Jason Maloney telling Fox, quote, FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries, and did so on this occasion as well. The Fox News chief judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said the move suggests to him that investigators were able to persuade a federal judge there was good reason for this search."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's clear that people close to the investigation are starting to spill some details. Remember that last week, we heard that there was more than one grand jury. We had known about one in Virginia. Now we hear about a second one in D.C. So, part of why it leaked based on what we're hearing suggests that they are trying to push Manafort hard here and suggest that they mean business with him, Dana."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "All right. Thank you so much, Ed. Here now with insight on these type of raids is Ron Hosko, he was assistant director of the FBI. Sir, do you think when they went in to the home, that they were looking for something very specific?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RON HOSKO, FORMER ASSISTANT FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "I do. I do. In fact, it's really required by a federal search warrant expectation. An affidavit would have gone before a federal judge laying out the case for what federal crime might have been committed and what evidence would likely been found and seized."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Earlier today -- I'm sorry. On July 26, early that morning, President Trump tweeted this, why did A.G. Sessions replace acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend, who was in charge on Clinton investigation, but got big dollars, $700 thousand, for his wife political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives, drain the swamp. Now, some people are trying to tie the raid of that morning to these tweets. And I wonder would the president have even been privy to knowing that this had actually happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOSKO",
      "utterance": "I highly doubt it, Dana. Look, this is going to be coordinated by Bob Mueller and his team with FBI agents as the tip of the spear running the execution of the search warrant. I don't think Bob Mueller is paying attention to the president's tweets, with time, a search warrant to the president's tweets, it would take a period of time for the FBI agents to develop probable cause, to get to a judge and to swear that affidavit before the judge. So I don't think that you'll see any proof that those things are tied together."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "OK, because I saw that all day long, people trying to say that he must have been trying to pressure Mueller after that. So, let me then ask you what Ed Henry was just saying, is that possibly the reason we know about this raid now is that perhaps the investigators are trying to put pressure on Paul Manafort. Do you think that would be true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOSKO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think as you move forward in any criminal investigation, you're bringing pressure to bear on the subject of that investigation. Quite clearly, Mr. Manafort is the subject of an investigation here, this and the execution of a search warrant is a logical technique. But you know, there're internal guidelines to the FBI. It's a big thick manual known as the -- their domestic guidelines that really require -- it expects FBI agents to use the least intrusive means to acquire the information they need to build their case. A search warrant executed at 6:00 in the morning is not a least intrusive means, it's a rather intrusive means. So it suggests to me that they couldn't get that information that they thought was relevant and provident of a crime in some other way, like consent of Mr. Manafort and his counsel, or foreign bank records, or domestic bank records, they thought something was being held back from them or concealed, and they had to use this technique. So it will apply pressure, sure."

      "speaker": "HOSKO",
      "utterance": "Yeah, there is. And typically it's venue. It is the locality or the jurisdiction where they believe the crimes or of the crimes or crimes occurred. And so, if I do a bank robbery in Virginia, it's unlikely that a grand jury in Illinois is going to hear that case."

Katie Pavlich and Michael Starr Hopkins will debate."

A source tells Reuters the suspect who is now in custody is an Algerian national who was in France legally. Investigators say the incident appears to be the latest assault on France's security forces, the third in the last few months. Three soldiers were seriously injured today, but all, thankfully, are expected to survive. There's a new protest movement tonight involving the pro quarterback who sparked a national controversy for sitting out the national anthem. But this time around, supporters are coming to Colin Kaepernick's defense and planning to take on the NFL. Trace Gallagher has the story live from out west coast newsroom. Trace?"

    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Hey, Dana. At the time, San Francisco 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick said he wouldn't stand for the national anthem because, quote, I am not going to standup to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. The NFL's initial response was the players are encouraged but not required to stand during the anthem. But Kaepernick's protest led to an intense national backlash. And now, just weeks before the start of the NFL season, Kaepernick has yet to sign with a new team. Film director Spike Lee is among those who think the national anthem controversy is the reason he remains a free agent. So Lee is promoting a rally for Kaepernick at NFL headquarters on August 23 called, United We Stand, where, by the way, they spelled Kaepernick's name wrong. Lee admits he didn't organize the rally. In fact, he won't even attend. But on twitter he made it clear he agrees with its intents, saying, quote, how is it possible that all 32 teams in the NFL, no freedom league he calls it, can't or won't find a spot for number 7 on their roster with his proven talent. What Spike Lee fails to mention in his proven talent comment is that in 2013 Colin Kaepernick was rated the eighth best quarterback in the league and led his team to a Super Bowl. Last year, he was a highly paid quarterback who ranked 23rd in the league. And as an ESPN writer tells it, quote, don't over think why Colin Kaepernick is still a free agent. Simply put, years have passed since he was an effective quarterback. And last year, we should note that television ratings for the NFL were down 8 percent from the previous year. Now a new poll shows that 26 percent of those who stopped watching did so because of the national anthem protests. Dana?"

Joining us now, Katie Pavlich, Town Hall News editor and a Fox News contributor, and Michael Starr Hopkins, a Democratic strategist who served on the Obama and Clinton campaign, thank you both for being here. You know, I have really deep football knowledge, so -- actually, I don't. Katie, let me turn it over to you. What do you make of this whole controversy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the stats on Colin Kaepernick's talent are true. Last year during week three, he threw four interceptions against the Arizona Cardinals proving that he's just not that good at football anymore, and he's not at the starter level. There's been reports that he turned down what they call backup pay, meaning he was offered a deal to not -- be a nonstarter on a variety of teams. And instead, wanted to continue pursuing this narrative. The second is, just the poll that Trace mentioned by J.D. Powers, the number one reason why NFL fans, not just people in general, fans tuned out of games last year was because of the disrespect that Colin Kaepernick and other people who followed them showed for the national anthem and for the American flag which represents all of us in this country."

      "speaker": "MICHAEL STARR HOPKINS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I do. I wrote a column about this for the Huffington Post yesterday. And Colin Kaepernick is absolutely being banned. Colin Kaepernick had 18 touchdowns, four interceptions. Like the reporter stated, he may have been the 23rd best quarterback in the league, but there's still 31-32 teams in the league, which means he should, at least, be a backup if not a starter. This isn't about Colin Kaepernick. This is about a really uncomfortable conversation that America needs to have about African-Americans and the policing that's going on in this country."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "One of the things I've learned, Katie, was that Brandon Marshall who played for the Denver Broncos, and I think he's at the Giants now, he took some heat in Denver. But what he did is he started having meetings, bringing in police officers and, actually, apparently, about half of the NFL teams have tried to follow that model. So perhaps something good did come out of all of this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Look, I think that there may have been some good conversations. But to act like Colin Kaepernick who had a $100 million contract, who's the victim here, is absolutely absurd. The only person he has to blame is himself. He's also not a team player. It's not that he stop for the national anthem, he also wore socks to practice with cops portrayed as pigs. He wore a Castro t-shirt. I mean, his activism is one thing to do it outside of the workplace, which is the football field, but on the field, you're part of a team, you're part of a league, and based on the numbers and what the audience says, he's a business liability. And the NFL also has an obligation to say you stand during the national anthem. The NBA has a policy. It's time for the NFL to implement one too."

And some might think he's untalented. Some might think that he actually causes a problem for their business, or might like bring unwanted unnecessary attention and negative attention to their club. So why try to force them? Why have this rally of protest if it actually could be based on the free market?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOPKINS",
      "utterance": "Because this isn't really about what Colin Kaepernick has said. There's this argument about whether Colin Kaepernick is good enough to be an NFL quarterback, and that's not really the issue. Colin Kaepernick is good enough to be an NFL quarterback, but he's being black-balled because he's making people uncomfortable. The topics that he's talking about. You know his teammates have come out and defended him. The NFL has come out and said that he doesn't have to stand during the national pledge of allegiance. And this is -- I think we should look at Mohammed Ali and how that was handled, and when we think about Colin Kaepernick. Mohammed Ali spoke out in an unpopular way."
