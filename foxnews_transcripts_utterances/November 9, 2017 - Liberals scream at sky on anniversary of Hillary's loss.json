He's calling this fake news. And part of an email statements from the campaign said this, Judge Roy Moore has endured the most outlandish attack on any candidate in the modern political arena. But this story is base Washington Post, alleging sexual impropriety takes the cake. National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate, Doug Jones, is in a death spiral and this is their last ditch Hail Mary. The senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who Moore basically ran against in his primary, just said this, if these allegations are true, he must step aside. But not all Republicans have the patience to wait to see how this pans out. Senator John McCain says this about Moore, quote, he should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of. But even if Moore does step aside, his name is still going to be on the ballot in December because we're within 76 days, and the law says the ballot can't be reprinted this late. Alabama also has something called a sore loser law, which means that since Luther Strange already lost this year, he can't run on the ballot as an independent. But he could stage a write-in campaign.

According to The Air Force Times, a black cadet admitted to writing the slurs and he's since left the school. So what's the response when we see stories like these exposed as hoaxes? It's never as huge as the initial response was when we assumed that it was real -- which only encourages more hoaxes, for the outrage over the crime is the only part the press seems to remember, not its debunking, which encourages the copycats. Which is why we're doing this now: So people don't keep thinking this kind of thing pays off. Of course, social justice warriors will repeat the pathetic excuse that, while this racist act may not be true here, you just know it's true somewhere else. Which guarantees further opportunity for attention and likely another student's expulsion. I know it's crazy, but maybe it's time we stop feeding the stories to the public before they're properly investigated. Who am I kidding?

They can help you get your business started. And they have also committed to hiring 1,500 veterans themselves over the next five years to support all of their business -- it's a growing company.

To the point where they went ahead and said OK, we're going to put her forward when you had really great candidates as well, like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders going forward because she felt it was her time and it was owed to her. OK. She had her chance. So now it's time to like move on and let the party grow and express.

Now Donna has gone back on the rigging claim if you notice.

She was the first African-American woman -- or maybe even the first woman to run a presidential campaign when she was the campaign chairwoman for Al Gore. And, look, she -- this is amazing to me about Democrats. This is a person who has dedicated her entire life to Democratic activist politics. When she took over for Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was disgraced and had to step down, she took a leave of absence from ABC and CNN. She did not take a salary from the DNC. And allegations that she's just trying to make money and cashing in by selling a book, that really makes me mad because if we know anything about who was actually trying to cash in, it wasn't Donna Brazile."

Like probably should be a little bit more solid. But I feel like she looks liberated. And also, she has said that I worked hard to get Hillary Clinton elected. I'm excited about the Democrats going forward, but she wanted to tell her story. And when it comes to sexism, I imagine that if you're on the other end of the phone, you're in Washington, D.C., and you're getting a call from Brooklyn telling you that you know better in Brooklyn, what's going on in the country than Donna Brazile who spent her entire life on the front lines for the Democrats, it's probably pretty annoying."

Mick Mulvaney said I've tried to convince the president, it's necessary, and he said no. So that's why they're actually trying to fit it all in this box.

Moore kissed her, he touched her, he stripped down, he tried to get her to touch him in a sexual way, and she said she didn't want it. But tonight, Moore is not admitting to anything. He's calling this fake news. And part of an email statements from the campaign said this, Judge Roy Moore has endured the most outlandish attack on any candidate in the modern political arena. But this story is base Washington Post, alleging sexual impropriety takes the cake. National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate, Doug Jones, is in a death spiral and this is their last ditch Hail Mary. The senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who Moore basically ran against in his primary, just said this, if these allegations are true, he must step aside. But not all Republicans have the patience to wait to see how this pans out. Senator John McCain says this about Moore, quote, he should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of. But even if Moore does step aside, his name is still going to be on the ballot in December because we're within 76 days, and the law says the ballot can't be reprinted this late. Alabama also has something called a sore loser law, which means that since Luther Strange already lost this year, he can't run on the ballot as an independent. But he could stage a write-in campaign. Tonight, Strange hasn't said anything about a writing campaign. All he said is that the details he knows are very disturbing. Kimberly?"

This is a guy who's not gone out, you know, without a fight before when they wanted to remove him, he wouldn't resign. And now we have this situation, obviously, a very disturbing allegation.

But I have to say this, the state auditor of Alabama, the way he tried to spin this is to say take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager. Joseph was an adult carpenter.

According to The Air Force Times, a black cadet admitted to writing the slurs and he's since left the school. So what's the response when we see stories like these exposed as hoaxes? It's never as huge as the initial response was when we assumed that it was real -- which only encourages more hoaxes, for the outrage over the crime is the only part the press seems to remember, not its debunking, which encourages the copycats. Which is why we're doing this now: So people don't keep thinking this kind of thing pays off. Of course, social justice warriors will repeat the pathetic excuse that, while this racist act may not be true here, you just know it's true somewhere else. Which guarantees further opportunity for attention and likely another student's expulsion. I know it's crazy, but maybe it's time we stop feeding the stories to the public before they're properly investigated. Who am I kidding?

It was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person. Anyone claiming otherwise is uninformed or seeking media attention.\" Senator Paul's neighbor has pleaded not guilty, but sources say Senator Paul has been told to expect federal charges against his attacker.

He shouldn't be making any statement, because this is a very serious matter. He was injured in a horrific way. He was attacked by a psycho coward who blindsided him and severely injured him. So it's a bad situation. And when people say, \"Oh, he's not issuing a statement.\" I mean, to suggest, like -- can you imagine if this was a liberal Democrat and somebody came and attacked him at his house and broke his ribs and fluid in the lungs and the whole deal? No. It would be a completely different way that this would be handled. And for them to try to say it was about bushes or foliage or whatever, it's just absolutely ridiculous. I see this in the same way that I saw the attacks on the baseball game where, you know, Scalise was injured. This appears to be that somebody who's well-documented -- well-documented -- on his Facebook page as somebody who is very much against President Trump, wants impeachment, is very liberal in his ideology and committed a crime specifically, I believe, against Rand Paul because of those ideals."

No one was on the record blaming landscaping. And then the Washington Examiner came out with seven on-the-record neighbors saying this guy had nothing to do with the bushes. It was all political. And then the real story got out. And they also bought, the media, the defense attorney's lying about this just being about landscaping. When have the media ever bought a line from a defense attorney so some guy that just assaulted someone? And Kimberly's point is good.
