First, that brand-new hurricane forecast out from the National Hurricane Center in South Florida, and they thought it would strengthen instead it's gotten weaker, a cat-3, 120-mile-an-hour maximum sustained winds, but the core has enlarge, making the storm surge in even greater concern. Let's go live now to Ed Rappaport, he's the deputy director of the National Hurricane Center down in South Florida. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Good evening. This is the 5 p.m. Eastern Time update on Hurricane Florence. Florence remains a dangerous hurricane. It's closing in on the southeast coast. This hour, the center of the hurricane is located less than 400 miles offshore approaching the North Carolina and South Carolina coast, remains a very dangerous hurricane, category 3 on the scale at this time with winds of about 120 miles per hour. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Don't think there'll be much change in terms of intensity over the next day or two, likely to approach the coast late Thursday into Friday with winds near that strength. Because of those winds, we're expecting a very high storm surge. As the center of the storm approaches the coast, strong winds will blow on shore, pushing water ashore, and that would mean a storm surge of -- as high as 9 to 13 feet. That's an innovation. Depth over normally dry water along portions of the North Carolina coast and up some of the rivers as well with somewhat lower values but still very dangerous all the way down into South Carolina and up to near the Virginia border. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So there is a storm surge warning along the coast now for life-threatening storm surge. And this will be one of the key hazards for this hurricane. We expect that everyone who needs to prepare has -- is in the process of doing so or is completed doing so, and is following the recommendations of local officials, including evacuations as necessary. You also expect that the hurricane will slow down in its forward speed as it approaches the coast. That's bad news because not only does it prolong the wind and the storm surge along the coast, but it also allows the storm to dump more and more rainfall over land. And so we have a very large area of rainfall, total is expected of 5 to 10 inches or more, including areas that could see 20 inches, locally isolated spot to 40 inches. So we're expecting flooding along the coast from storm surge, the potential destructive winds of the coast, and then significant in-land flooding from rainfall. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And this is a big risk coming into the next couple of days. The hazards will be increasing. The conditions will be deteriorating tomorrow. And by tomorrow night and early Friday, they'll be near their worst along the coast. At the National Hurricane Center, I'm Ed Rappaport.",

They have thought there might be more strengthening, up to a category 4 before it hit land. Now they believe it will hit as a category 3. The big question is after it makes that glance and then begins to slow down, does it head down the coast into South Carolina and Georgia? Let's get a more detail look of what's expected in the next few days, our chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth live in the Fox extreme weather center.

      "sentences": "Hey, Shep, yeah. Looking a little bit more like that, our two most reliable models are getting in a much better agreement. And that hasn't really been the case for about the last five or six days at any point with this storm. So now that we have that there's the GFS, there's the euro. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Euro has been talking about these a lot of the time. Both of them, though, drift this a little bit further towards the south here, and eventually pull in-shore somewhere here across -- may be South Carolina, North Georgia. One of the big things to point out is wherever the center of that is? We can't really say where that is going to be. Is that over the water or is it over land? If it move say 30 to 40 miles in-land, it will weaken a lot more rapidly. If it stays over the water, it won't weaken as rapidly. However, it will weaken because of its slow movement it will pull up that area of low pressure will pull up cooler water that's below and it will start to weaken a little bit. When I say that, I mean from like a category 3 storm to a category 1 storm versus maybe that 50 miles an hour storm if it goes inland. Here's all of our model, our -- those spaghetti models we talked about. All of them kind of, at least, on that same idea of a northwest turn, and then this little dip to the south, eventually, say next Monday or so, pulling off towards the Ohio valley. Take a look also here, this is the satellite image. As you've just said, it has not strengthened any. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It is going to go over some warmer water. Still has to go over the Gulf Stream. That's much higher oceanic heat content. That content that it needs for it to strengthen. So it is possible it could do that a little bit. However, the eye is really large, takes a lot longer for that to strengthen. That eye being also so large, the wind fill has expanded from this, so everybody is going to get something from this storm. And take a look at the official track here, it's just kind of hugs the coast for a couple days. So that Thursday at 2 p.m., just off the shore. That's Friday at 2 p.m. That's Saturday at 2 p.m. You get the idea, not moving very much here at all. That's a prolonged period of onshore wind flows, so a storm surge pulling all of the water in. And because that wind doesn't change, all of that water is going to continue to be pulled in. The storm surge that Ed Rappaport was just talking about and then the rain that falls behind this, that rain wants to go out to the ocean, but you're going to have all of the water being pushed in from the storm surge, and that's one of the reasons why we're so concerned about that inland flooding because that water won't be able to escape back out to the ocean. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, as he was just saying as well, looking at some spots, maybe 20 to 40 inches of rain here along the coast. I just want to tell you one last thing, Shepard, Wilmington, North Carolina, their wettest year that they've ever had already. That's before this storm is anywhere near here and that's such a rainy year already. So much of this ground is already saturated. There's no place for that water to go except to flood and tried to get out. As waters coming on shore, that's why we're so concerned about this disaster in the waiting.

First, that brand-new hurricane forecast out from the National Hurricane Center in South Florida, and they thought it would strengthen instead it's gotten weaker, a cat-3, 120-mile-an-hour maximum sustained winds, but the core has enlarge, making the storm surge in even greater concern. Let's go live now to Ed Rappaport, he's the deputy director of the National Hurricane Center down in South Florida."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ED RAPPAPORT, NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER DEPUTY DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Good evening. This is the 5 p.m. Eastern Time update on Hurricane Florence. Florence remains a dangerous hurricane. It's closing in on the southeast coast. This hour, the center of the hurricane is located less than 400 miles offshore approaching the North Carolina and South Carolina coast, remains a very dangerous hurricane, category 3 on the scale at this time with winds of about 120 miles per hour. Don't think there'll be much change in terms of intensity over the next day or two, likely to approach the coast late Thursday into Friday with winds near that strength. Because of those winds, we're expecting a very high storm surge. As the center of the storm approaches the coast, strong winds will blow on shore, pushing water ashore, and that would mean a storm surge of -- as high as 9 to 13 feet. That's an innovation. Depth over normally dry water along portions of the North Carolina coast and up some of the rivers as well with somewhat lower values but still very dangerous all the way down into South Carolina and up to near the Virginia border. So there is a storm surge warning along the coast now for life-threatening storm surge. And this will be one of the key hazards for this hurricane. We expect that everyone who needs to prepare has -- is in the process of doing so or is completed doing so, and is following the recommendations of local officials, including evacuations as necessary. You also expect that the hurricane will slow down in its forward speed as it approaches the coast. That's bad news because not only does it prolong the wind and the storm surge along the coast, but it also allows the storm to dump more and more rainfall over land. And so we have a very large area of rainfall, total is expected of 5 to 10 inches or more, including areas that could see 20 inches, locally isolated spot to 40 inches. So we're expecting flooding along the coast from storm surge, the potential destructive winds of the coast, and then significant in-land flooding from rainfall. And this is a big risk coming into the next couple of days. The hazards will be increasing. The conditions will be deteriorating tomorrow. And by tomorrow night and early Friday, they'll be near their worst along the coast. At the National Hurricane Center, I'm Ed Rappaport."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "So much. So let's take a look at what just happened. What happened is the storm has weekend when they thought it would strengthen, but that's not to say it's not still extremely dangerous. It is. They have thought there might be more strengthening, up to a category 4 before it hit land. Now they believe it will hit as a category 3. The big question is after it makes that glance and then begins to slow down, does it head down the coast into South Carolina and Georgia? Let's get a more detail look of what's expected in the next few days, our chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth live in the Fox extreme weather center. Rick?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Hey, Shep, yeah. Looking a little bit more like that, our two most reliable models are getting in a much better agreement. And that hasn't really been the case for about the last five or six days at any point with this storm. So now that we have that there's the GFS, there's the euro. Euro has been talking about these a lot of the time. Both of them, though, drift this a little bit further towards the south here, and eventually pull in-shore somewhere here across -- may be South Carolina, North Georgia. One of the big things to point out is wherever the center of that is? We can't really say where that is going to be. Is that over the water or is it over land? If it move say 30 to 40 miles in-land, it will weaken a lot more rapidly. If it stays over the water, it won't weaken as rapidly. However, it will weaken because of its slow movement it will pull up that area of low pressure will pull up cooler water that's below and it will start to weaken a little bit. When I say that, I mean from like a category 3 storm to a category 1 storm versus maybe that 50 miles an hour storm if it goes inland. Here's all of our model, our -- those spaghetti models we talked about. All of them kind of, at least, on that same idea of a northwest turn, and then this little dip to the south, eventually, say next Monday or so, pulling off towards the Ohio valley. Take a look also here, this is the satellite image. As you've just said, it has not strengthened any. It is going to go over some warmer water. Still has to go over the Gulf Stream. That's much higher oceanic heat content. That content that it needs for it to strengthen. So it is possible it could do that a little bit. However, the eye is really large, takes a lot longer for that to strengthen. That eye being also so large, the wind fill has expanded from this, so everybody is going to get something from this storm. And take a look at the official track here, it's just kind of hugs the coast for a couple days. So that Thursday at 2 p.m., just off the shore. That's Friday at 2 p.m. That's Saturday at 2 p.m. You get the idea, not moving very much here at all. That's a prolonged period of onshore wind flows, so a storm surge pulling all of the water in. And because that wind doesn't change, all of that water is going to continue to be pulled in. The storm surge that Ed Rappaport was just talking about and then the rain that falls behind this, that rain wants to go out to the ocean, but you're going to have all of the water being pushed in from the storm surge, and that's one of the reasons why we're so concerned about that inland flooding because that water won't be able to escape back out to the ocean. And then, as he was just saying as well, looking at some spots, maybe 20 to 40 inches of rain here along the coast. I just want to tell you one last thing, Shepard, Wilmington, North Carolina, their wettest year that they've ever had already. That's before this storm is anywhere near here and that's such a rainy year already. So much of this ground is already saturated. There's no place for that water to go except to flood and tried to get out. As waters coming on shore, that's why we're so concerned about this disaster in the waiting. Shepard."

Normally, this would be a pretty busy highway, but not today. There's not a lot of traffic. The only people being allowed past that checkpoint are residents of Wrightsville Beach, which is just on the other side of this drawbridge. This bridge will close at 8 o'clock tonight. That's it. No one else will be allowed onto the beach. Everyone who's on the beach and wants to get off will be able to drive over the bridge this way, but you can't get onto the beach after 8 o'clock tonight, and you probably wouldn't want too. We've seen fire rescue vehicles, beach patrol vehicles, pretty much any official who's been on the beach this week is getting off it now. Most of the residents have heeded the evacuation orders. Most of the businesses around here are already closed. Most of them are also boarded up. Where we're standing will definitely be underwater if they get that 9 to 13-foot storm surge, Shepard, and they're pretty concern about it here in North Carolina."

So the headline with this brand-new 5 o'clock eastern time update from the National Hurricane Center is this, the hurricane has weekend ever so slightly. The central pressure has gone up only 1 millibar. It's continuing to hit northwest towards the coast where they believe it will strike a glancing blow somewhere along the North Carolina coast and then begin to drift down. If we look at the big map, you'll see it's now a category 3 storm moving towards that coast. If we have the big map. Let's take the big map. And there it is. And you can see it's headed right up. They're believing that by Thursday afternoon, tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock, 125-mile-an-hour maximum sustained winds, that's a strong category 3. Then coming ashore, don't know exactly where, but somewhere around Wilmington, then drifting down the coast into South Carolina, potentially into Georgia, and lingering for multiple days. The chance for an enormous storm surge is very good and chance of up to 40 inches of rain in isolated spots. Florence is one not to be taken lightly. The Five is next on Fox News Channel.

So that's 37 percent as frequent. So if there's rising climate change and fewer of these major hurricanes, there goes your theory. But there is something -- you know, there's an increase in damage over time with these hurricanes. But that's not due to the storm intensity, it's because we're increasing infrastructure in coastal areas, so you can blame -- not global warming, but you can blame the builders for building in areas where there're storms. But I will say this to be fair because I know Juan disagree with me, the jury is probably still out on this stuff. It's going to take time to look at everything. The big problem is, is what I call the Trump floater. You know when you go to a bar and you order like a whiskey with a Bailey's floater or a Meyer's floater, every story is now a drink. Every story is a drink with a Trump floater. So it's like whether -- whether it's about -- like yesterday, 9/11, or hurricanes, or any kind of event, psychological disorders, depression."

I do think that America plays an important role here, and that is because we're innovative and we have a growing economy right now, and that means you can invest in new technology so that you can get to the point that Jedediah was making which is, can we continue to figure out a way to decrease them.

A lot of Democrats on the ballot are already saying, \"We're not aligning ourselves with her.\" And I think -- I think it's a bad move. I mean, she's part of an old regime, so to speak. I think they need some new blood in there. And if you have people on the fence, likely to vote, as you say, in all these places that are very red that may flip and may say, as a rejection of Trump, \"We're going to vote for a Democrat,\" Nancy Pelosi is being used in all these Republican attack ads.

Yes, that's an eagle, in case you couldn't make it out, perched on an extended ladder on the back of a fire truck that was there to honor victims of the 9/11 terror attacks' 17th anniversary, the tragedy yesterday. Fire chief Jerry Streich, who made the video, said the eagle landed there and stayed for so long he was able to get his phone out and capture the video. The eagle landed there just as the pair of fire trucks were suspending a giant American flag. \"We couldn't have asked for anything more patriotic,\" the chief said. The Facebook video, by the way, has been viewed by more than three million folks and attracted endless well wishes. Looks like fate, huh?"
