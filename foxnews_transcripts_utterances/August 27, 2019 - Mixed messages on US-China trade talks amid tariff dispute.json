We measure these things day to day. There's a lot of different variables, obviously, with the markets. But over all changes since the president took office, it's important to step back and look 30,000 feet, real GDP growth is down. And a lot of people blame specifically this China trade back and forth for really the slowdown that they are seeing here. Unemployment rate also down, consumer confidence is up significantly, and average hourly earnings are up despite some criticism that they wouldn't be. They are. Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post,\" and FOX News contributor Steve Hayes.

And if China were to do that, then they were to threaten the CCCP's grip on power. So in the midst of protests in Hong Kong, upcoming anniversary of the Communist Party takeover of China, and then the Taiwan elections in January, we are in for a long road ahead.",

And Peter Navarro, his top adviser on China, seemed more and more to actually see a break with China as the strategic goal, a decoupling of the U.S. and the Chinese economies. And the irony here is there's actually -- I don't know about for a decoupling, but for a much, much tougher posture on China, there's quite a bit of support in the United States, including in our business community. What has got people troubled and uncertain and disinclined to invest is the conduct of the policy, is the erratic nature of the president's pronouncements that just what you were showing, he doesn't seem to even know if there was a phone call or who made it. He refers to the vice chairman on China, whoever that is. And it raises big questions about his competence with which he is pursuing this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so it's not so much that there is a trade war per see or a confrontation with China.

This is not a theoretical war, these aren't theoretical problems. It's affecting real people, and in many cases people that the president has promised to help. I think the broader question of volatility, volatility and President Trump, that's not anything new. You just look at the rest of the stuff that happened this past weekend, whether it's picking fights with Denmark, whether it's retweeting conspiracy theorists, whether it's not having a straight story. That part I think people have come to expect from the president even if this past weekend was a little crazier than it usually is. But I think the real problem on the trade war is that the president and his team are now making arguments that contradict arguments they have made for years. American consumers won't really will be affected, this isn't a big deal. And then when the president decides to hold off on new tariffs, they celebrate this as a gift to the American consumer. Those two things are in pretty obvious tension.

      "utterance": "The who, what, when about phone calls between the U.S. and China, it is unsettling, obviously, for the market. Today, the market, the Dow started out down. We measure these things day to day. There's a lot of different variables, obviously, with the markets. But over all changes since the president took office, it's important to step back and look 30,000 feet, real GDP growth is down. And a lot of people blame specifically this China trade back and forth for really the slowdown that they are seeing here. Unemployment rate also down, consumer confidence is up significantly, and average hourly earnings are up despite some criticism that they wouldn't be. They are. Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post,\" and FOX News contributor Steve Hayes. Matthew, we are now in the second day of digesting post G7 and really the fallout from this China trade war back and forth. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I don't think anyone should be optimistic, Bret, that the trade war will end any time soon, President Trump is asking the Chinese to pay a price they just can't pay, and that is liberalizing their economy, ending the state owned enterprises, ending the forced technology transfer, ending the nontariff trade barriers that China has. And if China were to do that, then they were to threaten the CCCP's grip on power. So in the midst of protests in Hong Kong, upcoming anniversary of the Communist Party takeover of China, and then the Taiwan elections in January, we are in for a long road ahead."

Chuck, he doesn't like some polls. This one he probably likes. And the question is whether there is that negative rebound the longer this goes. CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": I agree with Matt, and I also would add that I'm not sure President Trump really wants a deal. And Peter Navarro, his top adviser on China, seemed more and more to actually see a break with China as the strategic goal, a decoupling of the U.S. and the Chinese economies. And the irony here is there's actually -- I don't know about for a decoupling, but for a much, much tougher posture on China, there's quite a bit of support in the United States, including in our business community. What has got people troubled and uncertain and disinclined to invest is the conduct of the policy, is the erratic nature of the president's pronouncements that just what you were showing, he doesn't seem to even know if there was a phone call or who made it. He refers to the vice chairman on China, whoever that is. And it raises big questions about his competence with which he is pursuing this. And so it's not so much that there is a trade war per see or a confrontation with China. Some people thought --"

    {
      "speaker": "STEVE HAYES, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, and this is an area where the presidents volatility has obvious real term economic effects. You're seeing people, you've seen people over the years, whether you're talking about steel producers, whether you're talking about manufacturers, whether you're talking about farmers, who are seeing this in their pocket book. This is not a theoretical war, these aren't theoretical problems. It's affecting real people, and in many cases people that the president has promised to help. I think the broader question of volatility, volatility and President Trump, that's not anything new. You just look at the rest of the stuff that happened this past weekend, whether it's picking fights with Denmark, whether it's retweeting conspiracy theorists, whether it's not having a straight story. That part I think people have come to expect from the president even if this past weekend was a little crazier than it usually is. But I think the real problem on the trade war is that the president and his team are now making arguments that contradict arguments they have made for years. American consumers won't really will be affected, this isn't a big deal. And then when the president decides to hold off on new tariffs, they celebrate this as a gift to the American consumer. Those two things are in pretty obvious tension. You don't have to know a whole lot about how trade wars are conducted to know that those things don't agree with one another."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "On the flipside, arguing the other way, the president said this is how he negotiates. Yes, it's chaotic. But the Chinese don't know what he's going with next, and there hasn't been a president who has pushed back on China like this one has."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "I think on two big issues, the rise of China and also the concentration of power in Silicon Valley, President Trump has forced the conversation, forced Washington to take attention and to pay attention. I would say this, though. When talking about a global economy which is the only closed economy is the global economy, there are a lot of different pressures on this global economy. It's not just the trade war with China. We also have a slowdown in Germany. We also have the possibility of a hard Brexit coming up at the end of October. And we also have political and economic disruption in Italy. So there are a lot of different factors that could tip the global economy into a downturn, and that could hurt President Trump in the long run."

We recognized, we recognized that North Korea's rogue behavior could not be ignored."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "On all those fronts, he's right, they did call it out. But on all those fronts there is still a question mark about what comes next, on China, on Iran, that Iran says it's not going to sit down with President Trump now, and on North Korea as they launch missiles and the prospect of a third summit still hangs in the ether."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "And on all three of them there is this strange kind of dual quality to the way the president talks about these hostile powers, China, Iran, North Korea. Every other day, they are the enemy, and then he says Kim Jong-un is a guy I love, and we get a terrific letter from him, and he builds up the legitimacy of someone like that. On one day he's saying Iran is a rogue state and we've got to crack down. But hey, I'd be happy to sit down with the president of Iran, something Barack Obama never dared to propose. And so people are never quite sure exactly whether he understands the role of the United States in conferring legitimacy on the same regimes that he's attacking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "speaker": "HAYES",

Iran is an enemy. They are a determined enemy. They're a foe. I would say one thing that wasn't in that clip from Mike Pompeo was the administration's words, rhetoric, and I think policy coming on Afghanistan, where they are downplaying the threat from the Taliban and not speaking the truth about the threats emanating from jihadists in Afghanistan and the Taliban specifically."

On average, 130 people die every day from an opioid overdose, 2.1 million people in the U.S. suffer from an opioid use disorder. The stats are staggering, and if you look at five states with the highest rates of opioid overdose deaths, this is back in 2017, you can see West Virginia, Ohio, Washington D.C., New Hampshire, and Maryland.
