This is \"The Five.\" It was a Democratic slugfest, the 2020 presidential candidates mixing it up during the sixth primary debate. Mayor Pete Buttigieg the target of many of those attacks. Take a look."

      "speaker": "Dana Perino",
      "utterance": "Well. Yes. This is what I understand about this debate from Elizabeth Warren. So basically, what she's saying is this. She has disavowed doing big fundraisers, okay? Now, this is after she ran for Senate and raised 10.5 million dollars from big donors that she then put it towards her campaign. And she's complaining that something like Mayor Pete has gained some support from big donors and is taking that money. But nobody, nobody, except for a very small percentage of people, cares about campaign finance reform as long as it's disclosed as to who is donating. So, she wastes all of this time talking about this. I thought that he was getting attacked because he has risen in the polls while she has declined ever since for Medicare for All. And I think that it showed that he was well able to fight back. I thought one of the best lines of the night was when he's talked about the purity tests and the problem with them, especially if you can't even pass the test that you put out there, which she has done. And I think that he also made another good point. If you plan to beat President Trump in 2020, you have to deal with the fact that the Republicans are awash in cash. Jesse just mentioned right before the show we saw that the president raised 10 million dollars in this week --"

He said less bizarre things. He still said crazy things, for instance, I think one person said, you know, \"Are you just going to throw, like, hundreds of thousands manufacturing jobs in order to go green?” And he said, \"Yeah.\"."

So, Peter Doocy was out on the trail, and he asked the Biden people, \"Did he mean, really, it's OK to get rid of all these hundreds of thousands of jobs in order for the environment to be better?

She's, as you've said, taken money from lots of lots of rich people. Why would you disarm? It's like unilateral disarmament. Trumps awash, I like that word, awash with cash. And you're going to say, \"No, no, no, no. A billionaire's money's dirty because the guy is a billionaire.\" What if the billionaire is a radical left-wing Democrat that hates Trump more than you do? You're not going to take his cash? Like most Democrat ideas, it doesn't make any sense."

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Yeah. That was actually. That wasn't his best answer. I liked what he had to say, and I liked the question on nuclear power. That was interesting. On PBS. On PBS, which stands for pretty boring stuff, was pretty interesting. I don't know. I felt like it was the whole thing. Covering this debate seemed so anticlimactic."

You're in the shadow of impeachment, and you feel like you're watching like a high school theater troupe taking a tour of the model U.N. Right. Everything seems so small. However, I did find that I genuinely liked a couple of the people more the more that they talked. I thought Amy Klobuchar did good and I think Biden did OK. You can feel that you're comfortable around these people. But Trump just keeps changing our perspective on things, whether it's our relationship with our allies, impeachment or even the Democratic field. Everything just seems so, so different. I was troubled by the fact that they keep talking about our world in peril. We have Trump -- troops that are returning safely to a country where they have jobs. I mean, this is a great time to be alive and to be in America. I think that's a challenge for them because they can't instill the fear in us that they, you know, they would love to. I wanted to talk about the wine cave."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Juan Williams",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, that's an interesting point because I was struck by the fact that it was consistent among all the Democrats said, \"You know what? If you go out on the campaign trail, so many people struggling not only with paying health care bills, but paying just basic education bills, paying for the groceries.\""

      "speaker": "Emily Compagno",
      "utterance": "I'll be fast. So, I just wanted to speak about that moment between Bernie and Amna when she asked about race and he answered in response about climate change. And she said, you know, with all due respect, I asked you about race. And to me, that was a metaphor for the Democratic Party right now, which is that voices are asking to be heard in a certain way and those on top and the establishment, Democrats included and especially are saying, \"Oh, no, honey. Shh, shh. Let me tell you what's really important. Let me tell you what you need to care about.\" I thought it was that perfect symbolic moment. I think Yang continues to shine in that he's the best issue spotter on that stage. He continues to me to demonstrate that he's not presidential. But he's absolutely like at the top of answering in these relatable issues that gets to the point that the other ones who are kind of continuing to bring about their same talking points, the same lunch buffet of issues that they care about, you know, exactly every time they open their mouth what they're going to say. And that's not the case with him. And, just as a reminder, you guys; Gabbard, Booker, Castro, Bloomberg, Bennett, Delaney, Patrick, and Williamson are still in the race."

And I think that the scarlet eye of impeachment, as the 9 p.m. host of MSNBC said, basically, it's like, \"You're not asleep,\" and it's almost like they woke up on Christmas morning. He got impeached. It was just what they always wanted. And now they have that. And maybe they don't even care about it going to the Senate."

[CROSSTALK] They want to accuse Trump and brand him with impeachment, without having to go to court. They want to indict without a trial because they know they'll lose. And that -- the thing is, it goes back to that question that I raised yesterday. Why would you be happy if you knew that you have lost? It's because it wasn't ever about justice. It wasn't about politics. It was about making Orange Monster feel bad. And make all of his supporters feel bad. And that is how you feel good. That's what people -- the little spring in your step, BS. It is purely an emotional act, and I have to think that the supporters and the fans of MSNBC and CNN, when they wake up, to Christmas and they expected a puppy, and they got a chemistry set, and they're looking and they go, is that all there is? They're going to feel mad. And that's what they're -- and again, they're going to have these viewers and these fans leave them because you going to be betrayed the way they were betrayed over Covington and Kavanaugh and collusion.

There has to be some kind of retribution when a person is falsely called racist because it's a label that sticks forever.
