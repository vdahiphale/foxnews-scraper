He's the U.S. ambassador to the E.U. He's the one who actually talked to the president about all of this. The Ukrainian foreign minister last night, Vadym Prystaiko, had a statement in which he said that he never heard from Gordon Sondland that there was any connection between the investigations and U.S. aid to Ukraine. So, Sondland may be asked about that. The president said, well, that exonerates him and there goes impeachment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } However, Sondland did talk to Ukrainian officials on September the 1st, Andriy Yermak in particular, to say he believed that that aid was being held up because of the investigation.

And then to drop the tweet in, in the middle and give Schiff the chance to read it to the -- to this witness, who was very impressive, who was praised by both sides, and to have her react to it in a kind of a dignified outrage, I think it was a bad moment politically for the president.

As you get through a week like we have had and you get towards the end of the week, positions want to be appropriately priced going into the weekend, because anything can happen over the weekend.

Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And it is very clear today the president is no fan of the former U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, the president tweeting everywhere she -- well, everywhere she went turned bad. And in real time, the ambassador firing back, calling that tweet -- quote - - \"very intimidating.\" But, legally, how damaging is it? We are all over it with John Roberts at the White House with more on the tweet that's creating this stir, and Ellison Barber on Capitol Hill if today's testimony is actually going anywhere.

Let's set put up the tweet for you, so you can follow along exactly what the president said -- quote -- \"Everywhere Maria Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia. How did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian president spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. \"It is a U.S. president's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\" It is absolutely a United States' presidents right to appoint ambassadors. He can make political appointments. He can pick people who are already in the Foreign Services and put them in there. It is the president's prerogative and discretion to do it. But to send out that tweet in the middle of the hearing gave Adam Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman, a perfect opportunity to say, hmm, maybe we should consider an article of impeachment here on witness intimidation. Listen to what Schiff said."

But there could be other articles of impeachment as well, witness intimidation or tampering, obstruction. And don't forget Schiff has talked an awful lot about obstruction with the fact that the White House will not send certain people up to Capitol Hill to give depositions before the House committees. Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary, though, with the president's back, saying -- quote -- \"The tweet wasn't witness intimidation. It was simply the president's opinion, which he is entitled to. This is not a trial. It is a partisan political process, or, to put it more accurately, a totally legitimate charade stacked against the president.\" In the last hour, you saw some of the Republican members of the committee point to the July 25 phone call in which the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, did talk about Marie Yovanovitch in not-too-flattering term, saying -- quote -- \"It was great that you, the president, were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador, because I agree with you 100 percent. Her attitude towards me was far from the best, as she admired the previous president.\" That was Poroshenko. \"And she was on his side. She wouldn't accept me as a new president well enough.\" Next week, the marquee witness is going to be on Wednesday, will be Gordon Sondland. He's the U.S. ambassador to the E.U. He's the one who actually talked to the president about all of this. The Ukrainian foreign minister last night, Vadym Prystaiko, had a statement in which he said that he never heard from Gordon Sondland that there was any connection between the investigations and U.S. aid to Ukraine. So, Sondland may be asked about that. The president said, well, that exonerates him and there goes impeachment. However, Sondland did talk to Ukrainian officials on September the 1st, Andriy Yermak in particular, to say he believed that that aid was being held up because of the investigation. So still a long way to go here, Neil, and a lot to clear up."

And I view it more that way. The president is not going to be impeached and removed. So the issue to me is not, are they making much progress making their impeachment case? Because I think, if that's what you were looking at, today wasn't a good day for the advancement, say, of this bribery case, which I think has a lot of problems. But if what you were trying to foment here is a kind of an ick factor, politically speaking, I think they probably did make progress as far as that's concerned. The tweet is part of that. I think to say the tweet is an impeachable offense is overwrought. If it's to say the tweet was really an inappropriate thing to do and actually turned out to be damaging, in that it gave the Democrats their best moments of the day, I think that's a fair observation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, the thing is, Neil, when you're trying to prepare for something that's either a trial or something like a trial, like this kind of an adversarial proceeding, you want to make sure that the people who are conducting it, especially in this public setting that so many people are watching, that they get -- that they have a plan and that they're able to implement a plan. And if someone is dropping bombs from the sidelines that no one can anticipate, that kind of causes a big ruckus as far as the plan is concerned. And it seems to me, the president did that twice today. So, at the beginning of the day, he released the transcript of the first conversation with Zelensky. And, to my mind, that really didn't do much. I mean, I guess you can look at it and say there was no intimidation there. But on the other hand, it gave Adam Schiff the opportunity to talk about all of the things that they have asked for that the administration hasn't turned over. So, to me, that was an unforced error, because he was able to marshal what he calls evidence of obstruction. And they are talking about having an obstruction article of impeachment. And then to drop the tweet in, in the middle and give Schiff the chance to read it to the -- to this witness, who was very impressive, who was praised by both sides, and to have her react to it in a kind of a dignified outrage, I think it was a bad moment politically for the president. It doesn't mean he will be impeached and removed. That's not going to happen."

      "speaker": "REP. BRAD WENSTRUP, R-OH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it obviously, in some ways, stole the show. But I got to say this. It has to be somewhat frustrating through this process, as it is for us, where we have the chairman, who shuts us down when we're asking questions, where we try to go through procedure. We're in a situation where we can't use some of the previous testimonies in these open hearings because Adam Schiff still has them under lock and key. And here's a president who's being impeached, if you will, and he has no way to defend himself. That has to be frustrating. I'm not saying I would tweet, necessarily. But, at the same time, I would imagine that that's pretty frustrating. I want to be there to talk about impeachable offenses. And one of the things that we came away with today is, here we have someone who was part of the interagency who supported lethal aid. And this is what this was all about, right? The aid, I thought, was what's in question in this impeachment. She was for the lethal aid under the previous administration and this administration. Congress was for the lethal aid under the previous administration and this administration. And guess what? The previous president completely denied Congress and the interagency, and yet we have another president who actually delivered the aid. And now he's being impeached. To me, that doesn't make sense. There was another telling moment again today. Chris Stewart asks, is there a crime? Is there a crime? And she said no."

    {

Leaving aside how it looks to comment on a witness on the stand, and whether that could be witness intimidation, as Democrats charge, that might be a bit of an overreach, but it was an unforced error, when things were going pretty much the president's way, at least thus far, reading from polls that seem to still be going his way, to markets that are certainly going his way. He didn't need to do that."

      "speaker": "WENSTRUP",

But at the same time, I don't think we got the full tweet. I haven't even seen the full tweet. But I understand he had a lot more to say in it. And so I don't think it's fair, as we have seen throughout this whole process, for Adam Schiff..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, would you tell him, Congressman, if other witnesses appear, that should he reserve commenting on them, certainly in real time, while they're still on the stand?

    {
      "speaker": "WENSTRUP",
      "utterance": "No, I think -- I think he's -- people are going to say that. They also brought up a point today where they called it witness intimidation.

They would have to prove something beyond that. And they are still a few people away from doing that, which is the problem. It may be distasteful, but it's not impeachable at this point.

I think I told you last week that, again, Democrats' voters gave Democratic lawmakers on the Hill the license to stick with Clinton.

Now, there are a lot of people who loved John Dean, a lot of people thought he was just leading a cabal against President Nixon, but at least there was one-on-one with the president of the United States.

And I think, when I ran investigations, the first thing we always did was make sure it's fair, because if the process is unfair, you lose all credibility. That's why Henry Hyde ran things the way he did in Clinton and why Peter Rodino ran things the way he did in Nixon. And I just don't see that here."

And last time that happened was back in January 2018. Charlie Brady, our stocks editor on FOX Business, who knows way too much, and he just shared that with me, as a very interesting anomaly. Market watcher Jonathan Corpina on all of that from the New York Stock Exchange. Jonathan, it gained particular steam in the last roughly 20 minutes. We were up a lot already.

We don't think it's going to be for quite some time. Trade talk clearly has an effect on our market. We have seen it this week, where there were a couple of negative headlines come out that the talks had broken down. We saw the market come down, pull back 100 points, immediately rebound back. What we saw at the end of the day today is the mentality of, I don't want to miss out on this trade. As you get through a week like we have had and you get towards the end of the week, positions want to be appropriately priced going into the weekend, because anything can happen over the weekend. So investors are trying to get those last trades in. They're holding back. And at the at the end of the day, when they see this market is not going to pull back, they throw their buy orders in. And that's why we see that spike towards the end of the day. But taking a step back and looking at it from the macro sense, the market is doing what it should be doing, right? Fundamentals are good, the economy is good, sentiment is good, and all these other ancillary stuff that can have a negative effect on our markets, it just isn't impacting it just yet. That doesn't mean it won't happen. But, clearly, investors, Main Street, Wall Street are clearly looking at all these headlines."

In fact, there's another deposition that started right after the hearing this afternoon with David Holmes. He's somebody who worked in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. And I'll tell you, to sum up today's hearing, usually, you have a big moment in one of these hearings that kind of crystallizes the entire scenario. This might be the first hearing that ever had something that happened outside the hearing room that is emblematic of the hearing itself. And that was that ionized tweet from President Trump directed at Marie Yovanovitch here. And after the hearing, Elise Stefanik, a Democratic congresswoman from New York who is a member of the Intelligence Committee, said this hearing was not about a tweet, but in many respects it was -- Neil, back to you."
