Now, this comes, of course, as a caravan of more than 1,000 asylum-seekers and migrants are traveling through Mexico to America and tonight, there are reports that has now been stalled. Also breaking news from Sara Carter.

And also breaking, a brand-new poll showing 67 percent of you, the American people, want a special counsel to be appointed to investigate the severe FISA abuses against the Trump campaign and 77 percent of Americans see fake news for what it is.

They are not even interested in helping DACA recipients because they want to make this a big campaign issue in 2018 this year.

      "sentences": "Think about this. All the drug trafficking, human trafficking, and, of course, the possibility that terrorists, too, can cross that border. This is a major national security issue and there's a reason why Mexico, all of a sudden, now appears at the last minute willing to cooperate with the Trump administration to stop the Caribbean. That's because President Trump is applying a tremendous amount of pressure, just like he did with little rocket man, Kim Jong Un. President Trump is telling Mexico, if they don't act, NAFTA negotiations will be in jeopardy. He also threatened to pull foreign aid from Honduras, where many of these migrants are coming from. It's about time an American president stood up for our country's sovereignty. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And because the media and the left love to distort conservative positions on this, let me be clear -- there is nothing wrong with people coming to the United States of America. We're just asking it be done legally. We are a constitutional republic. We have laws. Those laws need to be obeyed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You can't have a country when illegal immigrants, noncitizens, can enter as they please. And guess what, that's what the president is now trying to do here. And, by the way, enough is enough when it comes to Mexico and people like their former president, Vicente Fox, he's lecturing us about how we deal with illegal immigration. Yet under Vicente Fox, Mexico sharply increased their police, their military presence at their own southern border and they spent millions of dollars upgrading security checkpoints. As a result, from 2002 to 2006, detentions, deportations increased by 74 percent in Mexico. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is ridiculous. Beyond hypocritical, for Mexico to constantly be lecturing the United States regarding immigration laws when they are far tougher than we've ever been. And for spending -- sending military personnel to secure the borders, well, liberals and the media are so outraged that President Trump would dare to do that. Here's the thing, they are completely silent, of course, when President Obama did that exact same thing back in 2010. Back then, Obama sent 1,200 National Guard troops to the border to help Border Patrol agents. Remember in 2014, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, he called up the National Guard to protect the border because the Obama administration wasn't doing enough. Well, it's not like this is unprecedented. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's another point the liberal media will never tell you. They were so quick to criticize President Trump for saying that he wants to use part of the military's budget to build a border wall. It's a national security issue. According to a 2009 Congressional Research Service Report, the military has already been used to help construct the border wall by past presidents, including George W. Bush and even Barack Obama. Those are facts the media will never tell you any of this, because it doesn't fit their anti-Trump agenda. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to a new survey, 89 percent of Border Patrol agents say a wall system in strategic vocations is necessary to secure the border. That is coming directly from the people on the ground there every day risking their lives. Why not give them what they're asking for it? And what President Trump is calling for is security and accountability. It is that simple. And for the record, this position is similar to the one that Barack Hussein Obama once held. You may remember him saying this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So, it's the height of ignorance and stupidity and that's why President Trump wants to change it. Other countries, for example, let's look at Australia. They don't roll out the red carpet for illegal immigrants like we do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When Australia catches asylum-seekers trying to enter their country -- well, they are very compassionate. They give them food, they give them water, they gave them medical attention if they needed to. And then they send the migrants back from where they came. That's beyond past time that America used the same common sense measures to secure our borders. Also brand-new tonight, another major report, Sara Carter who will join us in a few minutes. Here's the headline: Bombshell sacred texts show FBI, DOJ may have rushed anti-Trump FISA warrants. And according to Sara Carter, congressional investigators have discovered new text messages between anti-Trump FBI agents, lovebirds, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page that show possible coordination between the FBI and the DOJ to get a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associate, Carter Page. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In one of the text messages Sara has obtained, Strzok is whining and complaining to Page that a warrant in the Russia investigation is being held up. And one of the congressional investigators is telling Sara tonight, quote: 'Everything here from the texts, complaining about FISA delays to the exchanges indicating coordination, to the White House visitors log, well, it seems a bit match to a disturbing degree. At best, it's a strange coincidence worth investigating. Now, but, of course, it's much likely more.' if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, you have the FBI using an unverified Clinton bought and paid for dossier as part of a FISA application, then they rush to get a FISA warrant approved, and new evidence points to coordination between the Obama White House, the FBI, the DOJ, and the CIA. Sara will explain all of us in a few minutes. Also tonight, Robert Mueller secures his first conviction, got to give him a lot of credit in this witch hunt. A Dutch lawyer was just sentenced to 30 days in jail, 30 whole days. And he's being ordered to pay $20,000 fine for lying to the FBI. That's it? And it had nothing to do with Russia collusion. The media played this up. They thought this guy was getting 20 years. In reality, it looks like a giant waste of your money. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } While the media was hyper-focused on this apparent Dutch lawyer and this travesty, they missed a massive story that proves Robert Mueller is carrying out a witch hunt that is being aided and abetted by his buddy, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. And according to an August memo written by Rosenstein, he actually authorized Mueller to go after Paul Manafort's work with the Ukrainian government which happened way, way before Paul Manafort anything had anything to do with Donald Trump on the Trump campaign. In addition to that, none of the charges Paul Manafort is facing have anything to do with any of that. And, of course, that's only half the story. 'Washington Times' reporting that Mueller investigated Paul Manafort on an allegation from the never corroborated, now known to be lies that Clinton bought and paid for dossier, that came from an unnamed Russian source and sources. It's pretty shocking but it shouldn't come as a surprise. The special counsel Mueller as corrupt as they come, he doesn't seem to care about truth, doesn't care about facts, doesn't care about evidence. He doesn't care about being fair. He doesn't care that he's biased. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at the team he's assembled, a team of Democratic donors that donated to Hillary, Obama, the DNC. And we can't ignore that Rod Rosenstein, he's a guy that appointed Mueller, Rosenstein is giving Mueller free reign to do whatever he wants. Whatever happened, by the way, to this so-called collusion? Turn out to be a witch hunt. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Rod Rosenstein, he should be ashamed of himself and, frankly, he's the same guy that signed the FISA extension against Trump associate Carter Page and then appointed Mueller. Does anyone see that as a conflict of interest? And like we have been saying, Rosenstein needs to go. And also tonight, a brand-new poll, 67 percent of you, the American people, think a second special counsel should in fact we named to investigate all the disturbing FISA abuses that we've been reporting on and the media's been ignoring it because you, the American people, understand the severity of this because it's a massive abuse of power and that the DOJ and the FBI, they cannot investigate themselves, because that is a massive conflict of interest. It's called abuse of power. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } While the Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he won't be naming a second special counsel, he has appointed Utah prosecutor John Huber since November, we didn't know about it -- good for Jeff Sessions -- to serve in a similar capacity. While it's not a special counsel, it's a massive development. And as a federal prosecutor, Huber will be able to convene a grand jury, gather evidence, issue subpoenas, have witnesses testify, and that means he'll be able to properly investigate these FISA abuses. The FBI putting the fix it on the Clinton email investigation, kickbacks to the Clinton Foundation, the corrupt Uranium One deal, and, of course, lying to a FISA judge and the phony dossier that she paid for. A major development and it's just getting started. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Another quick point tonight. Jill McCabe, she is the wife of the fired FBI Director Andrew McCabe -- well, she has an op-ed in 'The Washington Post,' where she is claiming to be setting the record straight. Predictably, Jill McCabe excuses the fact that her husband was fired for lying under oath multiple times about a number of issues. And instead, she's blaming President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If he dog bites, if the bee stings, if you're feeling sad, and if you have a headache, and hangover, it's Donald Trump's fault. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Jill McCabe seems to be downplaying the fact she got over $700,000 in campaign money from key Clinton ally, BFF Terry McAuliffe, and the Virginia Democratic Party , when she had a failed state Senate run. Now, state senate candidates in Virginia, they never get that kind of money. So, the McCabes, they can whine all they want in public about what happened, but facts are facts. You can't change that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right. Finally tonight, I have a special message for the abusively biased media that once again is trying to smear me. So, yesterday on my radio show, I was making a point about Robert Mueller dividing this country at a level we have never seen in forever, which he undoubtedly is doing and has been doing. And I made reference, it's like a civil war in this country because of his abusively biased team, corrupt Democrats, people that see truth, we're sick and tired of it. And it's dividing those that hate Trump, those that like Donald Trump. Look at the person like Andrew Weissmann he appointed. What the media didn't report to you -- well, I was talking about a really deep divide that the arrogant Mueller's creating and that Americans are more divided than ever and I was actually talking about family members, a civil war, and they're going to sit at dinner and they're going to have a food fights and they're going to throw mashed potatoes and broccoli at each other at the dinner table. I wasn't talking about a real civil war and I was very clear. This sent the media into a frenzy, but they quickly ignored everything I said. And they raced to take me out of context, like they always do, claiming, oh, Hannity wants a civil war in America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No, I'm saying we're more divided than ever. And as you know from watching the show, this is what the media does all the time, but I'm not going to sit back and take their crap. We're going to call out the corrupt media in this country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For example, the media lost it over me saying the word 'civil war'. OK, we went to the archives. They have said it many more times than I have. And we've got the proof.",

And what these text messages in particular reveal that the FBI may have been improperly coordinated with Department of Justice officials to try to expedite FISA applications on Carter Page. And what was interesting about this, Sean, is that if you look at it, they talk about David Laufman. Now, he hasn't come up quite frequently at all in the media. David Laufman was a DOJ prosecutor. Strzok is talking to Lisa Page about David Laufman. He was in charge of the Hillary Clinton investigation on the DOJ side. He was a very senior official, in charge of national security, as well as Russia. And Peter Strzok tells Lisa Page basically, look, you know, I'm upset with Laufman, Laufman is trying to explain why things aren't moving past enough in the eastern district of Virginia, probably referencing that, you know, the area where all the subpoenas had been issued by Mueller and the FISA application isn't moving fast enough. So, it kind of shows this buildup. They also noticed that White House logs actually correlated with some of these text messages. So, as they were discussing this back and forth, they bring up another guy from the DOJ. Matthew Axelrod, he's a DOJ prosecutor who is involved in the case. They talk about him. They talk about the frustration, they talk about Andy McCabe may be coming under fire or by some of these folks at the DOJ for the supposed information that was in the application. And then they say, two days later after these text messages are exchanged, Matthew Axelrod actually goes to the White House and signs the visitors log and actually visits President Trump. I think what we're looking at here is little pieces of the puzzle. How much did people in the White House know? Did the president know about this investigation himself? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What we do know now is based on information that came out last week, is that very senior members in the FBI, the CIA, and in the White House, were well aware of this investigation early on and may have coordinated.",

The bottom line is, we've heard the president in recent days ramping up the rhetoric on illegal immigration as a caravan moves through Central America toward the U.S. border. What's new tonight is that the president is now promising dramatic action to back up those words by using the American military to help secure the southern border until the wall is built. What he did today is he convened a meeting with Defense Secretary James Mattis, other top cabinet military officials to say that in the absence of action by congress, he wants executive action. The cracked down on illegal immigration, drugs, violent gangs coming from Mexico and elsewhere in Central America. Tonight, White House officials are making very clear the president is talking about mobilizing the National Guard to secure the southern border, not active duty military. That's prohibited by law because active duty military cannot get involved in domestic law enforcement actions like apprehensions at the border. Yet, there was a bit of a freak out from some Democrats like Congressman Ruben Gallego of Arizona who tweeted today, quote, real Donald Trump wants to use our troops to advance his extreme anti-immigrant agenda, while wasting time, resources and money, and depleting our military's strength in areas of real danger. Congress must stop this misguided scheme. --... What he and other Democrats seem to have missed is that then President Barack Obama in 2010, George W. Bush in 2006, they did similar things. The Obama administration sent 1200 National Guard troops to the southern border to assist border patrol and immigration officials amid concerns about drug trafficking. They've provided intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance. The Bush administration launched operation jump-start, 6,000 members of the guard for engineering, road and fence building. What the president today seemed to be saying that's different. He says he may be looking at a more aggressive approach where the National Guard, perhaps, takes on a more direct law enforcement role. Plus, a senior official here, tonight, saying the number of National Guard troops will be, quote, unquote, substantial, suggesting, at least, a larger number than we've ever seen before. We're going to have to, obviously, fact-check that and see how it plays out. Now, as you noted, the reaction from Mexico, swift and negative. Vicente Fox, the former president saying, real Donald Trump, to militarized the southern border as you provoked more hate and distance even further between our nations, somebody has to talk some sense into him. He's elevating his hate towards Mexico causing a greater conflict. The current Mexican government, by the way, sent an official request to the White House late today saying they want clarification on what the president's remarks really mean for this relationship. And we're told that the homeland security secretary for the president has been in touch on.",

'Washington Post' reporting at this hour the special counsel Robert Mueller told President Trump's attorney the president is not a criminal target, but, of course, that witch hunt continues. Also, President Trump is taking bold action and seeing U.S. military will guard the southern border until that wall is built. Now, this comes, of course, as a caravan of more than 1,000 asylum-seekers and migrants are traveling through Mexico to America and tonight, there are reports that has now been stalled. Also breaking news from Sara Carter. Now, text messages from the corrupt Trump-hating FBI lovebirds, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, show that the FBI appears to have improperly coordinated with the DOJ to expedite the FISA warrant to spy on Trump campaign associate Carter Page. And also breaking, a new memo is now showing the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in fact allowed Robert Mueller to go way beyond his mandate to investigate Paul Manafort. Now, this includes using the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier to go after the former Trump campaign chairman. And also breaking, a brand-new poll showing 67 percent of you, the American people, want a special counsel to be appointed to investigate the severe FISA abuses against the Trump campaign and 77 percent of Americans see fake news for what it is. Now, this, of course, after the Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed a Utah prosecutor to do essentially a lot of the same things. We'll explain. All that plus I have a special message for the destroyed Trump media once again trying to twist and distort my words in their latest attempt to smear, slander, besmirched.

We're going to analyze this new development in a minute, but first, we also have the president refusing to back away from his promise to secure America's borders. Here's the current situation. Congress has repeatedly failed to pass tough immigration laws and people are flooding into our country. Democrats, they have been obstructing every single step of the way. They are not interested in solving problems. They are not even interested in helping DACA recipients because they want to make this a big campaign issue in 2018 this year. And according to reports, that caravan of more than 1,000 asylum-seekers and immigrants heading for the United States has now reportedly stalled out in Mexico.

Until we can have a wall and proper security, we're going to be guarding our border with the military. That's a big step. We really haven't done that before, certainly not very much before."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Think about this. All the drug trafficking, human trafficking, and, of course, the possibility that terrorists, too, can cross that border. This is a major national security issue and there's a reason why Mexico, all of a sudden, now appears at the last minute willing to cooperate with the Trump administration to stop the Caribbean. That's because President Trump is applying a tremendous amount of pressure, just like he did with little rocket man, Kim Jong Un. President Trump is telling Mexico, if they don't act, NAFTA negotiations will be in jeopardy. He also threatened to pull foreign aid from Honduras, where many of these migrants are coming from. It's about time an American president stood up for our country's sovereignty. And because the media and the left love to distort conservative positions on this, let me be clear -- there is nothing wrong with people coming to the United States of America. We're just asking it be done legally. We are a constitutional republic. We have laws. Those laws need to be obeyed. You can't have a country when illegal immigrants, noncitizens, can enter as they please. And guess what, that's what the president is now trying to do here. And, by the way, enough is enough when it comes to Mexico and people like their former president, Vicente Fox, he's lecturing us about how we deal with illegal immigration. Yet under Vicente Fox, Mexico sharply increased their police, their military presence at their own southern border and they spent millions of dollars upgrading security checkpoints. As a result, from 2002 to 2006, detentions, deportations increased by 74 percent in Mexico. This is ridiculous. Beyond hypocritical, for Mexico to constantly be lecturing the United States regarding immigration laws when they are far tougher than we've ever been. And for spending -- sending military personnel to secure the borders, well, liberals and the media are so outraged that President Trump would dare to do that. Here's the thing, they are completely silent, of course, when President Obama did that exact same thing back in 2010. Back then, Obama sent 1,200 National Guard troops to the border to help Border Patrol agents. Remember in 2014, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, he called up the National Guard to protect the border because the Obama administration wasn't doing enough. Well, it's not like this is unprecedented. Here's another point the liberal media will never tell you. They were so quick to criticize President Trump for saying that he wants to use part of the military's budget to build a border wall. It's a national security issue. According to a 2009 Congressional Research Service Report, the military has already been used to help construct the border wall by past presidents, including George W. Bush and even Barack Obama. Those are facts the media will never tell you any of this, because it doesn't fit their anti-Trump agenda. According to a new survey, 89 percent of Border Patrol agents say a wall system in strategic vocations is necessary to secure the border. That is coming directly from the people on the ground there every day risking their lives. Why not give them what they're asking for it? And what President Trump is calling for is security and accountability. It is that simple. And for the record, this position is similar to the one that Barack Hussein Obama once held. You may remember him saying this."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Wow, he sounds like Donald Trump. Obama only changed his stance when it became politically expedient. And as for President Trump, according to 'The Wall Street Journal,' the Trump administration will put quotas in place and start evaluating immigration judges on the number of cases that they hear in order to speed up and expedite potential deportations of illegal immigrants. Remember, someone gets caught entering America illegally, they are actually allowed to stay here until they get to their court date, and about 98 percent of them never show up. So, it's the height of ignorance and stupidity and that's why President Trump wants to change it. Other countries, for example, let's look at Australia. They don't roll out the red carpet for illegal immigrants like we do. When Australia catches asylum-seekers trying to enter their country -- well, they are very compassionate. They give them food, they give them water, they gave them medical attention if they needed to. And then they send the migrants back from where they came. That's beyond past time that America used the same common sense measures to secure our borders."

      "utterance": "Bombshell sacred texts show FBI, DOJ may have rushed anti-Trump FISA warrants. And according to Sara Carter, congressional investigators have discovered new text messages between anti-Trump FBI agents, lovebirds, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page that show possible coordination between the FBI and the DOJ to get a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associate, Carter Page."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "In one of the text messages Sara has obtained, Strzok is whining and complaining to Page that a warrant in the Russia investigation is being held up. And one of the congressional investigators is telling Sara tonight, quote",
      "utterance": "'Everything here from the texts, complaining about FISA delays to the exchanges indicating coordination, to the White House visitors log, well, it seems a bit match to a disturbing degree. At best, it's a strange coincidence worth investigating. Now, but, of course, it's much likely more.' So, you have the FBI using an unverified Clinton bought and paid for dossier as part of a FISA application, then they rush to get a FISA warrant approved, and new evidence points to coordination between the Obama White House, the FBI, the DOJ, and the CIA. Sara will explain all of us in a few minutes. Also tonight, Robert Mueller secures his first conviction, got to give him a lot of credit in this witch hunt. A Dutch lawyer was just sentenced to 30 days in jail, 30 whole days. And he's being ordered to pay $20,000 fine for lying to the FBI. That's it? And it had nothing to do with Russia collusion. The media played this up. They thought this guy was getting 20 years. In reality, it looks like a giant waste of your money. While the media was hyper-focused on this apparent Dutch lawyer and this travesty, they missed a massive story that proves Robert Mueller is carrying out a witch hunt that is being aided and abetted by his buddy, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. And according to an August memo written by Rosenstein, he actually authorized Mueller to go after Paul Manafort's work with the Ukrainian government which happened way, way before Paul Manafort anything had anything to do with Donald Trump on the Trump campaign. In addition to that, none of the charges Paul Manafort is facing have anything to do with any of that. And, of course, that's only half the story. 'Washington Times' reporting that Mueller investigated Paul Manafort on an allegation from the never corroborated, now known to be lies that Clinton bought and paid for dossier, that came from an unnamed Russian source and sources. It's pretty shocking but it shouldn't come as a surprise. The special counsel Mueller as corrupt as they come, he doesn't seem to care about truth, doesn't care about facts, doesn't care about evidence. He doesn't care about being fair. He doesn't care that he's biased. Look at the team he's assembled, a team of Democratic donors that donated to Hillary, Obama, the DNC. And we can't ignore that Rod Rosenstein, he's a guy that appointed Mueller, Rosenstein is giving Mueller free reign to do whatever he wants. Whatever happened, by the way, to this so-called collusion? Turn out to be a witch hunt. And Rod Rosenstein, he should be ashamed of himself and, frankly, he's the same guy that signed the FISA extension against Trump associate Carter Page and then appointed Mueller. Does anyone see that as a conflict of interest? And like we have been saying, Rosenstein needs to go. And also tonight, a brand-new poll, 67 percent of you, the American people, think a second special counsel should in fact we named to investigate all the disturbing FISA abuses that we've been reporting on and the media's been ignoring it because you, the American people, understand the severity of this because it's a massive abuse of power and that the DOJ and the FBI, they cannot investigate themselves, because that is a massive conflict of interest. It's called abuse of power. While the Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he won't be naming a second special counsel, he has appointed Utah prosecutor John Huber since November, we didn't know about it -- good for Jeff Sessions -- to serve in a similar capacity. While it's not a special counsel, it's a massive development. And as a federal prosecutor, Huber will be able to convene a grand jury, gather evidence, issue subpoenas, have witnesses testify, and that means he'll be able to properly investigate these FISA abuses. The FBI putting the fix it on the Clinton email investigation, kickbacks to the Clinton Foundation, the corrupt Uranium One deal, and, of course, lying to a FISA judge and the phony dossier that she paid for. A major development and it's just getting started. Another quick point tonight. Jill McCabe, she is the wife of the fired FBI Director Andrew McCabe -- well, she has an op-ed in 'The Washington Post,' where she is claiming to be setting the record straight. Predictably, Jill McCabe excuses the fact that her husband was fired for lying under oath multiple times about a number of issues. And instead, she's blaming President Trump. If he dog bites, if the bee stings, if you're feeling sad, and if you have a headache, and hangover, it's Donald Trump's fault. Jill McCabe seems to be downplaying the fact she got over $700,000 in campaign money from key Clinton ally, BFF Terry McAuliffe, and the Virginia Democratic Party , when she had a failed state Senate run. Now, state senate candidates in Virginia, they never get that kind of money. So, the McCabes, they can whine all they want in public about what happened, but facts are facts. You can't change that. All right. Finally tonight, I have a special message for the abusively biased media that once again is trying to smear me. So, yesterday on my radio show, I was making a point about Robert Mueller dividing this country at a level we have never seen in forever, which he undoubtedly is doing and has been doing. And I made reference, it's like a civil war in this country because of his abusively biased team, corrupt Democrats, people that see truth, we're sick and tired of it. And it's dividing those that hate Trump, those that like Donald Trump. Look at the person like Andrew Weissmann he appointed. What the media didn't report to you -- well, I was talking about a really deep divide that the arrogant Mueller's creating and that Americans are more divided than ever and I was actually talking about family members, a civil war, and they're going to sit at dinner and they're going to have a food fights and they're going to throw mashed potatoes and broccoli at each other at the dinner table. I wasn't talking about a real civil war and I was very clear. This sent the media into a frenzy, but they quickly ignored everything I said. And they raced to take me out of context, like they always do, claiming, oh, Hannity wants a civil war in America. No, I'm saying we're more divided than ever. And as you know from watching the show, this is what the media does all the time, but I'm not going to sit back and take their crap. We're going to call out the corrupt media in this country. For example, the media lost it over me saying the word 'civil war'. OK, we went to the archives. They have said it many more times than I have. And we've got the proof."

And sadly, they have missed the biggest story of their lifetimes while they have been obsessing over a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory where there is no evidence. And now, that the liberal media has been exposed, they are lashing out at people like me. We've been right. It's no wonder there is a new poll from Monmouth University showing that 77 percent of you the American people believe the traditional media in this country reports fake news because they do.

Joining us now is Fox News investigative reporter Sara Carter, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. All right, Sara, let's go into your piece today. I left out some of the details. I'll let you fill in the gaps."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, congressional investigators have discovered, you know, once again, another trove of text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two FBI agents. And what these text messages in particular reveal that the FBI may have been improperly coordinated with Department of Justice officials to try to expedite FISA applications on Carter Page. And what was interesting about this, Sean, is that if you look at it, they talk about David Laufman. Now, he hasn't come up quite frequently at all in the media. David Laufman was a DOJ prosecutor. Strzok is talking to Lisa Page about David Laufman. He was in charge of the Hillary Clinton investigation on the DOJ side. He was a very senior official, in charge of national security, as well as Russia. And Peter Strzok tells Lisa Page basically, look, you know, I'm upset with Laufman, Laufman is trying to explain why things aren't moving past enough in the eastern district of Virginia, probably referencing that, you know, the area where all the subpoenas had been issued by Mueller and the FISA application isn't moving fast enough. So, it kind of shows this buildup. They also noticed that White House logs actually correlated with some of these text messages. So, as they were discussing this back and forth, they bring up another guy from the DOJ. Matthew Axelrod, he's a DOJ prosecutor who is involved in the case. They talk about him. They talk about the frustration, they talk about Andy McCabe may be coming under fire or by some of these folks at the DOJ for the supposed information that was in the application. And then they say, two days later after these text messages are exchanged, Matthew Axelrod actually goes to the White House and signs the visitors log and actually visits President Trump. I think what we're looking at here is little pieces of the puzzle. How much did people in the White House know? Did the president know about this investigation himself? What we do know now is based on information that came out last week, is that very senior members in the FBI, the CIA, and in the White House, were well aware of this investigation early on and may have coordinated."

      "utterance": "Nonstop, Sean. Good to see you tonight. The bottom line is, we've heard the president in recent days ramping up the rhetoric on illegal immigration as a caravan moves through Central America toward the U.S. border. What's new tonight is that the president is now promising dramatic action to back up those words by using the American military to help secure the southern border until the wall is built. What he did today is he convened a meeting with Defense Secretary James Mattis, other top cabinet military officials to say that in the absence of action by congress, he wants executive action. The cracked down on illegal immigration, drugs, violent gangs coming from Mexico and elsewhere in Central America. Tonight, White House officials are making very clear the president is talking about mobilizing the National Guard to secure the southern border, not active duty military. That's prohibited by law because active duty military cannot get involved in domestic law enforcement actions like apprehensions at the border. Yet, there was a bit of a freak out from some Democrats like Congressman Ruben Gallego of Arizona who tweeted today, quote, real Donald Trump wants to use our troops to advance his extreme anti-immigrant agenda, while wasting time, resources and money, and depleting our military's strength in areas of real danger. Congress must stop this misguided scheme. --... What he and other Democrats seem to have missed is that then President Barack Obama in 2010, George W. Bush in 2006, they did similar things. The Obama administration sent 1200 National Guard troops to the southern border to assist border patrol and immigration officials amid concerns about drug trafficking. They've provided intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance. The Bush administration launched operation jump-start, 6,000 members of the guard for engineering, road and fence building. What the president today seemed to be saying that's different. He says he may be looking at a more aggressive approach where the National Guard, perhaps, takes on a more direct law enforcement role. Plus, a senior official here, tonight, saying the number of National Guard troops will be, quote, unquote, substantial, suggesting, at least, a larger number than we've ever seen before. We're going to have to, obviously, fact-check that and see how it plays out. Now, as you noted, the reaction from Mexico, swift and negative. Vicente Fox, the former president saying, real Donald Trump, to militarized the southern border as you provoked more hate and distance even further between our nations, somebody has to talk some sense into him. He's elevating his hate towards Mexico causing a greater conflict. The current Mexican government, by the way, sent an official request to the White House late today saying they want clarification on what the president's remarks really mean for this relationship. And we're told that the homeland security secretary for the president has been in touch on."

And now, he's even comparing the special counsel investigation to the tactics of the former Soviet Union. Joining us now to explain, author of the new book, Trumped Up, how criminalization of political differences endangered democracy. You know, I notice you get attacked, but you've been very consistent on the special counsel on the criminalization of political differences."

      "utterance": "Oh, yeah. Today, we see that Mueller announces that one of the things that he's going to go after Trump for, and Rosenstein says he can do it, is collusion. Now, he's inventing a crime. There's no such crime as collusion in the federal statute. You can't just make up crimes. Nobody likes collusion. If collusion had occurred, and there's no evidence it did, if collusion had occurred it would've been a political sin. But neither Rosenstein nor Mueller can simply magically make up a crime and say now collusion is a crime. You want to make collusion a crime in the future? Pass a statute. It's not on the books."

And I think it's interesting, one week after Paul Manafort's home is raided, and his poor wife is thrown into handcuffs, which wasn't necessary, that's typical Andrew Weissmann tactics, but a week after, Rosenstein then authorizes Mueller to do it."

And it should be set out in advance so everybody can see it and know it. You know the constitution jokes about ex-post-facto criminal laws. The policies behind that are fair warning and constraining the government. And the government, when you have a special prosecutor, should know and everybody should know. What he's entitled to and what he's not entitled to look at. This special prosecutor is going to look at everything. He's beginning to look at President Trump's personal financial matters before he was president. Will he start looking at the women who were alleging actions against him? Where does it stop? We know that the Clinton special counsel started with Whitewater and ended up with the blue dress, and that's wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Where does -- Jonathan Turley, a smart law professor, also on the other side, politically, than where I am, he made a good point. He thought the appointment by the attorney general of the prosecutor, Huber, that actually helps Trump because it moves so much faster."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "I agree with that. And first of all, that's what should have happened when special counsel was appointed. They shouldn't have appointed a special counsel in the beginning. They should've had somebody within the justice department, look at it initially, look at the whole issue of Russian involvement in the election, and then, if it looked like there was evidence of crimes that couldn't be investigated by the justice department, then maybe."

He is the major witness that any decent Trump lawyer calls. He's the guy who wrote the memo. The first question you want to ask him if there's an obstruction of justice investigation is, how can there be obstruction of justice? Yeah. You wrote the memo authorizing the firing. How is he in the case?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
