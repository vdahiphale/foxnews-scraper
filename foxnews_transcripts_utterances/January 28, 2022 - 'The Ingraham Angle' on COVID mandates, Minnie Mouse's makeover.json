But first, the streets of New York City turned blue today as New York's finest turned out in massive numbers to honor one of its brothers. 22-year- old Officer Jason Rivera, who was murdered in a Harlem ambush just one week ago. His partner 27-year-old Wilbert Mora was also shot, and he died three days later. Now, Rivera's funeral brought thousands and thousands to St. Patrick's Cathedral, where his young widow addressed the mourners and they all seem to feel a combination of grief and anger.",

Now, one year and the Democrats coast-to- coast already don't want to appear at any campaign events with Biden. So, what's going on here and speaking of the president, he has become the master of distraction. Raymond Arroyo has all the details in Friday Follies. But first, the streets of New York City turned blue today as New York's finest turned out in massive numbers to honor one of its brothers. 22-year- old Officer Jason Rivera, who was murdered in a Harlem ambush just one week ago. His partner 27-year-old Wilbert Mora was also shot, and he died three days later. Now, Rivera's funeral brought thousands and thousands to St. Patrick's Cathedral, where his young widow addressed the mourners and they all seem to feel a combination of grief and anger."

That is what real New Yorkers believe. And this powerful woman gave us a window into her kitchen table conversations with her husband, a New York City Police Department, a person of color, a person who lived in Manhattan his whole life. And they were scared about those bail reform laws. They were scared about the laws and the prosecution policies of our DA Alvin Bragg.

If he was charged with only a gun. That's the type of prosecutor Alvin Bragg is. Just ask Alvin Bragg, he's the one who's telling us, he's not going to charge people with gun crimes and fully prosecute them according to the law. So, it's just lip service from people like him. And unfortunately, that has real world consequences. Every single police action whether it's a domestic violence response like this, or a traffic stop has the potential of going south. And if police officers are not going to be protected by the law, if the prosecutors are going to go after the people, then we have to reconsider whether it's even worth the risk of sending cops in the first place.

The greatest way to honor the loss of life on all sides. loss of life due to gun violence, she said is to try to turn all of this into more funding for community programs and so forth.

Officer Rivera lived in this neighborhood. He's from Northern Manhattan. He's one of her constituents just like everyone else. And to mention his name, to mention the name of Wilbert Mora in the same sentence, almost equivocating it with the man who killed him is a new low for some people that I thought couldn't possibly go lower.

In Houston last night, three police officers were shot by a man with a very long rap sheet. Now this occurred just days after Houston constable was killed. It was essentially execution style by Oscar Rosales, an El Salvador national who's here illegally and wanted for murdered in his own country. So, how did he get into the country? How did this happen? And how many other violent felons are slipping across our border in this wonderful era of Joe Biden? Here now as a man as groups dedicated to finding that out, Stephen Miller, President of America First Legal, former Trump senior adviser. Stephen, along with Texas, you've just filed a lawsuit about the resettlement of illegals that's taking place across the country. But Texas obviously isn't spared from any of this.

What Biden is proposing and in fact, implementing right now is allowing the illegal aliens already here, to bring in their foreign relatives to join them in the United States, fully approved by the United States Department of State. This is chain migration for illegal aliens. And you're going to see as a result of this, more crime, more death, more devastation, more suffering, all purposeful, all intentional. This administration, when it comes to the border, it's not just allowing the border crisis to happen. It is creating it, it is perpetuating it, it is expanding it for the sole reason that their objective is as much illegal immigration as possible."

You just don't like immigrants. No, no, no, we love our people. Stephen, we love the people of this country. We want them to be safe. They don't deserve this. That's the point.

Joe Biden. So, in every sense, in every sense, Joe Biden is waging war on citizens, including Hispanic American citizens. I don't care where you come from if you're a part of our national family. If you are a U.S. citizen living here, as part of our community today, illegal immigration is an attack on you and your family. And that's why my group, America First Legal, Ken Paxton and others are suing this administration in court, because Joe Biden has violated his oath of office. He has violated the constitution, and he has repeatedly violated the laws of the United States. And sadly, there is a trail of blood to show the consequences."

So, when Biden visited Pennsylvania earlier today, two of the three leading state Democrats, Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, who's a leading Senate candidate and State Attorney General Josh Shapiro, likely Dem nominee for the governorship kept him at arm's length. This isn't unique though to Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, she's a leading candidate for governor, she skipped a chance to appear with Biden at that big voting rights event. And she was discussing her signature issue. They were discussing a signet signature issue there and she still didn't show up.

And because - the reason why - look, this is a guy who campaigned as a moderate. He tried to project the fact he's a moderate. But he's alienated those moderates by pushing a progressive agenda. I mean, he's really been one of the most progressive Left-wing presidents we've ever seen in history. But then he's also lost those progressives because he's failed to deliver on promises, and his agenda, things like build back better, as well. As you know, the voting rights which is really just to try to keep Democrats in perpetuity. So, he's just burning bridges left and right. And then the more unpopular he gets, the less sway he has to try to get anything done. And this limited window before the midterm election. So, he's really governed moronically and shot himself in the foot and now everyone's basically giving him the stiff arm trying to keep him away from because he's completely toxic."

I mean, to put this in context, this is way more than we saw in the 2010 election, I think there was only 17 in total. Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House, that midterm election. It's also tied with the record set in the 1994 Republican revolution, Republicans picked up 54 seats in the House. And then again, Laura, we've got months to go until November. So what Democrats are saying, it's not worth it, right. It's not worth it to seek re-election, or they're trying to look at another seat that they can run for that might be, a little bit better for them. But we're at a crisis point, or Democrats are at a crisis point. I mean, it's a tsunami coming."

So, someone like Manchin is closer to the mainstream than a lot of these people think and pretending like he isn't won't help the cause. So, Lisa, this sliver of Far-Left activists who have an outsized influence in the Democrat party. I mean, they got Stephen Breyer to retire and announced it earlier than he wanted to. That's how much influence they have in the party."

    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, they have enormous amount of influence, but what Biden has really done is blown himself up by just governing so moronically, I mean, look, this is a guy where he's been acting like he has some sort of mandate when they barely have a majority in the House and they're 50-50 in the Senate, so he doesn't have the numbers to try to get these big progressive policies done. And so, what he's done is, he alienated independence, he's alienated moderates and now he has no sway with them. I mean, do you think Kyrsten Sinema or Joe Manchin care what Joe Biden has to say, Absolutely not. He's toxic into their state. So, he's really created this scenario where he has no friends left, and he has no power. And they have months to try to right the ship and I just don't see it happening. And I think that's - I think that's why they've really been trying to push or nationalize the elections, not because they have the numbers to do it, but they're teeing up the midterms as being illegitimate."

Will they succeed? We'll explain it, next."

      "utterance": "Now, recently, have you noticed this some in the regime media, they've been desperately trying to move Democrats off their COVID mandate agenda? What's obvious, I think that they see some potential political fallout, they want to avoid. So, first in the Washington Post, then the Atlantic, and finally the New York Times, Michelle Goldberg. Well, she finally relented, saying let kids take their masks off after the Omicron surge. Otherwise, I fear that, at least in very liberal areas, school masking will persist indefinitely. But the COVID bullies running school districts well, they're not listening. For instance, Montgomery County, Maryland just announced the return of virtual learning and the creation of pods. If you want to do pods, you can. Parents can have their kids in these little subgroups. But parents want their kids in class and a neighboring Prince George's County kids mask mandates. Well, they're not going away. Michelle Goldberg right here, the school CEO saying, I don't think that off ramp will exist. I think this is how our life will be for a while. That means forever, by the way. So, our question tonight, where the heck is Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan. Joining me now is Bethany Mandel, Montgomery County resident and editor at Ricochet, Bethany, liberals are beginning to kind of put up the white flag here. They're saying the political fallout and some are saying to fall out with their own children. But why is Larry Hogan who supposedly a middle of the road Republican allowing Far Left county executives to destroy kids' education two years into this?"

This county has gone so far to the Left while the state has sort of veered back on the on the ramp of normalcy. And Larry Hogan wants to be president. And I think what a lot of people loved - I know, right? What I think a lot of people loved about Trump and love about DeSantis and now Youngkin is they fight, they see injustice and they fight for what's right. And Larry Hogan is just you know, he's another one of these Republicans that cares more about being liked and cares more about being nice and personable and getting on the Sunday shows than actually doing his job."

Bethany, I said this two years ago, almost now, they will never give you an objective metric, because they want to hold on to this as long as they can."

I have a weekly standing date where I just go on Zoom and I yell at the Montgomery County Council, and they grow now when they see my face. They just like slump in their seats, and they look at their cell phones and I yell at them about that too. But they finally admitted that they think that the masks in public places, not in schools, they will absolutely not have a conversation about schools, but they think that masks in like Target could come off at the end of February maybe. But they keep on changing the metrics. And so, they decided that when 85 percent of the county was vaccinated, then that's when we could get the masks off. And then when we got too close, it just it wasn't sorry, we're just not safe enough and they're constantly changing goalposts and metrics is what the Montgomery County Council is best at."

Now after the small rural Alsea school district in Western Oregon voted to defy the state's universal mask mandate, the Oregon Department of Education retaliated by denying them federal COVID relief funds. Joining me now is Mark Thielman, Superintendent of the Alsea School District and candidate for governor.

And I would like all the viewers to know, it's a true irony of the progressive Left that they've stepped in to freeze federal funding to a tiny little school district in rural Oregon as a state agency. There is no boundaries for our leaders here in Oregon. We are at the new war, or cultural war front. Here, Oregon is the next Virginia and somebody's got to step out and stand in the breach. So, my school board said, enough is enough. We had one - we had a local hospital announced that paper and cloth masks are no longer allowed in the hospital because of their low efficacy, it's slowing Omicron that pretty much did it because we have students, middle school and high school and they all have these things called cell phones. And they got a news alert that said, these masks don't work. And man, it was rough keeping kids in masks after that. And how do we argue with good science? If our medical people are saying they don't work, why are we still wearing?"

But I have to highlight something, an interesting point made in your school districts' regulation for the mask mandate. The Alsea School District has successfully remained open during the 2020- 2021 school year without a single case of COVID trace of the classroom as the source. So, you guys have done a fantastic job.

So, we worked with our state legislators to get what was called a small rural exception so that we could stay open at the beginning of the pandemic. And we decided to stay open K through 12 instead of the K through 3 like the state was recommending. And we looked at all the science, we made great decisions, we made good - we used good judgment. And we showed the state of Oregon that schools to be open during COVID safely and the full weight of the government came down on my hand. And I did not roll over because I have a duty to serve our parents and our students in Alsea. We had students committing suicide, we had students disconnected. We had drug epidemics going on in the state. And for me, and my community and my school board, I was having none of it. And we were the ones that pushed back on the governor.

National Weather Service issuing blizzard warnings for at least eight states. The governors of Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland all declaring states of emergency. Thousands of flights have already been canceled. Up to two feet of snow and up to 75 mile-per-hour winds are expected in parts of New England. Utah Senator Mitt Romney has tested positive for COVID-19. The 74-year-old Republican is asymptomatic. Both he and his wife, who tested negative, had been vaccinated and boosted. This now makes 67 members of Congress to test positive for COVID-19 since mid-July amid a surge of cases fueled by the Omicron variant. He will isolate and work remotely in the meantime. That's going to do it for this update. I'm Kevin Corke. Now back to more INGRAHAM ANGLE."

It's moment like that that erode public confidence in the president. And frankly, that's what's destroying his poll numbers. To combat all of this, the White House has launched what I call operation distraction, which kicked off in Georgetown. We were watching this together."

I thought that was an interesting parallel. But this presidential outing was supposed to underscore the success of his COVID relief for businesses. The only problem is Biden is the only one actually getting out in D.C. Open Table, the reservation service, reveals that D.C. reservations are down 59 percent from two years ago, and other blue cities experienced similar double-digit drops."

Oprah Winfrey once declared it our national novel. So why is today's left hellbent on banning it from schools? A Seattle area school board just voted to remove the novel from its ninth-grade curriculum. The school board spokeswoman saying that the students who shared their experiences and thoughts with the board were especially compelling, and their reasoning that there are other novels that can teach similar literary conventions and themes without causing further harm to students. Joining me now, Cynthia Garrett, education activists, found of the Cynthia Garrett Ministries, author of \"I Choose Victory.\" Cynthia, this is really - - the word \"iconic\" is overused in modern language. It becomes trite. But this truly is an iconic novel. And it won the British literary, in 2006 the British declared it as one of the most important novels of our time. Race relations, gender roles, all of it tackled in this book. What is going on here?"

These were not horrible people. These were people who were invested in what happened in the sought. We have all been invested in our past. We have all gotten through it together. And I guess I just have to say that ignorance is not bliss. And education, Laura, in my opinion is the 21st century civil rights struggle for African Americans, and it is about time that we really woke up and got on the right side of this struggle and realize that what the Democrats are doing is really trying to disguise this love and protection of us from feeling awkward and uncomfortable by basically erasing our past."

And so I find this sort of namby-pamby, mollycoddling of these kids to be something that is actually, in my opinion, it comes from teachers who, they are not smart. Laura, listen, I don't know if I was every talked about this, but I was sexually abused as a little girl. There are a lot of days I want to erase a large part of my childhood because of what happened to me, but I can't. And now there are a lot of days where I wouldn't even want too because those events, while they were horrible and difficult, they helped shape the power and the strength that I walk in today. They taught me to choose victory, and they taught me to take responsibility for the fact that I've got to get me through those awkward moments. And if we didn't --"

After the death of George Floyd, the University of Chicago started to consider funding an entirely new department that was dedicated just to Critical Race Theory. But the university was so cowed that they thought this didn't even go far enough. So they put forth and even more insidious idea, the Department of Race, Diaspora, and Indigeneity. My next guest, a professor at the school, has been one of the few brave enough to stand up against this, saying in a speech to the school's council, \"It promotes privileges, interpretations of history, modernity, contemporary social institutions, and events external to the university that are predicated on an ideology as much as a subject matter.\" That's a mouthful.

They would invite speakers like Glenn Loury and Tom McWhorter. And they would consider hiring someone like Wilfred Reilly. And so there would be a range of opinions. I would consider that a nonideological sort of department, and that would be the ideal way to study race at a university like the University of Chicago."
