It's critical. Sessions' Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be the next one on the chopping block. He reportedly reviewed and approved that FISA application to surveil the Trump campaign, and we understand it looks like it was based on that phony Clinton-funded Russian dossier.

Willful blindness to Trump's triumphs and how the FBI and DOJ can stop the bleeding. That's the focus of tonight Angle. Think about how reporters would handle things under this hypothetical. Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, won the presidency in 2016. I realize that's terrifying to contemplate, but bear with me for just a second. Imagine that Bill is too old to chase interns, so she isn't distracted by any new scandals, and somehow during her first year in office, Hillary oversees a stock market rocketing up, there's a big drop in unemployment, including among minority workers, and imagine this, imagine consumer confidence, business investment, even wages in certain sectors, all up. Imagine Hillary announcing that dozens of American run businesses are bringing jobs back to the United States. They are doling out thousand dollars, $2,000 bonuses to thousands and thousands of employees. And let's just say that Republican leaders respond to this news by calling that money crumbs, and it's all just a gimmick. Meanwhile, imagine President Clinton renegotiating important trade deals and taking unilateral action to level the playing field for American manufacturers and workers. By the way, I actually remember when both Hillary and Barack Obama were running for president in 2008, and back then they both sounded a lot more like Trump than Trudeau on NAFTA."

You usually get a benefit from a tax cut when you pay your taxes. Everyone is going to benefit except for upper income earners. Hello? And from the Trump tax plan, they will see more money in their pockets come April when most people pay their taxes. Most people don't pay quarterly. We will see if at that point Reuters runs another poll just to see if people are happier or benefiting. A far more telling survey from the National Association of Business Economics finds that company say sales and profits rose at the end of last year and nearly half of the respondents say they are now paying more in wages and in salaries to their employees. This is news that we've been waiting for and that will benefit workers long term. It's about time people had a raise.

      "utterance": "Now a more likely theory, I think, is that McCabe himself, along with his previous boss, Jim Comey, are actually to blame for this early retirement. Now given McCabe's partisan ties via his wife to Hillary's best friend, Terry McAuliffe, well, he shouldn't have been within 100 yards of either the Hillary email or the Trump-Russia investigation. Not with that close tie. Remember, McCabe's wife received a $500,000 donation from Terry McAuliffe's PAC for her failed political campaign. Now given this, he should have removed himself or removed nomadic recused himself from both probes. There was a New York Times story tonight suggesting that FBI Director Christopher Wray was concerned about the findings of a forthcoming government investigation into the FBI and into McCabe's conduct. That's the inspector general's report. The Times source said that the director and McCabe had a frank conversation about that report and apparently a demotion was discussed for McCabe. Whatever the explanation for his departure, I say this, it's about time. There's a larger point being lost in the McCabe blame game. The president is actually trying to restore confidence in law enforcement institutions that I think for a long time have been used as political instruments. There are a lot of great rank-and-file people, of course, the overwhelming majority. But when the leadership appears to have a political ax to grind, nobody is served by that. It's time to cleanse the upper tiers of the Justice Department and the FBI of all partisanship. It's critical. Sessions' Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be the next one on the chopping block. He reportedly reviewed and approved that FISA application to surveil the Trump campaign, and we understand it looks like it was based on that phony Clinton-funded Russian dossier. Of course, the anti-Trump partisans, Jeannie Reid and Andrew Weissmann should be immediately terminated from the investigation as well before any more damage is done to the credibility of both the FBI and the Justice Department. And that's the ANGLE. Joining us now for a reaction from Minneapolis is John Iannarelli, a former national spokesperson for the FBI and here in Washington is Joe DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C. Joe, your reaction to the McCabe departure, and the media from the moment the story broke on all the other cables and on NBC, CBS, ABC tonight, it was Trump to blame?"

As someone who has worked with the bureau for over 30 years, I'm truly saddened by the fall from grace for everybody there. But make no mistake about it, this was a plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally and then if she lost the election, to frame Donald Trump with a legal crime. This is the worst period in the history of the bureau, much worse than the late Hoover period when they were spying on domestic groups. This is the weaponization of the FBI for political purposes by all the people at the upper echelon of the bureau. I think it's really time for people in the other party who seem to make nothing but excuses for the senior people at the bureau and the Department of Justice, may I say, to kind of wake up and see that what's coming now is the federal grand jury and it's not going to be pretty."

With the information from the inspector general and from the Hill with the legal release of documents that it was clear that Mr. McCabe and others had engaged in highly improper, probably illegal activity in the FISA court stuff along with the dossier from Christopher Steele. First of all, McCabe should have been gone a long time ago and so should Strzok and Page and all the people involved in this. This is a dark moment for the FBI.

But another plan exists that should be put on the table. Republican Senator David Perdue is one of the men behind it. He joins us now with more. Senator, always great to see you. I ran into you at an event on Saturday and I said you better come on the show, and here you are, so thank you. So you and Tom Cotton in my view came up with an original idea that kind of in some ways mirrors what was going on in the Hill with Goodlatte and Mike McCaul. And it was focused on the 800,000 DACA people, who are not kids, they are adults now for the most part. And then you did the chain migration, end of that, and a visa lottery. Three or four days later suddenly it's at 1.8 million. How did you go from 800 to 1.8, and was that thought process because you needed to pick up a few people?"

And we warned about the diversity lottery and we said we needed an end to chain migration. And so what we've done now, the president has laid out, I believe, a framework that's ingenious, because we're going to find out if people are really serious about solving this immigration problem on both sides. And I think we have the framework to actually get it done now finally."

And my point is if you want cuts in legal immigration, which is a big number, a million green cards every year, most of those are based not on merit but on extended family ties, aunts, uncles, cousins twice removed. Everyone is coming in. Need to do it that way. But I'm not an amnesty person. I think it hurts people's feelings and sensibilities who have been waiting in line for a long time.

Bill Clinton also called for an end to chain migration when he and Barbara Jordan wanted to go to a merit based immigration system like Canada and Australia.

What did she do to Juanita Broaddrick, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey? Mrs. Clinton was right at the center of trying to smear and discredit these women, nuts and sluts and a narcissistic looney toon. That's what Mrs. Clinton did for specific women."

If I were a liberal, I would be like, OK, Hillary, thanks for your service, but we are moving on. It's time to turn the page from the Clintons, done. The scandal, it's not helping Democrats. It seems like most Democrats I know want to be done with the Clintons."

      "utterance": "Before we go, I want to let you know that a very dear friend who was an amazing person, Julie Reyes Taubman passed away a few days ago. She was a wonderful person, great patron of the arts. She was the founder of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Detroit, did a phenomenal book on photography, helped me through a really difficult time with my own cancer. There is a picture of her with my daughter Maria back in 2008. And just welcomed us into her home at a very difficult time for me, and she will be so missed by her husband Bobby, her twin sons Teho and Seb and Gogo and Alex. And we just wish her family the best. A great person who will be missed very much by everyone who loved her, including her six brothers. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
