President Trump and First Lady, of course, spent an emotional day visiting the survivors, the families, first responders of the weekend's deadly mass shooting but the media and Democrats are only focused on one thing. Stoking division. Rudy Giuliani, Mollie Hemingway are here to discuss the twisted rhetoric. Also today, Joe Biden campaigning in Iowa saying Trump has no moral leadership and is directly to blame for the violence. Candace Owens is here to respond. Plus, Pollster Frank Luntz breaks down the words that Democrats are using two separate America. And Raymond Arroyo will share shocking details, interestingly-timed, of a violent new Hollywood film that could inspire, some are warning tonight, more mass shootings. I can't miss seen and unseen straight ahead. But first, mourning in America. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” As our nation continues to mourn the tragedies in El Paso and Dayton, President Trump did what was right by spending the day visiting with the shooting victims, their families and brave first responders.

They care more than you do about keeping America safe, they care, all right. If they care about 2020 and some Democrats are worrying that their chances might be slipping away. Democrats know that Trump's support among Hispanics has gone up five points since January to 25 percent. They know that his numbers among African- Americans are also on the rise.

Think that hundreds or even thousands of people crashing the border at one time is a problem? Yep, you're a racist. I believe deporting immigration law breakers is the right thing to do? It's just? Absolutely racist. How about detaining people pending their immigration hearing? Doesn't that make sense given the backlog? Totally racist. Believe there is rampant abuse of our asylum was? Racist. Expect new immigrants to speak English? 100 percent racist. By my count, that means there are more than, this is conservatively-speaking, 100 million racist, maybe even white supremacists in the United States. Sorry. I don't think anyone is buying this. Racism is a problem. It persists. White supremacy is a cancer, but throwing the terms around to tar anyone you disagree with or can't beat at the ballot box is poisonous. And it's dangerous. It's increasingly clear the Democrats aren't really happy unless people out there are angry and agitated and marching through the streets against this President.

And that's “The Angle.” Joining me now to respond, Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's Personal Attorney and Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at \"The Federalist\" and Fox News Contributor she is also co-author of the great new best seller \"Justice on Trial\".

There are two situations in which madmen did horrible things. One motivated by the left and apparently the other motivated by the right and to turn this into some kind of an attack on the President, who was really just trying to heal some of the pain these people are going through. I remember what it meant to New York when President Bush came here four days later. It lifted everyone's spirits. They felt like the country was behind them, and they are depriving these people of that feeling, or at least some of them. I also think politically this doesn't play. This is a very, very - very partisan, very divisive kind of strategy and I think most of the American people can see through this. But it's a shame that these people have degraded themselves to this level to do this kind of thing. It's really shameful."

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It has been really difficult to watch and it has been going on for years. A refusal to just simply admit the election results of 2016, to accept that Donald Trump won that election and that he is the President, this is something that we saw with the rejection of the election results the Russia collusion hoax narrative and then now have a replacement with calling all political opponents racists."

You can't say certain things because an idiot said the same thing and some whack job manifesto. That is just - that's ridiculous.

The last time this was done, Carter said to Castro \"Send everybody here\" and Castro sent him 30,000 insane people, maniacs, criminals, who wreaked havoc on Miami and the lower part of America for about three years. That was during the Mario boatlift. And now they want everyone to come in. We can't find out who they are. In a world as dangerous as ours, that is - I don't have a word to describe it."

Go try to sell that to the American people, but they don't want to do that because they know that's deeply unpopular. What they instead want to do is make people afraid to speak, afraid to be in places and feel demonized for just believing America is a special place.

But I think it's actually a sign of their weakness. This is the type of thing you do when you don't have good ideas that you have to promote to people and when you don't feel confident, for instance, to be able to sell people on your open borders plan or whatnot. It has been very troubling to watch this and it's very scary and it's very personally threatening to have officials in our actual federal government trying to docks people for political participation.

The woman saying she hopes to get stabbed in the heart the other night. And this is the party of peace, tolerance, love and understanding? You got to be kidding me.

That's just ridiculous. Raymond, thank you so much."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The left is blaming a lot of people for the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, seemingly everyone except the gunman. Now they blame Trump, racism, and how California's governor is blaming toxic masculinity."
    },

      "speaker": "GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "The shootings overwhelmingly, almost exclusively, are males, boys. I think that goes deep to the issue of how we raise our boys to be me, because. It goes deeply to values that we tend to hold dear, power, dominance, aggression, over empathy, care, and collaboration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And joining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator, filmmaker. Dinesh, so now men acting like men will lead to mass shootings? What about the cops who stopped this lunatic? They were men who acted with force and determination."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER",
      "utterance": "Look, we might be making a little bit of progress here. For a long time when there was a shooting you would always hear it was the gun, the gun did it. Now at least we are moving past that to the idea that there's a shooter and there are motives. So I don't object to the idea of looking at the sort of cultural and even moral roots of all of this. Certainly, we have problems rooted in broken families and broken communities, even a spiritual crisis, a sense of nihilism among young people. But look, toxic masculinity, is this a kind of a Conan the barbarian problem? First of all, look at the shooters. They don't look to me like Conan the barbarian. They look to me more like Austin Powers. You've got these shriveled kids with glasses, very nerdy- looking. Arguably they're suffering from a deficit of masculinity, not too much masculinity. The gun becomes their great equalizer. So I think we're dealing here with a little bit of nonsensical speculation from Gavin Newsom, but the idea that we should look at the broader cultural roots of all of this, I'm not against that at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Isolationism, connectedness on the Internet, but no real human connections. People left behind because of family breakup or breakdown or substance abuse or a combination of all of that. There's no doubt about that. These are deep, complex problems facing a society in many ways, I think, with a lost spiritual center. Dinesh, also I want to get to this tonight, because in the wake of these protests at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's house this week that were vicious, 2020 fanatic Tim Ryan thinks that the 77-year-old should face more harassment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. TIM RYAN, D-OH",
      "utterance": "I am leading a caravan in my official capacity as a congressman working with Moms Demand Action to start in Youngstown and go to Akron and Columbus and Dayton and Cincinnati and pick people up along the way, and we're going to Louisville, Kentucky. And we are going to make sure that Mitch McConnell knows that there are two pieces of legislation sitting on his desk that he needs to bring up for a vote to actually get some action."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We just had a woman outside of his house hoping he was going to get stabbed the other night, and now a congressman is going to lead a caravan of people to Senator McConnell's home? Like he can't reach him when he's back in the office? These are theatrics that can get out of hand and even dangerous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "I think so. And I think in some ways this point was made earlier in your show. There's a sense of frustration here about Trump himself. Trump is a little bit like Muhammad Ali. He taunts these guys, he challenges them into the ring. They're scared of getting into the fight, so they go, hey, listen, let's pick on the coach, let's pick on the old guy in the corner. Let's go back after Angelo Dundee. Maybe we can terrorize him into submission. So I see this as a pathetic effort ultimately now to move away from Trump and try to pick on more vulnerable people like McConnell, thinking that maybe the left can do about to better job of terrorizing them, because they sure can't terrorize Trump."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

They think they got him, and he gets off the cliff, and then he goes around. They just can't do it, and I think there literally going insane. But we really appreciate you being on tonight."

Joining me not to break it all down, especially these pertinent phrases in his conversation, is pollster, media guru Frank Luntz.

      "speaker": "FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "Yes, Laura, it is affecting the views of a large percent of Americans. And you know how? It's turning people off against the media. That's not their job. Their job is not to label. Their job is not to condemn or criticize. Their responsibility is to present the language as it is used, to present -- nothing wrong with showing his tweets. He wants it. Nothing wrong with showing quotes from the speeches. He like that. All candidates do. But when you start to become a commentator and you try to move people to judge the president before they hear what he says, that's too far. And it is why the media has the list level of credibility at any time since they started polling this issue more than half a century ago."

They want to put the language out there. They want the public to see it. But does it have an impact on them? No. All that it does, and it does do this, is to add to the poison, to the toxicity that exists in American politics right now. And Laura, I am generally afraid of what's going to happen over the next 15 months because I think that people are just ready to explode on both sides, and it's becoming a real problem."

He wants to stay above the fray. That's effective language for him, and I hope he means it, and I hope he actually does it. Because both sides, and I know what I'm saying here, both sides are contributing to the ugliness of politics today. And all of us, all of us need to be involved in making this a more productive and a more valuable conversation about what's happening in America today."

It's been an emotional and I hope ultimately an impactful day, for him, for the country, for those who are grieving and morning. Politicizing tragedy -- not a good thing. None of us should do it. The hate and the rhetoric that we've heard over the last four or five days, it's got to -- everybody's got to take a break. Speaking of that, I'm going to be taking some time off.
