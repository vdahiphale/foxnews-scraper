He is taking a very tough on crime stance. We'll see what happens when he gets inaugurated. But that was obviously part of his platform for winning. So, if we get them in sync and that means that those two groups, the police chiefs and the mayors going to the D.A.'s and saying in practice this is not working. I understand where all progressives here. Because most of the mayors are also progressive like the D.A.'s. But this is what's happening on the streets. And if we don't get all on the same page, funding is going to be cut, we're also going to lose -- continue to lose tax dollars because people are going to move out of the cities. They are not going to become empty. So, bringing back together which is something that Bloomberg worked on really hard when he created this mayoral task force, there was a nationwide project, and was actually quite effective is something that I think is going to underpin a change here.

Because it's when the data comes out, it ends up being manipulated in a way that it can't be trusted. So, you see what this chart did, is that it zeroed in on the smallest increase and created a line that appears to be dramatic when in fact it's just a tiny little thing. For example, let's say you hear about a study that says if you take the conclusion from the study is if you take this pill, it will cut the rate of illness in half. Right? But then you read up. And it was like, it went from two people in 10,000 to one person in 10,000. So cut in half but it's essentially meaningless. That's how you deal with data. And you -- the best thing you can do when you take statistics courses, learn how to read stuff, take an economics class --",

He is taking a very tough on crime stance. We'll see what happens when he gets inaugurated. But that was obviously part of his platform for winning. So, if we get them in sync and that means that those two groups, the police chiefs and the mayors going to the D.A.'s and saying in practice this is not working. I understand where all progressives here. Because most of the mayors are also progressive like the D.A.'s. But this is what's happening on the streets. And if we don't get all on the same page, funding is going to be cut, we're also going to lose -- continue to lose tax dollars because people are going to move out of the cities. They are not going to become empty. So, bringing back together which is something that Bloomberg worked on really hard when he created this mayoral task force, there was a nationwide project, and was actually quite effective is something that I think is going to underpin a change here. And then the White House will be able to speak more cogently about what they are doing to try to help."

Right? Because there's a 70 percent chance of smash and grab. Thirty percent chance of felonious assault. So, it's up to you and it's out of your hands. I am so -- I feel so hopeless about this because it's been going on for quite a while. I am thinking about joining the dark side. Why bother being a law-abiding citizen and pay all these taxes and go shopping when you can just smash and grab? I mean, why am I going to Amazon online when I live around the corner from the store? I could just totally smash them windows. take some -- just join. If you can't beat them, join them. There should be an app for solitary people like me who can meet up with other solitary looters. Because that's my problem. I don't know, like I don't have a lot of friends. I don't have a mob that can like come with me while I go trash other people's private property. So maybe we could do -- we could do an app for that. The bottom line is we have redefined law and order as systemically racist so anytime you enforce the law, you're going to be called a racist. Which is the most effective method for undermining society. We are watching society implode. I feel absolutely hopeless. That kid. That Columbia kid was murdered, was murdered by a guy that's been in and out of jail. I mean, maybe his parents have some influence. Maybe with the home invasion in Beverly Hills, will that wake-up people? You know, a music legend murdered, right? While her husband was sleeping or her husband was sleeping. She was murdered.

So, you see what this chart did, is that it zeroed in on the smallest increase and created a line that appears to be dramatic when in fact it's just a tiny little thing. For example, let's say you hear about a study that says if you take the conclusion from the study is if you take this pill, it will cut the rate of illness in half. Right? But then you read up. And it was like, it went from two people in 10,000 to one person in 10,000. So cut in half but it's essentially meaningless. That's how you deal with data.

This is like -- it's like, I just point -- I didn't point -- I pointed the gun and it just went off. It's just like, this isn't possible. It's impossible, but that's Baldwin's defense. And if it actually becomes commonplace, then you're going to -- you will see more and more and more. Again, I go back to -- I've said this a million times. If they hadn't demonized the NRA, the NRA could have been on these sets. You can't -- I mean, you could have benefited from the instruction and the supervision.
