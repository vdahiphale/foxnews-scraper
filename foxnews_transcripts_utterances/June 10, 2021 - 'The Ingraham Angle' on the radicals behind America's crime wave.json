As its co-founder Patrisse Cullors has got rich and snapped up pricey LA real estate, Minneapolis got poorer and (inaudible). The city's police force is a shell of its former self. Nearly 200 have quit, gone on leave or retired rather than deal with the wave of anti- police sentiment and measures that they say make policing dangerous and ineffective. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now to give you a sense of how neutered the force has become, they didn't dare try restoring normal access and traffic into the several block radius around the South Minneapolis site or George Floyd died. An unwieldy sprawling makeshift memorial surrounded by vulgar anti-cop graffiti has been maintained and guarded by various groups for almost a year now. Visitors must go through ramshackle barricades manned by volunteers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, I visited the site last August. I remember it was perfectly nice there, but I could not believe that the public's access to public streets could be controlled by people with any legal authority to do so. Now, [ph] camera crews told me that they would need special permission to enter the area. How is this allowed in the United States of America, I wondered? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, of course it's not. And the occupation of the area, just like it did last year with Seattle's autonomous zone, has harmed those that call that neighborhood home. Not only is there no through traffic there, there's no trash pickup either, which of course hurts businesses, like the barbecue restaurant, smoke in the pit. Ivy Alexander, who raised her children in the neighborhood, has run the small business for nine years, and she wants the streets reopened. She said, \"I'm upset because people who are not part of this community just came in and decided what we wanted to have here. I didn't get to make a nonprofit. I don't get donations. I haven't been getting money hand over fist. If you're fighting for the community, you wouldn't be holding down this block where all these businesses are, but everyone got their own agenda.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, she's rightly frustrated because Minnesota police have basically given up on trying to reclaim this area as public space. What's happened is the city has outsourced the work of removing the barricades to a community group called the Agape Movement. Since the entire area for law enforcement has become a no-go zone, regular patrols don't even happen there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One law enforcement source told me that it's so dangerous for police inside the Floyd Memorial area that they only enter in response to an active violent crime scene or sadly to remove anyone who is deceased. And of course, the far left's anti-police vendettas has endangered the very people they claim to care about. So the term live shot took on an entirely new meaning a few weeks ago as reporters were there doing stand-ups.",

Do they ever hold a press conference to encourage communities to take personal responsibility for the fatherless young men committing most of the crime against other minorities? Of course, not. Keeping the political theater going to extract concessions is what always matters most. Now, just as things are beginning to really unravel for the Twin Cities, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, she never fails to disappoint, wants to pull the thread even faster. Writing in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland that invoking black, indigenous and people of color, she wrote that she was urging him to expand his federal probe into Minneapolis police on grounds that the murder of Mr. Floyd is not unique. It's a pattern among many law enforcement agencies in Minnesota. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Omar and the 19 other left-wing officials who co-signed the letter are just boldface liars. If you want to know who should be voted out of office, it's every single person who signed that letter. Now I've posted the full list on lauraingraham.com. So if you're from Minnesota, know who you're dealing with here and always be respectful when you make your views known. It's frankly not clear that any of Omar's group would have favored changing any of the - charging any of the violent protesters from last summer either. After all, the systemic racism made them do all that violent raging. But at least for now, all those charged last year in the now infamous arson attack on the 3rd precinct have been sentenced. And they'll do between two and four years in federal prison. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, I'm sure they've all considered themselves at one time or another to be righteous crusaders. Bryce Michael Williams and Davon De-Andre Turner were the Molotov cocktail duo. They've been sentenced to jail time along with Dylan Robinson and Brandon Wolfe. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And speaking of peaceful protesters, just a few weeks ago this humanitarian Desmond David-Pitts from Alaska was sentenced for conspiracy to commit arson as well. That was last August of that Seattle Police Department East precinct. Now, sadly, this destructive behavior is not only being condoned, it's being encouraged by the racial arsonists themselves in the media.",

After all, public safety shouldn't be political. It's essential. A bill that would have required police to issue tickets instead of arrest suspects for panoply of misdemeanors and petty crimes, was defeated in committee in Colorado when two Democrats broke away from their party to oppose that legislation. State reps Matt Gray, a former prosecutor and Shannon Bird, the committee chair voted with four Republicans to kill the insane bill. Permissive policing leads to cities looking a lot like Seattle, New York, and Portland, their health escapes, rampant homelessness and rampant crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Of course, the defeated bill's author, radical state rep Jennifer Bacon immediately tagged the vote as, wait for it, racist. Once again, the real racist out themselves every single time. She claimed that black legislators - she claimed that people that weren't her skin color shouldn't have had a determinative vote on the issue. That's insane. Can you imagine if anyone said that? With the colors reversed, they'd be driven out of politics and rightly so. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The fact is, Democrats are slowly starting to realize that wokeness is not going to win them majorities in 2022, or the White House in 2024, which is why Barack Obama left Martha's Vineyard to go on CNN and pretend that wokeness is a right-wing hoax. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } BARACK OBAMA, 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I also think that there are certain right wing media venues, for example, that monetize and capitalize on stoking the fear and resentment of a white population that is witnessing a changing America and seeing demographic changes.

Heather, I know you are not surprised about the ramping crime you're seeing across this country, the fact that we still have these autonomous zones patrolled by people without any legal authority to shut down public access to areas. Yet this sign of hope in Colorado, I was flying back from Wyoming this morning and I was actually trying to read all the local papers. And I found that to be welcome news in a crazy time. HEATHER MAC DONALD, \"THE WAR ON COPS\" AUTHOR: It is, Laura. To the left, crime is a racist fiction. They simply do not acknowledge that it exists. And the biggest lie that defines the left today's and every disparity in America is a result of racism. Alternative explanations, such as the academic skills gap or cultural and behavioral differences are not just not allowed, they'll get you branded as a racist. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the reality will eventually assert itself and what we're seeing today is a record-breaking increase in violent street crimes in city after city. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Two dozen blacks are killed every day to absolutely no attention from the press. That's more than all white and Hispanic homicide victims combined, even though blacks are only 12 percent of the nation's population. Why? Because of this massive delegitimation of law enforcement based on the phony idea that if blacks are arrested more or incarcerated more, the only allowable explanation is police racism. Here's the facts, Laura. Blacks commit violent crime at over 10 times the rate of whites, and they're victimized, they're killed by violent criminals at over 10 times the rate of whites, not killed by cops, not killed by whites, but killed by other blacks. The reason blacks are in minority neighborhoods, is to save black lives, and when the cops back off, which is what's happening across the country, thanks to this phony, racist attack on law enforcement, black lives are the ones that are lost. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Obama started this meme that Biden has picked up throughout his campaign in his inauguration speech, in his George Floyd commemoration speech that black parents are right to feel that their kids will be killed by cop every time they step out the door. That is a complete lie. Blacks are killed at very high rates, not by cops, but by other blacks.

Here now with me is Dr. Scott Atlas, author of the forthcoming book, cannot wait, \"A Plague Upon our House, My Fight at the Trump White House to Stop COVID from Destroying America.\" Dr. Atlas, first of all, congrats.

And so what we see, what I experience myself, of course, but what we see in the journals, for instance, in that trove of emails, it's really not about a single person. There are big issues there like that article, that letter from a bunch of virologists to the journal \"Lancet\" which is a very high level journal, that was basically a political statement and worse. It was saying that anyone who said that the virus came out of a lab was a conspiracy theorist. And what that was was an attempt to silence other scientists. We also hear even Dr. Redfield say when he mentioned that, he got death threats from other scientists. So it's not just the nutjobs on Twitter, although I have to say some of those nutjobs are other scientists, but the reality is that we're seeing an attempt to intimidate and bully science. This is really totally something I think that is new in its overtness. We saw this in my case with a bunch of people who came out and really wanted to rebuke me and defame, really, me. This is sort of really unexpected. It took me by surprise, and then you really look at these people and you understand it. But this is a very bad trend. We have a country, a world that depends on science, and when you have politicization of that, to make these political statements, and it's infected the journals. When we look at some of these studies that were suppressed, I had emails from all over the country, people sending me their papers, but also afraid to speak out. And within the past 24 hours, as you mentioned, a colleague who I know well, who is one of the top scientists, has received an intimidating email from somebody who is very high-level in academic medicine, really implying that they would be blackballed from academic medicine if this person kept speaking out.

Roughly 100 different times he could have had me served as I'm walking to or from the capital, the House floor where I vote, and my House office building. But he chose not to. Instead, the Swalwell team chose to hire a process server that would chase my wife down as she's coming home from church, keeping in mind that she's a grandmother with 10 grandchildren. There could have been some of those grandchildren in the car with her when this transpired. And then illegally entered my home. In Alabama, this is a criminal offense. It's a trespass in the first degree. And it carries a penalty up to one year and a $6,000 fine. So they did it entirely the wrong way.

But first, the race racket unravels. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, a year after the ruinous deadly riots that ripped apart America, we see the corrupt poisonous fruits of BLM's work. As its co-founder Patrisse Cullors has got rich and snapped up pricey LA real estate, Minneapolis got poorer and (inaudible). The city's police force is a shell of its former self. Nearly 200 have quit, gone on leave or retired rather than deal with the wave of anti- police sentiment and measures that they say make policing dangerous and ineffective. Now to give you a sense of how neutered the force has become, they didn't dare try restoring normal access and traffic into the several block radius around the South Minneapolis site or George Floyd died. An unwieldy sprawling makeshift memorial surrounded by vulgar anti-cop graffiti has been maintained and guarded by various groups for almost a year now. Visitors must go through ramshackle barricades manned by volunteers. Now, I visited the site last August. I remember it was perfectly nice there, but I could not believe that the public's access to public streets could be controlled by people with any legal authority to do so. Now, [ph] camera crews told me that they would need special permission to enter the area. How is this allowed in the United States of America, I wondered? Well, of course it's not. And the occupation of the area, just like it did last year with Seattle's autonomous zone, has harmed those that call that neighborhood home. Not only is there no through traffic there, there's no trash pickup either, which of course hurts businesses, like the barbecue restaurant, smoke in the pit. Ivy Alexander, who raised her children in the neighborhood, has run the small business for nine years, and she wants the streets reopened. She said, \"I'm upset because people who are not part of this community just came in and decided what we wanted to have here. I didn't get to make a nonprofit. I don't get donations. I haven't been getting money hand over fist. If you're fighting for the community, you wouldn't be holding down this block where all these businesses are, but everyone got their own agenda.\" Well, she's rightly frustrated because Minnesota police have basically given up on trying to reclaim this area as public space. What's happened is the city has outsourced the work of removing the barricades to a community group called the Agape Movement. Since the entire area for law enforcement has become a no-go zone, regular patrols don't even happen there. One law enforcement source told me that it's so dangerous for police inside the Floyd Memorial area that they only enter in response to an active violent crime scene or sadly to remove anyone who is deceased. And of course, the far left's anti-police vendettas has endangered the very people they claim to care about. So the term live shot took on an entirely new meaning a few weeks ago as reporters were there doing stand-ups."

Do they ever hold a press conference to encourage communities to take personal responsibility for the fatherless young men committing most of the crime against other minorities? Of course, not. Keeping the political theater going to extract concessions is what always matters most. Now, just as things are beginning to really unravel for the Twin Cities, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, she never fails to disappoint, wants to pull the thread even faster. Writing in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland that invoking black, indigenous and people of color, she wrote that she was urging him to expand his federal probe into Minneapolis police on grounds that the murder of Mr. Floyd is not unique. It's a pattern among many law enforcement agencies in Minnesota. Now, Omar and the 19 other left-wing officials who co-signed the letter are just boldface liars. If you want to know who should be voted out of office, it's every single person who signed that letter. Now I've posted the full list on lauraingraham.com. So if you're from Minnesota, know who you're dealing with here and always be respectful when you make your views known. It's frankly not clear that any of Omar's group would have favored changing any of the - charging any of the violent protesters from last summer either. After all, the systemic racism made them do all that violent raging. But at least for now, all those charged last year in the now infamous arson attack on the 3rd precinct have been sentenced. And they'll do between two and four years in federal prison. Now, I'm sure they've all considered themselves at one time or another to be righteous crusaders. Bryce Michael Williams and Davon De-Andre Turner were the Molotov cocktail duo. They've been sentenced to jail time along with Dylan Robinson and Brandon Wolfe. And speaking of peaceful protesters, just a few weeks ago this humanitarian Desmond David-Pitts from Alaska was sentenced for conspiracy to commit arson as well. That was last August of that Seattle Police Department East precinct. Now, sadly, this destructive behavior is not only being condoned, it's being encouraged by the racial arsonists themselves in the media."

      "utterance": "I don't know whether I'm more disturbed about her being disturbed about the American flag or the fact that a New York Times editorial board member says explicatives, when she meant expletives. When our media, our schools, our celebrities, and now our president, keep repeating the lie that America is systemically racist, she's afraid of the flag. We're setting ourselves up for a lot more of this kind of rage in the future in the streets. And it's so destructive, and it's so sad, especially for the minority-owned small businesses and the families just trying to get by and stay safe. They don't want things vandalized, they don't want things looted, they want things to get better. But I have to say there are signs that at least some common sense Democrats see that they're on the losing side of this issue. After all, public safety shouldn't be political. It's essential. A bill that would have required police to issue tickets instead of arrest suspects for panoply of misdemeanors and petty crimes, was defeated in committee in Colorado when two Democrats broke away from their party to oppose that legislation. State reps Matt Gray, a former prosecutor and Shannon Bird, the committee chair voted with four Republicans to kill the insane bill. Permissive policing leads to cities looking a lot like Seattle, New York, and Portland, their health escapes, rampant homelessness and rampant crime. Of course, the defeated bill's author, radical state rep Jennifer Bacon immediately tagged the vote as, wait for it, racist. Once again, the real racist out themselves every single time. She claimed that black legislators - she claimed that people that weren't her skin color shouldn't have had a determinative vote on the issue. That's insane. Can you imagine if anyone said that? With the colors reversed, they'd be driven out of politics and rightly so. The fact is, Democrats are slowly starting to realize that wokeness is not going to win them majorities in 2022, or the White House in 2024, which is why Barack Obama left Martha's Vineyard to go on CNN and pretend that wokeness is a right-wing hoax. BARACK OBAMA, 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I also think that there are certain right wing media venues, for example, that monetize and capitalize on stoking the fear and resentment of a white population that is witnessing a changing America and seeing demographic changes. The single most important issue to them apparently right now is critical race theory. Who knew that that was the threat to our Republic?"

Heather, I know you are not surprised about the ramping crime you're seeing across this country, the fact that we still have these autonomous zones patrolled by people without any legal authority to shut down public access to areas. Yet this sign of hope in Colorado, I was flying back from Wyoming this morning and I was actually trying to read all the local papers. And I found that to be welcome news in a crazy time. HEATHER MAC DONALD, \"THE WAR ON COPS\" AUTHOR: It is, Laura. To the left, crime is a racist fiction. They simply do not acknowledge that it exists. And the biggest lie that defines the left today's and every disparity in America is a result of racism. Alternative explanations, such as the academic skills gap or cultural and behavioral differences are not just not allowed, they'll get you branded as a racist. But the reality will eventually assert itself and what we're seeing today is a record-breaking increase in violent street crimes in city after city. Two dozen blacks are killed every day to absolutely no attention from the press. That's more than all white and Hispanic homicide victims combined, even though blacks are only 12 percent of the nation's population. Why? Because of this massive delegitimation of law enforcement based on the phony idea that if blacks are arrested more or incarcerated more, the only allowable explanation is police racism. Here's the facts, Laura. Blacks commit violent crime at over 10 times the rate of whites, and they're victimized, they're killed by violent criminals at over 10 times the rate of whites, not killed by cops, not killed by whites, but killed by other blacks. The reason blacks are in minority neighborhoods, is to save black lives, and when the cops back off, which is what's happening across the country, thanks to this phony, racist attack on law enforcement, black lives are the ones that are lost."

Obama started this meme that Biden has picked up throughout his campaign in his inauguration speech, in his George Floyd commemoration speech that black parents are right to feel that their kids will be killed by cop every time they step out the door. That is a complete lie. Blacks are killed at very high rates, not by cops, but by other blacks.

And he essentially opened our borders versing very effective policies that had our borders under control. That's true, even in the eyes of the presidents of Mexico and Guatemala, who during this trip, said that Joe Biden is largely responsible for his rhetoric on the campaign trail and during the transition, and then his policies during the administration. That's why we've had three straight months of record high illegal immigration in our border. The highest numbers recorded in 20 years.

So they were worried about bed space, showers and hot meals and all the rest. That is all derivative of the fact that we have so many illegal aliens showing up at our border. If you turn them around in the first place, if you don't let them into the country, you don't have to worry about how many facilities you have to house them, or how you're going to put them on an airplane and put them up in a hotel until they find relatives inside the country."

We're still in the middle of a global pandemic. I know, it's gotten a lot better in United States, Laura. But all across the country, especially in - or all across the world, especially in Latin America, it's still pretty bad. So we could use the public health authorities that have long been on the books, just close the border. That's what happened last year. And then finally, in Guatemala, what Kamala Harris should have been doing is trying to get a safe third country agreement back in place. So anyone who crossed through Guatemala, which is in effect, everyone who is not Mexican, would have to apply for asylum there.

Senator, I have to get to this, the senators club, which are Blunt, Peters, Portman, released this report investigating the January 6 riot. And it contains a list of recommendations that struck me as some of them somewhat concerning. Among them, \"Empower the chief of the Capitol Police to request assistance from the DC National Guard in emergency situations, and establish civil disturbance unit as a formal permanent component of the U.S. Capitol Police.\" Senator, your reaction there.

Look, we have a lot of practice and fortifying the Capitol during prominent events, whether it's the State of the Union speech, or when a foreign leader like Benjamin Netanyahu comes to address the Congress, that's what should have been done on January 6.

You hear the refrain that they're just private companies. There's nothing we can do. But 2020 changed that. And I think a lot of conservatives, including in Congress, saw what happened with the election -- 43,000 votes was the difference between Donald Trump winning and Joe Biden winning when you look at those three states.

And many of the studies that do get published are, as one doctor put it, shoddy as hell. This medical Marxism has its enforcers in a rising generation of young, ideologically driven doctors. Some of these antiracist zealots are reportedly refusing to treat white patients. The sad fact is it wasn't hard to see this coming.

And so what we see, what I experience myself, of course, but what we see in the journals, for instance, in that trove of emails, it's really not about a single person. There are big issues there like that article, that letter from a bunch of virologists to the journal \"Lancet\" which is a very high level journal, that was basically a political statement and worse. It was saying that anyone who said that the virus came out of a lab was a conspiracy theorist. And what that was was an attempt to silence other scientists. We also hear even Dr. Redfield say when he mentioned that, he got death threats from other scientists. So it's not just the nutjobs on Twitter, although I have to say some of those nutjobs are other scientists, but the reality is that we're seeing an attempt to intimidate and bully science. This is really totally something I think that is new in its overtness. We saw this in my case with a bunch of people who came out and really wanted to rebuke me and defame, really, me. This is sort of really unexpected. It took me by surprise, and then you really look at these people and you understand it. But this is a very bad trend. We have a country, a world that depends on science, and when you have politicization of that, to make these political statements, and it's infected the journals. When we look at some of these studies that were suppressed, I had emails from all over the country, people sending me their papers, but also afraid to speak out. And within the past 24 hours, as you mentioned, a colleague who I know well, who is one of the top scientists, has received an intimidating email from somebody who is very high-level in academic medicine, really implying that they would be blackballed from academic medicine if this person kept speaking out.

This week it came to a head when Congressman Brooks' wife Martha was accosted. Now look at this video. The Congressman's wife pulls into their garage. Seconds later a car speeds up the driveway. A man jumps out and runs into that same garage, attached, by the way, to their private home. The man was in there for about 15 seconds until Brooks' wife chased him out. We now know what that man was there for. He was a process server. Joining me now, Congressman Mo Brooks. Congressman, your message tonight to Eric Swalwell.

But second, for three months -- two months, since the lawsuit was filed back in March, Eric Swalwell has got notice of when we are going to go folk. Roughly 100 different times he could have had me served as I'm walking to or from the capital, the House floor where I vote, and my House office building. But he chose not to. Instead, the Swalwell team chose to hire a process server that would chase my wife down as she's coming home from church, keeping in mind that she's a grandmother with 10 grandchildren. There could have been some of those grandchildren in the car with her when this transpired. And then illegally entered my home. In Alabama, this is a criminal offense. It's a trespass in the first degree. And it carries a penalty up to one year and a $6,000 fine. So they did it entirely the wrong way.
