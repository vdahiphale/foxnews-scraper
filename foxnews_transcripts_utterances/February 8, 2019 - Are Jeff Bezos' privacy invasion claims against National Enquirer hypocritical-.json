This time the allegation is a forcible rape 19 years ago. 2020 Presidential aspirants in the Democrat field have been quick tonight to call for Fairfax's resignation.

First Bezos went on a blogging platform called Medium and posted details of the alleged extortion, including messages sent to him from the \"National Enquirer,\" its parent company American Media, and American Media CEO David Pecker, threatening to release intimate photos of Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez unless Bezos agreed to, one, call off his investigation of how \"The Enquirer\" got the private pictures and texts, and, two, issued a statement saying the investigation that uncovered his affair with Sanchez was not politically motivated. Bezos of course refused, writing, quote, \"Of course I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\" American Media has now responded, saying it wasn't blackmailing Bezos and that the messages were good faith negotiations to resolve the matter, saying, quote, \"American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.\" That said, American Media CEO David Pecker says the company will conduct its own investigation into what, if any, action needs to be taken. And the government is also getting in on the action. Federal prosecutors are now looking into the \"National Enquirer's\" is handling of the Bezos extramarital affair story. As for how the intimate photos were leaked in the first place, a reporter for the \"Washington Post\" owned by Jeff Bezos says that he has spoken with Bezos' lead security consultant Gavin de Becker. Watch. MANUEL ROIG-FRANZIA, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Gavin de Becker told us that he does not believe that Jeff Bezos' phone was hacked. He thinks it's possible that a government entity might have gotten hold of his text messages.",

There were too many political points to be scored. There were too many Congressional reputations to burnish, too many opponents to burn. And despite the fact that he's only going to be in his job for maybe another week or so, Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was in the hot seat. Recall, that he only stepped into this role three months ago when Attorney General Sessions was fired. But every, Democrat without exception, grandstanded. For the most part they asked questions that had nothing to do - zero relevance to their proper oversight role. So the only purpose was to hit him with cheap shot after cheap shot after cheap shot, knowing that Whitaker was rightly going to assert what's called the \"Deliberative Process Privilege\" in refusing to answer questions about conversations he had with other DOJ staff or with the President himself. It's totally expected. So given the Democrats over-the-top performances today, and it being the awards season after all, we thought tonight would give out our own awards.

So last night I warned about how people in both parties, now even corporations are falling victim to the ever-shifting PC goalposts. Now, I worry that the real offenses like the donning of blackface, discriminatory intent as adults, well, that's being casually lumped in with imagined offenses like the release of an all-white tennis shoe being labeled insensitive during Black History Month. And could the attention given to these flash points have irreversible effects in our society and then just end up driving us all further apart when we need to come together for some real solutions.

And I think, we often put aside you the moment and just deal with the controversy. And say, why won't - this is a great moment, for you and I to talk about race. Where are we in the 21st Century? Can we at least agree on the language that we must use in order to address some of these big issues, whether it is white males appearing in blackface, which clearly is objectionable, no matter the period, because we all know what it symbolizes.

First Bezos went on a blogging platform called Medium and posted details of the alleged extortion, including messages sent to him from the \"National Enquirer,\" its parent company American Media, and American Media CEO David Pecker, threatening to release intimate photos of Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez unless Bezos agreed to, one, call off his investigation of how \"The Enquirer\" got the private pictures and texts, and, two, issued a statement saying the investigation that uncovered his affair with Sanchez was not politically motivated. Bezos of course refused, writing, quote, \"Of course I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\" American Media has now responded, saying it wasn't blackmailing Bezos and that the messages were good faith negotiations to resolve the matter, saying, quote, \"American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.\" That said, American Media CEO David Pecker says the company will conduct its own investigation into what, if any, action needs to be taken. And the government is also getting in on the action. Federal prosecutors are now looking into the \"National Enquirer's\" is handling of the Bezos extramarital affair story. As for how the intimate photos were leaked in the first place, a reporter for the \"Washington Post\" owned by Jeff Bezos says that he has spoken with Bezos' lead security consultant Gavin de Becker. Watch. MANUEL ROIG-FRANZIA, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Gavin de Becker told us that he does not believe that Jeff Bezos' phone was hacked. He thinks it's possible that a government entity might have gotten hold of his text messages."

Filmmaker Peter Schweizer has a new documentary that examines how these tech behemoths operate in stolen and manipulated information, that is your information, by the way. Peter joins us now. Peter, the \"National Enquirer\" seems to be in the wrong here with how they came after Bezos, but it's kind of ironic, isn't it, that Bezos is crying foul about stolen text when these tech companies can be guilty in the end of much worse."

And what's troubling is they don't just use that information, our information, to sell us advertising and sorts of things like that. They also use it against us. And so to me it's quite ironic. I sympathize with Jeff Bezos, but I find it quite ironic that they're raising privacy concerns when the high-tech industry, primarily Google and Facebook, but also Amazon pedal in selling our information and invading our privacy on a regular basis."

What does he have about the ties to Trump? He has earned his journalism wings with this move. So he has pulled off a masterstroke in terms of recasting his own image, in terms of making himself look like a good guy again."

But then again, Pecker, he has already gotten an immunity deal from Mueller, so it's like he's working with Mueller on some of this killing the stories about Trump deal. So I don't get where any of these people are going. What do you have to hid? What does AMI have to hide? I don't get it."

      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "It's interesting, Jeff Bezos is in this story kind of the victim, right, so that is going to help him. But I think most people are going to look at these tech titans and ultimately not view them in a sympathetic light. And it's not, in my book, because they make a lot of money. More power to them. They create these great companies, these great products and services. But it's because of the invasion of privacy. With all of these online companies including Amazon, a big part of their revenue stream is selling information about you. And they use that information against you. Some of them at Google and others talk about the fact that their goal is not just to sell your information. It's to actually change and manipulate your values and your views. So I sympathize with Jeff Bezos in this case, but to paint him as some kind of a victim like the rest of us I think is patently ridiculous."

With everything that you exposed about Hillary and the email server, how good would that be?"

What I'm betting on is that Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia, will be the stalking horse for the Clinton machine. They're longtime associates. He raised a lot of money for them when Bill was president, they helped him get elected governor of Virginia. So they're going to try to live vicariously through Terry McAuliffe and go up against the Obama machine in 2020 with their candidate. I think it's going to be quite a slugfest."

His state would be not the only one to explore such a measure. Arizona, Montana, and West Virginia are considering or have considered similar proposals. Here now is Bruce Griffey.

So that, you tax it over two percent over 10 years, there's your wall, bingo, $20 billion. So he pushed this back then, didn't get any traction. I think it's a no-brainer.

Online I see entire streams of messages about how certain states should basically not be part of the United States anymore. Tennessee isn't one of them, but it's like Alabama, Florida, now Virginia, maybe even Mississippi, they are so filled with a bunch of white southern racist that they can't be redeemed. I kid you not, that is where the conversation has gone online."

      "utterance": "I understand. It's unfortunate. But one of the bright spots of this may be is for this conversation to come out and show that a lot of these Democratic congressmen and governors, and they are so hypocritical. And it's frustrating. The old Democratic Party that I used to know about is not this current Democratic Party. And I certainly wish we could get back to get some serious discussions and Democrats and Republicans come together, and let's work through the problems and come up with the best solutions for Americans."
