So, any minute now, we're going to get to our first look at where American voters stand out there on the GOP, on Democrats, on the anti-establishment fervor that we have watched by President Trump. Good evening everybody, I Martha MacCallum and this is 'The Story' tonight. The first big primary day of 2018. You've got, ten states in the United States of America where Democratic senators are up for reelection in states that were handily won by President Trump. And you've got three of those that have primaries this evening. As we await the first numbers out of Indiana, where Republicans are battling for the chance to challenge one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the whole country, if not the most in November. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It is too early to project a winner in tonight's race in Indiana. There is a live look at Mike Braun's headquarters. He's sort of the outsider businessman candidate. In this race, he's poured millions of his own money into the campaign. He is enjoying an early lead; it is too soon to say who's going to win here. The winner of this race will face off against Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly in November. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Minutes from now, also polls will close in West Virginia and this one has been a barn burner and a lot of fun to watch. Republicans hope that the winner of this wild GOP primary could perhaps defeat Joe Manchin, the Democrat in West Virginia. The wild card in that race, former coal baron and ex-con whose probation ends this evening, a minute after midnight, Don Blankenship. What did he do today when others were campaigning?

Dennis, the menace, who was a member of congress for a number of years and famously bankrupt the city of Cleveland --even though the Cleveland plain dealer actually endorsed Dennis Kucinich for this race.

In that open seat, it's predominantly the 16th congressional district in northeastern Ohio. These are Republican leaning seats. On the Republican side, you have two main contenders in Gonzalez and Hagan. Hagan is a young woman, current state representative; Gonzalez is a former football star raising a lot of money.

Former congressman Dennis Kucinich is backed by the more progressive Bernie Sanders wing of the party. There are other Democrats in this race, but Cordray and Kucinich are very much considered to be the top two candidates at this point. On the Republican side in both the gubernatorial race as well as the senate primary race, President Trump is a constant theme. Most Republican candidates seem to be trying to prove that they're more like him than their opponents are. Of course, President Trump traveled to Ohio this past weekend and he endorsed Republican senate hopeful Congressman Jim Renacci. That race is all on the Republican side because the incumbent senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, does not have a primary challenger. The big question is did that visit from President Trump on Saturday help Congressman Renacci, did it help turn out? Did it help convince people to go for him over some of -- over the other Republicans?

So, any minute now, we're going to get to our first look at where American voters stand out there on the GOP, on Democrats, on the anti-establishment fervor that we have watched by President Trump. Good evening everybody, I Martha MacCallum and this is 'The Story' tonight. The first big primary day of 2018. You've got, ten states in the United States of America where Democratic senators are up for reelection in states that were handily won by President Trump. And you've got three of those that have primaries this evening. As we await the first numbers out of Indiana, where Republicans are battling for the chance to challenge one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the whole country, if not the most in November. It is too early to project a winner in tonight's race in Indiana. There is a live look at Mike Braun's headquarters. He's sort of the outsider businessman candidate. In this race, he's poured millions of his own money into the campaign. He is enjoying an early lead; it is too soon to say who's going to win here. The winner of this race will face off against Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly in November. Minutes from now, also polls will close in West Virginia and this one has been a barn burner and a lot of fun to watch. Republicans hope that the winner of this wild GOP primary could perhaps defeat Joe Manchin, the Democrat in West Virginia. The wild card in that race, former coal baron and ex-con whose probation ends this evening, a minute after midnight, Don Blankenship. What did he do today when others were campaigning? He went shopping for a new suit."

I think he will be the best candidate in a general election. However, if Morrisey loses to Jenkins, I think we have a terrific chance if either of those of the nominees to beat the incumbent Democrat senator. The president won that state overwhelmingly by about 34 points. It is a place that Donald Trump can really help us defeat an incumbent U.S. senator that we need to beat.

First and foremost, the Democratic primary for governor, we have a matchup of four individuals; the two leading folks in this race, Rich Cordray, the former Attorney General of Ohio, former Treasurer, and most notably the former Head of the Consumer Protection Finance Bureau for the last eight years, versus Dennis Kucinich. Dennis, the menace, who was a member of congress for a number of years and famously bankrupt the city of Cleveland --even though the Cleveland plain dealer actually endorsed Dennis Kucinich for this race. We have two other individuals -- I actually voted for Joe Schiavoni, my former colleague in the Ohio Senate, who's also a former Senate Minority Leader, because he's a guy whose common sense and can actually, can I think bring the Trump voters back into the fold since he's from the Mahoning Valley like I am. But it will be interesting to see because this is really a matchup between sort of the progressive wing, and Dennis Kucinich and the establishment wing, and Rich Cordray. Rich Cordray that he finally has the endorsement of the AFL, CIA. So, we will see how this plays out."

The two other things to watch in Ohio are two Congressional races: one, which is the vacant seat being left by Jim Renacci who's running for United States Senate, endorsed by Donald Trump and I think the favorite, certainly, in the senate primary here to challenge Sherrod Brown. In that open seat, it's predominantly the 16th congressional district in northeastern Ohio. These are Republican leaning seats. On the Republican side, you have two main contenders in Gonzalez and Hagan. Hagan is a young woman, current state representative; Gonzalez is a former football star raising a lot of money. So, I think that's going to be a close race. Then finally, the race down for the special election in the house race vacated by Pat Tiberi, that's, you know, basically, the Tea Party, Freedom Caucus versus the establishment down there.

He's being supported by our revolution, which is the Bernie Sanders-backed Super PAC, but those guys aren't really Democrats, right? They're the sort of the hand-grenade wing of the base.

In just a short period of time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons. I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement. I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanctions. America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction and we will not allow a regime that chance death to America to gain access to the most-deadly weapons on Earth. The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them. In fact, at this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with Kim Jong Un. Finally, I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran. The future of Iran belongs to its people. They are the rightful heirs to a rich culture and an ancient land and they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams, honor to their history and glory to god.

We know exactly what they did with the money because the people are starving. That's why there was an uprising, because the money wasn't going to them.

So, how can giving billions of dollars to a country who hasn't stopped spreading terrorism first and saying, you know, we'll give you billions if you just don't build nuclear weapons, how about no? You're already terrorist, you're already spreading terrorism; we're not giving you any money. We'll just going to put more sanctions on and clean them up just like we did with North Korea.

But more important than whether or not the number is right is whether or not the spirit is right. I understand why Sergeant Bartlett would be angry about that agreement, and I understand some of President Trump's criticisms of the Iran agreement. It did not intend to deal with the ballistic missile program. It did not intend to deal with their domestic human rights problems, and it did not deal with their support for terrorist organizations in the region. In fact, the Iran deal specifically allowed us to continue to sanction those activities by Iran. What I wish the president had done instead is to work with our European partners: France, Germany, the U.K., to impose tough sanctions on Iran for the things they are doing in Syria."

When you look at all of the different areas that he's working in, he basically says let's join all of these ideas together. Let's not do, you know, let's join trade, let's join our trade agreement, let's look at all of these issues across the board and let's hold Iran accountable for its behavior. Let's not strike a deal with Iran that doesn't force any behavior change from this country that is the number one state sponsor of terror. So, it's highly likely that at this point, we're going to start to see a negotiation that gets closer to exactly what you want."

But Martha, given that we've got right in front of us the challenge of a nuclear capable North Korea, that has developed ballistic missiles and the upcoming negotiation between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, I would have urged -- I did urge him to give the Iran agreement more time and to give our European partners more time because frankly, we now raise questions with them, with the Chinese and the Russians and with the North Koreans about how reliable we could be in any future agreement. And if Iran chooses to walk away from this agreement and resume enrichment, we don't have a clear answer or a strategy from President Trump and the administration over how we're going to deal with a restarted and renewed Iranian program. The only reason that we have the pressure to really get onto the table in the first place was allies like South Korea, India, and others who stopped buying oil from India -- excuse me, from Iran, to reassemble the global powers that will force Iran back to the table will take time."

She said it was rushed into the first place and we gave away a lot of things that we never should have given away. So, we'll see.

His final day radio ad actually repeated establishment Republican attacks against him for being a bigot or mentally ill, but he explains to voters in the ad that even if those things are true, he thinks he'd be a better choice than Congressman Evan Jenkins or Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. But Morrisey and Jenkins have something that Blankenship doesn't, and that is the blessing of President Trump. In a state where Trump beat Clinton by 42 points in 2016. Morrisey's closing argument today was all about electability. He believes that after the Fox News debate last Tuesday, this became a two-man race between himself and Blankenship, and that his resume is the only one conservative enough to flip Democratic Senator Joe Manchin seat. Morrisey watching results tonight in Kernersville, while Congressman Evan Jenkins is down in Barboursville. Remember, he was the front runner in the Fox News poll released two weeks ago tonight. Jenkins told us today there's a little bit of nervousness, but that he's put a lot into an aggressive campaign and he's looking forward to the results here in Charleston. Blankenship, whose probation ends at midnight is set to watch the results with about 100 family and friends, and we're told that soon they're all going to be handed red and white hats with a message to the senate majority leader, they're going to say ditch Mitch.

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. There's been, of course, a lot of concern in places like West Virginia among Republicans concerned that perhaps one candidate might be too far right, and perhaps they won't be very electable come the general election. To some degree, that exact same concern exists here in the Ohio gubernatorial primary, but on the opposite side of the political spectrum. That is the concern in many ways for Democrats here. Richard Cordray is backed by the more establishment side of the Democratic Party. He served as the top consumer watchdog under the Obama administration. Former congressman Dennis Kucinich is backed by the more progressive Bernie Sanders wing of the party. There are other Democrats in this race, but Cordray and Kucinich are very much considered to be the top two candidates at this point. On the Republican side in both the gubernatorial race as well as the senate primary race, President Trump is a constant theme. Most Republican candidates seem to be trying to prove that they're more like him than their opponents are. Of course, President Trump traveled to Ohio this past weekend and he endorsed Republican senate hopeful Congressman Jim Renacci. That race is all on the Republican side because the incumbent senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, does not have a primary challenger. The big question is did that visit from President Trump on Saturday help Congressman Renacci, did it help turn out? Did it help convince people to go for him over some of -- over the other Republicans? Of course, it will be a little while before we know that, but the Board of Elections say they expect that about 1.6 million people to show up and vote today. The total number of registered voters here in Ohio, Martha, is about 7.9 million."

So, there's one that we can tell you about. And we don't know yet who going to win back on the Republican side and who will go up against Joe Manchin in the fall. Don Blankenship, Evan Jenkins who is the current congressman, and the Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, are all vying for that position. And as soon as we get some numbers rolling in West Virginia, we're all very interested to see how that's going to work out. So, we'll get those up on the board as soon as we have them. In the meantime, this breaking story.

Four women have spoken out saying, yes, he did it to me too.

Hours after the New Yorker was published, Eric Schneiderman had already resigned. Here to react, Kimberly Guilfoyle, cohost of The Five, and former attorney and prosecutor. Kimberly, good to see you.

You saw four brave women came forward as it relates to the New Yorker piece. And as some of these executives and produces here at Fox News know I've been working on an investigation into this case as well. I've been working with one of the victims of Eric Schneiderman and her horrific ordeal that she endured at his hands.

She's afraid -- you know, she's a single, you know, mom like myself, and it's very difficult when you think about that type of thing and you think about going up against someone very powerful, but you see these four brave women were able to do it. And I think, you know, it's so compelling and really gives strength to others that have suffered at the hands, you know, physical abuse."

She saw, in particular that, woman saw Dr. Gwen Corbin, who is an ENT who examined her.

The Manhattan district attorney's office has opened a case. Long Island has also opened an investigation to see the nature of the abuse and what kind of charges could be filed. It's very serious. It's criminal conduct, certainly, assault of conduct, the battery over repeated period of time. He used the phrased role-playing."

This is politics across the nation tonight, folks. You see these conference rooms and hotel spaces where people are waiting to flood in, in support of their candidate when we get some winners tonight, and there will be some who have to give concession speeches as well this evening. All of that just hours before something else that's very important, Gina Haspel will be on the hill tomorrow for her confirmation hearing. New documents have surfaced and they are raising questions about her role in the CIA enhanced interrogation technique program. Liz Cheney joins us with some thoughts about Gina Haspel's nomination, next. SEN. ROY BLUNT, R—MISSOURI: She is the most qualified person to ever be nominated to run the CIA. She has the best background, the best preparation. I think she's exactly the right person at exactly the right time."

They get to make the rounds, meet with everybody who is going to be at the hearing. We expect that it's going to be kind of tense in their, potentially, tomorrow as some contentious confirmation hearings get underway. Her nomination reignited a fierce debate over controversial Bush era enhanced interrogation tactics that were used after 9/11. And then, further fanning those claims, BuzzFeed, today, releasing hundreds of CIA documents about the program and the black sites. Here now, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney during that era. Liz, good to see you. Thanks for being here. REP. LIZ CHENEY, R—WYOMING: Hi, Martha, good to be with you."

    {
      "speaker": "CHENEY",
      "utterance": "I think the president did exactly the right thing today. President Trump's decision to withdraw from the deal is courageous. It's perhaps the worst deal the United States has ever entered into, had no anywhere, anytime inspections. No access to military sites. The Iranians got to continue to enrich. It was actually a pathway to a nuclear weapon. It didn't prevent them from obtaining one. And the president was right. What he's done now is send a very clear message. We're not going to be bound by phony deals. We're not going to be in a situation where we're taken advantage of. And frankly, it sends a terrific message also to the North Koreans. It says, look, we are absolutely committed to making sure that the world's worst sponsor of terror does not get access to a nuclear weapons. It was a brave courageous decision and exactly the right thing to do."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

In terms of Gina Haspel, tomorrow we do expect that there's going to be a lot of questions for her about her oversight of a black site in Thailand for one period during a very long career with the CIA. I guess how would you advise her to handle those questions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHENEY",
      "utterance": "Look, I think that we've got an effort underway right now, which is frankly disgraceful. Gina Haspel is probably the most qualified person who's ever been nominated to head the CIA, the first career official in 52 years nominated for that position, somebody who's got support across the board, Republicans, Democrats, career officials at the agency. She's someone who is known as having integrity, she's known as somebody who is absolutely committed to the security of this nation. And for the Democrats, and for their allies, and the media to be trying to smear her now with these attacks I think is really disgraceful. I'm confident that she'll do well."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you, you know, some of the specifics, in terms of the interrogation of KSM, this report from BuzzFeed says that he lied while he was being water boarded, while these enhanced interrogation techniques were used on him. -- they say that he gave up the dirty bomb plot before he was water boarded, and that they didn't get useful information out of him afterwards. These are the kinds of questions that she's gonna get."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHENEY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Look, I think, that there are -- number one, I would urge people to go back. There's a 2004 report that was declassified by the CIA. The title of the report is KSM was the source of the vast majority of our knowledge at that point about Al-Qaeda, and it is simply not the case that he gave that information up prior to being water boarded. So, I would urge any of the senators who are going to oppose her, any of the senators who are going to stand up and say we shouldn't have water boarded KSM, for example. They ought to be able to tell the American people how many American lives they're willing to sacrifice so they don't have to water board a terrorist. I wouldn't be willing to sacrifice any American lives for that. And there's a big effort now to rewrite history. Big effort to try to claim this program, didn't work. But we know the program gave us information that helped save lives. We also know the program led directly, gave us clues that led directly to helping identify the location of Osama Bin Laden, and CIA directors have said that from both parties throughout the period of time since the program was started and also was ended. So, it was a good program and it worked."

A very hot race in West Virginia that we have watched, Don Blankenship, of course, is the coal baron who used to be the CEO of Massey Energy in West Virginia. He spent a year in prison after the explosion at UBB mine, lost 29 people, and he's up against Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey. So, let's bring in our friends who are with us tonight to cover this, Charlie Hurt, Chris Stirewalt, Mo Elleithee and Capri Cafaro. Welcome to all of you. Charlie just joining us, welcome."

      "utterance": "Well, I think that what we're still seeing is -- especially in Republican parts of the country, you're seeing an electorate that is very much in the throes of antiestablishment fervor, and it's a probe Trump fervor. And so a guy like Don Blankenship, while he may give the vapors to everybody here in Washington, he's got a real shot at winning the nomination now in West Virginia."

    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Yeah. They've been spending too much time with the West Virginians. I think Charles is 150 percent right. I think that not just in West Virginia, but in Indiana there is a mold here to whatever degree that the president wants to stop this, he was the accelerant for this fire, and telling Republicans that they can't have what they want after Trump demonstrated that they could, right? It was possible to pick who they told you not to and still win anyway. It's pretty hard then to turn around and say but stop here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, Mo, we know that, obviously, Mitch McConnell is no big fan of Don Blankenship, and this has been a really fascinating debate to watch between these two. They've been sniping at each other throughout the whole course of this thing. And, you know, word is that Mitch McConnell and President Trump spoke about this, and President Trump decided to come right out and say do not vote for Don Blankenship, he cannot win. But he could win tonight, potentially, we'll see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "He could. And if he does, it's because he's trying to say that he's Trumpier than Trump, right? If Blankenship pulls this out, you know, I think it will show that, at least right now with the Republican base, Trumpism -- that Republican voters are more loyal to Trumpism then they are to Trump. And that's a really interesting dynamic. Though the president will be 0 for 2 in sort of these races between Alabama and West Virginia. And, you know, you look at -- compare that to the Democrats in that West Virginia congressional seat to replace Jenkins where you've got this really interesting Democrat, Richard Ojeda, if he pulls it off tonight is running as a populist Democrat, pro- gun, pro-labor, really made a name for himself as a -- fighting -- standing with the teachers. You're seeing the debate between antiestablishment and economic populism."

In all seriousness is that Trump said don't vote for Blankenship, they didn't pick one of the other two. So, the establishment can split the vote, we'll see what happens. I think that's good for Blankenship."
