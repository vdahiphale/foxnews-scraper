From there, things got increasingly, well, personal. With O'Donnell telling Shapiro to do things that we can't say here on television, prompting Shapiro to send out this tweet today. \"Just reported Rosie for targeted harassment, mainly just to see if Twitter does indeed have a double standard. Everyone knows if Rosie were conservative, Twitter would suspend her in a hot second. So, Twitter, put your money where your mouth is. Hashtag Me Too.\" Rosie replied simply, \"Oh, Ben.\" Shapiro's response, \"Rosie, all victims deserve to be believed.\" And the story doesn't end there. Joining us now in an exclusive interview, Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief at The Daily Wire. I know you just heard from Twitter. I want you to hold on to that for one second, just so we can make sure everybody is up to speed. Her original tweet which I saw applied by two, where she says, $2 million to Senator Susan Collins, Senator Jeff Flake, if they vote no. \"No, i will not kill Americans,\" that's what she tweeted. I don't know how this is killing Americans. That's OK. For the sour rich, I think it was supposed to say super, but she was impaired in some way while doing this probably with her fingers. DME (ph) Susan, DME (ph) Jeff. You responded that if Trump orders Sessions to investigate Rosie, he will be carved into rush more by Friday, which I thought was a pretty good burn.

The fact that Democrats have been saying it's going to fall on its face. But what a difference a few weeks can make? It was not too long ago the healthcare reform had failed and everybody was saying he's not going to get anywhere at all. The fact of the matter is, he was saying I'm not going to get on the road very much to sell this because it's going to sell itself.

It was the meeting where sources say it got pretty tense as Trump advisor, Corey Lewandowski, suggested to the president the White House political operation led by Bill Stepien doesn't have his back. There was talk of big adjustments that are needed ahead of those 2018 midterms. At that session, top aides like John Kelly, Kellyanne Conway, Hope Hicks. Part of the concern for Republicans, that you mentioned, is that various polls have suggested this tax package is deeply unpopular as Democrats charge it's only for the rich. But GOP Leaders believe those numbers are going to brighten as paychecks fatten. Look at this, typical family of four, earning $75,000, will receive income tax cuts of more than 2,000 bucks. Two more big companies today announced bonuses for workers: Sinclaire Broadcasting and PNC, that's on top of AT&T, Boeing, Comcast, Fifth Third Bank and Wells Fargo. Even though Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi insisted such benefits would not reach workers, today she doubled down saying, \"The insulting crumbs Republicans give working families are meager,\" Melissa, meager, \"and temporary. And that's for the families lucky enough not to face a tax hike right away.\" The president looked ahead and said he's getting beyond this and he's going to win on other issues. Watch"

One of his signature achievements that President Trump has said is a disaster. Obama officials are saying the story was exaggerated, but today the Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department is going to look into it. Look, the bottom line is, you have a lot of Democrats saying that the Republicans are just trying to distract attention from the Robert Mueller investigation with these various probes. But the fact of the matter is you hear people in the White House saying you have to follow the law and you have to follow the ethics.

And the reality of it is that the average American business was being taxed at a rate of about 44.6 percent. And we needed -- desperately need help on our taxes. And what this new tax bill allows us to do now is take a 20 percent deduction on our taxes. That gets us in an area where we can become a little bit more creative with our funds, we can become more, you know, drive even more jobs than we are driving now. Currently, American small businesses create two thirds of all jobs in this country. This is nothing but good news for America's small business community."

So, I think what you're seeing in this tax bill which you also didn't mention was the Obamacare penalty repeal, if you will, that is going to lead hopefully to the entire repeal of Obamacare. So, I think this leads well to a good 2018, plus the electoral map that really where Donald Trump is strong. And I think what you're seeing inside of the Republican Party are candidates that are coming together that really appeal to the masses, because they're Trump coalition type of candidates. They're running on that same type of platform that propelled Donald Trump the victory. That was, you know, (INAUDIBLE) legal immigration, protecting our border. It was getting better trade deals and creating U.S. jobs. So, I think this tax bill is a step in the right direction, and we're going to see that lead to a very good 2018."

He announced as well that they will be investing over $50 billion, over the next 10 years, into improving their infrastructure. Guess who is going to help them improve their infrastructure?

I mean, 121 percent Obamacare, where it's destroying Arizona families. And you have candidates like Kelli Ward who's running in Arizona that says, hey, enough is enough. And so, I think you have to look at it from that type of prism.

We're going to go down to a screaming defeat in the fall. We are in a tough, tough fight, where we have to have the best candidates in order to hold onto the Senate and the House."

But I wrote my column this week in the Wall Street Journal about this issue because, as part of the White House discussions, The Washington Post wrote a story clearly quoting on background White House aides saying, the president wants to go out and spend 2018 campaigning and he wants to have a lot of rallies. And I said that's a very bad idea. The president ought to spend 2018 focused on his job as president and advancing an agenda that makes a difference in the lives of ordinary Americans. And he should down play politics; he's not very popular. And the way to become more popular is to become less political and more involved in this agenda. It's like now, the president is getting a burst of good press, is it because he's attacking Meryl Streep? Or, you know, attacking Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer? No, it's because he is heralding the passage of an important piece of legislation that will make a concrete positive difference in the lives of Americans. Got to have more of that in 2018."

Bannon called an advisor and said he would consider running for president if President Trump doesn't run for re-election in 2020, which he has told people is a realistic possibility. He said that Trump only has a 30 percent chance of serving out his term in private conversations. What do you think about all of this back and forth?"

      "speaker": "ROVE",

First of all, apparently, Bannon has said to a number of people on a number of occasions that he thinks President Trump only has a 30 percent chance of making it through his term. So, I accept that that's more likely. The other one that Bannon himself is contemplating a bit for the presidency is based on one conversation that Bannon supposedly had with one individual that is then reported to one reporter. And so, I'm less, less, you know -- that's less believable to me. What's interesting about the story is, frankly, what Bannon says himself on the record, which I think is really interesting. The Trump presidency -- this is after he got fired. The Trump presidency that we fought for and won is over because Bannon is leaving the White House. \"I'm free, now that I have been fired from the White House. I've got my hands back on my weapons,\" namely the Breitbart Web site. \"I have power.\" I mean, that seems unhinged, frankly. And then, what he said about Roy Moore in Alabama \"on the record.\" He said, this is when the charges came out about molesting young girls, he said you have to double down. In other words, deny, deny, deny. And, \"this is Alabama. The age of consent is 16 for a reason.\" All those seem sort of weird to me."

That's a very real thing. And so, the president, along with his national security counsel laid out a security plan that does what you have to do with terrorists.

They should have done more. And then on top of that, I also feel like they blackballed Colin Kaepernick. You know, he was not able to try out for any team. If they would have brought him on to a team, I believe a lot of this would have been dulled down. And then on top of that, you know, the NFL continues to have issues with their players, not just when it comes to social justice, but also domestic violence. They are not doing their job. So, you know what? Their ratings are down and they are down for a reason."

      "utterance": "A Twitter war breaking out between two prominent voices on the left and the right. It all started with Rosie O'Donnell's suggestion that she would bribe lawmakers to vote against the tax bill. Ben Shapiro wasn't having it, saying that's a violation of federal law. From there, things got increasingly, well, personal. With O'Donnell telling Shapiro to do things that we can't say here on television, prompting Shapiro to send out this tweet today. \"Just reported Rosie for targeted harassment, mainly just to see if Twitter does indeed have a double standard. Everyone knows if Rosie were conservative, Twitter would suspend her in a hot second. So, Twitter, put your money where your mouth is. Hashtag Me Too.\" Rosie replied simply, \"Oh, Ben.\" Shapiro's response, \"Rosie, all victims deserve to be believed.\" And the story doesn't end there. Joining us now in an exclusive interview, Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief at The Daily Wire. I know you just heard from Twitter. I want you to hold on to that for one second, just so we can make sure everybody is up to speed. Her original tweet which I saw applied by two, where she says, $2 million to Senator Susan Collins, Senator Jeff Flake, if they vote no. \"No, i will not kill Americans,\" that's what she tweeted. I don't know how this is killing Americans. That's OK. For the sour rich, I think it was supposed to say super, but she was impaired in some way while doing this probably with her fingers. DME (ph) Susan, DME (ph) Jeff. You responded that if Trump orders Sessions to investigate Rosie, he will be carved into rush more by Friday, which I thought was a pretty good burn. But what inspired you to pile on this mess, because it was already out of control?"

Specific provision of the U.S. code. In doing so, she had done this on Twitter. And so I sort of piled on a little bit. She responded by essentially telling me to perform an anatomical act on her --"

      "utterance": "Right."

    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "-- that certainly would fall under \"Me Too\" sexual harassment. But what was weird about it was that she told me to perform it on a male appendage of hers. That was weird."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "Let's not get into that, because people could be having dinner right now. SHAPIRO: That's probably smart. And so I responded by essentially saying that she was already a felon. There was no need to make herself into a homophobic sexual harasser as well. Things degenerated from there. FRANCIS: Yes, absolutely. The serious part of this is that she told you to do things to her that of course Harvey Weinstein and lots of people are in trouble for trying to get people to do to them. I mean, if a man said this to a woman, you say conservative versus liberal, but any of the normal tables were turned, people would recoil in horror and just would really be on your side, but not this time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "No question. I mean, if I had said exactly the same words to Rosie O'Donnell that she said to me on Twitter, I have very little doubt that I would have been suspended or expelled from Twitter for targeted harassment or abuse under their rules. So, I decided to find out exactly how Twitter operated. And so I reported her for targeted harassment and abuse. And then I have now received back their notice that apparently there was no violation of the Twitter rules which is astonishing. They say that she did not actually perform behavior that crosses the line into abuse. I totally understanding why we can't read these tweets on air because they are really obscene and abusive. But that's why Twitter probably should have done something if they cared about enforcing their own rules. I actually don't want Rosie O'Donnell tossed off Twitter. I find her far too amusing and sad that she blocked me today. But, that said, I think the Twitter should be held to account for its own enforcement of the rules because it's wildly inconsistent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "Yes. We are looking right there where you can see that Rosie blocked you. It does seem very hypocritical on Twitter's part which is sort of the focus, because Rosie has gone off a bunch of times before. I mean, she has a long Twitter history. Some of her best times were during the debate where she called President Trump all kinds of names comparing him to body parts, saying how orange he was. Talking about his appearance. Again, t things that if tweeted at a woman, you know, tweeted Hillary Clinton about her appearance, people would be all open arms. This is what she was doing to Donald Trump. She even said he was like the snake (INAUDIBLE) little house on the prairie, which I kind of liked for obvious reasons. But, all these things going on, she is on Twitter but, Twitter does nothing about it when she attacks someone with what should be sexual harassment. Do they have a track record of banning other people for saying things like this though?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Well, they do have a track record of at least blocking people's tweets for considered abusive or suspending people who are abusive. They have a track record of going after people for political reasons as well. Again, their terms of service suggest that you are not allowed to issue tweets like this. But they have a rather arbitrary standard obviously for what they choose to enforce or not enforce. My guess is that they didn't want to open the can of worms that would have necessitated opening in order to take any action against Rosie O'Donnell for suggesting that I do certain things to her which is horrifying in contemplation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "I am so shocked on the fact that she seemed very sincere and the fact when she went on originally and she tweeted long tweets about exactly how much money she wanted to give to them to vote no. I mean, she sounded very serious. So, I don't know. There is a lot of debate right now about whether or not that's a violation of the law, since it was on Twitter. We will see. Ben Shapiro, hat tipped to you, my friend, thank you for coming on."

    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
