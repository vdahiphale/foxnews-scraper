It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" President Trump is renewing his attack today on both the press and the critics. This morning, the President made his case for using social media to bring his message directly to the American people. Tweeting, \"Only the fake news media and Trump enemies want me to stop using social media (110 million people). Only way for me to get the truth out. This is the mainstream media sure seems to be proving Mr. Trump right. Behold! CNN political analyst David Gregory's analysis of the White House."

I think all of this going around and purging people, just like Kim Jong-un, what is he doing? Knocks all of his relatives when he gets scared? When you get scared of your position, you start killing people around. We don't do that in this country, we fire them. Trump seems to know how to fire."

The media is chasing rabbits. The rest of America is interested in the whales. So, the rabbits are rumors and conversations and maybe some meetings and some staffing changes, those are the rabbits that everybody chases and we chased them too. But America is interested in the whales and the whales of the economy, economy, economy and security and terror. So, it's really, action. I had to frame it after the election as its action versus words. They are preoccupied, the media is preoccupied with his words. America is preoccupied with his deeds. And if you have problems with Trump's character or his jokes or the way he acts, concentrate on what he does. And so, there are four things that I look at that make me feel like things are going well. ISIS, not entirely gone but it's getting there. He's rolled back a ton of regulations, he withdrew from the Paris accords, that symbolic bomb meant something, it meant something and then he's confirmed I think five judges so far. So, those are five whales that Trump has harpooned while the rest of the media just blubbers."

And actually, if you look at some of the polling, it's like supporters of his are like, whoa, I don't know if this is actually helping you so much. And the President also, he wants to be taken for his word and his actions. So, when, I don't know, I can kind of separate it because I can sort of see like, I think some of this is bluster. For example, tonight the other media is covering the story, that is reportedly the President told some friends at a golf club that the White House is real dump. Okay. So, they're running with this story. I can just imagine the President would be joking when he said that. Like, oh, yes, they're real dump. It's really hard to live at the White House. He actually in interviews that he did like with \"Time\" magazine and with Maggie Haberman of the \"New York Times.\" He loves being at the White House, he think it's beautiful. He wants people to come and visit. He hardly ever comes back to New York. So, I do think that the media has a tendency to run away with things that make the media look bad but I also think that the President hinders his own message in trying to get those results by talking about the media all the time."

But a quarter of them say, no, I think it's actually more than a quarter of his own supporters. People who voted for Donald Trump say that they think this is the wrong way for him to go. And if you ask all Americans, then you're like 70 percent of Americans say, this is ridiculous. This is not the way to do business. And in fact, after the communication about the ban on transgender people serving in the military where the Pentagon didn't know exactly what he's doing because he did it in the serious of tweets.

I don't think so.

If Martinez had been deported permanently, maybe even on the 20th time, two women wouldn't have been attacked. But he returned and he sanctuary raped in a sanctuary city.

You try to convince the Chinese essentially that something might go off here, because remember Lindsey Graham said thousands of people would die. If we were to engage in the kind of strike necessary, to eradicate North Korea Nuclear program or if God helps us if there was a nuclear missile on the pad and we struck, we would not be talking about thousands of dead we would be talking about millions of dead. For the Chinese, we must always remember, for the Chinese, North Korea represents antagonism toward the United States, yes, antagonism toward Japan and South Korea. A good way to destabilize the region but it also represents a humanitarian crisis at any moment. 20 million North Koreans living as vassals to this madman, if this breaks bad China has a terrible problem on their hands.

When you have potential for strikes in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, this gets real and people need to be assured. So he needs to speak several people all at once and the speech will do that.

I think we may be over blowing this a little bit that in fact this guy is exercising his options, as crazy as it may seem. Why else would we talk about dialogue if we didn't think that was possible? There's the other point to this, we do have options until the strange house at the end of town. We didn't have to deal with, and other strange house is driving over past our house, throwing their bottles on our lawn and it could get worse.
