Virtually every key sector of the economy added jobs, and a lot of them. If you think about it, health care more than 50,000, construction 38,000. We saw restaurants and bars 41,000, manufacturing 32,000, retail 24,000. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We see that also the prior months also had an uptick in activity from that prior period as well.

You pointed out the broad-based nature of it, but my goodness, guys, we have had these numbers before, I mean, yes, maybe not 312,000, but we have had easily close to 200,000 now for several months running.

And stocks on a tear after they were yesterday, well, a terror, as those job numbers keep the bear at bay, at least for now. The Dow soaring than 800 points earlier, ultimately up about 743.33 points, about 70 or more points than we fell yesterday. So what's going on? We got Fox team coverage with Fox Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on what is driving those numbers and Rich Edson with what the president is saying about those numbers. We begin with Deirdre. What happened?"

      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, that December jobs number, it was a wow, right? When that number crossed, we were collectively surprised. Labor Department saying that the U.S. economy added 312,000 jobs in December. So that blew past forecasts for 177,000 jobs. Now, that data point also rounded out the year really well. So in total, if you look for 2018, employers added an average of 220,000 jobs per month, making 2018 the best jobs growth year since 2015. So more jobs added to the U.S. economy, also wage growth gained. So it went up by 3.2 percent annual rate, best full year again in a decade. Now, unemployment did move higher. So it went from 3.7 percent to 3.9 percent. But this was mostly due to more workers entering the work force. The director of National Economic Council had an optimistic take on the report with reason."

So traders heard a more cautious tone in his comments vs. even what he was saying about a month ago. And traders, a lot of them at least, began to estimate that a slower pace of potential future rate hikes is possible. Also signs of hope that progress can be made between the U.S. and China on trade, both countries sending high-level officials to meetings next week in Beijing. So, Neil, basically a trifecta. You had jobs, Fed and trade all giving investors a little hope -- back to you."

Now, investors outside of today's trading have been concerned about rising interest rates, slowing global growth, the ongoing trade fight with China. The president mentioned China today. He says there is a massive ongoing trade negotiation with China, and that the United States is doing very well. He was also asked about Apple downgrading its -- cutting its revenue forecast because of slow iPhone sales in China. He says he's friends with Apple CEO Tim Cook, and that he's urging Tim Cook to start building iPhones here in the United States, instead of China. Also, Jay Powell not only talking about interest rates today, but he was also asked that would he resign basically if the president asked him to? Powell said no -- Neil, back to you."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the way I'm going to be. If they tell me to go, I'm not leaving. I think it's a good strategy to take. All right, Rich, thank you very, very much, Rich Edson. Just to show you how widespread this job growth goes, because it can't be overstated here, this was across the board, folks. Virtually every key sector of the economy added jobs, and a lot of them. If you think about it, health care more than 50,000, construction 38,000. We saw restaurants and bars 41,000, manufacturing 32,000, retail 24,000. We see that also the prior months also had an uptick in activity from that prior period as well. So the average gains in the last three months have been an excess of 250,000 jobs. And that kind of pace shows a pickup in activity. What would that mean and does that mean that whatever is ailing China is unique to China and not us? Traders Kevin Caron join us, Michelle Girard, along with Scott Martin. Michelle, what do you make of this and how broad-based this was?  MICHELLE GIRARD, NATWEST: Oh, it was, as you said, Neil, across the board in terms of job growth. Another thing that's really impressive that us economists like to look at is not only were more people working, but the people who are working, their companies had them working longer hours, which is like the equivalent of another 300,000-plus jobs. So there was a strong labor input and companies were having their workers making a lot of goods. As you said, it's suggests much better momentum at the end of the year than some of the other reports and certainly then some of the pessimism that had seemed to have overtaken the markets over the last couple of weeks."

      "speaker": "SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know yet. I will tell you tomorrow -- or Monday, rather, Neil, because I will tell you, I mean, you're right. The market has been very schizophrenic and not taking its mood meds. And, Michelle, I will tell you, I'm probably one of those pessimists now, because the thing that I do like is the strengthened number today, Neil. You pointed out the broad-based nature of it, but my goodness, guys, we have had these numbers before, I mean, yes, maybe not 312,000, but we have had easily close to 200,000 now for several months running. And tell me why the 10-year note rate then has plummeted from, say, 3.2 percent in October, all the way down to a low of, say, 2.60 or so yesterday. Yes, it bounced back today. But the bond market is trying to tell us something, my friends. So I don't want to be accused of pulling out or let's say pouring out the party punch here at the party. But the reality is the bond market is saying that there's maybe more disinflation ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Kevin, in the middle of this, we had the Federal Reserve chairman saying, look, I don't see a reason to pounce on anything and willy-nilly raise rates -- I'm paraphrasing here -- but his message seemed to defy a very strong economic report that you could argue would necessitate in continuing with that tightening cycle. What did you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEVIN CARON, WASHINGTON CROSSING ADVISORS",
      "utterance": "Yes, he said that he's going to pay very close attention to financial markets. And the financial markets definitely got his attention the last month. And what financial markets have been saying is that there is some worry out there. So the bond market, the yield curve flattening, the 10-year yield moving down, like we just said, that's indicative of a weakening global economy, where we see most of the weakness outside our borders. But the data here in the United States has been very strong. So you had this wind shear throughout the year. The story here has been very good. We got more evidence of that today. The rest of the world not so much. And foreign investors have been funneling money into our economy, into our treasuries, driving up the price of the treasuries and down the yields. But, ultimately, if the global economy erodes too badly, that is going to affect us here at home. So we're right on that precipice where we have to see which way the cat bounces."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "GIRARD",
      "utterance": "I am still expecting that the Fed will nudge up a little bit more. Again, my outlook is really one for the economy to continue to perform well. I mean, I think a big point about today's number, as you said, in the context of the weakness yesterday, is that you can't take any one piece of information as the rule, as the gospel."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIRARD",
      "utterance": "The bottom line is, the economy doesn't swing from growth to recession back to strong growth like these economic indicators do. And I think what today did was remind people that, hey, the global economy may be a bit slower, U.S. growth may be a little bit slower, but it's a very different thing to be talking about slowing from over 3 percent in 2018 to maybe 2, 2.5 in 2019. That is not a recession forecast. That is still above trend growth. And it still potentially would keep the Fed saying, hey, we shouldn't be -- we should be very cautious about raising rates too much, but also about falling behind the curve if in fact the economy does perform better and we do start to see inflation pick up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "MARTIN",
      "utterance": "I thought it was a good answer. I guess he's somewhat confident today, maybe more so, Neil, with the market going up the way it was after his comments. I mean, gosh, you can attribute maybe 35 S&P points to Powell and the group today. It was a nice little reunion, by the way, with Bernanke up there too. Haven't seen him in a while. But I got to disagree with Michelle."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARTIN",
      "utterance": "It reminded me of my high school reunion, except I was made fun of at that reunion. And what's funny is too, is, to Michelle's point, though, Neil, I don't see inflation anywhere. And that's what I don't get about the Fed. They have been so concerned about inflation. They have been reducing their balance sheet, yet Powell still has talked about -- until today about this outlook for inflation that I just do not see. So I think they have some room to really pause here. The market is telling them to do that. If they do pause going forward, I think you're going to see the S&P stocks get some support."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARON",
      "utterance": "Yes, his job is safe. But the message in the markets since the markets' volatility picked up a couple months ago has been lower expectations for interest rates. It wasn't today. Those expectations got -- started to get backed out of the market through the month of November, through the month of December. All Powell did today was sort of confirm that. And keep in mind, the market was already on a tear coming into the session this morning, and helped by the employment figures, which were very, very strong."

So, if a wall is immoral, then where's the legislation being introduced by the Democrats to take down the wall between Tijuana and San Diego? So, I mean, so I think it is the term in some -- in some regards at least with the Democrats. And, of course, it is some about the money. But this is just common sense. And the president said today in his -- in his press event. He said, look, we're going to do what he's told the American people he's going to do. And he's going to stand firm for that. And I think that's exactly the right position. We just got to keep making the argument, and the American people have to keep speaking up in support of it, I think. That's when we ultimately get the Democrats to do the right thing."

That's why we think this is the better approach, to actually appropriate dollars to build a border security wall, like we all promised the American people we were going to do when we ran for the job. This is simply doing what we said. If you want to deal with the gang problem, and you want to deal with the drug problem, and you want to deal with the human trafficking problem, build a border security wall on the southern border, like we all promised, and like Democrats have supported in the past. But now, some -- for some -- if you need no other evidence, look to what happened yesterday, that they are more concerned about stopping the president than helping the country. Brad Sherman files articles of impeachment on the very first day. Representative Tlaib makes her disgraceful comments last night about the president. That shows where they're at. That's not for the good of the country. The wall is. So let's get back focused on what helps this -- what helps this great nation."

And what are the Democrats' first two things they do? They pass a rules package that looks to raise taxes. They introduce impeachment resolution. And you have a new member of Congress from Michigan say the disgraceful, terrible thing she said about the president. So I don't think they understand what this -- think about this president, taxes cut, regulations reduced, economy growing at an unprecedented rate, 312,000 jobs last week, lowest unemployment in 50 years, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the court, out of the Iran deal, embassy in Jerusalem, hostages home from North Korea, new NAFTA agreement. And what are Democrats focused on? Impeaching the president and saying the terrible things that they said yesterday. So that's the fundamental problem. We can come to a solution.

To date, after a year-and-a-half not one bit of evidence, and now we're going to extend it six more months? I haven't heard what they're doing exactly.

But sources in the courthouse are telling our producers there that the extension is for another six months. Typically, a grand jury term caps out at 24 months. So this has been going on for 18 months. So that would mean at the very least that this investigation will go into the summer. And that's just when it's -- when it's wrapped up. It doesn't necessarily mean that the full report and the full findings are released. But it does give you a sense that this could drag on a while.

And a couple things here, Neil, this is the problem with special prosecutors. This is -- we used to have an independent counsel law back in the Reagan years. Congress ended the independent counsel law because these investigations tend to go on forever, years and years. And the independent counsel or special prosecutor, there is a question of accountability. And I would say here, Neil, that if this thing starts dragging on that, once the new attorney general hopefully is confirmed, William Barr, then I think Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein probably should call in Robert Mueller and ask him to explain exactly what he has and what is going on, rather than let this thing simply extend indefinitely into the future, hanging over the American system, as it has for the past 18 months."

This has been an amazingly successful investigation so far by Mueller, in that he has received already five guilty pleas, not indictments, guilty pleas, from former Trump advisers who are actually quite close to the president, of course, including Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, and others, right? So of course, this is going to keep going, because it seems, the way that Mueller has conducted his investigation thus far has been that he's sort of -- if you think of it about as concentric circles around the president, he started with people who are not all that close to the president. Now we're sort of zeroing in on the people who are closest to him. We're finally sort of getting more and more information about what are actions that, say, Don Jr. may have taken or Jared Kushner, the president and his family, right? You can't stop just now, right before we're actually getting information."

      "utterance": "I would say that's, again, ironic. When you look back at, let's say, the Bill Clinton impeachment, that was because there wasn't actually anything around Whitewater. They had to go to the fact that he had this affair with an intern in the Oval Office. That's immoral, but not illegal. Mueller has turned over all kinds of actually illegal, criminal activity around Donald Trump."

We are going to explore this in more detail, especially on our Saturday show tomorrow, \"Cavuto Live,\" the implications of this. Any extension at all is going to rattle Republicans, maybe consider delighting some Democrats here, and confusing pretty much anyone and everyone in between. But it is a big development here that the investigation has been extended, at least for a grand jury to sit tight for a while, while they dot the I's, cross the T's or whatever else they do. It's lawyers, and a lot of them. We will have more after this."

He also laid out a possibility that, in the name of a national emergency, he will make sure he gets it done himself. Can he do that militarily? He says it's about our security and keeping us alive. To retired Four-Star General Jack Keane on that. General, obviously, I don't expect you to be a constitutional scholar and all of that, but he's claiming, in our natural interest, in our -- for simple national security reasons, that thing has got to be built, and he will take the power into his own hands to do it. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "JACK KEANE, SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST",

And I think, obviously, he's spoken to his White House lawyers and the Department of Justice, and they have given him some advice that, yes, you can do that legally. I mean, the facts really speak for themselves. I mean, they're really quite stunning, with 2,000 people per day illegally trying to penetrate our border, 17,000 criminals last year apprehended in doing that. And this one. Listen to this, 3,000-plus suspected terrorists apprehended at our border. I mean, we have 1,000 inside the country that the FBI is looking at. And we consider that a very serious challenge for the FBI. And here we have stopped 3,000-plus more joining that list. I clearly think it's a major national security issue."

Some of it has to be improved, because it's deteriorated or it never was the right quality. And then they want another 600 miles or so of it. When you talk to the Border Patrol and the people who are dealing with this every day, and some of the Army folks that are down there, I mean, clearly the wall slows down to penetrators and it gives the Border Patrol an opportunity to apprehend them. And if you were able to do that in all the places they believe that the most vulnerable, then you begin to shut this thing down. So, I -- the logic just doesn't seem there when you try to say that there is -- there's no value here. And $5 billion out of $716 billion defense budget, I mean, that's on the margin and easy to find, frankly."

In that case, it would be -- that would be a continuing down payment on something, we're told, General, could cost in excess of $25 billion. I don't know the exact figures here. But, militarily, would you be comfortable with transitioning some funds earmarked for other purposes to this?"

The president was saying today that the Chinese really need these talks to succeed, they need them a lot more than we do, and he seemed to be talking from a number of vantage points, militarily, their own financial security seems to be at risk, and that we have the upper hand. Do you buy that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, here's what I do buy. The national security strategy from this administration has identified China as a long-term strategic threat to the United States. And I think that is absolutely spot on. And it separates -- it separates this administration from previous administrations. And this is a threat from what? This is an economic -- they're economic predators, to be sure, and that has got the largest piece of the focus. Their military expansion in the region in terms of dominating the region, and they want to drive the United States out of the Asia-Pacific, and President Xi has stated time and time again that he intends to replace the United States as the global leader of the world. Now, this is usually ambitious strategic objectives from the Chinese. And their economic predatory behavior is existing in Asia, in Southeast Asia, in Africa, in South America, and in the Middle East. It is really quite extraordinary what they're doing to compete with the United States and actually dominate the world in a way that the United States has enjoyed world hegemony for a number of years."

I can't in any way condone that. It's not how we act in West Virginia. It's not how we talked about public leaders. We might disagree with each other, but we try to get through it. We try to find a pathway forward. And to act like that, just awful, and to speak like that is even more deplorable. I'm so sorry. I want to apologize to all Americans.

And people want to start speculating just because you don't like somebody or don't like their personality, you don't like the way they talk, the way they act. I can disagree with all those things. It's not the way I was raised. But the bottom line is, I have a job to do as United States senator to try to help my state the best I can. West Virginians expect me to do that, and also to make sure that my country is protected and strong with great opportunities. I'm going to work with whoever is there, whoever the people from respective parts of this country send there. And the president is my president. And that's -- that's what we have in front of us. So let's work together to try to get this thing fixed. This shutdown is ridiculous right now. Neil, I was just -- I was just looking.

Therefore, pulling back, there should be money there. If the president believes that he can use it, he should use it, then we should be able to give him the ability to transfer that money. Doesn't take out anybody else's wish list or whatever else we have our responsibilities and obligations for. And let's move on. This government should not be shut down for one minute longer."

      "utterance": "Well, if they're providing -- if they're balking about putting new money and more debt in this, we have already provided $69 billion for OCO. That's overseas contingency rMD-BO_fund for our military. Surely we can find $5 billion of that, if we're pulling back in different areas, and not pulling back from Afghanistan some, which I agree with the president. I'm more concerned about pulling out of Syria, very much concerned. But still yet we're ratcheting back. There should be $5 billion. And if he has an emergency, and it's -- and I believe our borders need to be secured. I support securing our borders. And it's more than just a so- called wall. We're not even talking the optics of a wall. We're talking secured -- some type of a secured structure, more of a high gate, high steel strength that you can see through, whatever it takes. But it's more than that. It's going to take basically X-rays and hardware that we're going to need on our ports of entry, container ships coming in, mail coming in, sensors that we need, more agents that we need. I still would say, Mr. President, please accept the 2013 compromise bill that we had and we passed in the Senate. But the hard right prevents him from going in that direction, Neil. And it's a shame. So both extremes are being detrimental to our country and our welfare and our well-being."

Joining me now to discuss the significance of all of this is the former Apollo 17 astronaut.

And here they are doing the same thing, but apparently with a very aggressive agenda. What do you think of it?"

      "speaker": "SCHMITT",

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter that remains in orbit around the moon today, and the GRAIL mission that established the gravitational field of the moon, as well as the (INAUDIBLE) satellite on which we had a payload that gave us a great deal of information about the mineral composition of the surface of the far side, all of these, I'm sure, were taking advantage of by the Chinese in navigating to a far side landing. I hope, though, that the landing itself and the existence of that landing lights a fire under NASA. Many of us are concerned that NASA has not shown the kind of urgency that they should, geopolitical urgency, that they should in implementing the president's directive to go back to the moon and prepare to go to Mars."

I was thinking -- and you and I have chatted about this before -- but I always think that what took away the momentum of going way beyond just what you and Gene and 10 other brave men who walked the moon did is that we did it. We achieved the goal. We beat the Russians. We did it before the proverbial decade was out, in your case the last man to walk on the moon in 1972, and then we kind of shook our hands. And that was it. I often think that the thing that helped John Kennedy when he was pushing the space program was the battle with the Soviet Union and to beat them and the Cold War mentality. I don't want to be crass about it. But, in a weird way, do you think the competitive juices between ourselves and the Chinese might do it now?"
    },

      "speaker": "SCHMITT",

And part of that Cold War, psychological part of that war, as well as technological, is going to include the moon. And as soon as the United States fully recognizes that and NASA fully recognizes that, and the Office of Management and Budget recognizes that, and the Congress recognizes it, the better off we're all going to be. To have another nation, whatever nation, but particularly to have China now, take away the primacy of the U.S. as being the only nation to have put human beings on the moon, I think, would be psychologically and geopolitically very dangerous."
