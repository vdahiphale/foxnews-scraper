It's 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Well, Democrats have been obsessed with Russian meddling in the 2016 election earlier this month. Former FBI Director James Comey revealed some possible interference much closer to home. Comey testified before Congress that Obama's Attorney General Loretta Lynch told him not to use the word investigation while discussing the Clinton email case. News that even troubled prominent Democrats."

Now, do not adjust you set, this was not a story from two years, this is actually still going on. Richard, you did also have Feinstein today saying that he does not believe that Attorney General Lynch played any role in influencing the investigation of Hillary Clinton. These letters are just to request an information to put to rest speculation about the issue. What are you hearing?"

Every Justice Department is played politics in recent history. So, there's no, nothing, there is no there, there. I think this is very interesting. I think that Loretta Lynch clearly probably made some mistakes in which he did here. I'll be the first to admit that. I mean, Hillary Clinton lost the election. She is taking a walk in Chappaqua. Just let her walk in the woods."

I mean, again, after all of this stuff that we've gone through, here she goes, demonizing a group of people calling us killers, that's not a good thing to do when this heated political climate Hillary. But it's always about Hillary, it's always about the Clintons, they are the acid reflux of a Democratic Party, no matter what, they just give common back up. Every year -- there's another Clinton problem. Anyway, the letters are meant to put the risk of speculation. That is exactly what Donald Trump watered from Comey and he didn't get it. And so, we can see there is no, there there but I don't know. This is truly the anti-transparency party. This is about using a manipulating speech to hide truth. They didn't want us say investigation. They wanted to say it's a matter. Remember man caused disasters, those Janet Napolitano's way of replacing the word, terror."

The last time she testified in front of a Senate Committee, 70 separate times, she refused to answer the question. I think that she's going to say, I am not going to testify, she subpoenaed, if she subpoenaed, she will try to say, you know, the Fifth Amendment or something. She's not going to sit there and spill the beans on any of this whether there was any kind of an appropriate behavior or not. And as it relates to Hillary Clinton as security clearance, it is, it is Groundhog Day all over again. Because we've been doing this over and over again. Maybe this time, they'll actually pull the security clearance.

That the CIA gave him information on Russia a longtime before they even, you know, before the election. And I hardly see it. It's an amazing thing. To me, you know, in other words, the question is, if he had the information, why didn't he do something about it? He should have done something about it. But you don't read that. It's quite said."

In a desperate attempt to be edgy, he figured he can win over the British audience with the joke about killing Trump, when all else fails, go there. It reveals a truth about Depp. He was never a trailblazer, but an imitator. That is why he still impersonates Keith Richards wherever he goes. Remember how Rachel Dolezal decided to as black, Depp is doing the same thing. He is culturally appropriating Keith Richards. And now Depp is 54. A member of AARP, it's time to stop dressing like your mother's hat rack. Now he since apologizing saying, he intended no malice and he probably didn't. What he intended to do was maintain his relevance. Clean to a coolness. That is dwindling. And easiest way to say stop the Hollywood thinks it's dangerous when it's really not. Now, the real dangerous comment is saying that you like Trump. But the bloated parrot that is Depp reveals that all celebrities do is copy other celebrities. Act like Keith Richards, talk like Kathy Griffin, drink like Oliver Reid. Who is Johnny Depp, I don't even thing he knows. So, it's not the joke that is the real outrage. It's the banality of it. So how desperate must you be to say, you want to kill the President just for applause. Johnny Depp desperate. He wants so badly to be a rolling stone, but he's just rolling stoned. Jesse, he apologized, they always do. They always do."

If there's truly nothing there, who better than to have announced that Clinton affiliated folks? Because that will actually solidify it. So, President Trump is actually set himself up, so either way.

Remember in the 90s he was just all about dyeing his air pink and piercings and dressing up like a woman and putting lipstick on. You know, he is a narcissist. I think he goes over North Korea because it is the only place he gets VIP treatment since the 90s.
