Maria, there isn't anyone in the country, Republican or Democrat, who expected Bob Mueller, after everything you just related, two years of this, to come back and tell us that he wasn't able to reach a decision or a conclusion, especially when he was able to reach a decision on the most important aspect, whether or not anyone committed any crime by colluding with Russia. Bob Mueller put a stake in the heart of this collusion conspiracy narrative as it related to Donald Trump. He did exactly what a prosecutor is supposed to do. It's -- that's what's so surprising and puzzling about why he then went on for 200 more pages in his report and did exactly what a prosecutor isn't supposed to do, which is talk about potential crimes, potential conduct of someone that he has no intention of charging with anything. It doesn't make any sense. And to your point about that advisory OLC opinion that Bob Mueller used as the basis, I wish I could tell you that I agreed with his analysis. The idea and the explanation that he gave, that that OLC opinion stands for the proposition that you can investigate a sitting president, but not reach a decision or a conclusion about whether criminal activity occurred, is just absurd. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I wish I could tell you that it conjures up James Madison, but all I can think about is Billy Madison, the part of the movie where they say everyone in the room is now dumber for having listened to that explanation, because it makes no sense at all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It was on July 31 of 2016 that the FBI opened this counterintelligence investigation that related to the Trump campaign, Operation Crossfire Hurricane. It was opened by FBI agent Peter Strzok. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So it's interesting that, 18 days later, on August 17 of 2016, that the FBI and CIA conducting a counterintelligence briefing for the purpose of protecting and warning Donald Trump would put in charge of coordinating that briefing Peter Strzok, the same agent who was already investigating the Trump campaign, the same agent who eight days before that defensive briefing to protect and warn Donald Trump sent a text message saying he was going to stop him, and who two days before that defensive briefing sent a text message saying, we need an insurance policy against a Trump presidency. So little wonder that on that date of August 17, 2016, Donald Trump wasn't warned about Russian interference in his campaign. He wasn't briefed about the Steele dossier. He wasn't briefed about Carter Page. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Jim Comey came out this week, Maria, and said, well, we wouldn't have wanted to tip off anyone about that. The problem with that, Maria, is at the same time they weren't warning and protecting Donald Trump, they were warning his political adversaries. On August 25, CIA Director -- August 25, 2016, CIA Director John Brennan picked up the phone and called Democratic Minority Leader Harry Reid and briefed him on Russian interference into the Trump campaign, about the Steele dossier and about Carter Page. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

My successor picked him, notwithstanding that my successor was a Democrat, picked him to investigate the cases that he reopened, notwithstanding that they had been closed, on interrogation. And he did a thorough investigation, gave basically over a year of his life to it. And he also has a history of having investigated the FBI, when he was in Boston investigating the Whitey Bulger case, specifically the corrupt FBI agents who concealed the fact that innocent people had been convicted of murder, because they wanted to continue to use Whitey Bulger as an informant.

Straight ahead right here \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Vice President Mike Pence sitting down with me exclusively just hours before President Trump threatens to slap Mexico with new tariffs if it doesn't crack down on illegal immigrants pouring into our country. Also with me this morning, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, talking about immigration and why he's concerned Republican censorship on social media could play a role in 2020. And Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe is here -- he sits on the House Judiciary Committee -- on whether Robert Mueller will ever testify, what comes next, as the attorney general investigates the investigators. And as we await the inspector general's report expected to drop any day now, also Democrat Jeff Van Drew joining me, as House Democrats ramp up their investigations, why he says it's time to call off the dogs. Also, this morning, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey is here on how the current A.G. is being treated. All that and a lot more right now, right here, \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we are awaiting a report from the Department of Justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, investigating surveillance against the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. That is expected to arrive any day now. We will be all over it when it hits. This follows a week where we heard from Robert Mueller for the first time and perhaps the last time, the special counsel indicating he doesn't plan to testify before Congress. He also reiterated the findings of his report, which cleared the president of collusion, but didn't make a determination on obstruction. Mueller said charging the president with a crime wasn't an option under guidelines set by an opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Here's the Attorney General William Barr's reaction to that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, let me see. Robert Mueller -- you just heard that sound bite from William Barr. Robert Mueller said that he had a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants. The special counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing the use of pen registers, interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, and was given almost $40 million to complete the task. Should he have come up with the determination or a judgment on obstruction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Yes, Maria, I actually disagree with the Attorney General Barr when he says that Bob Mueller could have reached a decision. Bob Mueller should have reached a decision. Maria, there isn't anyone in the country, Republican or Democrat, who expected Bob Mueller, after everything you just related, two years of this, to come back and tell us that he wasn't able to reach a decision or a conclusion, especially when he was able to reach a decision on the most important aspect, whether or not anyone committed any crime by colluding with Russia. Bob Mueller put a stake in the heart of this collusion conspiracy narrative as it related to Donald Trump. He did exactly what a prosecutor is supposed to do. It's -- that's what's so surprising and puzzling about why he then went on for 200 more pages in his report and did exactly what a prosecutor isn't supposed to do, which is talk about potential crimes, potential conduct of someone that he has no intention of charging with anything. It doesn't make any sense. And to your point about that advisory OLC opinion that Bob Mueller used as the basis, I wish I could tell you that I agreed with his analysis. The idea and the explanation that he gave, that that OLC opinion stands for the proposition that you can investigate a sitting president, but not reach a decision or a conclusion about whether criminal activity occurred, is just absurd. I wish I could tell you that it conjures up James Madison, but all I can think about is Billy Madison, the part of the movie where they say everyone in the room is now dumber for having listened to that explanation, because it makes no sense at all."

And to just leave some crumbs around for Bob Mueller's friends in the media, as well as in the Democratic Party, well, it's actually stoking exactly what he intended, I guess. And that's impeachment conversation once again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's -- again, it's this idea that what Bob Mueller was supposed to do was investigate and then make a referral to Congress. It doesn't work that way, Maria. Members of Congress make criminal referrals to the Department of Justice because they have the ability to convene grand juries, issue subpoenas, conduct interviews, and make a determination whether or not conduct rose to criminal activity. It doesn't work the other way around. The Justice Department doesn't make referrals to Congress to decide on whether or not something criminal has happened."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it's exactly what Bill Barr said, actually. The A.G. said, we're not an adjunct to Congress. The Department of Justice is not an adjunct to Congress. Let me go back to a letter that you have been talking about very much that has to do with the intelligence assessment that then candidate Trump was given back in August of 2016. We have got the letter here to Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary then, back in October of 2017. Let's talk about this letter and why this letter is important, because we are looking at the letter from Gregory Brower. He's the assistant director of the Office of Congressional Affairs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Yes, Maria, that letter documents some really important and extraordinary events that were happening in August of 2016. Let me remind your viewers exactly what happened during that time frame. It was on July 31 of 2016 that the FBI opened this counterintelligence investigation that related to the Trump campaign, Operation Crossfire Hurricane. It was opened by FBI agent Peter Strzok. So it's interesting that, 18 days later, on August 17 of 2016, that the FBI and CIA conducting a counterintelligence briefing for the purpose of protecting and warning Donald Trump would put in charge of coordinating that briefing Peter Strzok, the same agent who was already investigating the Trump campaign, the same agent who eight days before that defensive briefing to protect and warn Donald Trump sent a text message saying he was going to stop him, and who two days before that defensive briefing sent a text message saying, we need an insurance policy against a Trump presidency. So little wonder that on that date of August 17, 2016, Donald Trump wasn't warned about Russian interference in his campaign. He wasn't briefed about the Steele dossier. He wasn't briefed about Carter Page. And Jim Comey came out this week, Maria, and said, well, we wouldn't have wanted to tip off anyone about that. The problem with that, Maria, is at the same time they weren't warning and protecting Donald Trump, they were warning his political adversaries. On August 25, CIA Director -- August 25, 2016, CIA Director John Brennan picked up the phone and called Democratic Minority Leader Harry Reid and briefed him on Russian interference into the Trump campaign, about the Steele dossier and about Carter Page."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So here we are, in August of '16. The president is candidate Trump. He's supposed to get this intel briefing. They tell him, oh, you have to be careful about China. You have to be careful about Russia. But they don't tell him, in fact, they are investigating him. They are investigating his campaign. And it's Peter Strzok who launched the investigation, who's also giving the intel briefing. Look, the president declassified some important documents last week . You wanted him to declassify this. Tell us what this means. And are we going to see accountability here? You mentioned John Brennan. I'm talking about John Brennan, Peter Strzok, Jim Comey. Will we see -- I mean, what will we see, prosecutions, indictments, what? Where's this going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Well, think about the irony of what we just talked about, Maria. The only reason Democrats are be able to talk about obstruction of justice as a possible basis for impeachment is because the people responsible for starting the obstruction investigation, Jim Comey, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, didn't do their damn job and warn Donald Trump. Had they warned Donald Trump, there wouldn't have been a Bob Mueller. We wouldn't be having a discussion about obstruction. So these documents that go to the origin that many of us, like Trey Gowdy and Devin Nunes and myself, have been asking to be declassified, the president did give that declassification authority to Bill Barr. One theory that I have as to why we have not yet seen those is because Bill Barr instead named a second special counsel, John Durham. And if I were a special prosecutor looking into these things, those documents and what I know they establish are things that I would want to use before a grand jury to determine whether or not indictments should be issued, whether not anyone's conduct as it related to the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation or the obstruction investigation..."

These questions were raised about election interference. And we know that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. We don't believe it affected the outcome in any way. But we have held them accountable for that. We have taken steps to ensure that that doesn't happen again. But there were other questions raised about collusion. Now, even the special counsel confirmed that there was no collusion between our campaign and the Russians. And the Department of Justice has confirmed that there was no collusion, no obstruction. The matter is entirely over. It's entirely closed. The American people got the answers. I -- and I couldn't be more proud, Maria, of the fact that, for more than two years, hundreds of witnesses, millions of pages of documents, full operation with the special counsel. This president and our office, and our entire administration fully cooperated. And the American people now know that the investigation is at an end. They have their answers. But what I think the country wants to see us do is focus on the things that are now most important to them. And that is jobs and security. We're -- we're in discussions right now about a budget agreement that will allow us to continue to make historic investments in our national defense. We have got a crisis on our southern border. You traveled there very recently. You saw it firsthand, as did your viewers on this program. I mean, we're on track to have more than a million apprehensions at our southern border. And yet -- and yet Congress, some in Congress continue to focus on investigations, baseless allegations, while -- while literally, last month alone, more than 118,000 people were apprehended at our southern border, and Congress continues to refuse to act to close the loopholes that are being used by cartels and drug traffickers to entice people to make the long and dangerous journey north to our southern border. The American people want to see a Congress focus where this president and our team are focused. And that is on their security, on securing our border, on closing loopholes, bringing about asylum reform, and advancing the kind of policies that will continue to create jobs in this booming economy."

President Trump has taken decisive action to call on Mexico to take further action to intervene in this massive flow of people that are coming north from Central America to our border to come into our country and take advantage of those loopholes. And the president's also going to continue to call on this Congress to pass the kind of commonsense reforms. Look, we have a humanitarian and a security crisis at our southern border. I mean, the drug cartels and human traffickers -- you heard it firsthand -- they are telling people in Guatemala and El Salvador and throughout Central America about loopholes in our laws, and that if they come up with a -- with a -- with children, that they will have the opportunity to come into our country. And that's just unacceptable. We ought -- this Congress ought to be willing to set politics completely aside, and, at minimum, bring about the kind of changes in our asylum laws that would fix this immediate problem overnight. We're building the wall. We're building hundreds of miles of wall over the next several years. The president's kept his promise in that regard. We're providing resources for Customs and Border Protection. But we have to close the loopholes in our law. And the action the president has taken and will continue to take are all designed to say that -- that Congress needs to step up and bring about the kind of reforms that will close these loopholes and end that magnet that drug cartels and human traffickers are using. And we will continue to call on Mexico and take actions necessary to see to it that Mexico does their job to ensure that this mass exodus and humanitarian crisis comes to an end."

And it all begins with President Trump with personal relationships. And I have witnessed it. That relationship people saw with Prime Minister Abe in high relief that now has us talking about a free trade agreement with Japan. The president will be traveling to the U.K. just in a few days. And you will see that relationship, writ large, as he visits with the queen and as we continue to talk to the E.U. about -- about the possibility of a free trade agreement, even as Brexit continues to work its way through for the U.K. But, with regard to China, I can attest firsthand that the president's forged a good relationship with President Xi. But we have our differences. And it's not just the structural or the -- it's not just the fact that China is half of our international trade deficit. It is those structural issues, intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers, the -- essentially, the respect for private property that, at this point, China has not reflected in their practices.

We have made great progress. But, as the president said last week, they started to step backwards. And so the president called it off. And we believe we're in a very strong position with the tariffs that we have imposed. We could more than double those against China. But president hopes for better.

And the United States is going to continue to stand with Canada until those Canadians are free and hopefully back home in Canada. But the whole issue of Huawei is -- it's an issue of national security. I mean, Huawei is, in effect, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chinese Communist Party. And to have Huawei operating as a 5G network in our country or in our allies' countries, we believe represents a fundamental compromise of our national security and the privacy of millions of citizens. So we're going to continue to communicate that message very strongly to our allies in Canada and all over the Western world. But we're also going to continue to promote alternatives for 5G networks. Look, this is the most dynamic, innovative economy in the history of the world. We know we can meet that global need for 5G with enterprises that respect our values, respect privacy and individual rights, intellectual property, and preserves our national security, and will continue to drive that."

Now, the circumstances will be different. We hope to enter into free trade agreement with the European Union. That's a different arrangement. But President Trump really believes, whether it be China or Japan or any other nation in the world, that, with just a couple of exceptions, the American worker and American jobs and the American economy are better served if we can enter into bilateral trading relationships. And then we're better able to hold our trading partners accountable to the promises that they've have made."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENCE",
      "utterance": "Well, first and foremost, let's recognize that the American economy is booming, 5.8 million new jobs, in the last quarter, 3.1 percent growth. More importantly, wages are rising at the fastest level in more than 10 years. And we have seen 500,000 manufacturing jobs created. And the president's done all that because he drove for tax cuts. He's been rolling back federal red tape. We have been unleashing American energy. But, also, a central pillar of President Trump's vision for this growing economy is the kind of free and fair and reciprocal trade that we have negotiated in the USMCA. And I think the American people see that. And they see that the president drove a hard bargain. We put American agriculture first, American workers first. And we're just taking that message, not just to Capitol Hill, but I have literally been traveling all across the country, carrying that message to farms, to factories. And we have every confidence that, as the American people let their voice be heard, that the USMCA will be approved by the Congress of the United States. But we're just determined to carry the message of what this will mean for jobs, for growth, for opportunity. And we think it's absolutely essential, just like they're doing here in Canada, that the Congress move on approving the USMCA, and approving the USMCA this summer."

But we have been talking to the rank and file as well and what the USMCA is going to mean in their districts. I think the American people know that trade means jobs. But when it comes to NAFTA, we saw lots of jobs head south of the border since the 1990s, when that was signed into law. The president took this issue before the American people, like many of his predecessors had. You know, it's -- it really is interesting. As I talked -- as I talked to some leaders here in Canada, they noted that many people who had been elected president in the past have been critical of NAFTA, but it was only President Donald Trump that stepped up, rolled his sleeves up, and renegotiated our trading relationship with Canada and Mexico. And we believe, as we carry that message forward to the rank-and-file Democrats, we carry it forward to the American people, that the Democratic leadership in the Congress -- and we know we have strong support of Republican leadership in the Senate -- will move this bill to the floor. And if it's put on the floor of the Congress, we know the USMCA will pass."

And we're in negotiations with Democrats in the House of Representatives to bring about some of the changes in the way that the USMCA will actually be unpacked for the American people and the economy, and those are ongoing. But when it comes to drug prices, I will tell you, you never met anybody more determined to lower drug prices for the American people than President Donald Trump. And we're so proud of the reforms the president has already advanced. We know it's going to -- it's going to result in a lowering of drug prices over the counter to the American people. And so, as we work through all the deals with USMCA, the American people can be confident this president is going to continue to fight to lower drug prices for them."

    {
      "speaker": "PENCE",
      "utterance": "Well, let's go back to what NAFTA did. There were elements of NAFTA that actually created an incentive for companies to build factories in Mexico and outside the United States. And what we have done in the USMCA, by creating a wage level that's commensurate with the American wage level, we're literally protecting American jobs. We're removing the incentive for companies to, in effect, go south of the border to chase lower wages. And that that's going to help American workers protect American jobs, but also it's also going to, we believe, bring wages up in our neighbors to the south. I mean, the simple fact is that, in my home state of Indiana, we literally saw almost entire communities hollowed out as you saw factories closed, automotive factories close, and go south of the border. Those incentives are out of the USMCA. It's a huge win for American workers and American jobs."

If you want to buy a domestic airline flight inside China, it's a score whether you cannot. There's a report of a reporter that tried to buy a ticket. He was denied because of what he said on Twitter. They told him he should apologize. He apologized, and they said that wasn't in -- that was insincere of how you apologized.

They now have a monopoly where 90 percent of all searches go through Google. In 2013, the FTC actually looked at this. They found that their behavior, the way they treated other companies was wrong, the way they abused their monopoly power. And they were supposed to correct themselves, even though staff wanted to go further.

My successor picked him, notwithstanding that my successor was a Democrat, picked him to investigate the cases that he reopened, notwithstanding that they had been closed, on interrogation. And he did a thorough investigation, gave basically over a year of his life to it. And he also has a history of having investigated the FBI, when he was in Boston investigating the Whitey Bulger case, specifically the corrupt FBI agents who concealed the fact that innocent people had been convicted of murder, because they wanted to continue to use Whitey Bulger as an informant.
