But, again, this isn't official until a few minutes after the trading day. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's run down where we stand right now. The Dow just coming up a little short of the gain it would have to have to have a 10th straight winning week. And I mean by just a few points. That's why it's not quite official yesterday. The S&P 500 also missing by a mark. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have the NASDAQ that did have an appreciable advance today, enough to garner 10 straight wins of its own. But, again, it is the Dow that is in doubt. Had it scored another weekly gain, it would have been 10. It would have been the strongest since 1995. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We would still have to go back to the Clinton administration to see a streak like this. Again, it's not official just yet, but it does look we came up a little bit shy. The Dow, the S&P 500 both on track for a 12 percent gain this year, the NASDAQ about a 14.5 percent gain, one of the fastest starts we have had to a new year in decades. Usually, how the first two months go of the year, the other 10 months tend to follow, 91 percent of the time, in case you're keeping track. So, we will keep an eye on that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also keeping an eye on the president and what he had to say about Michael Cohen's testimony. He says totally discredited. Now Democrats are targeting president's finances, and they're promising more witnesses and a lot more digging. So should the president be worrying? We're on that in just a moment.

And he spent part of this morning taking to Twitter to absolutely slam his former personal attorney Michael Cohen. Among the five tweets that President Trump sent out this morning, he reacted to a report that Cohen had been shopping a book that would have portrayed the president positively. One of the tweets here -- quote -- \"Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen's new book given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony, like a different person. He is totally discredited.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That from the president. Meantime, here at the White House today, they are having to defend comments from the president's press conference on Thursday in Vietnam. After meeting with Kim Jong-un, the president said he doesn't believe the North Korean dictator knew at the time about the treatment of Otto Warmbier. The 22-year-old college student was detained in North Korea for nearly 18 months. He was released back to the U.S. in June of 2017, but died a handful of days later, as doctors said he was unresponsive and suffered from brain damage. Warmbier's family released a statement today, taking issue with the president's comments. This is what they said in full -- quote -- \"We have been respectful during the summit process. Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The White House, though, is not backing off the president's initial comments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I do want to highlight that the Nasdaq got there, 10 straight weeks, and if you look at the S&P 500, five weeks. So to your point, Neil, there is certainly momentum. One of the things that really hurt the Dow -- and it was earlier on in the session -- the Atlanta Fed, according to its modeling, said U.S. GDP for the first quarter would only hit 0.3 percent. And that's where our viewers can see on the screen clearly the low point of the day. That hurt sentiment. But there's a lot of enthusiasm for some companies that aren't even yet public. Lyft, I'm thinking of that. That will be listing on the Nasdaq, LYFT, not too imaginative there with the ticker, but there you have it, as early possibly as April. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But I think one of the larger outstanding questions, Neil, this company, as we learned today through the paperwork, made in sales $2.2 billion last year, but it still has problems with earnings. So it has sales, but no earnings. Uber is the same. So a big question for both of these companies going forward is whether or not investors will show enthusiasm for that kind of balance sheet. I want to highlight Tesla. The stock fell. Model 3 car, just sort of saying, OK, it'll be available for $35,000. As one analyst said, this was the un-iPhone moment, essentially. A lot of analysts and even traders that I was speaking with here felt like Elon Musk really hyped this announcement. And then when it came out it was kind of like, huh, OK. Store closures as well. Musk saying that Tesla is closing most of its stores and laying off retail workers to make it financially possible to hit that $35,000-per-vehicle target, which the company has clearly been struggling with for a while. I want to leave you on a retail story as well. Gap separating from Old Navy. And there are so many analysts who are saying, this should have happened years ago. Old Navy is a brand that really resonates with people in its discounting, in its branding. And Old Navy's stand-alone brand last year had sales of $8 billion. So, Gap -- if you add up Gap and all of its brands, made about $9 billion. So, I mean, they're pretty much equal weight as far as the sales that they're doing. And a lot of people saying that Old Navy was shackled and weighed down by Gap's kind of old world problems, which were decreasing mall traffic and a decrease of traffic in brick and mortar stores. So those are some of the stories we were following all day here, Neil -- in the meantime, back to you in the studio. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And then off those -- the distribution network of the food is the military. And you have layers upon layers of corruption.

Number two, he wasn't in Prague, which undermines the premise -- one of the main premise of the Steele dossier. So if you want to believe him, as the Democrats would have you, then you have to believe all of those other points, which is, there are no collusions. And now the Democrats have almost forgotten to talk about Russia anymore. And now they want to talk about the Trump business, the Trump personal thing. You -- they have almost -- remember, it was almost like, OK, forget about all the Russia stuff. Now we're going to move on to the personal finances, some of the associations they have had. But this all stemmed from this premise of Russia collusion. And once now that they found out -- they have gotten three entities, the House, the Senate, and their star witness, Michael Cohen, have all said there was no collusion. So they quietly just moved on to a fishing expedition about the president's personal finances, his associations, his business, et cetera.",

But, again, this isn't official until a few minutes after the trading day. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. Let's run down where we stand right now. The Dow just coming up a little short of the gain it would have to have to have a 10th straight winning week. And I mean by just a few points. That's why it's not quite official yesterday. The S&P 500 also missing by a mark. We have the NASDAQ that did have an appreciable advance today, enough to garner 10 straight wins of its own. But, again, it is the Dow that is in doubt. Had it scored another weekly gain, it would have been 10. It would have been the strongest since 1995. We would still have to go back to the Clinton administration to see a streak like this. Again, it's not official just yet, but it does look we came up a little bit shy. The Dow, the S&P 500 both on track for a 12 percent gain this year, the NASDAQ about a 14.5 percent gain, one of the fastest starts we have had to a new year in decades. Usually, how the first two months go of the year, the other 10 months tend to follow, 91 percent of the time, in case you're keeping track. So, we will keep an eye on that. Also keeping an eye on the president and what he had to say about Michael Cohen's testimony. He says totally discredited. Now Democrats are targeting president's finances, and they're promising more witnesses and a lot more digging. So should the president be worrying? We're on that in just a moment.

And he spent part of this morning taking to Twitter to absolutely slam his former personal attorney Michael Cohen. Among the five tweets that President Trump sent out this morning, he reacted to a report that Cohen had been shopping a book that would have portrayed the president positively. One of the tweets here -- quote -- \"Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen's new book given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony, like a different person. He is totally discredited.\" That from the president. Meantime, here at the White House today, they are having to defend comments from the president's press conference on Thursday in Vietnam. After meeting with Kim Jong-un, the president said he doesn't believe the North Korean dictator knew at the time about the treatment of Otto Warmbier. The 22-year-old college student was detained in North Korea for nearly 18 months. He was released back to the U.S. in June of 2017, but died a handful of days later, as doctors said he was unresponsive and suffered from brain damage. Warmbier's family released a statement today, taking issue with the president's comments. This is what they said in full -- quote -- \"We have been respectful during the summit process. Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.\" The White House, though, is not backing off the president's initial comments."

That's where I think they're -- they're going. But it gets back to this one point that I think most legal scholars agree with me on, is how do you indict a sitting president, especially for things that happened perhaps years and years before he ever even campaigned for office? Even Mr. Cohen claiming that it was his idea that he run for office. So there's so much going on. And Mr. Cohen himself is discredited. And that's the president's term.

We don't really know what's going on in the Southern District of New York either, except for they're -- they're trying to widen this net, which I find really intriguing, that they're widening the net to basically the president's family and anybody that was in his circle.

As we told you at the outset, we came close, but we weren't able to close and make it 10 straight weeks of advances for the Dow Jones industrials, nevertheless, the fastest start to a new year in the better part of 20 years, and some say, depending on the average, 30-plus years. Let's go to Deirdre Bolton, who has been crunching the numbers. Hey, Deirdre."

      "utterance": "Yes, hey, Neil. So, so close, five points for the Dow to make it, but, OK, we didn't get there. I do want to highlight that the Nasdaq got there, 10 straight weeks, and if you look at the S&P 500, five weeks. So to your point, Neil, there is certainly momentum. One of the things that really hurt the Dow -- and it was earlier on in the session -- the Atlanta Fed, according to its modeling, said U.S. GDP for the first quarter would only hit 0.3 percent. And that's where our viewers can see on the screen clearly the low point of the day. That hurt sentiment. But there's a lot of enthusiasm for some companies that aren't even yet public. Lyft, I'm thinking of that. That will be listing on the Nasdaq, LYFT, not too imaginative there with the ticker, but there you have it, as early possibly as April. But I think one of the larger outstanding questions, Neil, this company, as we learned today through the paperwork, made in sales $2.2 billion last year, but it still has problems with earnings. So it has sales, but no earnings. Uber is the same. So a big question for both of these companies going forward is whether or not investors will show enthusiasm for that kind of balance sheet. I want to highlight Tesla. The stock fell. Model 3 car, just sort of saying, OK, it'll be available for $35,000. As one analyst said, this was the un-iPhone moment, essentially. A lot of analysts and even traders that I was speaking with here felt like Elon Musk really hyped this announcement. And then when it came out it was kind of like, huh, OK. Store closures as well. Musk saying that Tesla is closing most of its stores and laying off retail workers to make it financially possible to hit that $35,000-per-vehicle target, which the company has clearly been struggling with for a while. I want to leave you on a retail story as well. Gap separating from Old Navy. And there are so many analysts who are saying, this should have happened years ago. Old Navy is a brand that really resonates with people in its discounting, in its branding. And Old Navy's stand-alone brand last year had sales of $8 billion. So, Gap -- if you add up Gap and all of its brands, made about $9 billion. So, I mean, they're pretty much equal weight as far as the sales that they're doing. And a lot of people saying that Old Navy was shackled and weighed down by Gap's kind of old world problems, which were decreasing mall traffic and a decrease of traffic in brick and mortar stores. So those are some of the stories we were following all day here, Neil -- in the meantime, back to you in the studio."

But they wouldn't go on the record. None of the lawmakers we talked to at Politico were willing to stand up to her. And that's because they are afraid that her activist,s her army of Twitter followers -- she has over three million Twitter followers -- are going to come after her. And they are certainly afraid of being primaried from the Justice Democrats, which is the group that helped her come to victory in last year's midterms."

And for red state Democrats such as myself, gun rights are very important. Economic rights are very important. We don't have the same set of issues and same set of values as somebody who is from a district in New York. So I think if she stays in her lane, works on motivating those young people, that base, and doesn't interfere and damage Democrats in other districts, we have a great chance in 2020 to take back the Senate and also take back the White House. But as long as what we're doing is civil war and fracturing, then we're going to be looking at eight to 12 more years of Trump and then Trump Jr. and whoever else is after that.

They were saying vote for this Green New Deal, whatever, and she was trying to remind them, well, there has to be some balance here to get stuck through. Obviously, the message that Cortez had afterwards was, you have had 30 years to do something on this and you haven't. But even Dick Durbin, I think a slightly left-of-center senator, was saying the same thing, like be careful with this approach. Is she risking or damaging the party?"

And, look, I think this whole situation is just a really good early preview of the tensions that we are going to see, especially in the House, as the majority tries to tackle issues like climate change, Medicare for all. But what you are seeing is that Speaker Nancy Pelosi is actually looking out for her moderates. It's pretty quietly being done. But she is not moving ahead full-steam with the Green New Deal. She's been sort of dismissive of it. She's not allowing every committee to have hearings on Medicare -- Medicare for all. She didn't agree to back off of the -- she did agree to allow the ICE funding for detention beds in the spending deal. So there are signs that Nancy Pelosi is looking out for those moderates, and not necessarily going full steam ahead with some of these progressive priorities."

Juan Guaido, the opposition leader, is in Paraguay today. He was in Brazil yesterday, Colombia before that. He's going to Ecuador. He's going Argentina. The question is, when is he going to come back here to Venezuela? The Maduro government had put a travel ban on him. He disobeyed that ban. So if and how he comes back, he might be facing arrest. It's not clear which side that arrest would benefit, but Guaido said he's going to be back by Monday. He said he's going to start carrying out the duties of president. It's not clear at all how he's going to do that, with Maduro still in control of the military and the police. As far as sanctions going, they are really starting to hit hard here in Venezuela. The U.S. has oil sanctions against Venezuela, no longer buying any of Venezuela's oil. So their exports have declined 40 percent in the last month. That's the key source of cash for this Maduro regime. It is hitting the regime hard. And we could see the effects trickle down to the streets in the coming days ahead -- Neil, back to you."

And they said that they're going to try to.' Now, what had happened was, he got a -- he did get an extension of his authorization to leave the country. So the National Assembly doesn't recognize the order of him to stay in the country, because we don't recognize Maduro is president. So whatever he says is null and void. However, he had only permission to leave the country for five days. And that ran out on the 27th. But, on the 27th, they extended his permission to be outside the country, following the constitution, so that he can carry out this regional tour for support, which will also help to protect him. So now we think he will not be arrested."

      "speaker": "NEUMANN",
      "utterance": "Yes, of course they will take whatever they can get. So, the reason why you had the humanitarian blockade from Maduro, while it instilled such panic in the regime, is not because of military intervention at all. It's because it's a loss of control, and it's a loss of funding. So they have set up this paternalistic system, where they will keep you as a beggar to the Maduro regime, because you have sort of an oath to fealty to get your box of food, literally slavery. And then off those -- the distribution network of the food is the military. And you have layers upon layers of corruption. So, 70 percent of the value of what the government is paying for that box of food, which the boxes are assembled in Mexico, actually comes -- it actually goes to fund the military. So it's a loss of control in two ways. And so that's why they don't want the -- they don't want the humanitarian aid. And that's been going on for a while, but I think that will become more difficult now."

Because Mike Gianaris told me personally he just wasn't going to call them like right after the thing happened. I knew -- these people had predetermined their views on this without negotiating. I have never heard of a business deal that has happened without a negotiation. I have -- if Mike and Jimmy in our district had talked with Amazon, and have real disagreements with them, then we would have a whole different story here. But they didn't.

The president's basis with him through thick and thin. And I think going to CPAC will be an opportunity for him, much like he did at the State of the Union, but much more on issues that are important conservatives, reaffirm the accomplishments that he's been able to do over the last two years, and get those guys fired up heading into a crucial election year. So, this is an opportunity for the president to really fire up those folks, get them reenergized, make sure that they understand the litany of things that he's been able to accomplish. I think the vice president did a really good job of laying that out today, kind of being the warmup act for the president. I know that he wouldn't take offense to that, because he's been a phenomenal, loyal and effective vice president to President Trump."

They challenged his reliability. And all that's fine. But they were surprised that, on the remarks themselves, not much. What did you make of that?"

I mean, it's hard to go back and forth. Michael Cohen was bringing up experiences and instances that he's had over a decade there."

    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "So, you can't say you weren't -- they weren't there. So it's hard to challenge them and say, well, that couldn't have happened. They weren't there. Michael Cohen was. And I think what they sought to do was really to remind people that he was a convicted liar that had sought to win favor with the president, that wanted to go to the administration, that was always with him, his loyal supporter and defender, until he got caught. And then suddenly he's looking for redemption amongst the liberals. So I - - look, I get the criticism, but I think they played this thing right, which was to try to figure out, how do you make sure that people understand the lines here? Democrats have -- I think one of the things that also got lost, Neil, yesterday in the Cohen testimony was, this whole thing all stemmed from these allegations of collusion with Russia, right? So you have had the House committee come out and say that there was no collusion. The Senate committee that everyone said, well, that's bipartisan, that's come out and say, nothing. And then Cohen, this convicted liar that the Democrats put forward, they what -- they want everyone to believe him. Well, if you're going to believe him, then believe what he said about Russia, which is, there was no collusion, number one. Number two, he wasn't in Prague, which undermines the premise -- one of the main premise of the Steele dossier. So if you want to believe him, as the Democrats would have you, then you have to believe all of those other points, which is, there are no collusions. And now the Democrats have almost forgotten to talk about Russia anymore. And now they want to talk about the Trump business, the Trump personal thing. You -- they have almost -- remember, it was almost like, OK, forget about all the Russia stuff. Now we're going to move on to the personal finances, some of the associations they have had. But this all stemmed from this premise of Russia collusion. And once now that they found out -- they have gotten three entities, the House, the Senate, and their star witness, Michael Cohen, have all said there was no collusion. So they quietly just moved on to a fishing expedition about the president's personal finances, his associations, his business, et cetera."

So we did have the nominees for the board approved by shareholders today, overwhelmingly, and that includes Tim Cook himself, Bob Iger of Disney, and also Al Gore as well. And Apple talking about the new initiatives for 2019, what they're going to focus on in order to get that stock price back up. And they talked about Apple Pay once again, also services expected to double by the year 2020. And then we also have wearables as well, with watch sales up some 50 percent last year.
