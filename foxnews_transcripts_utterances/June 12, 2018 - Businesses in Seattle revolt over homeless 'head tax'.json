Well, he was fired in March, remember for leaking information improperly to the media and then more importantly perhaps lying to investigators about it. That's the allegation. So why is he suing now? Well, number one, there have been reports that James Comey, his former boss, the top guy of course at the FBI, has been called in to talk to a U.S. attorney in Washington because they are considering criminal charges against Andrew McCabe about lying to investigators. They are trying to square his stories with James Comey's, so both McCabe and Comey under the microscope but then the other big thing you mentioned I'm here in Singapore, White House was obviously focused before the president a few hours ago he got on Air Force One on all this diplomacy with North Korea. But they were also I can tell you from talking to senior officials looking very closely at what's happening in Washington on Thursday, which is that this finally, finally we are going to see this inspector general report from the Justice Department. There are reports out saying that it's going to be devastating for Andrew McCabe and James Comey because this is the report that's looking at their conduct in terms of the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's e-mail server. So we've been talking with us for weeks, for months. This report is going to be devastating. People are wondering where is it.

The environmental regulations, the zoning regulations, it's their own policies that contribute to homelessness. And so the idea of slapping a tax on Amazon can solve the problems. It's ridiculous.

I think it's something maybe Kim Jong-un mentioned about it being provocative that we fly nuclear bombers up to the almost at a border of North Korea. And any senses that, that is an act of aggression in the sense despite the fact of all of his acts of aggression, and that his regime has done for years. So, here's what I think if you listen to what the president said, it's conditions-based. The major exercise that's upcoming is spring of 2019. Martha, we are going to know, by the end of this year if these guys are really serious about denuclearization. And starting up that exercise again, and starting up sanctions again, and started -- and beginning cyber offensive operations at North Korean regime, all of those are things that are on the table if they're not serious."

When you get around to that point next spring if things aren't going the way that you like. I want to play something interesting for you that the White House put out. This is the video that was put together by the administration to play for Kim Jong-un, and it's interesting to play this video with the fact in mind that Kim Jong-un's father was a big film buff, and very involved in the film industry such as it is in North Korea. And in making these kinds of trailers, so perhaps, that was the reason behind trying to reach him this way. Let's play a little bit of it."

They started in this administration with the leaders meeting. Not any of the substance being worked out, but with the leader meeting to try and get some momentum. We started at the bottom working through all this substance and worked our way up to Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Zarif, but what I think is instructive about the Iran. Example, Donald Trump pulled out of that deal because he claimed that the nuclear pieces of it, inspections, verification, monitoring, timeframes, that those were not strong enough. So, in effect, he has set a bar for himself. He has to cross that bar on every single one of those issues he talked about on the Iran deal if he's to get something done with North Korea. And those are pretty high bars, and we'll see if he can do that but he has set a standard for himself that is extremely high, particularly, in a country like North Korea that already has nuclear weapons."

They tried to set up a meeting and it never happened. But I agree with Marie, on her assessment that President Trump has set a high bar. I think he strengthened his position going into these negotiations by pulling out of the Iran deal because he's six -- he set an expectation for Kim Jong-un of what was unacceptable in a deal. So, now it's all you know we have a floor of what's -- where -- of what is acceptable going, and this deal. A lot of people who are criticizing where would the agreement so, and so, that we've -- there is no agreement, it's a communique. The two met -- two leaders met, they had a statement about what they discussed, and what they -- what they agreed on. That's not the final -- the final agreement. But Marie is 100 percent right that they get a President Trump. What was his critique of the of the Iran deal? There was weak verification, the sanction -- the money was front-loaded, planes of cash going to -- going to Iran."

Donald Trump and President Trump has connected with the people in a way that you know, just previously these other people haven't undone. And then these liberals and Democrats have tried to connect with Hollywood, they try to do these things and I they're just out of touch. And the problem is Donald Trump is communicating with people.

They say they are optimistic that they will be able to find a path forward to avoid this discharge petition, but as of now, there is still no deal and the time is really running out. Now a discharge petition is a fairly obscure, a relatively rare legislative maneuver. It's being put forward by about two dozen moderate Republicans, moderate Republicans like Congressman Carlos Cabello and Jeff Denham who are trying to force a vote on DACA. They want to find a permanent fix for the DREAMers now. They don't want to have to wait for a big comprehensive immigration bill. That's one side. Then the other side, you have conservatives and the House leadership including House Speaker Paul Ryan and House majority whip Steve Scalise. They do not want a vote on DACA because they say the bill does not include certain enforcement measures that President Trump wants to secure the border. I think it would be devastating at something like the DREAM act passed because number one it actually threatens national security. It does not secure the border. What we want to do is get a real agreement that secures the border."

It would also, as you said, Martha, it would be a huge embarrassment for the House leadership, especially Speaker Paul Ryan.

Not only the two pillars which I support, border security and a permanent fix for DREAMers, but a four-pillar solution.

We had a two hour conference last week. We've been continuing to have these negotiations and meetings, but ultimately we got to have something that is willing to come to the floor.

What is he saying? Well, he is saying that he was unfairly fired. We know that already from March but that he has been wanting to get documents from the Justice Department, from the FBI to explain more about his firing. Well, he was fired in March, remember for leaking information improperly to the media and then more importantly perhaps lying to investigators about it. That's the allegation. So why is he suing now? Well, number one, there have been reports that James Comey, his former boss, the top guy of course at the FBI, has been called in to talk to a U.S. attorney in Washington because they are considering criminal charges against Andrew McCabe about lying to investigators. They are trying to square his stories with James Comey's, so both McCabe and Comey under the microscope but then the other big thing you mentioned I'm here in Singapore, White House was obviously focused before the president a few hours ago he got on Air Force One on all this diplomacy with North Korea. But they were also I can tell you from talking to senior officials looking very closely at what's happening in Washington on Thursday, which is that this finally, finally we are going to see this inspector general report from the Justice Department. There are reports out saying that it's going to be devastating for Andrew McCabe and James Comey because this is the report that's looking at their conduct in terms of the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's e-mail server. So we've been talking with us for weeks, for months. This report is going to be devastating. People are wondering where is it. It's finally coming out Thursday, so interesting that Andrew McCabe about to take it again pretty hard on that report, already facing potential criminal charges, already fired from the FBI in March, is now trying to get ahead may be of this I.G. report and trying to get his side of the story."

The president and others going after him because he oversees Robert Mueller. He oversees the documents at the Justice Department there since Jeff Sessions has been recused and hamstrung, if you will. He's the one overseeing those documents that Devin Nunes and other top Republicans want to see about whether there was a spy embedded in the Trump campaign or not. All of that, and you are right, from our reporting it seems that Rod Rosenstein under pressure to turn over documents has warned Kash Patel, one of the senior aides to Devin Nunes and others, you know what, we're going to will subpoena your e-mails. We're going to try to get some documents from you. And Devin Nunes and others have been put off by this saying, look, we are trying to do legitimate oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department and you were basically threatening us and coming after us and making a mockery of the oversight process."

Your thoughts on the suit that was just brought by Andrew McCabe against DOJ and FBI in his firing?"

      "utterance": "Well, I'm surprised it took so long. Of course he was right to bring the lawsuit. No one is above the law, but no one is beneath the law. He's entitled to see the documentation that resulted in his reputation being destroyed. He is entitled to see what evidence they really have against him. He's entitled to challenge the report of the inspector general. He's entitled to due process just like everyone else is entitled to due process. You know, in a hyper-partisan age in which we live, people want to get due process only to people who are on their side and not people on the other side. I don't care about sides. I only care about due process and the Constitution. And he's entitled to a matter of due process to see the evidence against him, to confront witnesses against him and to be treated fairly."

You know, in terms of this other Rod Rosenstein issue that Ed and I were just discussing, and the fact that he appears to be bullying the leadership on that House intel committee and threatening them with subpoenas themselves or he would like them to produce their e- mails and their evidence and their communications, what do you think about that, Alan?"

      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",

The legislature has the power, obviously, to oversee and investigate the executive branch, and a member of the executive branch, which Rod Rosenstein is, shouldn't be able to bully the legislative branch. He should be transparent. He should turn over the documents. He should be cooperative and Congress should be cooperative with the executive branch. You know, we have so much dispute today, partisan dispute. Dispute between the legislature and the executive branch. You know, they are all Republicans. They shouldn't be fighting with each other. It's one thing when you have the House under the control of the Democrats, which may have been the end of this year, or the Senate in control of the other party. But here we have everybody--"

Weeks after the city passed what is called a head tax, the city council now saying never mind after Amazon threatened to leave the city. The bill would have forced businesses that pull in over $20 million to pay $275 per employee. For Amazon, the city's largest employer, that would have been more than $12 million a year, but smaller businesses with tighter margins would have felt it even more. Here now Bill Bennett, the host of the Bill Bennett podcast and a Fox News contributor, and Steve Hilton, host of The Next Revolution here on FNC. Bill, you take the first crack at this, what do you make of it?"

Can you imagine how bad things must be for Amazon and Starbucks to threaten to leave Seattle? I mean, talk about a mother ship, a liberal community, but there they were. Boy, they flexed their business muscle, reminded people that they are a business and boy, the city council turned around on a dime."

I love this quote from the Amazon vice president and spokesman Drew Herdener who said the city does not have a revenue problem; it has a spending efficiency problem. Now that pretty much says it all, doesn't it, Steve?"

      "utterance": "I think that's right, and I think that frankly nobody comes out of this well. What a ridiculous way of trying to solve the problem of homelessness with this stupid tax. The reason that you got this homeless problem is because of their stupid policies that make housing so expensive, the regulations that make it so expensive to build a house. The environmental regulations, the zoning regulations, it's their own policies that contribute to homelessness. And so the idea of slapping a tax on Amazon can solve the problems. It's ridiculous. But frankly, I don't really like the way that these big corporations bully their way around elected governments and say look, you may want to tax us but we decide what taxes we pay, not you. So I think everyone comes out of this bad."

This is chicken shaming. Poor Jack Dorsey, the Twitter and Square CEO took a picture of this cash back program that he got at Chick- Fil-A and boy, did he get pounced on because the CEO of Chick-Fil-A in the past has said that he is not in favor of same-sex marriage, so then Soledad O'Brien jumped in and said this is an interesting company to boost during pride month at Jack. Jack quickly came back and said of O'Brien's tweet, you know, I'm so sorry, I complete -- you're right. I completely forgot about their background. Bill."

It tells you about the same time the bullying aspect that Steve referred to, but also how they can be intimidated by forces of political correctness. This craven behavior is really shameful."

This was from the Dalai Lama. He re-tweeted the Dalai Lama. Remember that Dalami Lama not that long ago said this about gay marriage, which is the reason for the frosted Chick-Fil-A. They, he's talking about his California followers, want me to condone homosexuality. But I am a Buddhist. And for Buddhist the relationship between two men is wrong. More recently, he said people who have belief or have special traditions then you should follow according to your tradition.
