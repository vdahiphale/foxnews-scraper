The second one, he said I just went there to get my property. It wasn't his property. And the California courts didn't say it was his property.

You cannot force out a special counsel without having huge political consequences, and the president's agenda for the balance of the year and, potentially, the 2018 midterm election would be out the window if he were to follow that.",

      "utterance": "Well, good evening, Martha. Here we're at Lovelock Prison, beautiful Lovelock Prison. And this morning, when we watched O.J. Simpson, I was a little shocked; not that he got parole. I figured he would get parole. But I was shocked at the way he actually -- at times, even argued with the parole board about the very issues he was here. This was an aggravated assault section of his parole, which is a use of the weapons. He argued that he didn't even know there was a weapon. And conveniently, I was actually talking to the very detective that filed these cases, and he said he not only knew they had weapons, he told them to bring weapons -- that's lie one."

      "speaker": "The second one, he said I just went there to get my property. It wasn't his property. And the California courts didn't say it was his property.

There were moments when one of the parole members was asking him: did you take the class that you promised us you would take? He said, no. Did you take the alcohol counseling that you promised us that you would take? He said, no. You know, and he did not really show remorse. He gave, you know, the old, I'm sorry that this happened but it wasn't my fault excuse, essentially. So, you know, it appears that they did walk into that room feeling that this was a done deal, Mark."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FUHRMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, let's call it what it is. I think the fix was in. They wanted to get rid of Mr. Simpson. They were going to parole him. Nothing he said would probably make any difference. That sounds a little harsh, but I that's the reality. And I think you're right, Martha, everything that he did. I've been to a few parole hearings. I've violated a few people's parole. I've been in these hearings. And what he said about those weapons, the very reason that they're talking about parole would've kept him in prison. And the parole hearings had been off it. Somehow, he got out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You were on the scene at Bundy, quickly after the horrific murders that took place there, Mark. What goes through your mind when you hear him say the words today, \"I would never, ever pull a weapon on anybody\"?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FUHRMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, you're seeing a classic sociopath, a narcissist, maybe even a psychopath. And he's talking; manipulating the crowd. He was doing exactly what he tried to do in the civil trial, but in this instance, there was no cross examination where he had an opponent that would actually break down what he was trying to say. That's what got him convicted in the civil trial. That, and there was evidence that was never brought forth in the criminal trial. But when I watched this, and I think of what he's saying, I think of one thing: he cut the mother of his children's -- the mother's throat of his children almost through all the way to cut her head off while they were sleeping upstairs in the residence. So that -- that, to me, it just boggles my mind how a man can actually live with that."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And he also said, you know, I've never hurt anybody. I'm not a guy that gets into conflict. I've led a conflict free life. You know, we played at the beginning of this, Mark, you heard it. That frightening phone call from Nicole Brown Simpson, saying he's coming back again, you know him. You know his record. I mean, how he can stand there and say that he's never had any conflict with that on his record? It's astonishing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FUHRMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it is. And when you look at -- we heard one call. There was a dozen. I was at one where he took a baseball bat and took out her windshield of her Mercedes, and she was bawling uncontrollably sitting with her car. I mean, I saw Simpson when he had that crazy look in his eyes, and then when he calmed down. Well, he did that a dozen times. And how many times did the police not get called? I mean, that's the issue. And yes, he's a violent man. And I doubt if he'll be able to make five years of parole."

    {
      "speaker": "GALANTER",
      "utterance": "I thought that it was typical O.J. Simpson. I mean, it was O.J., being O.J. It was O.J. being a little remorseful, little contrite, little apologetic, but yet shifting the blame to others, dissecting the crime, the parts that he didn't feel he's responsible for. I thought that, really, the two stars of the show, I was very impressed with Arnelle's testimony and Bruce Fromong's testimony. I don't think I've ever seen a victim in over 35 years step up to the plate the way Bruce Fromong did, and go to that for O.J.'s release. And I also just want to add that I agree with Mark, that I think this was a fait accompli. I think before the parole commissioners got into the room, they'd done his point totals, assessed his disciplinary record, assessed his age, his danger to the community, and he was going to be granted parole unless something totally, totally went south. It clearly didn't."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "GALANTER",
      "utterance": "It really takes your breath away. I mean, if somebody who looks in the mirror and doesn't see what the rest of the world sees; it's almost as if O.J. doesn't know he's O.J. And with the tapes in the reports and the analysis, it's just like it goes right over his head. So, I don't know whether its narcissism, or it's a sociopath, or it's just, you know, putting your head in the sand or being in complete denial."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But O.J. Simpson and you could see this with his testimony today -- in other words, if I was his lawyer, Martha, I would have told him three things",
      "utterance": "be remorseful, be contrite, and be apologetic. So, every other word that should've come up out of his mouth were, I'm sorry for what I've done, I accept total responsibility for what I've done, I've had nine years to reflect on what I've done, and I promise you it will never happen again. That did not happen."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALANTER",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the issue, you know. Everyone's talking about him being free. He's not. He's on something called legal restraint. Parole is not going to be easy for him. It's almost like a dog on a leash. And I don't say that in a bad way, but he's going to have a parole officer who's going to tell him what he can do and what he can't do, and if he doesn't follow, he's going to be back in prison."

Today's ruling that will set O.J. Simpson free on October 1; revolves around a bungled decade-old robbery. But 22 years ago, O.J. Simpson's defense team took what many saw as a cut and drives murder case, and essentially an indictment of race relations in America. And one that saw that team put the LAPD on trial, essentially, joining me now the lead detective in O.J.'s murder investigation, Tom Lange.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANGE",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, to begin with, this guy belongs in prison for the rest of his natural life -- that's the first thing -- but not for a robbery. And frankly, I'm surprised that he even did nine years. That was kind of a low-leveled robbery; nobody got hurt, nobody got shot. He thinks it's his own property -- this type of thing. But it's just another chapter in this psychopath's -- sociopath type of individual in his career. I think we haven't seen the last of the guy and he's going to continue as soon as he gets out."

They're turning us into something that is more about the credibility of you and your team, than whether or not O.J. Simpson killed these individuals."

And as I'm sitting there, and I was being crossed-examined by Johnny Cochran, I would just look over at the jury and address them from time to time. They were only a few feet away. And as Cochran is laying out all of this nonsense about where I live, and what cops do, and if it doesn't fit, and all of a sudden of nonsense he went writing like crazy, yet when I'm on direct with Marsha, who's just sitting there glaring at me.

You go all the way back to his time at F.C. when there were complaints against him for abusing a couple of girls back then, all the way through his marriage. His whole life has been a conflict. He's in total denial because he's a sociopath. When something negative happens, it's all about them. It's not about me. I don't get involved in those types of things. But yes, you do. He's his own worst enemy in that regard."

He's been down now for nine years, so he's getting ready to get out, and he's getting out doing what he wants. There's just narcissism within him. He's not going to let something like parole hold him up. If he wants to get involved in something one way or the other, he's going to do it. I don't think we've seen the last of guy."

Really, the only thing they considered was O.J.'s behavior while he was in custody. Because if they had considered, you know, the risk to the public based upon his history, based upon a court of law finding that he murdered two people, based upon he's going 13 years before he committed another violent takeover robbery. This man poses a tremendous risk of harm to the public. There's no way he should have been let out, but he was. And now, the reality is, he's going to go back to probably entertainment, reality shows, making a lot of money, and back before he was. But I agree with the previous gentlemen that he is not going to last long on the streets. He's probably going to be one or two years before he's back behind bars, and we'll be talking about this again, Martha."

I'm not an O.J. fan, but they took into consideration his time in prison is almost nine years of good behavior, he took some classes about anger management, and he's been a model prisoner. And David is wrong, and he knows that they're only supposed to consider the criminal convictions of this man. They did. The one that he was found guilty on that he didn't even appeal. They considered that, and everyone knows whether you're a lawyer or not, that nine years is a very long time for any type of strong armed robbery that this was and it was his stuff. So, they did the right thing. And like I said, I'm not an O.J. fan, but they did the right thing on this one."

O.J. said he's not going to pay one penny for it, and his little trip to the hotel -- a number of months later -- proved that. He brought the guys with the guns to intimidate the other gentleman, and guess what? It's only by the grace of God that two more people or more than that weren't murdered, and O.J. would've had another double murder case. The guns weren't fired, fortunately, but this man is an exceptionally dangerous man. He's a sociopath.

One of the reasons why President Trump was elected in the first place, is there are millions of voters all around the country who believed that he delivers a straight talk, pulls no punches, even if that means blistering one of his most loyal lieutenants. And that's what we saw here, the president telling the New York Times -- yes, that paper he likes to call fake news and the failing New York Times. That he would not have nominated Jeff Sessions if he knew the attorney general was going to recused himself from that Russia investigation. The president clearly still angry that move by Sessions paved the way for the justice department to punt the Russia probe to special counsel Robert Mueller, who appears maybe to be expanding that probe the president has called a witch hunt into, yes, potentially the Trump family finances. Today, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was just being candid and is disappointed in the attorney general, but still has confidence in him."

The president had specifically warned against that saying it would be a violation of the original mandate to investigate meddling in the 2016 election. Although, he seemed to leave some wiggle room that perhaps Mueller could look into finances dealing specifically with Russia. The bottom line is the president would not commit to not firing Mueller.

It's one of the reasons that he got elected in the first place, and Ed kind of touch on it. He speaks openly and honestly all the time. He's not politically correct. He's not as guarded as a lot of D.C. politicians, one of the reasons that he won the election last November. People felt like he spoke the truth and he told people what they needed to hear, not what they wanted to hear.

I know that this president is about doing his job, and he's shown his frustration, obviously, because he had a great day yesterday with the health care meeting with the 52 senators. I think he was having a great time in trying to move that legislation forward, at the same time, dealing with this kind of witch hunt that he has to deal with every day."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Juan, what do you think? JUAN WILLIAMS, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, I think the White House was concern. So what I heard today was people talking about the president as someone who is a big believer in loyalty and being faithful to people who brought you to the party, and Jeff Sessions is almost the definition of that in the Trump world, as the first senator to have endorsed Donald Trump, introduced Donald Trump, and stayed with him. It almost seems like he was calling -- sending a message to Jeff Sessions, maybe it's time for you to leave, Jeff Sessions. Remember, Sessions, offered his resignation earlier, Trump did not accept it, but the bitterness seems to have lingered. And I think that's why you're hearing people in the White House expressed concern. They did not know that he was going to go off message. Also, David said accurately, the president speaks his mind. But in this case, if he was talking about health care, if he was talking about tax reform coming down the pike, people would understand it. He brought up Russia and put it back in the headlines, Martha."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, you could sort of hear his stream of consciousness and as he's going through this. I mean, he said, well, basically if Sessions is gone, and then I've got Rosenstein. I'm not sure that's a good option. He's working through all of that as he's talking about it. Let's put up at this poll. I thought it was very interesting about what people care about out there in America, and what the media is covering. The long blue line at the bottom of that screen is what is being covered, Russia at 75 percent. And what do people care about? Health care is the biggest of the issues on that list, David. And job is second. So the president could be going right into that wheelhouse and just health care, jobs, hammering those messages over and over again. But who brought it back to Russia? The president did this time."

James Comey in his own testimony said I leaked these memos, which is a violation of DOJ policy. I leaked these memos to put pressure on Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel. That infuriated, obviously, the president. It frustrates him because he can't get health care through, and he can't get -- he can't talk about jobs, jobs, job. And he can't get -- on the tax reform.

I can make a deal whatever it's on his mind, clearly, Martha. You're talking about the stream of consciousness evident in the interview, but I think he's never run in to somebody like an Elliot Ness or a Wyatt Earp. You know, they're lawmen. You don't negotiate. They're the law. In this case, next week, when you have Manafort up there, but also Kushner behind closed doors, you don't know what you get. It comes back into the headlines.

General Jack Keane on those breaking developments, and details of a phone call that he had this evening with Senator John McCain, we'll talk to him about that coming up.

    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Some short story here. One step closer, Christopher Wray, President Trump's new pick to lead the FBI, unanimously approved by the senate judiciary committee, just hours ago. Trump nominated Wray to lead the agency last month after firing James Comey. Wray's nomination now heads to the full senate for the confirmation vote. And new development in this strange story out of D.C., law enforcement has located two of these six African teens reported missing from an international robotics competition in Washington. They're from Burundi. The two were spotted crossing into Canada this morning, but their ultimate destination is unknown to the police. The other four reported missing on Tuesday night. D.C. police say that they believe no foul play is suspected, more on that when we find out. So there are new reports tonight that President Trump is halting a CIA operation that armed Syrian rebels against the brutal regime of Bashar al- Assad. Critics calling this move a victory for Russia, whose military backed Assad. Chief amongst those critics is Senator John McCain. In his first political remarks since announcing his brain cancer diagnosis, McCain said this, the administration is playing right into the hands of Vladimir Putin, asking any concessions to Russia absent of broader strategy for Syria is irresponsible and shortsighted, said Senator McCain. Here now is General Jack Keane, chairman of the institute for the study of war, and a Fox News military analyst. General, good to have you here tonight."

He was talking about this business with the administration moving away from the Syrian moderates. By the way, the Syrian moderates are the only opposition forces that fighting for a democracy in Syria. Not the Islamic State and so they're not radicalize Islamic State. But getting back to the senator, I'll tell you, he's the most honorable, selfless, courageous politician I've ever met in my lifetime. It's no wonder the American people have such affection for him, regardless of what their politics may be. But he's full of life, he's full of spirit. He'll come back here when his doctors gave him the green light. So he can travel, essentially, what the issue is. There's no noticeable effect in talking to him with anything to do with the illness, and the doctors are saying that's not surprising. He'll be John McCain when he gets back here for sure."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "We look forward to that. One of the reasons I think he's so respected across the aisle is that he's a person of conviction. And whether people agree with him or disagree with him, he is passionate, and he has conviction, and he loves his work in the senate. And I think everybody will welcome him back. Just explain for everybody, though, why is this such an odd move in your mind, and it really does not -- it doesn't send a good signal for an administration that is trying to make it clear that they are not interested in doing something that sort of -- in any way to what Russia wants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, the Syrian moderates are always been the force that we have aligned with. And obviously, there's been a covert operation to provide them with lethal aid, specifically -- missiles. And I can tell you, for a fact, because at the institute of the study of war, where I'm at, we tracked this every day. And they have been quite effective against the Assad regime forces. The moderate forces in the north has been attrited, but the one in the south has not been. So what mystifies me is why we would undermine them. Morale is going to be impacted by this when we take these weapons away from them. We're going to make them more vulnerable to the Assad regime, to the Iranians, and also to the al-Qaeda, who is likely to attack them. As a result of it, they'll likely lose some members because they'll head over to the more radicalized groups because they think they have a future and the moderates do not. So it makes no sense in doing this. And I agree with others who've said why make this concession? Certainly, if this is round one between President Trump and Putin, and we make a concession like this either before the deal or during the deal of establishing a de-escalation zone, this doesn't look too favorable to the United States. I think we have lost round one."

Well, he himself went out and stepped on it by giving the interview to the New York Times. Can you imagine what the next six months would be like with a battle over the president forcing out -- Donald Trump forcing out Jeff Sessions, or Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein? It would be horrific for the president's agenda and unnecessary. The same with Robert Mueller, I'm sorry, but he's stuck.

It's a law in the United States, passed by the congress, and sign by the president. John Ashcroft had to recused himself in the Bush years on the Valerie Plame issue because I was involved in it, and I had been his consultant when he ran for governor and U.S. senator. And those statutes were clear. He had to recuse himself. Same with Jeff Sessions, who is a senior advisor to President Trump in his campaign."

      "utterance": "So finally tonight, despite the fact that John McCain appears to be his feisty self and wants none of it. Telling his dear friend Lindsey Graham to, quote, buck up today. Our quote of the night is the lovely statement that was put out by his daughter and our colleague, Meghan McCain, which says in part, he's a warrior at dusk, one of the greatest Americans of our age, and a worthy heir to his father's and grandfather's name. But to me he is something more. He's my strength, my example, my refuge, my confidant, my teacher, my rock, my hero, my dad. Senator McCain tweeting this morning, I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support, unfortunately for my spying partner in congress, I'll be back soon, so stand by. We look forward to that, Senator McCain, and we wish you well. Send us your story at home. Tweet us at @thestoryFNC using the #thestory. That's our story for tonight. We'll be back tomorrow at 7. Tucker Carlson is up next. END Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
