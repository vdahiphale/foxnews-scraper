Those May numbers you mentioned, biggest monthly total of apprehensions in 13 years and it's the third consecutive month that border detentions topped 100,000 in a month, and look how jarring that is because over the last seven years, we've seen apprehensions of about 300,00 to 400,000 for the entire fiscal year. Now, it's over 100 thousand a month. You can get an idea of why that's alarming.

Now, CBP is now trying to buy -- purchase 2.2 million diapers for these migrant kids. Now -- and I saw it being down at the border. I mean, these are desperately needed because agents themselves are acting as caretakers. They're not caretakers, but they're having to act as caretakers. So, what do you say tonight to Democrats like Alexandro Ocasio-Cortez who wants to abolish I.C.E. because she thinks well I.C.E. are the bad guys, I.C.E. needs to go because that is not humanitarian, not humanitarian efforts."

Last year alone, 34,000 criminal arrests; 5,000 gang members arrested, thousands of cases of child smuggling and exploitation, human trafficking. They seized $1.2 billion in U.S. currency from illicit activity. Yes, I'd like to talk to that young congresswoman and have her tell me what's going to happen if I.C.E. is abolished. Enforcement removal operations, this year-to-date, 66,000 individuals have been removed from this country. Laura, 90 percent of those individual removed either had -- were convicted of additional crime or charges pending.

      "utterance": "Seventy-five years ago this week, Operation Overlord which later became known as D-Day was the largest amphibious attack ever attempted. The daring plan was to take Allied troops into Nazi occupied France over the English Channel. It would require up to 5,000 ships, moving vehicles, tanks and more than 150,000 men on to Normandy's beaches."

Well, they turned to Andrew Jackson Higgins, a boat manufacturer in New Orleans, originally a timber magnate who had an idea and he had a design for shallow draft boats used to navigate the swamps and bayous of Louisiana."

The Navy doesn't know a damn thing about small boats, the hard-drinking, hard-charging Irishman insisted. The military initially resisted Higgins overtures, nevertheless, in a sign of his confidence, Higgins purchased an entire crop of Philippines mahogany, one of the last shipments before the war ended trade there. It was an inspired purchase particularly once the Marines finally relented and Higgins put his landing craft into production for military use. He would eventually open seven plants in New Orleans, employ tens of thousands of people and build 20,000 landing crafts."

The men going ashore had spent 48 hours aboard ships awaiting deployment, the choppy seas meant that most of them were seasick and the invasion was delayed due to bad weather. But with time running out, General Dwight D. Eisenhower made the call that June 6, 1944 would be D-Day. Providence was kind. The Normandy weather was so bad the German Navy cancelled their usual patrol of the English Channel. They also pulled off a practice drill. An ally's deception campaign including inflatable tanks and fake plans made the Germans think the invasion would happen at Calais. They were wrong. The last thing the men heard as they boarded the Higgins boats was General Eisenhower."

It wasn't bombs, artillery or tanks that overwhelmed the Germans, it was men. Many of them boys, really, slogging up the beaches and crawling over the corpses of their friends that won the Allies a toehold at the western edge of Europe.\" I got teared up -- I feel like I'm going to start bawling during the show because every grave behind us represents a life cut short and given for our freedom and Craig, you've written so much about this over the years.

So thank God that the ones who are alive are there to celebrate this monumental challenge. You know, our old friend Lyn Nofziger who worked for Ronald Reagan for so many years was one of those Rangers on one of those troop transports and was on Normandy on June 6, 1944. Years later, I was having lunch with Lyn and I just happened to look down on his hand and noticed that his two fingers on his left hand were gone and I always thought he lost them in a power tool accident and I asked him, I said, \"Lyn, what happened to your left hand?\" He said, \"Nazi shrapnel.\" He'd climbed the cliffs and he put his hand up and half his hand was blown away, but he never bragged about it. He never talked about it. Like most of the greatest generation, they came back and went back to work. You know, a lot of them didn't like to talk about it until recently, but he told me that the seas were so wavy and so are uncontrollable that by the time they got to the Normandy Beach, they were ankle-deep in puke from all the other troops on board the troop carrier. They were so sick."

We stopped and we said, \"Wait a second, think about what was happening 75 years ago at this hour in the dark.\" They didn't know where they were, their compasses, half of them were broken.

You're moving the population of a mid-sized city, 150,000 men and tanks and cargo and jeeps and medical supplies and food supplies and guns and ammo and all the other things. The logistics that went into the planning of the D-Day Invasion are really staggering if you really think about moving that 150,000 with all those munitions and supplies, then 22 miles across the open sea through choppy waters to then land as Raymond, said in the murderous Nazi crossfire."

      "utterance": "Well, while the left has been obsessing over the fact that there was nothing in the Mueller report to charge the president in the Russia hoax, now the Kremlin is rolling out the red carpet for China amid Trump's trade war with Xi Jinping. The two appear to be strengthening their alliance in defiance of President Trump. Here now, Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute and author of \"Bully of Asia.\" Now, Steven, is this the unintended consequence of the Russia hoax, the Russia obsession? President Trump had expressed his desire to have a better relationship with Russia if possible in his first two years, but that really has not happened. STEVEN MOSHER, AUTHOR, \"BULLY OF ASIA\": Yes, every time anybody says anything about Russia in the Trump administration they get attacked for colluding, which is nonsense. The reality is that Trump's strong economy, we have got the American, great engine of American capitalism firing on all cylinders now, the strengthening of NATO with countries anteing up what they should be paying on our common defense. With all of these positive things happening with the American economy, with economic growth that's the envy of the world, Russia would be approaching us. Russia would see itself as weak in relation to American strength, and I think would be coming to the table and wanting to work out a deal on the Ukraine, for example. What has stopped that is this obsession with so-called Russian collusion and obstruction. And there is no there there, of course. We all know that by now. We've been talking about it for two years. But that conversation has --"

But knowing what Russia is and what Russia does, I believe it was a missed opportunity to box out China, which has a massive economy even with tis slowdown, a larger standing army than the United States now, space weaponry, China 2025, the Belt and Road Initiative. They are moving on all fronts, and yet we had to see this sit-down today, which was a big show. They put on a big show. It kind of got lost in the D-Day stuff. But Steven, I've got to play something for you. This is what Joe Biden said yesterday, downplaying the China threat."

I worry about a candidate whose son took $1 million -- $1 billion. I said $1 million. I mean $1 billion with a \"b\", $1 billion-and-a-half dollars in investments from a state-owned bank in China for his investment company. I'm worried that the Chinese Communist Party may think they have bought and paid for Joe Biden. I don't think that's true, by the way, but I think Biden has a lot to account for in that transaction. This is the way the Chinese Communist Party operates, of course. If you're a friend of China you get all kinds of benefits. And he has gotten a lot. So where does he stand on this? Is he going to be weak on China?"

The 30th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, and CBS reporter goes there to Tiananmen Square and shows pictures, the iconic pictures of the tanks rolling across the Square, putting down the student-led protests, and it has been erased from the popular memory, just like the Soviets did with erasing their own history. Totally erased. That's how they operate. And they are enemies of history, enemies of truth, enemies of free expression, yet we have had all these Wall Street types, all these venture capitalists who have made a boatload of money, and they want to keep it business as usual. And do you think that China would be far happier if Biden was able to win the election in 2020? Last answer."

The Chinese Communist Party has killed tens of millions of people in political purges during the Cultural Revolution. They starved 50 million to death in the early 60s. They've arrested the Muslims, the Tibetan Buddhists, the Christians. They have eliminated, actually killed hundreds of millions of unborn children and born children in infanticide because of the one child policy. If you total up the number of people killed by the Chinese Communist Party, it's 500 million people. Most communist parties kill off about 10 percent of their population as counterrevolutionaries. China has killed off about a quarter."

OK, Steven, thank you so much for this.
