MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": Pelosi has a big problem on her hands, and the problem is that the initial strategy of presenting voters a pseudo-impeachment by dragging out these hearings was thwarted by President Trump and his policy of no cooperation across the board. And so this has now put the Democrats in a box where the only way that they can attempt to get some of the answers or some of the big publicity they want is through opening an impeachment, even though Pelosi knows impeachment would be futile and likely to backfire politically. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",
