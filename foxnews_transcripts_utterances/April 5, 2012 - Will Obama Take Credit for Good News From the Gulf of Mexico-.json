It was a symbol of the administration's helplessness, it was sort of the ultimate contradiction of the Obama ideology, that the government can be, you know, can be competent, do stuff, help you, et cetera.

But there's one word of caution here: We are at a time of maximum danger. This could either be really good, successful, the cap, or the results could be catastrophic. If the pressures or high, that means it's working. If the pressures are not high, that means that the well head at the bottom hasn't held and the oil would be escaping through the sediment and the ground in a way that might be irreparable and unstoppable. That's why everybody is scared right now about the pressure reading.

Just to clarify what I was saying before: I don't think he is going to see some upsurge in the polls or the people. It you look at the Gallop poll -- I believe that Gallop did polling and they asked people how important this was -- last month in June of 2010, and 18 percent of people asked said it was one of the most important issues.

The new cap is on, and they say there is no oil escaping in the Gulf as of today. A lot of leaders and folks there along the Gulf are saying their prayers have been answered, at least so far, but they are still testing this thing. Democratic Saturday from Louisiana Mary Landrieu has said \"I am cautiously optimistic this is the beginning of the end of the terrible nightmare.\" What about the news and all the political ramifications? Let's bring in the panel: Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Steve?"

It was an anonymous plumber who called Robert Deed, the University of California engineer involved with the administration's earlier efforts, and basically laid out that he wanted, to deliver a sketch. He passed the sketch on and it seems to be what they used was designed after this anonymous plumber and people don't know who he is."

Just as President Obama, at least initially, was unfairly blamed for BP's oil spill, he will likely if this in fact holds -- I think there are reasons to be skeptical -- if it holds he will get credit for BP capping the well, also unfair. What we should be doing is judging him on what happened in between, and the key moment or series of moments is the moratorium. We talk to people down there who say the moratorium will have done more damage to the Gulf and the Gulf economy than the spill itself. If that is true and if they can back it up, it will cause lasting damage to the president."

The damage is done to BP and the damage is done to President Obama about his slow response to the crisis, his lack of management skills, if you will. Having never been a mayor or a governor who handles a local crisis like this, his response was slow in the beginning. Obviously, the debate will go on about the moratorium and the damage is done to the environment and the waters, but to the local economies, et cetera. And it will be digging out for years, the Gulf States. And so I don't think he will get a big pat on the back for this."

      "utterance": "The moratorium is an unforced error the administration somehow has to undo. On the cap itself, I'm between where Steve and A.B. are on this. I don't think it will have a positive effect in the sense people won't say he went down and plugged the damn hole. But I think it does remove a drag on the presidency. The fact that we could see every day the gushing was like America held hostage in the late '70s. It was a symbol of the administration's helplessness, it was sort of the ultimate contradiction of the Obama ideology, that the government can be, you know, can be competent, do stuff, help you, et cetera. It was a rebuke just right out there every day. So when you remove that, I think in time -- perhaps not in time for this election this year -- but in time, if this is successful, and that's a huge if, it will fade from memory and I'm not sure it has lasting impact on Obama, particularly in 2012."

      "utterance": "We are at a time of maximum danger. This could either be really good, successful, the cap, or the results could be catastrophic. If the pressures or high, that means it's working. If the pressures are not high, that means that the well head at the bottom hasn't held and the oil would be escaping through the sediment and the ground in a way that might be irreparable and unstoppable. That's why everybody is scared right now about the pressure reading. So it's either going to be a huge success or it could be a real disaster."

It you look at the Gallop poll -- I believe that Gallop did polling and they asked people how important this was -- last month in June of 2010, and 18 percent of people asked said it was one of the most important issues. This month, the same number is seven percent. So I think you are right, he has seen a lot of damage done to him. If it's a broader narrative of government involvement, that he can't fix. But as he was unfairly blamed at the beginning he will get residual credit at the end."

One democrat voted against it, Senator Russ Feingold from Wisconsin. We learned late today the Senate majority leader got a call from someone and he said he almost was in danger of losing that 60th vote. There is a bit of a mystery. The speculation was it was Senator Brown who made that call. But whatever happened, they worked it out. He got the 60th vote and it has passed and now will likely head to the president soon to be signed. We're back with the panel. Charles, what does this all mean? It's more than 2,300 pages long and you heard the two descriptions, the president and the Senate minority leader."

      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",

This is about as important as it gets. It deals with every aspect of our lives. And then he adds \"No one will know until this actually is in place how it works.\" Well, that gives you a lot of confidence in something that is going to influence all of our lives. The fact is there are hundreds of regulations that are going to be as a result of the bill that have not been written. They are going to be lobbied, they are going to be litigated. The big banks who have the big lobby operations and the big lawyering operations are going to have the upper hand here. Every comma, every adjective will carry hundreds of billions of dollars worth of importance over time. This is a gift to the big banks over the smaller institutions that don't the same lobbying and lawyering facilities. Also, when the president promises that we're never going to have a bailout, I'm not sure how he knows. I read a lot of economists who think it that actually increases our chances of it happening. But it certainly is going to set up a structure in which the Fed and the Treasury can act unilaterally without Congress as opposed to in 2008 to bailout a large institution. The large institutions, small number, are going to have a reputation. Everyone would know you can lend to them because ultimately the Fed and Treasury will stand behind them. If you're small, you don't have that. So again, the large institutions are going to have a serious advantage over the small guys."

They'll object to what Charles mentions as being in the legislation, punishing the small banks, facilitates bailouts and contracts credit further, ultimately damaging Main Street. And people will make an assessment whether this does more damage than repair or more repair than damage. What I was struck by is the timing of this -- the sort of the evolution of the debate. Months ago, this was a popular, populist push strongly supported by the public in polls. Republicans seem to siding with Wall Street against consumers. Now you have a focus on the fact that corporate leaders are complaining to Obama administration that they are not able to help with growth, not able to spur hiring. They're sitting on $1.8 trillion in cash because of the regulatory uncertainty brought on by the huge overhauls and the Obama agenda. If this is the focus now, the complaints by the Republicans that onerous regulations brought on by a bill like this will hurt Main Street, those complaints will get a lot more traction in the months to come."
