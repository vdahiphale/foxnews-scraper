As you explained, that border inexplicably left wide open, about 1,000 migrants crossing with no check of their documents whatsoever. That situation changed after a short time. Documents were being checked. The migrants were given wristbands and told they have to wait five days for a visa to Mexico. But keep in mind, this border is still wide open for the caravan even after that five-day wait. The president of Mexico, a leftist, Lopez Obrador, has said these people will be treated humanely. And when you talk to them, really the main goal is not to say here in Mexico but to keep going onto the U.S. That is where they want to go. When you talk to them almost to a person, they'll say we'll get there to the U.S. to work it's legal or illegal. For many, it's a sense they can't go back again. They do not intend to go back. And keep in mind, this is the second major caravan. The first one had 7,000, this one has about 2,000 spread out. And it's not the last one. Already even as we speak, two more caravans are coming. They are being formed right now in Honduras. So while the Mexican president says we're going to treat you humanely, you could get a sense that the people of Mexico, you see what happens to small towns like this when suddenly you have 1,000 people sleeping on the street, this is the second time here, and it's going to happen again and again in these small Mexican towns as these caravans continue to march forward to the U.S. border.

This is a cautionary tale, we got a long way to go here to see what Robert Mueller has and doesn't have. Remember the reporting from Ben Smith, the editor of BuzzFeed said, we're going to stay tuned, you were going to re-report the story, let's see, a stray said, no other independent journalist outlets have been able to corroborate the story. Let's see if they're able to do so as we dig deeper here. I suspect one of the reasons that finally the Mueller team said something is they're concerned a little more about the sourcing than the substance. There was an illusion that Mueller's team talked and that may not be the case, these two independents sources that are quoted in the article, maybe something not attached to the Mueller team. I would make one more quick point, the Southern District has been much more aggressive, talking about what the President did or didn't or possibly directed versus the Mueller team. This really underlines, we all got to wait for the Mueller report to come out, that's the pivot point here."

We've got McClatchy reporters out there claiming that Michael Cohen was in Prague, even though Michael Cohen says he never had been there and the Special Counsel's documents suggest they found no evidence that he ever was. So yeah it would be great if people slow down but look, why did everyone jump on this, I think this is important. The reason people got breathless is because there were claims in the story that there was text messages and evidence, something that went beyond Michael Cohen's word. Also the belief that this was a new bite at the obstruction apple, given that the whole hope that they could get Trump on obstruction for firing Comey doesn't seem to be panning out so that's I think what inspired everyone latching on to this but cautionary tale indeed.

I think the journalism sector has really lowered the bar on what used to be basic standards even going so far as sometimes when they would say they were anonymous sources, they would at least say for instance what branch they belong to, what department they were talking to, whether or not these were retired officials that they were speaking to or current officials. Now we just get according to officials, we don't know who, what, where, are they officials at the DMV or maybe they're officials at the at the Justice department, maybe they've been out of politics for ten years, we don't know and it really does diminish the ability for people to judge the credibility of stories. One of the really important things--"

I think this is a rough day for journalism, let's see how it all plays out over the long term, it's a call to go even higher in their standards, to double-triple check multiple sources, we all have our favorite places to go to get truth, they all got to step up their game. I would say we got to slow down and not celebrate and wait for Mueller's report to come out and when it comes to Bob Mueller, I don't want to tell him what to do but he should speed up. Let's get this thing going here."

But I think the message from what happened today, is there will be more fake mainstream media stories out about Donald Trump and my fear is that if Bob Mueller now doesn't come out and discredit those stories and then the Left wing media will say, see David, it must be true because Bob Mueller didn't discredit it.

And that's a serious question so that's going to continue. Every time there's another one of these unsourced story, here is my help that Bill Barr comes in as the Attorney General and he sets a deadline, he doesn't say he's going to impede, he doesn't say you know, you can't do this or that but he's going to say, look, this needs to be finished by this date.

Now I do want to drill down on one of the authors in this piece, Jason Leopold. You heard what we played earlier that he's confident this bomb shell and \"bombshell\" report was true and even BuzzFeed stood by him. \"Jason is one of the best journalists in the world and he has proven it. BuzzFeed news stands by this story 100%.\" Oops, you'd probably want to walk that back now. BuzzFeed was wish casting so hard on this story but before coming out with that statement, they should have checked into his troubled past of making up sources. Goes all the way back to the Bush administration and his work then. His problems were so bad, even the Columbia journalism review, recognized and respected, once accused Leopold of being a fabulist. One of the targets of his shoddy reporting, former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove sounded off earlier today to my colleague Dana Perino."

Said that I told members of the White House staff that I was going to soon be indicted. And all heck broke loose. It was simply not true, there is not an element of truth in it. Either as to the indictment, to the grand jury, to the meeting with the President, you name it."

You know what the tell was for me David, early today and you played the clip before where you had Anthony Cormier who is a solid reporter by all accounts telling CNN that he didn't see the damning evidence that was used in the story and then you have Jason Leopold on MSNBC telling Hallie Jackson that, \"Oh, no, no, no, we've seen the evidence. In other words the two reporters on it saw it. So excuse me - so somebody is lying here obviously. And now it's all falling apart and look, another tell as well, law enforcement officials in the story said they were involved in an investigation as this was pointed out by Anthony McCarthy earlier on Tucker Carlson show meaning maybe not the Russia investigation but some other investigations. To Kimberley's point, we don't know who these law enforcement officials are. Are they at the top of the ring, are they outside the loop, we don't know so again it's a matter of being first instead of accurate and treating gossip as gospel. And now here we are once again, one of the biggest black eyes that we've seen in journalism and this reminds me a lot David of the Michael Flynn story by AB - then ABC news reporter, investigative reporter Brian Ross using one source saying that Donald Trump during the campaign had directed Flynn to reach out to the Russians. Brian Ross is no longer with ABC. Boy, this feels a lot like that David."

Matter of fact, Olga Sanchez Cordero, their interior minister said they were going to do that. Well, I guess not. Take a look at this video. One-thousand migrants just walking across the border from Guatemala into Mexico after the gates were left wide open. FOX's Steve Harrigan is in Tapachula, Mexico, with the latest. Steve?"

      "speaker": "STEVE HARRIGAN, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "David, this is what it looks like when the caravan comes to your town. We're about 10 miles over that border just in the predawn hours. As you explained, that border inexplicably left wide open, about 1,000 migrants crossing with no check of their documents whatsoever. That situation changed after a short time. Documents were being checked. The migrants were given wristbands and told they have to wait five days for a visa to Mexico. But keep in mind, this border is still wide open for the caravan even after that five-day wait. The president of Mexico, a leftist, Lopez Obrador, has said these people will be treated humanely. And when you talk to them, really the main goal is not to say here in Mexico but to keep going onto the U.S. That is where they want to go. When you talk to them almost to a person, they'll say we'll get there to the U.S. to work it's legal or illegal. For many, it's a sense they can't go back again. They do not intend to go back. And keep in mind, this is the second major caravan. The first one had 7,000, this one has about 2,000 spread out. And it's not the last one. Already even as we speak, two more caravans are coming. They are being formed right now in Honduras. So while the Mexican president says we're going to treat you humanely, you could get a sense that the people of Mexico, you see what happens to small towns like this when suddenly you have 1,000 people sleeping on the street, this is the second time here, and it's going to happen again and again in these small Mexican towns as these caravans continue to march forward to the U.S. border.

Great to talk to you again here on \"The Ingraham Angle.\" What Steve just said about what happens in the march to the towns, to the localities, that's rarely covered. On this network we do, but they don't talk about the effect of this march on all of the people that pass by in those neighborhoods."

But let's not forget that we have been seeing a caravan coming through south Texas. Our agents are apprehending anywhere from 500 to 1,000 illegal aliens that are coming into the country. We just saw a couple of days ago in the Yuma sector where three border patrol agents came across 376 illegal aliens that crossed the border over there. So it's definitely a humanitarian crisis, and it's causing a lot of problems not only for migrants but for our agents and for the American public."

So this is like the waves splashing up against a border that the president may well close, or if they go to someplace else, they end up with annunciation, housed, they get released into the El Paso community. So this issue is just continuing to grow. What needs to be done about it now? And is Mexico going to be any help or are they just going to pass through as usual?"

So Mexico definitely needs to do something about that and not allow these people to come through the country and encourage them to come through this country. Now, the other thing is we need to talk about those physical barriers that we have been calling for as Border Patrol agents. And I want to make it very clear that these physical borders we are calling for barriers in strategic locations to make sure that we can help our border patrol agents enforce the law and make sure we can stop these types of caravans, but also the dangerous of these drugs. Now, these migrants are coming to this country because it's clear, rampant abuse of our immigration system. They know that if they just say a few key words to our border agents, they're going to try to qualify for asylum, and they are going to be released into the U.S. And unfortunately, we cannot - -"

The $5.7 billion request, all the other things that re requested in FY 2019 by the administration, immigration, judges, all the things that you guys have asked for, in your report to the president to Congress, it includes what needs to be done about the process for these migrants when they cross over into the U.S. illegally. So is that being done? Are we handling the flow and the flood, or do we need an immediate surge?"

And the flow is not stopping. There are some changes that need to be done at the Congressional level, but think about it. We can't even get our government open. How can we expect for Congress to close the immigration loopholes that these people are exploiting? It's just out of control.

They are there to protest the 1974 Supreme Court Roe versus Wade decision advocating for women to choose life, not abortion. But this is how the liberal media framed today's event. \"The Washington Post\" headline saying, and I quote, \"March for life says it's pro-science despite medical consensus favoring abortion access.\" Here now to react, Tony Perkins, he's the president of the Family Research Council, and Mike Kelly, my good friend and the congressman from Pennsylvania's third district. Gentlemen, great to see you both. Tony, first to you. By the way, the march, the longest running march in Washington successful. Americans have a belief, a right, they exercise it. And they do so peacefully. And yet they are attacked for their beliefs."

The media reports, in fact I think one of them said it was over 1,000 people. I guess they're safe. It was tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. And you're right, it has been going on 46 years, 45 years as people show up for these marches. And it is a message that we want to see the court reigned in when it comes to the issue of life, but it's more than that. It is a march to change the hearts and minds of people, which I would say we have seen tremendous progress in the last 46 years. In fact, I believe very soon, we will see America once again being a predominantly pro-life nation. And, despite what they say, science is on our side."

I would suggest that somebody or anybody who has never been to the March for Life, if you want to see stark contrast between people who love life, people who have so much peace and love in their hearts, if you were to say that group -- and I'm with Mr. Perkins. There's hundreds of thousands there, we talked about it earlier about it being undercounted, unreported. When you look at the faces of the people who come to Washington not in anger, not in hate, but in hope that can reverse a decision, it happened so long ago, and we keep saying, my goodness, in the United States of America, 2,500 to 3,000 abortions a day. We recoil anytime we hear of any disaster around the world or loss of life, but with this we sit back and we watch it happen, and it's OK because the Supreme Court said it was OK. But I've got to tell you, it is the faces of those people that you see, all age ranges, by the way, and I was in mass this morning. I was just so good to sit there among a group of people who were there for the same reason, and that was pro-life."

And unfortunately, one time I got caught up in the women's march. I wasn't there intentionally, but I will tell you there is a stark contrast. It's not just a stark contrast in the marches and the behavior but really in underlying ideas. And as Mike was sagging, we are marching for life, it's hope, it's love. And they were criticized today because of the embracing of science. And the science does underscore the potential and the presence of human life. And the left, they are mocking that, but the left treats the science like a smorgasbord where they can pick and choose what they want. And when it comes to babies and bathrooms, they reject science flat out."

There is an incredible passion for life in this country. There always has been. David, after the march left the capital today, there were note trash barrels that were upset. There was nothing on fire. There were no windows broken or doors torn off their hinges. It was a coming together of people who love life. What better is the personification of America than that pursuit of life and happiness? It is just so much who we are. You just wonder --"

      "utterance": "It's a nagging issue that has completely enveloped the Democratic Party, and frankly, the media apparatus. Can you be white, or even worse, a white male and win the nomination? The obsession took on a whole new level of absurdity with the publishing of this piece from CNN's political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson. \"Beto's excellent adventure trips with white male privilege.\" Here now with reaction, Candace Owens, communications director of Turning Point USA, and Dee Dawkins-Haigler, who is a former Georgia state legislator and a Democratic strategist. Ladies, let's get into it. By the way, apparently this week I am the newest thing in white privilege thanks to Areva Martin, who is Kamala Harris' close confidante and friend. Candace, you and I covered something similar to this and where we are in false narratives on FOX Nations. But this is identity politics on steroids, isn't it?"

      "speaker": "CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINTS USA",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Sometimes I like to challenge myself and just switch the words \"black\" and \"white\" and see what you would come up with. You would say that it was discriminatory, you would say that it was racist. If black men in this country were discussed in the same that white are men discussed today, this nation would be up in arms. There would be another civil war, and there's no question about that. But I think that this is sort of part and parcel of what the left has become. Every election cycle they drum up this imaginary enemy, this bogeyman. I think in the 2016 election cycle it was definitely police officers, and I think that we are seeing that they're going to continue this push on trying to attack white men so people aren't actually thinking about the issues, plain and simple."

      "utterance": "I think because America historically has basically had white men at the helm of all politics. And I think when you talk about identity politics, we can't just look at race. We also have to look at gender. And we know that the Democratic Party is the big tent. However, historically minorities have been discriminated against, and not just the Democratic Party. But look also in the Republican Party. In the 115th Congress you have only one African-American serving in the United States Senate that is a Republican. We only have two in the Democratic side, but still --"

      "speaker": "WEBB",

They are almost a protected class in Washington. They have a lot of power. Frederica Wilson, Sheila Jackson Lee, Maxine Waters, the list goes on. And you've got a new generation in Cory Booker and others. So is it really about victimization and victimhood? A quick one from you, then I want to go to Candace."

      "speaker": "DAWKINS-HAIGLER",

      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. And look, here is what the left wants you to believe. They want you to think that diversity is everybody looking differently but thinking the same. The only true diversity is intellectual, and there is none nonetheless. There are no disputes on the left. They're all in lockstep. I always find it a little bit strange when you encounter a black woman like Dee, who knows the history of her party who brought us the KKK, Jim Crow laws, absolutely no progress has been accomplished."
