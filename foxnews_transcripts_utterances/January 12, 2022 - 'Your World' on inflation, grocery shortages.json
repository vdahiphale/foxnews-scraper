Prices jumping 7 percent in December to the highest level in nearly 40 years, everything from bacon and eggs to beef and gasoline seeing huge price spikes. President Biden says the administration is -- quote -- \"making progress\" on slowing the rate of price increases, but Americans, at least for now, may not be feeling it. Inflation expected to be a big topic when the White House holds its briefing this hour. We will go to it once it begins. Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. To FOX Business' Susan Li with more on what's driving this inflation surge -- Susan.",

      "sentences": "Charles, that's right. Get used to these higher prices, because they're going to be here for a while. You're paying the highest price jumps in 40 years in December, so consumer prices, as you mentioned, rising 7 percent last month. And that is the highest year-over-year increase since the summer of 1982, with prices rising almost twice as much as wages were last month. So there's still sticker shock when you go to the grocery stores. Food prices were up 6 percent. Filling up your gas tanks costs a lot more than it did a year ago. And used cars are still fetching premium pricing. Now, despite the inflation report, the White House is sticking to their promises of easing prices this year, the president saying in the statement that this report really underscores that we still have more work to do, with price increases still too high and squeezing family budgets. And despite the White House trying to calm household concerns, our latest FOX Business poll shows that more than a third of Americans are worried about higher prices. In fact, it's the overwhelming top issue for respondents, who say it's the number one issue affecting the economy right now. Government spending, income inequality and supply chain issues came way behind in this list. Also, inflation is forcing the Federal Reserve to take action, Wall Street now forecasting three interest rate increases this year, but the latest data also from the Central Bank showed that economic growth moderated, slowed down in the final three months of last year. So, as you see, Charles, it's really a tough balancing act for Jerome Powell and the Central Bank right now.",

But I think people have to get ready for this continued surge in inflation, because it's not going to come down right away. There's this momentum to it. And as much as the momentum goes, it's going to take a while before they can slow it down, and then get it to go in reverse. So I think it's here -- you know, I think it's here all through 2022.

You have got a workers strike; 4.5 million people quit the labor force in November, and for a variety of reasons. They say they don't want to come back. They have got some money saved up. And so the companies have to raise their wages. When they raise their wages, they have to raise prices. So here's the ironic thing. We learned today that real wages went down 2.4 percent. So, here, people are thinking they're getting more money, but they can't -- it won't go as far. This is sort of a death spiral, isn't it, Kenny?",

I will say this, because stock markets tend to price out what happens in six to nine months. And back in 1982, you had a pretty strong stock market, despite rising rates. And you have seen that five of the six times -- in the six times that we have seen rates go up. So, some are anticipating look, three interest rate increases, pretty much what we expected this year.

      "sentences": "Thanks, Jen. Good to be with you all today. I, just at the top, wanted to make a couple of points about -- of context on our current economic situation, and then happy to take questions that you have. So, four quick points. First is the context on our economic recovery. We've learned, based on data that we received over the last several days, that, in 2021, our economy experienced the largest single drop in the unemployment rate on record in the history of the country, down to 3. 9 percent; the most jobs created in any year on record at 6. 4 million; the strongest economic growth of any year in nearly four decades, coming in between 5. 6 -- 5 and 6 percent over the course of 2021, in all likelihood; and real household income -- that is taking into account price increases -- increased in 2021. So, just to repeat that context: the largest decline in unemployment, the most jobs created, and the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years. The second point is we got December price data today. And I would note that we saw a welcome deceleration in the rate of price increases in a number of respects. In the headline -- price increase data -- we saw a decline month to month to 0.5 percent, down from 0.8 percent in the month before. It's still too high, but moving in the right direction. As I think I say every time here -- and if I don't, I -- it's a mistake -- we never index too heavily on any individual one month of data in any direction. But I would note that we saw, in prices from November to December, a decline in the rate of growth of the prices for food at home, which is a technical way of saying food that people buy in the grocery store. And we saw a drop in the price of energy, both at the gas pump but also natural gas and winter heating costs. And many of you focused on the annual 7 percent rate. If we are trying to look at where we are headed, the month-to-month changes are more instructive. And most independent forecasters continue to project that we will see moderation in price increases over the course of 2022. Third point is the global context for this data, both on prices and on economic growth writ large. What we're seeing right now is these price increases are a global phenomenon, and that reflects the nature of the global challenge of coming through a pandemic crisis and a pandemic- affected recovery. Over the past six months, price increases in the United States and Europe have basically run neck and neck. In December, the E.U. saw its highest recorded inflation in -- on record. Germany saw its highest inflation, in December, since reunification. And so, while there are differences country by country, this is a global phenomenon and driven by these global issues. Which comes to the fourth point, which is: Given the unique strength of the United States economic recovery -- overall growth, as well as the labor market -- we are well positioned to attack the challenges of prices and costs head on. And that's exactly what the President and this administration are doing. And it's his principal focus when it comes to the economy. As he laid out on Friday, his approach to attacking prices and costs are grounded in the -- in the premise that the right way to do this is to build on the economic successes that we have seen, not to abandon them. And that really means, with respect to what we in the administration and Congress can do, is to focus on how we can expand the productive capacity of the economy; how we can make sure that our economy can produce more goods and services more cheaply and easily across the country; get more people working; and get to the strong, sustainable growth that we are beginning to see -- and if we can address these present challenges, we'll hopefully see going forward. The President has outlined a very specific three-part plan to do that around unsticking supply chains, protecting consumers, and promoting competition and trying to actually reduce directly some of the most significant costs that Americans' families face. And obviously, key elements of the Build Back Better framework go directly at that issue. So, I'm happy to talk about the policy details behind that plan in general. But I think, just to summarize: We have a historically strong economic growth and labor market outcomes. We have -- saw some welcomed deceleration, but price increases that are still too high; decidedly a global phenomenon happening everywhere, but we in the United States are uniquely well positioned that -- against that challenge. And that's -- that's the President's focus.",

      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "sentences": "So, I think that if we look at the situation earlier in the year, a number of projections and forecasts have come out differently than we anticipated. If you -- if you look at employment, for example, virtually nobody was projecting that we would see unemployment fall as quickly as it -- as it has and get to 3. 9 percent by the end of this year. That's four years faster than the median forecast. And so, I think we've seen a number of unanticipated outcomes. When it comes to prices, what we have -- what we have said consistently -- focused consistently is that this is a global phenomenon; it is connected to the pandemic and the issues that that has raised. Certainly the supply chain challenges that have evolved over the course of time, through the Delta variant and over the course of the fall, have been issues that we've had to go and tackle head on. But I think that the -- nomenclature aside, we find ourselves in a position now where we're looking forward, and most forecasters are projecting that the price increases will moderate. Our focus here is looking at what are the concrete, practical steps that we can take to try to help ensure that outcome and try to help accelerate relief where we can -- where we appropriately can. So, when it comes to something like the supply chain challenges, those manifested more significantly than people were anticipating over the course of the summer and early fall, both because of COVID factors but also buying behavior of major retailers and major freight movers. And so, we went into action over the course of the fall to try to help address those issues and the bottlenecking we were seeing at ports. Made very significant progress on that -- a 40 percent decline in the amount of time that a container is sitting at the dock. And at the same time, we still have work to do on that front, which is why, even this month, we're going to take additional steps with ports across the country to set up inland locations to move products and impose new fees on empty containers that are sitting idle at our ports. So, we're going to -- we're going to stay at that and other issues. And we believe that that's the best way that we can, again, help to expand the economy's capacity to deliver goods and services to the American people.",

The American Rescue Plan has historic investments in actually addressing food insecurity for people who couldn't afford food. As a result, we saw hunger in the United States decline in 2021. It also included a -- the Child Tax Credit -- another resource that went directly -- that are going directly to families to help address the typical costs that they face on a monthly basis. And, as a result, we saw child poverty fall by 35 to 40 percent in America over the course of 2021. And we saw -- as I mentioned, we saw some welcome deceleration in the increase in the cost of food this month. And we're going to keep focused on those ways that we can address the typical pocketbook issues that the American people face. And this is one of the issues why the core economic logic behind the President's -- behind the Build Back Better plan is important in this context, because for working Americans who are -- who are benefiting from a strong labor market and more job opportunities but also struggling with costs not only of food but costs of childcare or cost of health care, the components of the Build Back Better plan would directly address those issues by putting -- by providing a tax cut to families directly in their pocketbook, and then reducing other of their most salient costs. So, for a lot of the families that you're talking about, if they only had to pay 7 percent of their income in childcare, that would free up a lot of resources to invest in other monthly needs.

So -- and beyond that, we are looking at ways that we can unstick elements of the supply chain that may be getting in the way of, for example, physical product getting to market. And certainly we have seen -- we have seen -- over the course of this fall, we've seen concerns about product shortages in particular categories and otherwise. What we see overall, if you look at retail inventories, including grocery store inventories, they're actually higher now than they were pre-pandemic -- so, in a pretty healthy place.

With respect to China specifically and the current moment, we're monitoring it very closely. As we assess the issue today, the lockdowns are most likely to have the effect isolated in China because the production facilities in those geographies are principally suppliers to the Chinese market.

And I think that, as we have seen with what we were able to get done in 2021 to deliver that type of relief directly to families, that can make all the difference. And that can really help to bridge this gap for families and also help to get more people to work, that we continue to face real challenges where parents and other caregivers in this economy want to get back to work but are held back because of the cost of actually finding a quality way to take care of a kid or take care of an elderly parent -- that's compounded by the pandemic.

These numbers are pretty stunning and they're very likely to crank up some of the criticism of the Biden administration and their catch-and-release policy. So, we can pull up some video right here that we shot here in La Joya yesterday of migrants arriving and smiling and waving to our cameras. Well, explain the background on all this. Back in March, when the border crisis really first exploded, the Biden administration started mass-releasing migrants with what are called NTRs. That stands for notice to report. And what those are is a request to please turn yourself into an ICE office in a city of your choosing within 60 days. And now, for the very first time, we got some brand-new DHS data that shows how few of those migrants actually did that. If we can pull this graphic up right now, again, brand- new from DHS, what those numbers show is, between March and August, DHS released about 104,000 illegal immigrants into the country with NTRs, but only about 50,000 of them actually reported to ICE. More than 47,000, as you mentioned, never showed up to ICE within that 60- day window. And then about 6,600 also did not turn themselves in, but it still was not within that 60-day window at the time this data was compiled. All that, in a nutshell, essentially shows that about half of those migrants who got NTRs never showed up to an ICE office. And NTRs have since been discontinued entirely. Meanwhile, take a look at these wild photos out of Laredo, Texas, yesterday. Texas DPS pulling over this truck, and take a look at what they find inside, 27 illegal immigrants being smuggled inside the cab of that vehicle, all of them crammed inside. Texas State Troopers telling me the driver was a U.S. citizen from Houston, who was later arrested and charged with multiple counts of human smuggling. Also, take a look at this mug shot right here, just here in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, four sex offenders arrested at the border in a span of 48 hours, including this previously deported Mexican national you're looking at. He had previous charges out of the Corpus Christi area for aggravated sexual assault of a child and the continuous sexual abuse of a child. And then, lastly, want to pull up this photo here from Del Rio Sector. What you're looking at here are multiple unaccompanied minors, just over the weekend, Border Patrol there reporting they picked up more than 70 of these unaccompanied minors, who turned themselves in with no family or with total strangers, many of them telling agents they have no idea where their parents are. And then back out here live, more on Del Rio Sector. Migrants continue to come in from all around the world. Agents there saying just this last week they got more than 30 from Uzbekistan, four from Tajikistan, one from Syria, and one from Mauritania in Northwest Africa. We will send it back to you.",

They continue to be mind-boggling that you would let someone go and say, by the way, come back later and show up for a hearing. I'm almost shocked that half did, to be quite frank with you.

And so it's no surprise that they got overwhelmed. And by getting overwhelmed, they couldn't do the proper paperwork to issue notice to appears, instead, notices to report. And, again, it's essentially the honor system. So, to have 50,000, again, that's just through August. I think we need to keep in mind the Haitians that we saw in Del Rio, that was in September. I can guarantee you the majority of those were also issued notice to reports as well. So, that number, 50,000, 47,000, 48,000, is probably much higher, as you go all the way through the end of 2021.",

      "utterance": "FOX on top of prices over the top and shoppers under siege. Prices jumping 7 percent in December to the highest level in nearly 40 years, everything from bacon and eggs to beef and gasoline seeing huge price spikes. President Biden says the administration is -- quote -- \"making progress\" on slowing the rate of price increases, but Americans, at least for now, may not be feeling it. Inflation expected to be a big topic when the White House holds its briefing this hour. We will go to it once it begins. Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. To FOX Business' Susan Li with more on what's driving this inflation surge -- Susan."

    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Charles, that's right. Get used to these higher prices, because they're going to be here for a while. You're paying the highest price jumps in 40 years in December, so consumer prices, as you mentioned, rising 7 percent last month. And that is the highest year-over-year increase since the summer of 1982, with prices rising almost twice as much as wages were last month. So there's still sticker shock when you go to the grocery stores. Food prices were up 6 percent. Filling up your gas tanks costs a lot more than it did a year ago. And used cars are still fetching premium pricing. Now, despite the inflation report, the White House is sticking to their promises of easing prices this year, the president saying in the statement that this report really underscores that we still have more work to do, with price increases still too high and squeezing family budgets. And despite the White House trying to calm household concerns, our latest FOX Business poll shows that more than a third of Americans are worried about higher prices. In fact, it's the overwhelming top issue for respondents, who say it's the number one issue affecting the economy right now. Government spending, income inequality and supply chain issues came way behind in this list. Also, inflation is forcing the Federal Reserve to take action, Wall Street now forecasting three interest rate increases this year, but the latest data also from the Central Bank showed that economic growth moderated, slowed down in the final three months of last year. So, as you see, Charles, it's really a tough balancing act for Jerome Powell and the Central Bank right now."

We have been talking about this, and I have been talking about this in my note, that it brings us right back to the late '70s, early '80s. Now, interest rates aren't that high yet. But I think people have to get ready for this continued surge in inflation, because it's not going to come down right away. There's this momentum to it. And as much as the momentum goes, it's going to take a while before they can slow it down, and then get it to go in reverse. So I think it's here -- you know, I think it's here all through 2022. And I don't think we see any relief until early 2023."

And I think it's that one part that, that sort of flexible part, particularly wages. We're in this crazy wage spiral. You have got a workers strike; 4.5 million people quit the labor force in November, and for a variety of reasons. They say they don't want to come back. They have got some money saved up. And so the companies have to raise their wages. When they raise their wages, they have to raise prices. So here's the ironic thing. We learned today that real wages went down 2.4 percent. So, here, people are thinking they're getting more money, but they can't -- it won't go as far. This is sort of a death spiral, isn't it, Kenny?"

Some people thought I was out of my mind. They said, you don't understand. It's a different world. It's not. And look what we're seeing. We're seeing exactly that wage price spiral. And I think that's what people are going to have to get used to. And the fact that today's number actually showed that wages went down, but yet prices are still going up, is even more of a problem."

Could the Federal Reserve go that route?"

You still have four million less jobs now than you did before the pandemic. Now, you brought up 1982 ,Charles. I will say this, because stock markets tend to price out what happens in six to nine months. And back in 1982, you had a pretty strong stock market, despite rising rates. And you have seen that five of the six times -- in the six times that we have seen rates go up. So, some are anticipating look, three interest rate increases, pretty much what we expected this year. And that's why you saw stock markets aren't really moving in reaction to the inflation numbers."

And they came out to break the back of unemployment, break the back of inflation, break the back of the economy, and they reduced rates by 10 percentage points -- 10 percent, which was 2 percentage points.

They're not alone in this. There are a number of grocery stores around the country and around the D.C. area that have had issues, especially in the beginning of the week. This is the scene, according to people who were posting on Twitter sharing their photos, of empty shelves around the D.C. area. Now, we walked into a D.C. grocery store on Friday night.

We're up to 120,000 workers short within the consumer packaged goods industry. We have obviously got issues with demand. Consumer demand is off the charts, more people staying at home, fewer kids in school, unfortunately, fewer people in offices and traveling around the country, which means that demand is in the grocery stores. And then we have got this winter weather. All those things are combining to create this situation. And it doesn't help us that we have got a shortage of good, clear communication coming from the administration when it comes to how to manage Omicron right now. We're losing too many people on the front lines because of issues around quarantining, issues around what happens with asymptomatic people. We don't have the clear communication we need to keep people on the front lines when they're healthy enough to do so."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

And when a truck driver says that or someone in your industry says that, that means that maybe a family won't get that meal that they that they go to the supermarket searching for. What does it -- when do you think we should get the all-clear? When should the administration be at least clearer on these things, particularly when we're talking about this massive system? And we have all seen the photographs of these ships outside the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It's integrated. It's an intricate system. And at the very least, we would -- we need to be able to move these trucks, these -- the ports that -- all the intermodal packaging and all of that. When should we get there all- clear from the administration, hey, let's get this thing moving?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREEMAN",
      "utterance": "I'm not a health expert. I will leave that to those. But what we could use from the administration is clear communication. How should we handle people right now who have the Omicron virus? How quickly can they get back into the work force? What do we do? Obviously, to get back in the work force, you need tests. We don't have enough tests right now. How do we prioritize the essential work force to have access to those tests? We don't do that right now. If we want to keep food on the shelves, if we want to keep these places stocked, we need to make sure that truckers can stay on the road, that people can come into manufacturing facilities. We need to be rushing tests to these essential workers to do that. We need to look at states and localities that are now contradicting those areas where we have seen some progress with CDC. CDC limited the quarantine time from 10 days to five days. But we have still got states out there. Washington state, for example, they're maintaining the 10 days. That's a great way to ensure that these shortages continue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "There's been a shortage of truck drivers for a long time. There's been a desperate plea out there. And a lot of folks say the genesis of that is sort of this public opinion, hey, that's not the kind of job that you want, also that there's not the sort of proper training for it. How do we get to the core of some of these issues? That's an amazingly great-paying -- those are great-paying jobs. And I'm sure a lot of Americans, if they knew more and they had the training, Geoff, they would want to take those jobs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREEMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, you're right, Charles. And we're 80,000 truck drivers short right now of where we need to be. But I will give you another angle of this. Sometimes, it doesn't take more drivers; 40 percent of the trucks on the road are driving around empty. They're driving around empty because they're doing what's called backhaul, dropping something off, and going somewhere else to pick something up. If we could have those trucks full, we would address a lot of the capacity issues that are in the system right now. But we can only do that if we have some type of bird's-eye view at the federal level, if we begin to understand and use some type of ground traffic control system, just like we do with an air traffic control system, to empower trucking companies, to empower people who want to ship goods with information on where that closest truck is. There's ways the government could be helpful. This labor shortage is affecting all aspects of our economy. For too long, we haven't paid attention to supply chain. And, today, we're rearing the results of that."

I will say this about the -- we see these images on the screen of empty shelves. The food, beverage, household product, personal care industry for two years have delivered for the American people. They will continue to deliver for the American people. The question is, how disruptive are these waves going to be? I don't know what the virus is going to do. But I know that, with more clear communication from government, better cooperation at the federal -- from the federal level, the state level, we can, I think,nip in the bud some of these problems that we shouldn't be seeing two years into this. Testing is a great example of that. Let's get testing to the essential work force. And we have the -- if the waves come, the waves come, but we're able to keep people on the front lines."

He's taken on the beef industry. He says we should be making more cars, essentially saying that it's competition, that it's business greed. Do you sense there's sort of so some sort of overwhelming greed factor, and that's why shelves are empty, that's why people can't buy the things they would normally buy?"

These people are committed. They have been providing for the American people, again, 300-plus million people every single day. We couldn't be prouder of what they have done.

      "speaker": "BRIAN DEESE, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL",
      "utterance": "Thanks, Jen. Good to be with you all today. I, just at the top, wanted to make a couple of points about -- of context on our current economic situation, and then happy to take questions that you have. So, four quick points. First is the context on our economic recovery. We've learned, based on data that we received over the last several days, that, in 2021, our economy experienced the largest single drop in the unemployment rate on record in the history of the country, down to 3. 9 percent; the most jobs created in any year on record at 6. 4 million; the strongest economic growth of any year in nearly four decades, coming in between 5. 6 -- 5 and 6 percent over the course of 2021, in all likelihood; and real household income -- that is taking into account price increases -- increased in 2021."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "So, just to repeat that context",
      "utterance": "the largest decline in unemployment, the most jobs created, and the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years. The second point is we got December price data today. And I would note that we saw a welcome deceleration in the rate of price increases in a number of respects. In the headline -- price increase data -- we saw a decline month to month to 0.5 percent, down from 0.8 percent in the month before. It's still too high, but moving in the right direction. As I think I say every time here -- and if I don't, I -- it's a mistake -- we never index too heavily on any individual one month of data in any direction. But I would note that we saw, in prices from November to December, a decline in the rate of growth of the prices for food at home, which is a technical way of saying food that people buy in the grocery store. And we saw a drop in the price of energy, both at the gas pump but also natural gas and winter heating costs. And many of you focused on the annual 7 percent rate. If we are trying to look at where we are headed, the month-to-month changes are more instructive. And most independent forecasters continue to project that we will see moderation in price increases over the course of 2022. Third point is the global context for this data, both on prices and on economic growth writ large. What we're seeing right now is these price increases are a global phenomenon, and that reflects the nature of the global challenge of coming through a pandemic crisis and a pandemic- affected recovery. Over the past six months, price increases in the United States and Europe have basically run neck and neck. In December, the E.U. saw its highest recorded inflation in -- on record. Germany saw its highest inflation, in December, since reunification. And so, while there are differences country by country, this is a global phenomenon and driven by these global issues."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Which comes to the fourth point, which is",
      "utterance": "Given the unique strength of the United States economic recovery -- overall growth, as well as the labor market -- we are well positioned to attack the challenges of prices and costs head on. And that's exactly what the President and this administration are doing. And it's his principal focus when it comes to the economy. As he laid out on Friday, his approach to attacking prices and costs are grounded in the -- in the premise that the right way to do this is to build on the economic successes that we have seen, not to abandon them. And that really means, with respect to what we in the administration and Congress can do, is to focus on how we can expand the productive capacity of the economy; how we can make sure that our economy can produce more goods and services more cheaply and easily across the country; get more people working; and get to the strong, sustainable growth that we are beginning to see -- and if we can address these present challenges, we'll hopefully see going forward. The President has outlined a very specific three-part plan to do that around unsticking supply chains, protecting consumers, and promoting competition and trying to actually reduce directly some of the most significant costs that Americans' families face. And obviously, key elements of the Build Back Better framework go directly at that issue. So, I'm happy to talk about the policy details behind that plan in general."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But I think, just to summarize",
      "utterance": "We have a historically strong economic growth and labor market outcomes. We have -- saw some welcomed deceleration, but price increases that are still too high; decidedly a global phenomenon happening everywhere, but we in the United States are uniquely well positioned that -- against that challenge. And that's -- that's the President's focus."

      "utterance": "All right. Jeff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "Brian, thanks for coming today. The White House and other economists, last spring and fall, were talking about inflation being transitory. And I think at least the expectation when we were talking about it last spring was that it was going to be well taken care of by now. What did you get wrong? What did economists writ large get wrong? And how should Americans -- why should Americans be confident when you say prices are going to get better later this year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "So, I think that if we look at the situation earlier in the year, a number of projections and forecasts have come out differently than we anticipated. If you -- if you look at employment, for example, virtually nobody was projecting that we would see unemployment fall as quickly as it -- as it has and get to 3. 9 percent by the end of this year. That's four years faster than the median forecast. And so, I think we've seen a number of unanticipated outcomes. When it comes to prices, what we have -- what we have said consistently -- focused consistently is that this is a global phenomenon; it is connected to the pandemic and the issues that that has raised. Certainly the supply chain challenges that have evolved over the course of time, through the Delta variant and over the course of the fall, have been issues that we've had to go and tackle head on. But I think that the -- nomenclature aside, we find ourselves in a position now where we're looking forward, and most forecasters are projecting that the price increases will moderate. Our focus here is looking at what are the concrete, practical steps that we can take to try to help ensure that outcome and try to help accelerate relief where we can -- where we appropriately can. So, when it comes to something like the supply chain challenges, those manifested more significantly than people were anticipating over the course of the summer and early fall, both because of COVID factors but also buying behavior of major retailers and major freight movers. And so, we went into action over the course of the fall to try to help address those issues and the bottlenecking we were seeing at ports. Made very significant progress on that -- a 40 percent decline in the amount of time that a container is sitting at the dock. And at the same time, we still have work to do on that front, which is why, even this month, we're going to take additional steps with ports across the country to set up inland locations to move products and impose new fees on empty containers that are sitting idle at our ports. So, we're going to -- we're going to stay at that and other issues. And we believe that that's the best way that we can, again, help to expand the economy's capacity to deliver goods and services to the American people."

      "utterance": "Thank you, Jen. And thank you, Brian, for being here. I have a quick question on some of the practical matters that you've talked about. Are you taking any steps to help people afford food? Despite the figure that you mentioned -- that, month to month, the prices have gone down -- my colleagues are reporting about how people are finding shortages on the shelves, how the stuff that is there is more expensive. Is there anything you can do to help families pay for that food?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say a number of things. One is, when the President came into office, he prioritized early passing the American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Plan has historic investments in actually addressing food insecurity for people who couldn't afford food. As a result, we saw hunger in the United States decline in 2021. It also included a -- the Child Tax Credit -- another resource that went directly -- that are going directly to families to help address the typical costs that they face on a monthly basis. And, as a result, we saw child poverty fall by 35 to 40 percent in America over the course of 2021. And we saw -- as I mentioned, we saw some welcome deceleration in the increase in the cost of food this month. And we're going to keep focused on those ways that we can address the typical pocketbook issues that the American people face. And this is one of the issues why the core economic logic behind the President's -- behind the Build Back Better plan is important in this context, because for working Americans who are -- who are benefiting from a strong labor market and more job opportunities but also struggling with costs not only of food but costs of childcare or cost of health care, the components of the Build Back Better plan would directly address those issues by putting -- by providing a tax cut to families directly in their pocketbook, and then reducing other of their most salient costs. So, for a lot of the families that you're talking about, if they only had to pay 7 percent of their income in childcare, that would free up a lot of resources to invest in other monthly needs. So..."

    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say, first, what we have done is historic and has made a big difference. Number two, our central economic legislative priority is getting those elements of Build Back Better in place. And part of the urgency of that is to address precisely the challenges that you are identifying. So -- and beyond that, we are looking at ways that we can unstick elements of the supply chain that may be getting in the way of, for example, physical product getting to market. And certainly we have seen -- we have seen -- over the course of this fall, we've seen concerns about product shortages in particular categories and otherwise. What we see overall, if you look at retail inventories, including grocery store inventories, they're actually higher now than they were pre-pandemic -- so, in a pretty healthy place. But that doesn't mean that there's logistical challenges at bottlenecks that may be localized. And to the degree that we can work with private sector companies and help ease the challenges in their private sector supply chains, certainly we will -- we'll remain open to doing that."

Can you talk about how much you believe China's latest round of lockdowns and its zero-case doctrine is having an impact on inflation since, obviously, it's impacting the global manufacturing? And has the administration had any conversations with China about the factory workers, about the lockdowns?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "So, there's no question that the global nature of the pandemic affects global supply chains and has affected the flow of goods across economies. One of the things that we did earlier this fall was actually set up what we call an early warning system, working with a number of our American companies that rely on sourcing input components or products from Southeast Asian countries to identify where there might be COVID outbreaks in those countries, and work with the State Department and USAID and the CDC on the ground in those countries to do what we can to actually help to stabilize the situation and reduce the potential impact of a shutdown or a lockdown or otherwise. With respect to China specifically and the current moment, we're monitoring it very closely. As we assess the issue today, the lockdowns are most likely to have the effect isolated in China because the production facilities in those geographies are principally suppliers to the Chinese market. But the situation is fluid and ongoing. It's something that we're monitoring in real-time and working across the interagency, including the State Department and the CDC, to try to keep a handle on."

    {

And that's consistent with the administration's view. And you have a President and an administration that's waking up every day and thinking about the practical actions we can take to try to help accelerate that, protecting -- unsticking supply chains, protecting consumers -- make sure that consumers aren't being taken advantage of in a moment of uncertainty."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "Well, if you look at -- if you look at the projections by independent forecasters, then you see moderation over the course of '22. And you get back to -- you get back to levels that are closer to pre- pandemic normal. But I think that in the -- in the short term, in the immediate term, I think there -- we'll focus on the practical steps that we can take; focus - - working with Congress, encouraging Congress to take practical steps that would have real, concrete impact for those families in their lives right now; and delivering in practical, concrete ways. And I think that, as we have seen with what we were able to get done in 2021 to deliver that type of relief directly to families, that can make all the difference. And that can really help to bridge this gap for families and also help to get more people to work, that we continue to face real challenges where parents and other caregivers in this economy want to get back to work but are held back because of the cost of actually finding a quality way to take care of a kid or take care of an elderly parent -- that's compounded by the pandemic. And us acting now to help address those costs for families would not only provide some peace of mind to those families. You know, if every American family with kids knew they weren't going to pay more than 7 percent of their income in childcare, that would be a big weight off their shoulders; it also would be a big benefit to the labor market by allowing more people to work as productively as they -- as they choose to."

      "utterance": "Hey, Charles. Good afternoon to you. These numbers are pretty stunning and they're very likely to crank up some of the criticism of the Biden administration and their catch-and-release policy. So, we can pull up some video right here that we shot here in La Joya yesterday of migrants arriving and smiling and waving to our cameras. Well, explain the background on all this. Back in March, when the border crisis really first exploded, the Biden administration started mass-releasing migrants with what are called NTRs. That stands for notice to report. And what those are is a request to please turn yourself into an ICE office in a city of your choosing within 60 days. And now, for the very first time, we got some brand-new DHS data that shows how few of those migrants actually did that. If we can pull this graphic up right now, again, brand- new from DHS, what those numbers show is, between March and August, DHS released about 104,000 illegal immigrants into the country with NTRs, but only about 50,000 of them actually reported to ICE. More than 47,000, as you mentioned, never showed up to ICE within that 60- day window. And then about 6,600 also did not turn themselves in, but it still was not within that 60-day window at the time this data was compiled. All that, in a nutshell, essentially shows that about half of those migrants who got NTRs never showed up to an ICE office. And NTRs have since been discontinued entirely. Meanwhile, take a look at these wild photos out of Laredo, Texas, yesterday. Texas DPS pulling over this truck, and take a look at what they find inside, 27 illegal immigrants being smuggled inside the cab of that vehicle, all of them crammed inside. Texas State Troopers telling me the driver was a U.S. citizen from Houston, who was later arrested and charged with multiple counts of human smuggling. Also, take a look at this mug shot right here, just here in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, four sex offenders arrested at the border in a span of 48 hours, including this previously deported Mexican national you're looking at. He had previous charges out of the Corpus Christi area for aggravated sexual assault of a child and the continuous sexual abuse of a child. And then, lastly, want to pull up this photo here from Del Rio Sector. What you're looking at here are multiple unaccompanied minors, just over the weekend, Border Patrol there reporting they picked up more than 70 of these unaccompanied minors, who turned themselves in with no family or with total strangers, many of them telling agents they have no idea where their parents are. And then back out here live, more on Del Rio Sector. Migrants continue to come in from all around the world. Agents there saying just this last week they got more than 30 from Uzbekistan, four from Tajikistan, one from Syria, and one from Mauritania in Northwest Africa. We will send it back to you."

Chad, I mean, we continue to hear these numbers and these stories over and over again. And here's the thing. They continue to amaze. They continue to be mind-boggling that you would let someone go and say, by the way, come back later and show up for a hearing. I'm almost shocked that half did, to be quite frank with you. This NTR program apparently did not -- it's been discontinued, but who thought this would work in the first place?"

      "speaker": "CHAD WOLF, FORMER ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY",

So there's no way to know where they are. And, look, the reason why they did it, if you recall, back in March, April, May, and June, it's because they were overwhelmed at the border, because they had -- throughout the campaign and throughout all their policies since they took over, they have been encouraging migrants to come to the border to claim asylum, knowing that the majority of those are false claims. And so it's no surprise that they got overwhelmed. And by getting overwhelmed, they couldn't do the proper paperwork to issue notice to appears, instead, notices to report. And, again, it's essentially the honor system. So, to have 50,000, again, that's just through August. I think we need to keep in mind the Haitians that we saw in Del Rio, that was in September. I can guarantee you the majority of those were also issued notice to reports as well. So, that number, 50,000, 47,000, 48,000, is probably much higher, as you go all the way through the end of 2021."

I mean, really, it's -- I'm asking because we have got a lot of citizens in this country who -- we're the greatest country in the world. We have got the kindness hearts in the world. We're the most generous. We have lost blood, we have lost treasures, we have spent trillions to help everyone around the planet.

      "utterance": "Well, I think you laid out the conservative case pretty well there. What's interesting and what we heard from Aishah just a moment ago is that the political arithmetic hasn't changed in the Senate. So the problem that Joe Biden is going to run into in 2022 is the same problem he had in 2021, which is that he doesn't have the votes. And so the difference, though, is that this is not just a disagreement over how much money to spend, over dollars and cents in Build Back Better. The difference, and we heard the president lay it out yesterday, is that he said, essentially, that if you do not support this carve-out, that you are on the wrong side of history, that you're on the side of Bull Connor, Jefferson Davis, and some other unsavory characters."
