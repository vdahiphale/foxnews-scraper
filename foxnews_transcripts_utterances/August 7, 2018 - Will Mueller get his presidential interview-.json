Just look at what's happened on the conservative speakers on college campuses. And after liberal radio hosts flopped on Air America -- remember them -- well, some democrats thought to revive the fairness doctrine to snuff out conservative talk radio. Thankfully that went nowhere. But now they've moved onto the internet and squelching political speech there. A leaked proposal circulating amongst democrats outlines a detailed plan to take over the internet by regulating digital platforms and purging content they deem harmful or inaccurate. In other words, information they don't like. They would require social media users to be tracked and labeled according to how reasonable their content is deemed to be. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy even hinted at this yesterday, tweeting, Infowars is a tip of a giant iceberg of hates and lies, that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.

Translation: the survival of the democratic party depends on it. There's an old saying in TV and radio that content is king. Same goes for the internet. If they can shut down political speech on the grounds that it's hateful, you have to ask where does this end? If you want to see hate, check out some of the comments on my Twitter feed after the show tonight. Then you'll see hateful. Why do leftists always seem to escape big techs censors? I don't know Louis Farrakhan comes to mind.

And what about those who traffic in violence? If Facebook really cares about standards or safety, I don't think they would be granting ANTIFA chapters from coast to coast where their pages can plug their next thuggish beat down of conservatives with their black hoods and all.

But since a utility can't refuse to give electricity to a family because they disagree with their views or heaven forbid because they're of a different race, they act in the public interest. Ted Cruz, by the way, in response to the Alex Jones purge said tech companies have quote a degree of power and an ability to censor that William Randolph Hearst at the height of Yellow Journalism could never have imagined.

But if I were Trump's lawyer -- I'm not -- I would not under any circumstances allow him to testify, because all you need is one question in which he answers truthfully, but somebody else answers in a different way, say he says, I didn't know about the meeting at the Trump Tower involving the Russians, and Cohen says, yes, he did, then you have an opportunity to spring that perjury trap.

If he issues the subpoena to force President Trump to be interviewed by him, to go to the grand jury, for example, certainly President Trump has to accept that subpoena. You can subpoena a president. But then when President Trump invokes executive privilege, under the law, the current law in the D.C. circuit in resealed case, it is going to be very difficult and time-consuming for Bob Mueller to ask the questions he wants to ask, particularly about obstructions. And there is absolutely no guarantee that he will win. You're talking about the heart of executive privilege here, presidential communications and presidential thought processes. And Mueller would have to show that it's very, very important evidence and that he can't get it anywhere else. And don't forget, when Jaworski won the tapes case against Nixon, and when Cox won the earlier case, they knew their subpoenas were incredibly narrowly drawn. They knew the tapes existed.

So although I think in the end if a subpoena was issued and challenged, I think Mueller would be able to get some testimony from the president if he stayed away from issues that are covered by these privileges.

Former Governor Mike Huckabee is also here to react to a loony left wing -- Rosie O'Donnell's latest stunt in front of the White House. You could almost hear it last night from our set.

Facebook followed suite, unpublishing four of Jones' pages, claiming that the videos on those pages violated that hate speech policy. Hours later YouTube decided it wasn't going to miss out on all that censorship fun and YouTube suspended the Alex Jones channel with its 2.4 million subscribers. Well it's easy to dismiss concerns about big techs actions all coordinated it seems to shut down Jones, because of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories. But this isn't about Alex Jones. This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.

This has happened to conservative commentators like Ben Shapiro, Dave Ruben and Dennis Prager. For many on the left, the view seems to become if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking. Just look at what's happened on the conservative speakers on college campuses. And after liberal radio hosts flopped on Air America -- remember them -- well, some democrats thought to revive the fairness doctrine to snuff out conservative talk radio. Thankfully that went nowhere. But now they've moved onto the internet and squelching political speech there. A leaked proposal circulating amongst democrats outlines a detailed plan to take over the internet by regulating digital platforms and purging content they deem harmful or inaccurate. In other words, information they don't like. They would require social media users to be tracked and labeled according to how reasonable their content is deemed to be. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy even hinted at this yesterday, tweeting, Infowars is a tip of a giant iceberg of hates and lies, that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival or our democracy depends on it."

I don't know Louis Farrakhan comes to mind. He's a casual racist, of course, and an anti-Semite who called white people \"potential humans,\" praised Hitler and blamed Jews for 9/11. Well he's still standing tall on his Facebook page -- has a million followers. And what about those who traffic in violence? If Facebook really cares about standards or safety, I don't think they would be granting ANTIFA chapters from coast to coast where their pages can plug their next thuggish beat down of conservatives with their black hoods and all.

Our only point usually about speech is limiting it if there's a direct incitement to violence, or material that is injurious to children. But political speech in general, we want more. Now, while Facebook and apple are private companies and thus aren't actors for first amendment companies, they be really careful with these moves to circumscribe certain groups political speech, because voters in the future might just demand that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube be treated more like public utility, public utilities that have to operate in the public interest. But since a utility can't refuse to give electricity to a family because they disagree with their views or heaven forbid because they're of a different race, they act in the public interest. Ted Cruz, by the way, in response to the Alex Jones purge said tech companies have quote a degree of power and an ability to censor that William Randolph Hearst at the height of Yellow Journalism could never have imagined. They have the ability if there is a speaker that is disfavored simply to silence the speaker. Your words float off into oblivion and nobody hears them. Well, he's right about their power. The big five tech companies are now worth an estimated $4 trillion. Well, that figure puts them above the GDP of all but seven countries on the planet. The immense size of these companies is concerning, but so too is the speed with which they can succumb to external pressure.

It is razor tight, and right literally everybody in the room has their eye on one country. There is only one country that does not have all of its precincts in, and that is Delaware County. And this is a big deal because Delaware County is the country that President Trump came to on Saturday. It is where he held his big rally for Republican Troy Balderson. This is also a county that has been reliably Republican over the years, and yet when the early vote came in, Danny O'Connor, the Democrat, won the early vote by about 2,000 votes. So that has everybody here very nervous. They're watching Delaware County very closely. And based on the unofficial results I'm looking at right now on the Ohio secretary of state website, we have 95 percent of the (inaudible) in Delaware County and -- and Balderson is ahead 54-45 (ph). So we'll see if that holds. The other county that we've been watching all night, Franklin County. That's the county just outside the -- the suburbs of Columbus. This is where the Democrat, Danny O'Connor is from. It's also what the Republican, Troy Balderson had alluded to last night at his rally. He made a little bit of a (inaudible) he said, you don't want to see someone from Franklin County representing us (ph) (inaudible) Democrat Danny O'Connor of course is from Franklin County. And now O'Connor is ahead there, 65-35. not a huge surprise there, but this is so close, Laura. The other thing I'm hearing a lot from people in the room, the possibility of an automatic recount. If the difference is 0.5 percent or less, that triggers an automatic recount. It is very close. But so far right now, still outside that automatic recount margin, Laura. It is very exciting in here but everybody's still very nervous and cautiously optimistic. That's crazy (ph). I keep hearing over and over (inaudible) --"

Well, as we touched on earlier in the angle, one of your favorites -- and I know you've missed her on daily television -- Rosie O'Donnell has gone into full conspiracy theory mode with regard to President Trump. And last night -- about how many blocks is it? 16, 17 blocks from here?

Where did that noise come from that damaged the ear -- the hearing of the people who were working for the state department down in the Cuban embassy. I think we now know. Rosie and her team had gone down there and that's what caused that physical damage. One other observation, Laura. I thought Rosie had moved to Canada. You know, she promised that if Trump got elected she would go. So I don't know what she was able to do. I guess she was coming back into the country for a brief visit.

But I think what we all find a little bit disingenuous is that her attitude is rather than accept the election results from 2016, suck it up and say we're going to do better next time, their idea is let's invalidate the election results because we don't like how they turned out.

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "A dramatic new turn may be imminent in the showdown between the Trump legal team and special prosecutor Bob Mueller. According to FOX News sources, Trump attorneys are preparing to send the special counsel a letter largely turning down any questions related to obstruction of justice during a potential presidential interview. But Rudy Giuliani gave an interview just posted on \"Politico\" where he leaves the door open to some limited questioning about obstruction, which is an interesting new development. Will this spark, though, a major escalation between both sides in the Russia probe? Joining us now to analyze, Alan Dershowitz, author of the big bestseller, \"The Case against Impeaching Trump,\" and Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent council in the Whitewater investigation. We'll also get into the cantankerous T.S. Ellis, the federal district judge who is presiding over the Paul Manafort trial. But let's get to this breaking news, Rudy Giuliani and this \"Politico\" interview. You probably haven't read it, either of you, but he seems to leave open the possibility of a very narrow set of questions, if it can be narrowed, on obstruction. Alan, I'll go to you first. What might be the wisdom in that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS",
      "utterance": "I think Giuliani's tactic is to be able to say to the public, look, our president was willing to speak and Mueller turned him down. I think he's Mueller an offer that Mueller can't really accept. He's putting forth a kind of narrow window. If Mueller accepts it, then game on and we'll see some narrow questioning. But if I were Trump's lawyer -- I'm not -- I would not under any circumstances allow him to testify, because all you need is one question in which he answers truthfully, but somebody else answers in a different way, say he says, I didn't know about the meeting at the Trump Tower involving the Russians, and Cohen says, yes, he did, then you have an opportunity to spring that perjury trap. So in the end, I don't think lawyers generally will advise a client to testify or sit down with a prosecutor. But I think this client wants to be able to say I offered to sit down and it was Mueller who turned me down. So I think that's the strategy."

It can only be two to three hours long, narrow set of questions on collusion. They provide info on FBI information first, so they want that information, show proof that Trump committed a crime, show testimony is needed to end a probe, and curtail obstruction questions. So that's the one that kind of was fleshed out a little bit more tonight in Giuliani's comments to \"Politico,\" that last bullet point. Sol, you're reaction to these latest developments? Do you agree with what Professor Dershowitz is positing there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON WISENBERG, PARTNER, NELSON-MULLINS",
      "utterance": "No prosecutor worth his salt is going to accept those kinds of preconditions. But there's a reason -- and I do agree with, and have long agreed with Professor Dershowitz's assertion that the president shouldn't go in and answer these questions. It's far too dangerous. But there's a reason Bob Mueller has put up with this dance for so long. And I think a lot of people don't understand it. If he issues the subpoena to force President Trump to be interviewed by him, to go to the grand jury, for example, certainly President Trump has to accept that subpoena. You can subpoena a president. But then when President Trump invokes executive privilege, under the law, the current law in the D.C. circuit in resealed case, it is going to be very difficult and time-consuming for Bob Mueller to ask the questions he wants to ask, particularly about obstructions. And there is absolutely no guarantee that he will win. You're talking about the heart of executive privilege here, presidential communications and presidential thought processes. And Mueller would have to show that it's very, very important evidence and that he can't get it anywhere else. And don't forget, when Jaworski won the tapes case against Nixon, and when Cox won the earlier case, they knew their subpoenas were incredibly narrowly drawn. They knew the tapes existed. They knew there were potentially incriminatory conversations on those tapes. Mueller does not have that."

You can't even be in court. So the reason why Mueller has put up with these ridiculous preconditions is that he probably can't win if he goes to court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Alan, they have already gamed this out. You have Emmet Flood, one of the top partners at Williams and Connolly who's running this side of the legal prep inside the White House. He clerked for Justice Scalia. He was my co-clerk on the Secord Circuit for Ralph Winter. Brilliant guy. They've already gamed this out, correct? This is probably already briefed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, they had gamed it out a long time ago. Remember, that was the firm that represented Bill Clinton in his efforts to try to prevent testimony. In addition to his claim of executive privilege, there's also constitutional argument, and that is that since a senator and a congressman can't be questioned about what they did on the floor of the Senate, I don't believe a president can be questioned about why he pardoned or why he fired or why he tweeted or why he exercised any of his powers under Article Two of the Constitution or the First Amendment. So although I think in the end if a subpoena was issued and challenged, I think Mueller would be able to get some testimony from the president if he stayed away from issues that are covered by these privileges. But in the end it would be a Pyrrhic victory. It would take him so much time that it would guarantee that the report could not be written until after the midterm election."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, my response is that you can never extrapolate from one example. There was a very good story in the \"Washington Post\" in June by a guy named Christopher Ingraham showing that in fact both illegal immigrants and legal immigrants commit much less crimes in fact than natural-born Americans, which needs to be kept in mind. But I also want to note if we want to look at the big picture issues, things we can extrapolate from. These wars the U.S. has been fighting, like in Iraq, have actually exacerbated the immigration issue. And if people want to deal with lower immigration, the U.S. ought to start to think about withdrawing from these wars and avoiding --"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, we're not here to debate the wars. I would probably agree with you on a lot of the wars issue. We're talking about our right, our sovereign right as a people to decide who gets to come in, and then when you're here as basically a privilege that we grant you, who doesn't get to stay. And we have violent criminals who are released onto the streets, people who are here illegally, and, Tom, as you know, who have been deported multiple times, who come back, commit heinous crimes or DWI. They have a trail of tears behind them. And we still have the ACLU out there beating the drums for more illegal immigrants in the United States. And I think this has got to stop."

      "utterance": "Let me respond to the meaningless quote that he just made that illegal aliens and aliens here illegally commit less crimes than U.S. citizens. That's not the issue. The issue is how many crimes could have been prevented if they weren't here. So for people to say they commit less crimes. The question is how many crimes could have been prevented if we have secure borders and immigration law that made sense. That's the question."

It's specific police data culled through. It was painstakingly specific and well documented. So that's another fact. By the way, I want to put it as one full screen. We're running long. Issues that are important to the American voters, America's top problem facing the U.S., immigration, number one at 22 percent of the public. Government, poor leadership, 19 percent, race relations down at seven percent. Healthcare is down at three percent. Immigration, Dan, the number-one issue for Americans. And I don't think it's because Americans want more illegal immigration in the United States. You can close it out real quick."

Authorities discovered hundreds of rounds of ammo and firearm purchase receipts in Dayon's home along with bomb-building information. Joining us exclusively now with his reaction is House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Congressman, it's great to see you. I'm so relieved this guy was found, this was prevented. Lord knows what might have happened. We're also awaiting the election results from Ohio 12, which we're going to talk to you about, Congressman Scalise.

I first want to thank, once again, our United States capitol police. They were very quick to act when my office received this threat. They sent the information on to Capitol police. Capitol police did research, found out that this man has had some real serious concerns. And it was hard to track him down because he was trying to use aliases. But ultimately they found him. And he's in custody, in federal custody. And hopefully he gets a serious sentence, because you can't allow this kind of threats and violence against peoples based on their political views."

You saw what happened to Charlie Kirk and his colleague Candace Owens the other morning in Philadelphia. This seems to be ratcheting up. The left blames President Trump. They say, well, he's calling the news fake news and calling them out and that's making people more and more anxious."

In fact, liberals need to call this out. They need to speak up, just as we're speaking up saying there's no place for it on the Republican or Democrat siding. I think people on the left need to be as vocal about calling out this kind of violence."

In fact, when Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee that I sit on just a few weeks ago, I brought this up, the bias that we're seeing on Facebook since they put a new algorithm in place to change the way that people get their newsfeeds, and where they're literally starting to filter in, from what we've seen, a left-leaning way and having a bias against conservatives. We've raised it to them, and they have gotten back to me to let me know that this is something they're looking into. But we need to watch it closely, because if they get into a position where it looks like they're trying to become the platform of the left, there are other social media sites people can go to and will go to if it becomes a liberal site. They don't want their site to become a liberal --"
