JOSH KRAUSHAAR, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"NATIONAL JOURNAL\": It does feel like the walls are closing and when it comes to the Trump White House and possible connections with Russia and WikiLeaks. Stone is merely one of the many campaign officials on that Trump campaign to now be indicted, and it feels like the heat is on in the White House. On the other hand, from the political point of view, if you remember back in the summer of 2016, Trump was calling publicly on Russia to release the emails, and Stone was tweeting about this for everyone who follows him on Twitter to see. So this was baked in politically to the 2016 election. And I don't think the public and certainly the politics of this changes until Mueller releases his report, and actually there is some evidence of actual collusion which there has not been proven to be so far. So the politics I don't think really change a whole lot even though this is another damning connection from that Trump campaign to Russia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We find out that WikiLeaks, or the Russians have hacked the DNC. WikiLeaks discloses its stuff, and after it happens, someone in the Trump campaign says to Stone, what's going on. So that suggests that there was no knowledge beforehand. And also I think that does not really support any idea that there was some sort of collusion scheme or conspiracy going on between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the main thing to remember reading this indictment is Roger Stone has always been kind of a B.S. artist. He brags about all sorts of dirty deeds some of which he hasn't even done, and he was doing that in connection to this case in public. And then the House had him come for an interview and asked him about those statements under oath, and he allegedly lied about it all, and it has all caught up with him.

      "utterance": "A seven count indictment for Roger Stone, and in that indictment, a number of different parts of it, but this says \"After the July 22nd, 2016, release of stolen DNC emails by Organization One,\" that's WikiLeaks, \"a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and whether other damaging information Organization One had regarding the Clinton campaign. Stone thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization One,\" again, WikiLeaks. The counts that Stone now faces, one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, up to five years there, five counts of false statements, five years per count, potentially, one count of witness tampering, and there's 20 years in prison of that, meaning he's facing a maximum of 50 years in prison. Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, putting out a statement saying \"The indictment today is yet again nothing more than another false statement charge. It doesn't allege collusion. Indeed, it charges no underlying wrongdoing by Mr. Stone or anyone else. Seems like we are coming to an end.\" What about all this? Let's digest it with our panel, bring them back, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Josh Kraushaar, the political editor for the \"National Journal,\" and Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" OK, Matthew, what do you make of the Roger Stone indictment? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: What happened to Richard Nixon in Watergate is a tragedy, Bret, but Roger Stone seems to have read it as an instruction manual if the indictment is correct. And nonetheless, the crime for which he was indicted are process crimes. They are not the crimes that Mueller was appointed to investigate. And so I think the administration is to able to create some space between what happened to Roger Stone and the president himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Josh? JOSH KRAUSHAAR, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"NATIONAL JOURNAL\": It does feel like the walls are closing and when it comes to the Trump White House and possible connections with Russia and WikiLeaks. Stone is merely one of the many campaign officials on that Trump campaign to now be indicted, and it feels like the heat is on in the White House. On the other hand, from the political point of view, if you remember back in the summer of 2016, Trump was calling publicly on Russia to release the emails, and Stone was tweeting about this for everyone who follows him on Twitter to see. So this was baked in politically to the 2016 election. And I don't think the public and certainly the politics of this changes until Mueller releases his report, and actually there is some evidence of actual collusion which there has not been proven to be so far. So the politics I don't think really change a whole lot even though this is another damning connection from that Trump campaign to Russia."

      "utterance": "What we don't know, Byron, is the senior Trump campaign official who is ordered to talk to Stone. And the White House and Rudy Giuliani saying it doesn't touch the president. Obviously, he was intimately involved in the campaign. So we don't know a lot from this indictment even though it's seven counts and laid out. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": That passage that you read and that you just referred to about July 22nd, 2016, is very important, one of the most important things is it's after WikiLeaks is published. We find out that WikiLeaks, or the Russians have hacked the DNC. WikiLeaks discloses its stuff, and after it happens, someone in the Trump campaign says to Stone, what's going on. So that suggests that there was no knowledge beforehand. And also I think that does not really support any idea that there was some sort of collusion scheme or conspiracy going on between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the main thing to remember reading this indictment is Roger Stone has always been kind of a B.S. artist. He brags about all sorts of dirty deeds some of which he hasn't even done, and he was doing that in connection to this case in public. And then the House had him come for an interview and asked him about those statements under oath, and he allegedly lied about it all, and it has all caught up with him. But as far as revealing some kind of scheme or conspiracy, it just doesn't do it."

What's striking to me domestically is that there are these rising stars on the left in the Democratic Party that didn't have the moral courage to even criticize Maduro, and I'm talking about Ocasio-Cortez, and you have Ilhan Omar in Minnesota who put out statements without criticizing Maduro and even being to the left of Bernie Sanders on this subject.

We realize that they are a lot more than just the folks who work in Washington and are part of that big massive bureaucracy. But the loser, I'm going to go to sports. The Super Bowl is next week, but the Washington Redskins are still not in the playoffs. Dan Snyder has presided over a whole host of losing teams, and I think the Trump White House doesn't talk to the press a whole lot. Redskins President Bruce Allen held his first press conference in 588 days. They're not very media friendly, and it's not good when you're losing so many football games that you can't offer some explanations to your fans."

In fact, the first sign to me that this shutdown was probably going to come to an end and soon was when Trump retreated on the State of the Union earlier this week. My loser, Bret, is the news industry, which amidst the scandals involving stories about the special counsel, about the Covington Catholic kids, is also experiencing a wave of layoffs.
