      "sentences": "Neil, we're getting some new and disturbing video today via Customs and Border Protection. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What they're not sure about is whether what we're about to see is a one-off or a growing trend. Let's show you that video first given to us by CBP. Officials say it was recorded on the Arizona-Mexico border Saturday night. A group of men, at least two of whom are armed, with what appear to be automatic or semiautomatic weapons, pull up in a truck, a woman and a young boy with them. Carrying their weapons, they walk right up to the border. The armed men then stop on the Mexican side, while another man who appears to be unarmed escorts the mother and child through the fence, points the way to them, and then hops back through. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } CBP, by the way, moved in quickly to detain the woman and her son, who are Guatemalan. The armed men slipped away into the night in Northern Mexico. Now, given the ongoing drug smuggling activity along the border, weapons are nothing new, but officials say it is disturbing to see them in the hands of apparent human smugglers right on the border. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meantime, as you were mentioning, several thousand Central American migrants are currently in Southern Mexico heading toward the U.S. border, by train by bus and on foot, but they are still around 1,000 miles from the border itself. It's difficult to get an accurate estimate of the numbers, but Associated Press reporters who are actually traveling with the migrants put the number at around 3,000. Yesterday, Mexican police detained more than 350 of those migrants in what appeared to be a well-planned operation to disrupt the caravan. That may have reduced the numbers. And again, Neil, we cannot emphasize enough those numbers are frequently inaccurate. But President Trump's Twitter claim today that the caravan is 20,000-strong, according to all the information we can find, Neil, seems to be very much inflated -- Neil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So that, in essence, is a very small number of them. Obviously, President Trump has called on the Mexican government to do more. Remains to be seen if they will follow what are essentially presidential orders -- Neil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He's the only one actually throwing ideas out there, trying to think out of the box on what to do. And every time he does something, the courts hold him up. Congress hasn't done anything. The Democratic leadership hasn't offered up one proposal, one fix. So, as I have said many times, we need to do operationally what Congress is failing to do legislative. ICE needs to do a national operation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look for these family groups and single adults who had their day in court and a federal judge said they got to go home. We got to execute those orders, because I ran an operation like that three-and-half-years ago. And the result were, the border numbers went down significantly, because we show consequence deterrence. I think HSI portion of ICE needs to go down to Mexico, work with our vetted units, the federal police that we vetted, and identify these criminal cartels, dismantle them, take their money, and imprison them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look, any smuggling Mexico is also illegal.

I appreciate what Mexico's doing right now. But my concern is this. Is it a dog and pony show to just appease the president for a short time? Or are they actually going to sustain an operation that's going to result in the arrest and removal of Central Americans back to their home country.",

As such, the moment for the White House to assert some privilege to prevent this testimony from being heard has long since passed.\" This morning, the president said they are taking a firm position, after providing dozens of witness interviews and over a million records.

The bottom line is that this would cause massive cuts across the board to doctors and hospital pay.

These are some of the late images we have gotten, new video we have gotten from yesterday that shows how Mexican authorities crack down on a migrant wave going on in their country. They round them up on a big old train, several such trains. And they're successful at rounding them up. Here's the problem for us. They're on their way here. And we don't know how to deal with them. We just know that there are quite a few of them. So Mexico cracking down, and we're at a loss as to figure what the heck is up. Jonathan Hunt in Los Angeles with the very latest on that -- Jonathan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN HUNT, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neil, we're getting some new and disturbing video today via Customs and Border Protection. What they're not sure about is whether what we're about to see is a one-off or a growing trend. Let's show you that video first given to us by CBP. Officials say it was recorded on the Arizona-Mexico border Saturday night. A group of men, at least two of whom are armed, with what appear to be automatic or semiautomatic weapons, pull up in a truck, a woman and a young boy with them. Carrying their weapons, they walk right up to the border. The armed men then stop on the Mexican side, while another man who appears to be unarmed escorts the mother and child through the fence, points the way to them, and then hops back through. CBP, by the way, moved in quickly to detain the woman and her son, who are Guatemalan. The armed men slipped away into the night in Northern Mexico. Now, given the ongoing drug smuggling activity along the border, weapons are nothing new, but officials say it is disturbing to see them in the hands of apparent human smugglers right on the border. Meantime, as you were mentioning, several thousand Central American migrants are currently in Southern Mexico heading toward the U.S. border, by train by bus and on foot, but they are still around 1,000 miles from the border itself. It's difficult to get an accurate estimate of the numbers, but Associated Press reporters who are actually traveling with the migrants put the number at around 3,000. Yesterday, Mexican police detained more than 350 of those migrants in what appeared to be a well-planned operation to disrupt the caravan. That may have reduced the numbers. And again, Neil, we cannot emphasize enough those numbers are frequently inaccurate. But President Trump's Twitter claim today that the caravan is 20,000-strong, according to all the information we can find, Neil, seems to be very much inflated -- Neil."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, Jonathan, there are disputed reports as well that the Mexicans aren't doing enough to either stop the train or stop these folks from getting on the train, or that they're just looking the other way. We just don't know. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, we don't know. The evidence we have from the video we saw coming in yesterday was that they appeared to carry out this pretty well-coordinated operation to round up some of those migrants. But they got in the end the total figure we hear was 367. Now, there are at least several thousand, 3,000, according to the AP, in the current caravan. So that, in essence, is a very small number of them. Obviously, President Trump has called on the Mexican government to do more. Remains to be seen if they will follow what are essentially presidential orders -- Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Jonathan Hunt, thank you very, very much. It does show the renewed dangerous for our border agents there and how to deal with it, looking how a lot of these armed men, for example, are helping in one case, as Jonathan pointed out, escort a woman and a child to the U.S. border. Former acting ICE Director Thomas Homan. Thomas, good to have you back with us. You can understand obviously the president then talking or discussing the possibility of sending armed soldiers to the border to counter this, but it just seems to escalate by the minute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THOMAS HOMAN, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Look, it's very concerning. As I have said on your show many times, Neil, none of this is happening on the northern border without the coordination and the approval of the Mexican drug cartels. They control everything on the northern border, I mean, from the incursion the other day with the military, who I'm certain was probably working on behalf of the drug cartels, because that happens, to what we just saw. This is -- this should be very concerning to the administration, to the men and women of the Border Patrol, because this is going to end up in a shooting situation. It's going to happen. It's a matter of time. So, look, this emergency on the border, this crisis on the border, we got to -- we got to throw everything at it we can, before something devastating happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, this also occurs as a judge is pondering what to do about remain in Mexico, the Trump administration policy that, if you're apprehended, and you're going through the whole adjudication of this, that you're -- the Mexican authorities will be responsible for those in Mexico. They will not be able to wait it out in the United States. Now, assuming, as they have in the past, courts don't go along with that, now what are we looking at?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOMAN",
      "utterance": "The same thing I have been pushing. Look, the courts have not helped the president. He's the only one actually throwing ideas out there, trying to think out of the box on what to do. And every time he does something, the courts hold him up. Congress hasn't done anything. The Democratic leadership hasn't offered up one proposal, one fix. So, as I have said many times, we need to do operationally what Congress is failing to do legislative. ICE needs to do a national operation. Look for these family groups and single adults who had their day in court and a federal judge said they got to go home. We got to execute those orders, because I ran an operation like that three-and-half-years ago. And the result were, the border numbers went down significantly, because we show consequence deterrence. I think HSI portion of ICE needs to go down to Mexico, work with our vetted units, the federal police that we vetted, and identify these criminal cartels, dismantle them, take their money, and imprison them. Look, any smuggling Mexico is also illegal. And right now these criminal cartels are operating with impunity. Mexico needs to step up. We can show them how to do it and show them a way. So I think HSI needs to take a bigger role down there. I appreciate what Mexico's doing right now. But my concern is this. Is it a dog and pony show to just appease the president for a short time? Or are they actually going to sustain an operation that's going to result in the arrest and removal of Central Americans back to their home country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The irony would be then -- I'm going to accept what you're saying at face value -- is the Mexicans -- accepting at face value that they're trying to deal with this problem themselves, have actually made it easier for these migrants from all points south to get here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOMAN",
      "utterance": "Bingo, because it's illegal in the -- in Mexico to transit through Mexico without a transit visa. So if they're not applying to Mexican immigration for a transit visa, then they're operating illegal in Mexico. So Mexico needs to step up and enforce their own laws. If they do that, it would have a significant effect on the people coming north. And, plus, it's just not about law enforcement and border security. It's about saving lives. As we know, 31 percent of women are sexually assaulted during this trip. Children have died. More children will die. This isn't just about enforcing the law. This is about saving lives and saving women's health and children's health. Even if you don't like ICE, even if you don't like this president and border enforcement, would you please do something to save lives? I mean, that needs to be the message."

Jeh Johnson, former Barack Obama homeland security secretary, saying we have an emergency at the border. And now Tom Friedman, a somewhat left-of-center columnist, saying that what we have there is something that both parties need addressing and need to do so right now, talking about the need for something that is dramatic on both parties' part. Let's go to Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour, Democratic start Danielle McLaughlin, and The Wall Street Journal's Bill McGurn. Bill, end it with you.

He seemed to embrace a high wall, that he noticed a lot of the chicanery and the problems started when you left that area. And either it was a lower wall or no wall at all, but advocating that, while a wall exclusively wouldn't be the answer, his view, the president saying there's an urgent situation and was right."

It has to be comprehensive, but I think they do need to get on board with..."

So we just have..."

      "speaker": "MCLAUGHLIN",

And the number of folks who went to their asylum hearings, who went to check-ins with ICE offices was in the 90th percentile. It was a very, very effective way of making sure that people made their day in court. I think there's other things that Democrats want. They do want a DACA fix. They want -- probably they want citizenship for dreamers, but I'm not sure they're going to get that."

Turns out that those U.S. guards were on the side of the U.S. border, beyond just the fence, which obviously leaves some wiggle room here. But this is how crazy it's getting. That could end violently."

Many argued that Republicans were playing some of these same games looking into a lot of Clinton-related scandals and during the Obama years, what have you. But the fact of the matter is, though, this obviously isn't going away. To your colleagues who are saying, we need to get to the bottom of this to see whether it's an impeachable offense, something that they say Bob Mueller and his folks left out there for them to decide, that he wouldn't rule, for example, one way the other on obstruction and dropped it in their lap, do you agree with their characterization like that?"

The last four months that I have been in Congress, you have heard them say, let's wait for the Mueller report, let's wait for the Mueller report. And then the Mueller report comes out, and no collusion. And I think that disappointed a lot of Democrats, because I think they thought that there was going to be something that they could find that would be impeachable. And now, because they don't have that, they're going to try to do everything they can to try to find something that they can move forward. There's been a number of different of their members where they have said that they want to move forward with impeachment. There were some of the freshman members that I came into Congress with that were talking about impeachment soon after getting sworn in. So certainly there's members in their delegation that that's what they have wanted to do for the last four months. And they don't have any facts or evidence to support it."

But you have got to remember that Bernie Sanders has a lot of baggage that Democrats know Republicans and President Trump are going to exploit. This is Bernie Sanders, who wrote some pretty creepy things in the 1960s, Bernie Sanders, who traveled to the USSR and praised the Russian government there, and then Bernie Sanders, the Democratic socialist, who became a millionaire with his book sales. Those were things that in 2016 progressive voters who were so frustrated with Hillary Clinton, they could swallow those. The question now is whether or not that swing voter in a general election is going to be able to look the other way. And, right now, I think Democrats are worried, because, until Biden gets in, Bernie Sanders is the undisputed front-runner."

But there are some of these other things on the fringe that he does endorse, and he's consistent in them, that I think that Democrats are thinking to themselves, maybe this goes too far. And, again, the question is, that might appeal to the progressive voter in the primary, but how does that appeal to the swing voter in the Midwest? And you see some candidates in the Democratic field right now distancing themselves from Sanders and trying to occupy more of the center lane.

When the DNC decided on their rules for this primary, they were so haunted by accusations of favoritism towards Hillary Clinton in 2016 that they lowered the qualifications for the debate stage, they opened the floodgates. And they really have welcomed 18 candidates. The problem here is that when you have 18 contenders for the presidency, and we saw something similar in 2016, that allows someone with high name recognition to do very well without winning a majority of the votes, just a plurality. And that benefits someone like Biden -- excuse me -- like Sanders. The question now is whether or not Biden, with his own name recognition, can counter that."

But I appreciate that Nancy Pelosi wants to see this happen and she says she wants to, but I'm afraid she might have a hard time getting her compatriots on board with this.

Makes sense on paper, but, again, many on the left are galvanized by hearings on the Mueller report, maybe leading to impeachment.

We have been working on progress -- excuse me -- process for the entire time, trying to improve the processes that go on in Congress, and other things, like marijuana and many other things that people and Democrats are actually leading on. So it's not as though they're not doing anything. But I would agree with what Siraj said, which is that Democrats need to show the public that they're working on these things. It seems as though what's dominating are sound bites about Mueller, sound bites about impeachment. And that really doesn't -- doesn't help the Democratic cause and certainly hurts us moving forward."

In 2015, there was a $300 billion infrastructure bill that passed, and now we're already in four years later, and all of our roads and bridges are crumbling. We're talking about 5G and basically expanding that. But Democrats, they really need to focus on what makes them better at governing than Republicans. And if they can actually prove that working on something like infrastructure, which we all know is pretty mundane in terms of how bipartisan it can be, they actually just have to show that they can govern, and Republicans have no answers to go forward into 2020."

McGahn is at the center of the obstruction findings in the Mueller report that found in mid-2017 the president asked McGahn to fire Mueller, but he refused. McGahn's critics say he was a weak White House counsel, allowing the FBI to interview former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn without prior approval. And they claim McGahn's lawyer also assured those close to the president his Mueller testimony didn't amount to a road map on obstruction. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee issued this statement that reads in part -- quote -- \"Our request covers the subjects described by Mr. McGahn to the special counsel and described by special counsel Mueller to the American public in his report. As such, the moment for the White House to assert some privilege to prevent this testimony from being heard has long since passed.\" This morning, the president said they are taking a firm position, after providing dozens of witness interviews and over a million records.

But when he meeting with the American president, the Russian president, the Chinese premier, it does in fact -- at least in his own mind and in the mind of the North Korean people, it puts him in a position to be recognized as a global leader. Well, he really isn't. But he does have a nuclear arsenal that has thrust him into the limelight."

The second thing I think we do is, we go to the second -- to the next round of sanctions. What can we do to ratchet this up? Because both the Chinese and the Russians, in spite of what people say, they have both been violating these sanctions. So I think we go to the next level. And then I think we check with our allies to make sure that our coalition is solid and prepared to stand with us against this, until we see some movement on the denuclearization."

That's all provocative type of discussions, even though Kim Jong-un is always very careful to say, I love the president, he's a great guy, and blah, blah, blah. But what do you make of that and the fact that the president, our president, has been low-key in his response, and very supportive of Kim Jong-un?"

      "speaker": "BOYKIN",

I think that really stung the president and those around him. And I think that he has proceeded with much more caution. And I think that he realized during the Hanoi talks that he wasn't going to -- he wasn't going to get an agreement on denuclearization. And he walked out. And he walked out very deliberately. And I think he walked out to send a message. So I think that he is taking this very cautiously, one step at a time. I think he wants to keep the rhetoric on this down as much as he can, doesn't want to ratchet it up. And I think he's moving very slowly and very deliberately.

Exactly who's paying for this? Vision 4 Fund Distributors V.P. Heather Zumarraga. Heather, obviously, this carries a hefty price tag, all of this stuff.

So, no, just taxing the rich and raising taxes will not be nearly enough to pay for all of this."

That's his caveat there. But at least he says you can't do it by going after the rich alone."

      "speaker": "ZUMARRAGA",

But at the expense of the 40 million people who are currently uninsured -- uninsured in America, you're really going to upset the 170 million people who are insured. If you remember, under Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, the broken promises that were made, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. The bottom line is that this would cause massive cuts across the board to doctors and hospital pay. If you look at just below-average, below-market rates, it would be a nearly 40 percent cut, driving hospitals and doctors out of business. So there's no way this will work. House Speaker Pelosi saying she supports these hearings, Neil, but she doesn't support the legislation. So it's not just Republicans."
