The deployment after deployment after deployment. So it's important to hear things like what Rudy Giuliani said so everybody can reflect and remember and keep that flame alive.

Just a few letters, C through D, E through F, whatever it takes. It's a very sobering experience.

I do think that this is a really interesting problem though about what's happening to people who actually do have chronic pain.

Take a look at how this amazing run of dates look when written in reverse, it's on the screen. This week of palindromes is a once in a lifetime event. Now personally, I always noticed the rush of people to get married on dates like 7/7/17 or 8/8/18. Well, we could have a week of celebrations coming up in the few days left on that 10 day run.

Nico is a Dutch Shepherd, also honored. Niko went on over 600 missions in Afghanistan sniffing out IEDs. He also protected embassies and the U.S. dignitaries that visited. And this is a ceremony that allows all Americans a chance to see what these unsung heroes do every day. The other dogs honored include Troll, that's a Dutch Shepherd.

President Trump observing a moment of silence at the White House, and honoring those who lost their lives at a ceremony at the Pentagon where President George W. Bush also paid tribute with a wreath laying. And earlier today, New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani, revealing new details about a powerful conversation he had with President Bush at the time."

I said when you get Bin Laden you let me kill him. I might have said execute him. I think was -- I think I was thinking as a lawyer. I thought there'd be capital punishment and I could try the case.

And for me, my life breaks down into pre-9/11 and post-9/11 because the America before that, it's very hard to understand for people that weren't there. A lot of young people don't understand it how it changed air travel. How it's changed how we feel vulnerable in the homeland. About how we feel about privacy. The deployment after deployment after deployment. So it's important to hear things like what Rudy Giuliani said so everybody can reflect and remember and keep that flame alive. So when we say as a hashtag, never forget, we actually know what we're talking about. I woke up this morning and I watched the “Fox & Friends” montage from about 8:30 to 9 o'clock. What we do, we only play this once a year where we show the footage of the planes hitting the towers, and we show all of our anchors and all of our correspondents report the attacks in real time, and it's very important for all of us to do that. Also, very important, listen to the names that are read of those who passed away that day. You don't have to listen to every single name. Just a few letters, C through D, E through F, whatever it takes. It's a very sobering experience. Also today, always a good day to go up when you see a police officer, or firefighter, a service member, just shake their hand and say thank you. And you and I have also talked about this. Go to Ari Fleischer's twitter feed today and he will deliver a blow-by-blow of the events as is proximity to George W. Bush was right there, and he can tell you what went down that close to power. And go online and watched two videos, George W. Bush throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium, and then him standing on top of the rubble with the bullhorn. And also, if you have children, as I do, who weren't there, or if you have children who are born after, just explained to them what happens, in simple term, maybe you go visit the memorial, or go up to the top of the Freedom Tower. It's important for it to survive generation after generation."

You know, a plane just happened to hit. And then, by the time I got home, I turned on the TV and you could see what Jesse was describing. It was on Fox & Friends this morning, the second plane hitting the building. And at that moment, just being afraid for my son who was going to school across the river from the Pentagon, because then, all of a sudden, there was not only talk about the Pentagon, but about whether or not there was another plane heading for the Capital.

And when you drive past the Pentagon on the side where the plane hit, the Pentagon is on the right side when you're driving towards Washington, D.C., and on the left side is Arlington Cemetery.

Despite all of that, CNN still reported it this morning. And new numbers show the network spent a hundred and eighty one minutes hyping the so-called bombshell earlier this week.

You know, the interesting thing to me is that CNN and Savannah Guthrie claim to be concerned about Russia interference in the election, but anytime she says and gives Russia credit for maybe tilting the election towards President Trump, she's actually emboldening Russian propaganda and giving Russia a win. And every single time that someone at CNN reports a story incorrectly and puts a source -- a CIA source at risk, and the Russians do think (INAUDIBLE) you know, that's a huge problem. You're going -- you're setting up a situation where Americans are now debating about the Russia issue and tearing each other apart, politically, which the one thing in the Mueller report that we know is true, that was one of the Russians goal when they did the Facebook ads, and kind of the twitter troll farms was to sow dissent in America. So every time the media acts like they're concerned about classified information, they're worried about protecting sources, they've actually exposed the source, and they actually emboldened the Russian propaganda by continuing to give Russia credit for something it didn't actually do."

She understands Russians very well. And it's giving Russians way too much credit. It's building them up to up point of ridiculousness. The thing that she didn't say, she was very polite, didn't say it, which is that, if that were true, where was the Obama administration? Because they have responsibility for election security in the United States, and I don't know if that will be part of the Durham investigation. But I feel like they kind of get off easy because no one really talks about it. We've talked about the media, no one else talks about that. The other thing I would point out is, back in the olden days, like ten years ago, there was really no way to fight back when a reporter wouldn't back down, even if you knew the story wasn't true. If they wouldn't retract it, you could complain a little bit. You could try to get it out there to people, but there was no twitter, there was no Facebook, there was no direct way to communicate directly to people to say that story is wrong.

Denver, Colorado, so much love. Silicon Valley, the navy yard here in Brooklyn. Showered with love and attention and funding. But the minute the economic wind blows the other way, Washington is just like leaves them high and dry and hollowed out. And Trump is unique because he's going to these decaying parts of the country and he's saying we're going to revitalize this part of America, and here's how we're going to do it. He's not chasing the wind in the other direction. I just wish Democrats would recognize this and look and say we can work with this president on certain issues.

But if Purdue decides to make that decision, enter in the settlement that hopefully will go a long way. I do think that this is a really interesting problem though about what's happening to people who actually do have chronic pain. Purdue Pharma, whatever the culpability, whatever they admit to, set that aside. There is a black market problem. There is an illegal market problem and that has caused people who deserve the care that they can be given to have to suffer. That's really wrong. Imagine - and we don't have - we don't live with chronic pain. We don't know what that's like. It absolutely destroys your life. And so, what I pray for is an amazing innovation, something that will deal with people's pain in a way that doesn't cause the additional problems.

And so, you have all these efforts to throw extras away. You didn't use all of them to keep them out of the hands of kids, all that kind of thing. But the pharmacy companies are just the surface of this. I think they have to look at the insurance companies as well. Because when you go in to get an MRI now and this has happened to someone I know, you go into get MRI for too young or there is some reason they don't want to do it. They'll say, we know that you're in a lot of pain, you have to wait for six months. We're going to give you opioids until that period and if you're still having a problem then we will grant you the MRI, even though you have health insurance and or you can pay out of pocket for it."

Your back hurts from working in a factory, here's 20 pills. And it was over-prescribed, and it floods the market, especially the black market. It gets out on the street and everybody gets hooked and starts dying. So, you can't put the genie back in the bottle, because there is a legitimate need for it.

You also have to limit the dosages and the purity and the quantity because you don't need a quadrillion pill out there in America. You need to limit that to a certain extent.
