      "utterance": "She has a severe problem because if you watch this debate, it lasted more than 58 days since President Trump has requested supplemental funding for the aid along this border. Even the \"New York Times\" wrote two editorials about it. Mexico sent 15,000 troops to the southern end of their border. Everyone understands there's a crisis. Even the Democrat Senators on the senate side understand it, but not the House. You know, a bill came out of the Senate 84-8. Every Democrat in the leadership on the Senate side voted for it, but Nancy Pelosi did not want to bring that up. You know why? Because she believes in open borders. She wanted to deny anybody working along the border that they could not have overtime. In a time where you just had 144,000 apprehensions of people illegally crossing just last month, something we have not seen in a decade, this is when I talk about this is not the same Democratic Party of the past. This is a new socialist Democratic Party and many of the members there call themselves that, and they are the new leaders of this socialist Democratic Party. And that's a real concern. Not only do they want to have open borders, they want to allow illegals to even vote. We had a vote on the floor about illegals from other countries casting ballots. They voted that down."

And that was them knowing a congressional visit was coming. That was -- this is CBP on their best behavior telling people to drink out of the toilet."

      "utterance": "I wasn't in there. I've been to the border many times, I never saw anything like that. That would be unacceptable. But what's very concerning to me is now they are just coming to the border. We've been trying to get funding, humanitarian aid here and unfortunately that Congresswoman was holding it up. She voted against this aid. She even voted against the Democrat vote in the house just a little bit before. So I don't even know where she stands when it comes to this issue. That's what's concerning to me."
