According to the latest poll Biden's less popular than an anchovy with a yeast infection. Only 33 percent of adults approve of Biden's job performance which is a record low. And after answering the poll those 33 percent were rushed back to the mental health facility where the pollsters had found them. But his approval is like his body temperature, barely above freezing. It's dropped three points since November. And it beats former President Trump's worst approval rating by one point. Well, at least he can finally say he's better than Trump at something. But it is an amazing comparison. Consider the kind of press that Trump got was a relentless drumbeat of hysterical hate. And yet, Joe, who has none of that from the press is rated worse than Trump. How can that be? How is it that a genial old man coddled by every media entity on Earth is now less popular than the monster? The media deemed worse than Hitler? Stalin and Maroon Five combined? Yes, it's an amazing feat, but not when you see how bad it's really gotten.",

They don't address it, they can't address it. Instead, they pivot. It's why Jen Psaki is always circling back. As COVID in crime and inflation continued Joe scampered into the world of voting rights looking for cover. And because they become so invested in identity politics and wokeism, they don't know how to solve actual problems anymore. It's just pronouns instead of policy. They become so good at racial theatrics, but they bomb when it comes to helping out the average American voter. Meanwhile, Joe embraced rhetoric that was about as unifying as Alec Baldwin showing up on the set of a new Western. Well, unified America against him, I suppose.

Joe labeled half of Americans once again is bigots, racists monsters. Thanks for the support, Joe. And he wonders why he has a son who used to mistake Parmesan cheese on the rug for crack. Maybe Joe is just the A-hole the left tried to tell you Trump was. He played the whose side are you on stick until even his own side doesn't want to be on his side anymore. Pretty soon no one will be left to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer. I mean, when you lose Al Sharpton and Dick Durbin you are on (BLEEP) Island. And no one wants to get near you. The only way off is to swim right through it. So Joe was calling everyone racist. This from a man who went to the funeral of a KKK leader. His own V.P. implied he was racist during the debates. That's what the Democrats have become. A bunch of people calling everyone else racist, including each other. Too bad they can't tell you why you're racist, just like critical race theory. You just are. But really Joe, whose voting rights are Americans denying? They keep saying it's Jim Crow on steroids. But they can't find any victims with giant foreheads and back acne. There's no evidence that Republicans have tried to stop illegal voter from voting. In fact, it's kind of the opposite. I mean, how did Georgia, a red state that has a large black population flip blue in the last election? It sure wasn't because Republicans kept black people from the ballot box. They can't even name one person kept from voting. Is it a convicted murderer who doesn't have a picture I.D.? I don't know. But then say so. We need clarity of who we're discriminating against for God's sake. And yet the media plays along.",

An extra small, but Joe keeps smearing decent people who are just minding their own business. They aren't hindering the rights of others when it comes to voting. They're just trying to get along in tough times. It's kind of amazing. We're going through all of this, and Joe's still out in front calling your names while wondering why everyone keeps calling him Brandon. I mean, we have a president who ran on unified but now all he does is yell at you. Even though everything he accuses you of like supporting bigots, he actually did himself.

And I guarantee that call came from a landline. According to reports, the seniors were enjoying a game of cards when one woman shared what she thought were ordinary homemade brownies prepared by her son. Then they really started enjoying that game of cards. Good thing they didn't play strip poker. Naked seniors look like they're wearing corduroy -- an agist might say. Authorities arrived on the scene to find everyone under the influence and this time it wasn't the influence of relief factor. Turns out, the brownies weren't the only thing that got baked that day. There was such an uproar, dinner had to be moved back to 4:30. Police arrested the woman's adult son who said he had made the brownies the day before using a half pound of THC laced butter. Well, that's more than I used to lubricate my wetsuit. The 73-year-old mom then inadvertently took them to her card game, yes inadvertently. Yes, she gave those seniors the munchies.

According to the latest poll Biden's less popular than an anchovy with a yeast infection. Only 33 percent of adults approve of Biden's job performance which is a record low. And after answering the poll those 33 percent were rushed back to the mental health facility where the pollsters had found them. But his approval is like his body temperature, barely above freezing. It's dropped three points since November. And it beats former President Trump's worst approval rating by one point. Well, at least he can finally say he's better than Trump at something. But it is an amazing comparison. Consider the kind of press that Trump got was a relentless drumbeat of hysterical hate. And yet, Joe, who has none of that from the press is rated worse than Trump. How can that be? How is it that a genial old man coddled by every media entity on Earth is now less popular than the monster? The media deemed worse than Hitler? Stalin and Maroon Five combined? Yes, it's an amazing feat, but not when you see how bad it's really gotten."

They don't address it, they can't address it. Instead, they pivot. It's why Jen Psaki is always circling back. As COVID in crime and inflation continued Joe scampered into the world of voting rights looking for cover. And because they become so invested in identity politics and wokeism, they don't know how to solve actual problems anymore. It's just pronouns instead of policy. They become so good at racial theatrics, but they bomb when it comes to helping out the average American voter. Meanwhile, Joe embraced rhetoric that was about as unifying as Alec Baldwin showing up on the set of a new Western. Well, unified America against him, I suppose.

Maybe Joe is just the A-hole the left tried to tell you Trump was. He played the whose side are you on stick until even his own side doesn't want to be on his side anymore. Pretty soon no one will be left to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer. I mean, when you lose Al Sharpton and Dick Durbin you are on (BLEEP) Island. And no one wants to get near you. The only way off is to swim right through it. So Joe was calling everyone racist. This from a man who went to the funeral of a KKK leader. His own V.P. implied he was racist during the debates. That's what the Democrats have become. A bunch of people calling everyone else racist, including each other. Too bad they can't tell you why you're racist, just like critical race theory. You just are. But really Joe, whose voting rights are Americans denying? They keep saying it's Jim Crow on steroids. But they can't find any victims with giant foreheads and back acne. There's no evidence that Republicans have tried to stop illegal voter from voting. In fact, it's kind of the opposite. I mean, how did Georgia, a red state that has a large black population flip blue in the last election? It sure wasn't because Republicans kept black people from the ballot box. They can't even name one person kept from voting. Is it a convicted murderer who doesn't have a picture I.D.? I don't know. But then say so. We need clarity of who we're discriminating against for God's sake. And yet the media plays along."

An extra small, but Joe keeps smearing decent people who are just minding their own business. They aren't hindering the rights of others when it comes to voting. They're just trying to get along in tough times. It's kind of amazing. We're going through all of this, and Joe's still out in front calling your names while wondering why everyone keeps calling him Brandon.

But there's nothing funny about pedophilia. We'll be right back. In the first week of 2022, the network -- the network saw a staggering decline in viewership compared to the same week last year. They pulled in over 2-1/2 million viewers last January now it's barely over a half a million. Fox gets that many viewers when Kilmeade has a bunion removed. Yes. But it's no surprise with all the scandals from Chris Cuomo to actual child sex crimes.

And I guarantee that call came from a landline. According to reports, the seniors were enjoying a game of cards when one woman shared what she thought were ordinary homemade brownies prepared by her son. Then they really started enjoying that game of cards. Good thing they didn't play strip poker. Naked seniors look like they're wearing corduroy -- an agist might say. Authorities arrived on the scene to find everyone under the influence and this time it wasn't the influence of relief factor. Turns out, the brownies weren't the only thing that got baked that day. There was such an uproar, dinner had to be moved back to 4:30. Police arrested the woman's adult son who said he had made the brownies the day before using a half pound of THC laced butter. Well, that's more than I used to lubricate my wetsuit. The 73-year-old mom then inadvertently took them to her card game, yes inadvertently. Yes, she gave those seniors the munchies.
