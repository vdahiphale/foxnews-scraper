To use a movie analogy, if Freddy Kruger is on your tail, the first house with the light's on is the door you're going to knock on, but I am over simplifying because that's what I do.

But, you know, I mean, again, so I don't think you want to go through that. I think this was vile. And I think that it's not just, as you portray it, you know, Democrats or that crazy liberal media. I think the reason that he spoke out today was because there were a number of Republicans in Congress who said to Vice President Pence, and possibly directly to Mr. Trump, you know, Mr. President, this is not who we are as the Republican Party. It's not comfortable. We're not -- we don't like being portrayed or having -- when don't want -- you know, you can go back to lock her up. But this is of another magnitude, Jesse. This really is un-American that you would say to people who are -- three of them born in America. One in - - but all American citizens and all four members of Congress, not all socialists, by the way. And to say to them, go back, you know, send them back, I mean, there's a direct line from they should go back home to their countries to send her back.

Mitt Romney was accused of murdering somebody. They've accused Republicans of being in the closets. I mean, some of the worst crimes you could ever imagine Republicans have been accused of.

I don't like any kind of mob action, and that includes the media mob. So I'm not going to set my hair on fire over this because every day they've been setting their hair on fire about stuff and I'm numb to it. He did not say this, so this is important part.

Why is some violence OK if it's against an ICE agent or the ICE detention facility? And that verbal violence is never acceptable and we have to pass a resolution to condemn it? I think that, obviously, the rhetoric and clearly the chant push the envelope if not nuked it. But this strategy is working. For better or worse, Trump is succeeding at presenting to the public two options, himself or a totally unpalatable left face of the Democratic Party. And he has succeeded at making the squad that face at least for now. And this stark contrast, by the way, this is much more -- or will be much more successful for him in the long run than him versus Biden, or him versus Bernie, because this, again, is such a starker contrast and so difficult to stomach."

Like a reflective chant -- a reflex chant among a group of people whose only power is to vote and to yell, right? That's their only power. Is that as bad as weapons of mass -- somebody honing a phrase like axis of evil in which leads to what? Actual war, actual violence. I'm trying to figure out -- when I watch Republicans go after this, nobody is getting hurt. This is a group of powerless people shouting something.

So they are as harmful as actions. And therefore, violence on the part of groups like Antifa is justified because they are fighting back against words that the group finds offensive.

Boil down with some exception, migrants who pass through another country first must seek asylum there rather than at our border. So basically, you can't just say to El Salvador get me out of here when what you meant was get me a job in Phoenix. So Trump's plan is simple and sensible. And we've said it before, if you're on the run from something bad, why skip the first safe harbor? To use a movie analogy, if Freddy Kruger is on your tail, the first house with the light's on is the door you're going to knock on, but I am over simplifying because that's what I do. By bring a safe place closer to a migrant this is meant to prevent suffering by shortening the journey. So you think the Dems would be on board but no, it's Trump. Now his idea of making refugees seek asylum in the first safe nation they came to is one most countries use and for good reason. It saves lives as the Germans discovered when Merkel let in millions of refugees who are told they could go anywhere they wanted in the E.U., and many said London. So Britain's sent off later saying to the E.U., and Merkel has been trying to walk back her decision ever since. Trump knows anarchy comes when you base your laws on political pandering and what plays well on The View. The caravans were our version of Merkel's mistake, but this reform says not so fast, which is why in all likelihood the Democrats will hate it. All right, Juan, I want to play a sot from one Democrat who seems to agree with this plan. Let's roll it."

So what we've got now is the Republicans had two years of total control of everything, the House, the Senate, the White House, did they change the asylum law? I don't think so.

And that's why I think you're seeing so much distraction between Nancy Pelosi and the squad, and the president and the squad is because it allows people to not work on immigration because they really, really don't want to do it. And it's so incredibly unfortunate because we have to define these things. Even when it's painful, even when it's not politically convenient and you don't score instant points because sometimes fixes aren't emotional issues.

We've seen a lawsuit that was filed against the administration against an executive order basically said, OK, so right now we have exceptions already for those that have gone through safe counties, except how is that defined? It's technically only with Canada. It's a multilateral or bilateral agreement. Is it necessary for the immigrant to have resettled in that country or is passing through enough? Are we creating a compact with regional -- a regional compact with the South or Central American countries? Like, all of these questions are up in the air. And what they require is diplomacy and international relations and attention by our politicians and elected officials rather than just squabbling and the freaking out that most people are doing on the left and wasting everyone's time with, frankly, these lawsuits. But the bottom line is triage needs to occur, which is what the president was doing by that executive order. And the content of it already exist in our existing law.

And then secondly, as you said, this is just the latest in a long string. So, despite their defensive it and we're not maintaining the data and it's just the device number, whatever. Google researchers, they've admitted to using 8 million of our photographs to train A.I., Facebook 10 million, you'd never see if Colorado, they took unauthorized photos of people up to 2000.
