We're also getting clarity on another major story tonight. Remember how for the past year, the left-wing media, the Democrats promising that Trump Tower meeting was somehow the big smoking gun of Russia collusion? OK, tonight, in spite of media reports, we now have the evidence it was a total dud. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Senate Judiciary Committee, they released thousands of pages of the testimony, several key players at the meeting, the main takeaway is this: they all thought it was a waste of their time. They were talking about adoption, the Magnitsky Act. No dirt on Hillary Clinton came through and by the way, if he did, it wouldn't be illegal and we'll explain that tonight. From all accounts, this meeting quickly went off the rails, eventually focused in on topics like Russian adoption and Russian adoption. It's a nothingburger. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the media, they have been hyping this as a cruise missile that was going to take down the Trump administration. Donald Trump Jr., he testified, he was skeptical going into the meeting, and that had his suspicions were quickly justified. Donald Trump Jr. also said that his father, President Trump, had nothing at all to do with it in any way, shape, matter, or form. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And despite all this wild and false speculation, it's nothing. The Trump Tower meeting isn't the only breaking news story that is actually embarrassing to the destroy Trump media. \"New York Times,\" now, this is an amazing story, they hate President Trump. They are now basically tonight confirming everything we have been telling you regarding the biggest abuse scandal in the history of the country. It's not a mea culpa from a liberal \"New York Times.\" Frankly, it was inadvertent, which is probably why the so-called paper of record, they kind of playing cleanup. This was their original headline today. This is pretty amazing. A secret mission, a code name, and anxiety inside of the early days of the FBI's drop investigation. Well, they changed the headline. 'Code name crossfire hurricane: the secret origins of the Trump administration.' Great to know somebody in the FBI likes the Rolling Stones. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why would they change it? Let me explain what happened in this article. It's a long article. \"The Times\" explains how the FBI open a top secret completely unconventional operation into the Trump campaign, by the way, only days after they rigged the investigation into Hillary, and the same exact players. The details were closely guarded by FBI officials. This all happened days, just days after the same people put the fix in with the exoneration before investigation of Hillary Clinton, rigging it, knowing she committed felonies and obstruction of justice. In other words, everything we have been exposing. So, to break it down this way -- in the summer of 2016, the FBI sent agents to London. They interviewed an Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer. \"The Times\" described this interview as, quote, \"diplomatic protocol\". Highly unusual. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, Downer is the guy that got drunk one night with some guy, and I know -- I thought I knew everybody in the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos. Never heard of him. The Trump adviser nobody heard up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And during that night out, they're drinking, they apparently gossiped like I guess \"Mean Girls\" about so-called dirt on Hillary Clinton. Downer then alerted the Australian intelligence agency who then told their U.S. counterparts. One, two, three, four-way hearsay. This is massive. \"The Times\" is confirming that FBI used four-way hearsay to launch an investigation just like we've been telling you on the program. By the way, their timeline doesn't match up, and hearsay is never admissible, never mind the four way hearsay in a court of law. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, what \"The New York Times\" is proving is we have been right the entire time, and in the process of trying to cover up for their deep state friends and making excuses, they are actually exposing them. \"The Times\" and the rest of the media have been trying to get ahead of what is a massive scandal, and protect the likes of Comey and McCabe and Strzok and Lynch and Page and everyone else. But they can't because the facts, the evidence, the truth is finally coming out. And we have been promising you this and so far, what we have been uncovering is only the beginning. This is going to get a lot worse for all of these deep state actors before it ever gets better. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look at the side of your screen. James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Loretta Lynch, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, all at the center of this massive scandal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Comey's a liar and a leaker and probably broke the law multiple ways. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } McCabe lied under oath multiple times. He could be facing criminal charges. Loretta Lynch -- oh, she tried to the compromise the Clinton email investigation and get Comey to say it's not an investigation. It's only a matter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then you have the FBI anti-Trump lovebirds Strzok and Page. They routinely abused the president verbally, attacking him in their text messages. And Strzok's fingerprints are all over everything. We'll have more on that in just a second. We have another big story to tell you about. The DOJ's attempt to slow-walk, stonewall, obstruct Congress from ever seeing over 1.2 million documents about the Clinton email server investigation and the Russian witch hunt, which should be coming to an end. Congressman Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Ron DeSantis, they're now asking the president to use his executive authority, instruct the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who should be doing it on his own, to immediately turn over all documents that Congress has subpoenaed and as a constitutional right, coequal branches of government, and a right to oversight, and separation of powers. It is insane. It is unfair to you, the American people, that it has come to this, as Congress has the constitutional authority, as part of their checks and balances. Rod Rosenstein, he has been concealing information and then needlessly redacting key parts of these things in the name of national security that gets proven later not to have anything to do with national security. Rosenstein claims that, but it's not true. We have seen this lie play out. It's about protecting all his friends. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, he is conflicted from the very beginning of all of us, and, by the way, was a no-show for a closed-door hearing with the Senate intelligence committee today. I wonder why. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Several Obama administration officials were quoted, but Comey dodged the entire thing. That's telling. Think about this. Congressman Jordan and DeSantis will join us in a few minutes. One more thing tonight: a major follow-up on the former Obama official who at one point voted for the communist for president. This is how this man ever became the CIA director is breathtaking to me, John Brennan. Paul Sperry reporting that John Brennan, who has repeatedly threatened President Trump, you know: stay tuned, Mr. President, is now being exposed yet again as a liar, this time by his former colleagues. Last May, the former CIA director testified under oath the dossier didn't factor into the intelligence community's assessment of Russia election meddling. We've got the tape to prove it. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We've been saying that because guess what, Mueller never have the legal standing to ever do it in the first place. We'll explain. Also tonight, President Trump responding to Kim Jong Un's threat to pull out of the June 12th summit and he is refusing to back away from the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. And the media, the left promised a smoking gun. Remember, the Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer, okay, the Senate released the documents and in spite of what the media is telling you, a total dud. It's going nowhere. We'll explain. Also, a stunning report, new from the FBI, launched the secret investigation. It has a name, enter the Trump campaign, only days after they rigged and put the fixation and the Clinton email investigation. \"The New York Times\" is inadvertently confirming everything we have been telling you about all of us regarding the massive abuse of power and corruption. Also tonight, Congressman Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Ron DeSantis, they are fighting back hard against the DOJ and their obstruction. They are urging the president to get involved.

Remember, Kim Jong Un is now trying to act up, his ego has been bruised. He's threatening to withdraw from a summit in Singapore.

Kim Jong Un, well, he's the one that has made every concession, he gave up the hostages, we did not have to appease them with a plane load of cash and other currencies, $150 billion like Obama did with Iran. So, the ball is in Kim Jong Un's court, and he wants to talk, he wants a deal, he wants a better life for his people? President Trump is ready to listen. North Korea will not be allowed to threaten the world and build nuclear weapons, that's a fact, and the president, he's made it crystal clear. We're also getting clarity on another major story tonight. Remember how for the past year, the left-wing media, the Democrats promising that Trump Tower meeting was somehow the big smoking gun of Russia collusion? OK, tonight, in spite of media reports, we now have the evidence it was a total dud."

No dirt on Hillary Clinton came through and by the way, if he did, it wouldn't be illegal and we'll explain that tonight. From all accounts, this meeting quickly went off the rails, eventually focused in on topics like Russian adoption and Russian adoption. It's a nothingburger. And the media, they have been hyping this as a cruise missile that was going to take down the Trump administration. Donald Trump Jr., he testified, he was skeptical going into the meeting, and that had his suspicions were quickly justified. Donald Trump Jr. also said that his father, President Trump, had nothing at all to do with it in any way, shape, matter, or form. And despite all this wild and false speculation, it's nothing. The Trump Tower meeting isn't the only breaking news story that is actually embarrassing to the destroy Trump media. \"New York Times,\" now, this is an amazing story, they hate President Trump. They are now basically tonight confirming everything we have been telling you regarding the biggest abuse scandal in the history of the country. It's not a mea culpa from a liberal \"New York Times.\" Frankly, it was inadvertent, which is probably why the so-called paper of record, they kind of playing cleanup. This was their original headline today. This is pretty amazing. A secret mission, a code name, and anxiety inside of the early days of the FBI's drop investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Well, they changed the headline. 'Code name crossfire hurricane",
      "utterance": "the secret origins of the Trump administration.' Great to know somebody in the FBI likes the Rolling Stones. Why would they change it? Let me explain what happened in this article. It's a long article. \"The Times\" explains how the FBI open a top secret completely unconventional operation into the Trump campaign, by the way, only days after they rigged the investigation into Hillary, and the same exact players. The details were closely guarded by FBI officials. This all happened days, just days after the same people put the fix in with the exoneration before investigation of Hillary Clinton, rigging it, knowing she committed felonies and obstruction of justice. In other words, everything we have been exposing. So, to break it down this way -- in the summer of 2016, the FBI sent agents to London. They interviewed an Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer. \"The Times\" described this interview as, quote, \"diplomatic protocol\". Highly unusual. Remember, Downer is the guy that got drunk one night with some guy, and I know -- I thought I knew everybody in the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos. Never heard of him. The Trump adviser nobody heard up. And during that night out, they're drinking, they apparently gossiped like I guess \"Mean Girls\" about so-called dirt on Hillary Clinton. Downer then alerted the Australian intelligence agency who then told their U.S. counterparts. One, two, three, four-way hearsay. This is massive. \"The Times\" is confirming that FBI used four-way hearsay to launch an investigation just like we've been telling you on the program. By the way, their timeline doesn't match up, and hearsay is never admissible, never mind the four way hearsay in a court of law. So, what \"The New York Times\" is proving is we have been right the entire time, and in the process of trying to cover up for their deep state friends and making excuses, they are actually exposing them. \"The Times\" and the rest of the media have been trying to get ahead of what is a massive scandal, and protect the likes of Comey and McCabe and Strzok and Lynch and Page and everyone else. But they can't because the facts, the evidence, the truth is finally coming out. And we have been promising you this and so far, what we have been uncovering is only the beginning. This is going to get a lot worse for all of these deep state actors before it ever gets better. Take a look at the side of your screen. James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Loretta Lynch, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, all at the center of this massive scandal. Comey's a liar and a leaker and probably broke the law multiple ways. McCabe lied under oath multiple times. He could be facing criminal charges. Loretta Lynch -- oh, she tried to the compromise the Clinton email investigation and get Comey to say it's not an investigation. It's only a matter. Then you have the FBI anti-Trump lovebirds Strzok and Page. They routinely abused the president verbally, attacking him in their text messages. And Strzok's fingerprints are all over everything. We'll have more on that in just a second. We have another big story to tell you about. The DOJ's attempt to slow-walk, stonewall, obstruct Congress from ever seeing over 1.2 million documents about the Clinton email server investigation and the Russian witch hunt, which should be coming to an end. Congressman Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Ron DeSantis, they're now asking the president to use his executive authority, instruct the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who should be doing it on his own, to immediately turn over all documents that Congress has subpoenaed and as a constitutional right, coequal branches of government, and a right to oversight, and separation of powers. It is insane. It is unfair to you, the American people, that it has come to this, as Congress has the constitutional authority, as part of their checks and balances. Rod Rosenstein, he has been concealing information and then needlessly redacting key parts of these things in the name of national security that gets proven later not to have anything to do with national security. Rosenstein claims that, but it's not true. We have seen this lie play out. It's about protecting all his friends. Meanwhile, he is conflicted from the very beginning of all of us, and, by the way, was a no-show for a closed-door hearing with the Senate intelligence committee today. I wonder why. Several Obama administration officials were quoted, but Comey dodged the entire thing. That's telling. Think about this. Congressman Jordan and DeSantis will join us in a few minutes."

The FBI and the senior DOJ officials and John Brennan and James Clapper and James Comey set up out on a plot to frame Donald Trump and the people in his campaign. They used all sorts of means and methods to do that, including the use of an agent provocateur who is unleashed on the campaign, on the soil of a foreign country, and as a result of interviews with a number of people in the campaign, asking them, who approached you, a person that you never knew before, and started asking questions about foreign policy and seeing if they could, quote, help the campaign. It is now known who that agent provocateur was that the FBI used and John Brennan used and James Clapper. And tonight, there is a flurry of concern in Washington, and the law enforcement and intelligence community, that his name will come out."

Here with reaction to all of this, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis. Also with us, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. Sara, let's talk to you first. We know it was supposed to come in May, it was first supposed to come in April. But they found new information as it relates to this, a new evidence, and a new trail they are following.

And now, he will be releasing. So, this is going to be very important. I mean, this is -- this is part of what Congress has been asking for all along. Remember, it's the inspector general that has all of the documentation, the 1.2 million pieces of documentation that Congress has been practically begging for, and pushing and threatening with subpoenas, the DOJ and the FBI. So, this report is going to be very important."

This is a big breakthrough, on top of the letter that both you, Ron DeSantis, and Mark Meadows, who is not with us tonight, have put out saying the president, you've got to get involved. You've got to tell the attorney general, and you have the power constitutionally to do so. There is over 1.2 million documents we're talking about here. And we know with a little but we have gotten, as Andy McCarthy wrote, we only have a few of the Strzok-Page memos just to begin with. REP. JIM JORDAN, R—OHIO: Right. Couple of things, first to the inspector general's report. Remember, it was Michael Horowitz who uncovered the Page-Strzok text messages, where we've learned so much information. It was also Michael Horowitz and his team who determined that Andy McCabe had misled people, lied four different times, three times under oath. So, we are all anxiously awaiting this report. I'm sure there'll have -- if it's a draft, there will be some reviews that have to take place. But that's good news that we're going to be getting that soon. And more importantly, I think is the letter we sent. We are just tired of the runaround we have been getting from the Department of Justice. It's time for them to turn over the information. And the one way that we know that can happen is for the head of the executive branch, the president of the United States, elected by the American people, to tell the attorney general the deputy attorney general, and the FBI director, give Congress a separate and equal branch of government entitled to see."

We're talking about -- again, we've only got a small sampling of the Strzok-Page memos and it's so revealing -- insurance policies, how much they hate Trump, how Strzok as we've been reporting today is involved in everything, literally interviews Hillary, she's exonerated, he's writing it months before the exoneration before he interviews Hillary, 17 other witnesses, and a few days later. And then after they exonerate, rig an investigation into her, now they're investigating Donald Trump, and that the timing, as George Papadopoulos story is blowing up in their face? REP. RON DESANTIS, R—FLA.: That's why, Sean, I think the combination of the I.G. report hitting hopefully very soon, and then if the president pulls the trigger on all this other information, we could have a gusher of information that provides all the clarity that we've been asking about, all these different questions. And yes, you talked about the beginning, how did this Russia probe even start? Very important question. But even things going up into the special counsel, I mean, Rosenstein writes in appointing order appointing Mueller, the thing is defective on its face. So, what does he do in August? He writes a secret addendum, a new appointing order and then they've redacted most of it. They won't even show to the federal judge that."

So revealing. I don't know Michael Horowitz. I know he's appointed by Obama. Why should we believe he's going to do their job? Because the evidence about Hillary and committing felonies and obstructing is overwhelming and incontrovertible. Anybody -- any American would get convicted.

All the isolation is still there. I think that's exactly the right tone. Let Kim Jong Un dance around this huge country called America and all of our allies and he can posture, he can play games. The end is really simple. Does he want to stay under this level of pressure and watch his regime gradually crushed or does he want to give up his nuclear weapons and find a very, very different future as Secretary Pompeo described to him.

Kim Jong Un, well, he needs the summit to happen more than the U.S. Here with reaction, author of the upcoming book \"The Briefing,\" former White House press secretary Sean Spicer is with us, and former White House press secretary and Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer. It's a sad position for democrats to be in. All these 14 record states on low unemployment, all the different demographics on low unemployment records, you know, the president, North Korea is a great thing. For them to be happy, he has to fail."

      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "That's all true. But Sean, I have a surprising conclusion how bad it is with the press. It's actually good for Republicans. Because the press is so separating itself from the American people, particularly in the battleground states, that the Democrats read their good favorable press clips. They read the vehement anti-vitriolic Trump clips and they believe them. And the more they believe the good press they're getting, the more they separate themselves from the voters. The press has separated themselves from the American people. So you have a slice left that believes the press."

      "utterance": "The funny part is, all those clips forget what the president said at the beginning which is, if we get a deal, great. I might walk out. He laid the predicate for this a long time ago. And everybody is forgetting how he approached this to begin with. That's the important thing. The president has made very clear that he's willing to meet with him but he's willing to walk away from the table. That's what all of these people in their reports have forgotten. And you're absolutely right. He's gotten Kim Jong Un to give three American hostages back, he's gotten him to start talking about denuclearizing the Korea peninsula. Unemployment are at record low. So many millions of Americans are benefitting and they are doing whatever they can to figure out what negative news to cover. Because at the end of the day what's so fascinating is, most Americans are saying you know what, this president is keeping his promise as he's getting things done and America is better country before it. So I know for a lot of folks in the press corps, they're trying to figure where else can I find, what can I go after him on? But at the end of the day, Ari is right. They continue to show how wildly out of touch they are with the American people. Because the president is getting results both domestically and foreign policy-wise he's keeping the country safe, he's developing jobs--"

      "utterance": "They covered the hostages but it was a one-day story. But this is again, Sean, my point about how the press is separating itself from the people that they rely on and depend to buy their papers and news. Jill Abramson, the former executive of the New York Times said that every time Trump calls them the fake news, she hear the ching of the cash register as more people subscribe online. That's the curse of the New York Times. Because the people are subscribing online are so oppositional to President Trump--"

Zucker needs to pay me. But in all seriousness, they're not doing well with this. When did they -- if I was watching a president give a speech and they were chanting Fox News sucks, I'd be, I might take it seriously after a while."

I gave a lot of credit to CNN in terms of how they covered the campaign, how they ran their debate. And the suddenly on January 11 when Jim Acosta decided to become a carnival barker, they decided to change their entire model and realized that their model is not to try to follow MSNBC and become the other resistance."

And it's funny but I went long as I used to. I don't have time to run it full. And it's not good if I don't run it in full. So we will run that tomorrow. And I will find a way to shut up a little bit. All right. We will always be fair and balanced. We are not the destroy-Trump media. Thank you as always for being with us. We do appreciate it. Let not your heart be troubled. Big interview tonight."
