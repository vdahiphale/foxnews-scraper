      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It was just three days ago that \"New York Times\" reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin were the toast of the left. Boy, things move fast. Their new book appeared to finish the job that the national media started a year ago and take out Brett Kavanaugh for good. The authors accused Kavanaugh of committing a kind of sexual assault as a college student more than 30 years ago at Yale. Details were sparse, but it was enough to launch a tsunami of rage from the left. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Shouters on the other cable channels immediately denounced Kavanaugh as a gang rapist. Virtually all of the leading Democrats running for President demanded that Kavanaugh be impeached and removed from office. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then almost immediately, the story fell apart. Sunday night, the newspaper was forced to make a devastating correction to the piece. In fact, the woman that Kavanaugh supposedly attacked, didn't remember anything about the event. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And just like so many previous stories about Brett Kavanaugh, the whole thing turned out to be a crock. So last night, Kelly and Pogrebin sought refuge on MSNBC. In fact, on a show highly familiar with botched stories. Their explanation, \"Don't blame us, blame our editors.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They don't think you have a right to that context. Of course, these are also the people who took the Trump dossier seriously and buried the context in that. And you know, in some ways, it's a shame that Kelly and Pogrebin bungled their story so badly because the book actually has some interesting revelations in it -- assuming they're true. For example, they were the first reporters to get an on the record statement from Leland Keyser, that's the friend of Christine Blasey Ford, who supposedly could corroborate her story of being assaulted, but in the end did not corroborate it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why didn't she? Well, Keyser told the authors that she had quote, \"no confidence in Blasey Ford's story.\" That's not something the left wants you to hear. So of course, the authors downplayed that and buried it at the very end of the book. Really? It seems like the lead. But no, they downplayed it. They also downplayed another telling fact pattern, which is just how far the left is willing to go to destroy Kavanaugh last year. Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino also wrote a book on the subject. It's called \"Justice on Trial,\" and they reported that Leland Keyser face sustained pressure from the left to change her story, to lie and support Blasey Ford's account if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Kelly and Pogrebin found out what exactly that pressure was. They got text messages in which Blasey Ford's allies discussed defaming Leland Keyser, who is a suburban mom outside D.C. as a drug addict. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Keyser confirmed that this happened and she told the two reporters quote, \"I was told behind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn't comply.\" Now that's interesting story from a relevant -- it's not some unsupported gossip from a decades' old dorm party, it just happened last year. The problem with it, though, is that the story -- the truth of it -- makes the activists left look like ruthless fascists. Why? Because they kind of are. So \"The New York Times\" suppressed that. They want you to know, but you should know that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Brit Hume is Fox's Senior Political Analyst, and he joins us tonight.

A writer called George Packer just wrote a remarkable piece for \"The Atlantic\" magazine about his experience sending two children to New York City's public schools. Over the course of a decade, Packer writes that he watched as his children school shifted their agenda from education to the full time pursuit of a radical woke ideology. Now, Packer is not conservative. In fact, he is a lifelong liberal. He despises Donald Trump, but he is also an observant person and he is honest. In his piece, he admits something that could be professionally dangerous. The modern left scares him. For Packer, an early Red Flag Warning was bathroom policy. One day without warning or any discussion at all, the school that his children went to made every single bathroom gender neutral. Students were horrified, quote, \"Girls told their parents mortifying stories of having a boy kick open their stall door. Boys described being afraid to use the urinals. Our son reported that his classmates without any collective decision had simply gone back to the old system, regardless of the new signage. Boys were using the former boys' rooms; girls, the former girls' rooms. It was a quiet plea to be left alone.\" End quote. But of course, they weren't left alone. They never are. Later, Packer noticed that instead of learning reading and writing, his kids were learning a little more than to be advocates for far left politics. Quote, \"Our son learned about the genocide of Native Americans and slavery. But he was never taught about the founding of the Republic. He didn't learn that conflicting values and practical compromises are the lifeblood of self-government. He was given no context for the meaning of freedom of expression. He got his civics from Hamilton.\" End quote. In fifth grade, students at the school presented yearend projects that were nothing but political props, quote, \"The fifth graders presented dioramas on all the hard issues of the moment -- sexual harassment, LGBTQ rights, gun violence. Compared with previous years, the writing was minimal and the students when questioned, had little to say. They hadn't been encouraged to research their topics, make intellectual discoveries, answer potential counter arguments. The diorama is consisted of cardboard, clay and slogans.\" End quote. Mr. Packard's son moved on middle school, the signs grew even more ominous. At one Middle School, a large poster in the hallway warned students that they were tainted with privilege if they were white, or male or Christian or a citizen. Anyone who questioned this direction was presumed a reactionary and attacked. Teachers and school administrators warned that parents who didn't get on board were racist or bigots, or worse than that. Packer, though liberal, grew weary. But eventually it was his son who got fed up. He asked his father quote, \"Isn't school for learning Math and Science and Reading, not for teachers to tell us what they think about society?\" Well, that sounds like a rhetorical question, and if you have kids, you may have heard them ask it. But it's not a rhetorical question. For the woke-left, school really is about having teachers tell students what to believe. Packer had enough. He transferred his second child, a daughter to a private school to make sure she gets a proper education. In Bill de Blasio's New York, he won't be the last parent to do that because when it really matters, when it's about their kids, even sincere liberals will not sacrifice their own children to the church of wokeness. And by the way, they shouldn't have to; none of us should have to. It's not just happening in New York, though, it does seem particularly dire in the nation's biggest school system. Thanks, of course, to the Mayor of that city, Bill de Blasio, who by the way could soon end the city's best schools. The Mayor is currently considering a proposal that would abolish all gifted programs citywide, in the name of achieving classroom diversity. Nicole Malliotakis is a New York State Assemblywoman who ran against Mayor de Blasio for Mayor and she joins us tonight. Nicole, thanks so much for coming on. So I don't think it's an overstatement to say that there are a few number of schools that really are the crown jewel, not just of the New York system, but really of the country.

Boy, things move fast. Their new book appeared to finish the job that the national media started a year ago and take out Brett Kavanaugh for good. The authors accused Kavanaugh of committing a kind of sexual assault as a college student more than 30 years ago at Yale. Details were sparse, but it was enough to launch a tsunami of rage from the left. Shouters on the other cable channels immediately denounced Kavanaugh as a gang rapist. Virtually all of the leading Democrats running for President demanded that Kavanaugh be impeached and removed from office. And then almost immediately, the story fell apart. Sunday night, the newspaper was forced to make a devastating correction to the piece. In fact, the woman that Kavanaugh supposedly attacked, didn't remember anything about the event. And just like so many previous stories about Brett Kavanaugh, the whole thing turned out to be a crock. So last night, Kelly and Pogrebin sought refuge on MSNBC. In fact, on a show highly familiar with botched stories. Their explanation, \"Don't blame us, blame our editors.\""

And so I think in this case, the editors felt like maybe it was probably better to remove it. And in removing her name, they removed the other reference to the fact that she didn't remember."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Just a short mention. Of course, it's the critical claim in the story/book. We looked at some context. Well, it turns out some people think it's relevant when a character destroying smear comes from political activists, rather than from, say, ordinary citizens. You ought to be able to know that when you're reading the piece, \"The Time\" disagrees, though. They don't think you have a right to that context. Of course, these are also the people who took the Trump dossier seriously and buried the context in that. And you know, in some ways, it's a shame that Kelly and Pogrebin bungled their story so badly because the book actually has some interesting revelations in it -- assuming they're true. For example, they were the first reporters to get an on the record statement from Leland Keyser, that's the friend of Christine Blasey Ford, who supposedly could corroborate her story of being assaulted, but in the end did not corroborate it. Why didn't she? Well, Keyser told the authors that she had quote, \"no confidence in Blasey Ford's story.\" That's not something the left wants you to hear. So of course, the authors downplayed that and buried it at the very end of the book. Really? It seems like the lead. But no, they downplayed it. They also downplayed another telling fact pattern, which is just how far the left is willing to go to destroy Kavanaugh last year. Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino also wrote a book on the subject. It's called \"Justice on Trial,\" and they reported that Leland Keyser face sustained pressure from the left to change her story, to lie and support Blasey Ford's account Kelly and Pogrebin found out what exactly that pressure was. They got text messages in which Blasey Ford's allies discussed defaming Leland Keyser, who is a suburban mom outside D.C. as a drug addict. Keyser confirmed that this happened and she told the two reporters quote, \"I was told behind the scenes that certain things could be spread about me if I didn't comply.\" Now that's interesting story from a relevant -- it's not some unsupported gossip from a decades' old dorm party, it just happened last year. The problem with it, though, is that the story -- the truth of it -- makes the activists left look like ruthless fascists. Why? Because they kind of are. So \"The New York Times\" suppressed that. They want you to know, but you should know that. Brit Hume is Fox's Senior Political Analyst, and he joins us tonight. So Brit, as a piece of journalism, how do you assess the story?"

    {
      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "This is a story that should never have gotten anywhere near print. I mean this -- remember now, we're talking here about a second hand account from a witness that the authors did not speak to and who is not speaking. And he has said by friends to be saying this happen, right? So it isn't even a first-hand account. So right there, you've got a huge strike against you if you're trying to get the story independently in the old \"New York Times\" right? And then on top of that, you have the fact that the woman herself is not talking -- the alleged victim is not talking and has told -- and she has told friends that she didn't remember this. So I mean, I can only imagine what would have happened back in my newspaper days, if I went to an editor and say, \"This is what I've got.\" But I can just see him picking up the copy and throwing it across the room. I mean, you couldn't get anywhere near -- this is nowhere near publishable. It's not even remotely close."

And he has been, you know, he has been a reputable judge and a man with no history of this sort of stuff.

I remember when Abe Rosenthal was the legendary curmudgeonly editor of \"The Times' for many, many long years, I went to see him once about a job. This was years ago, back in the 70s, and he is an eccentric guy, no doubt about it. But he was a very strong editor. And he said to me, \"When I'm gone,\" he said, \"I want to be said of me, quote, 'he kept the paper straight.'\" That actually is on his gravestone. And I remember thinking at the time, \"The New York Times\" was the straightest newspaper anywhere. It was the Bible. It was the reliable source. When I was covering Reaganomics in the early 80s in Congress, \"The Washington Post\" was writing all kinds of editorialized stuff on their news pages about it. \"The New York Times\" didn't do that. They played it very straight. They were very fair. Always were, right? Well, now I understand what Abe Rosenthal was worried about.

Klopfer had plied his trade it turns out South Bend, Indiana, the city that St. Pete is the mayor of, but weirdly so far, Buttigieg has not commented on the incident in any way. Why is that?

And so your heart has to go to these women because women who have had abortions, they're terrified that their terminated pregnancy became this man's trophy. They want answers.

So Buttigieg, he is more than happy to make these statements about being pro-choice, about opposing regulation on abortion clinics.

Now, Packer is not conservative. In fact, he is a lifelong liberal. He despises Donald Trump, but he is also an observant person and he is honest. In his piece, he admits something that could be professionally dangerous. The modern left scares him. For Packer, an early Red Flag Warning was bathroom policy. One day without warning or any discussion at all, the school that his children went to made every single bathroom gender neutral. Students were horrified, quote, \"Girls told their parents mortifying stories of having a boy kick open their stall door. Boys described being afraid to use the urinals. Our son reported that his classmates without any collective decision had simply gone back to the old system, regardless of the new signage. Boys were using the former boys' rooms; girls, the former girls' rooms. It was a quiet plea to be left alone.\" End quote. But of course, they weren't left alone. They never are. Later, Packer noticed that instead of learning reading and writing, his kids were learning a little more than to be advocates for far left politics. Quote, \"Our son learned about the genocide of Native Americans and slavery. But he was never taught about the founding of the Republic. He didn't learn that conflicting values and practical compromises are the lifeblood of self-government. He was given no context for the meaning of freedom of expression. He got his civics from Hamilton.\" End quote. In fifth grade, students at the school presented yearend projects that were nothing but political props, quote, \"The fifth graders presented dioramas on all the hard issues of the moment -- sexual harassment, LGBTQ rights, gun violence. Compared with previous years, the writing was minimal and the students when questioned, had little to say. They hadn't been encouraged to research their topics, make intellectual discoveries, answer potential counter arguments. The diorama is consisted of cardboard, clay and slogans.\" End quote. Mr. Packard's son moved on middle school, the signs grew even more ominous. At one Middle School, a large poster in the hallway warned students that they were tainted with privilege if they were white, or male or Christian or a citizen. Anyone who questioned this direction was presumed a reactionary and attacked. Teachers and school administrators warned that parents who didn't get on board were racist or bigots, or worse than that. Packer, though liberal, grew weary. But eventually it was his son who got fed up. He asked his father quote, \"Isn't school for learning Math and Science and Reading, not for teachers to tell us what they think about society?\" Well, that sounds like a rhetorical question, and if you have kids, you may have heard them ask it. But it's not a rhetorical question. For the woke-left, school really is about having teachers tell students what to believe. Packer had enough. He transferred his second child, a daughter to a private school to make sure she gets a proper education. In Bill de Blasio's New York, he won't be the last parent to do that because when it really matters, when it's about their kids, even sincere liberals will not sacrifice their own children to the church of wokeness. And by the way, they shouldn't have to; none of us should have to. It's not just happening in New York, though, it does seem particularly dire in the nation's biggest school system. Thanks, of course, to the Mayor of that city, Bill de Blasio, who by the way could soon end the city's best schools. The Mayor is currently considering a proposal that would abolish all gifted programs citywide, in the name of achieving classroom diversity. Nicole Malliotakis is a New York State Assemblywoman who ran against Mayor de Blasio for Mayor and she joins us tonight. Nicole, thanks so much for coming on. So I don't think it's an overstatement to say that there are a few number of schools that really are the crown jewel, not just of the New York system, but really of the country. Some of the best high schools in the world are public schools in New York. And with one signature, your Mayor is threatening to eliminate them."

      "utterance": "Well, these are specialized schools that have produced Nobel Prize winners and the hypocrisy of it all is even his son, Dante graduated from one of these specialized schools. So not only is he trying to reduce the standards at these schools, he wants to completely eliminate our gifted and talented program, which is in such high demand. Seventy eight percent of the kids that qualify for these programs aren't even getting in because there's not seats and parents and teachers want more seats added. Meanwhile, a Mayor wants to get rid of it for some social justice experiment that he is trying to accomplish. And the bottom line here is that when every student can qualify for these gifted and talented schools, that's when we have achieved true social justice because we are preparing them for the real world."

      "utterance": "The weirdest part of this story, and the most telling part is, he is justifying this desecration of the one good thing left in New York City on the grounds of diversity. But these schools are not majority white. I mean, they're actually I think, pretty, overwhelmingly non-white immigrant. That's who is going to pay the price."

      "speaker": "MALLIOTAKIS",
      "utterance": "Many are Asian children who are first generation. They come from poor families. They've worked hard to get into these programs. And the Mayor wants to basically end this program. Instead of actually lifting up the children in other schools who are not able to qualify these programs, that's the whole key here. This Mayor has spent three quarters of a billion dollars to hire high-price consultants, some of them even $1,400.00 a day, instead of actually putting that money into helping lift the children from all across our city that actually need the help, whether it be through test prep, whether it be through adding teachers assistants. And that's one of the reasons why I'm running for Congress, because this is Federal money that is trickling down to the city level and it's not getting where it needs to go and our Mayor is looking to conduct this social experiment and again, he should be looking to lift every child in New York City not be spending all this millions and millions and billions of dollars on all of these consultants and vendors instead."

      "utterance": "The U.S. Navy just made a stunning admission. Naval officials yesterday confirmed that three separate UFO videos released by The \"New York Times\" in 2017 and previewed on the show are actually genuine. They do in fact show aerial phenomenon the Navy cannot explain, and in fact, our understanding of Physics cannot explain. The Navy also recently sent a letter to Congressman Mark Walker saying that it takes UFO sightings very seriously and is working to investigate them. Nick Pope is a British journalist. He once investigated UFOs for the U.K. Ministry of Defense. He joins us tonight to explain the significance of this. So Nick, this does seem like a change in the way the Pentagon describes this phenomenon, is it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NICK POPE, FORMER U.K. OFFICIAL",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is. Up until this point, the Navy has set very little. And in fact, they've left the door open sometimes and almost implied, look, we might be dealing with commercial drones or even balloons. But now what they've done is turned around and said, number one, this is real. And number two, this is unidentified aerial phenomena. That's the phrase that they've used. Previously, they've said \"advanced unknown aircraft.\" Now they're saying unidentified aerial phenomena. And that is it's a term borrowed from the British government. We used it in the Ministry of Defense, and we meant UFOs."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So, the U.S. government is admitting that they have no idea what these things are and that they're probably not some Russian super plane and nobody is paying attention to this. I mean, this seems like a watershed moment. I mean, we have all this tape of objects defying the known laws of Physics right next to U.S. military installations. The military admits it. Why is this not Page 1 news everywhere?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POPE",
      "utterance": "Well, it should be. Absolutely. These aircraft carriers that many of these UFOs have been interacting with, obviously, these are billion dollar assets. And if the official position of the most powerful Navy in the world is frankly a little more than, \"We don't know what this is.\" I don't think that's good enough. And I think clearly people like Mark Walker, don't think so either. And I would urge him to get the classified briefing that other senators have said they've received and maybe within the bounds of not wanting to divulge classified information, but maybe some of these senators could then step forward and at least give us a clue of what we're dealing with here."

      "speaker": "POPE",
      "utterance": "No, absolutely not. Somebody in the Pentagon must have. They say we don't want to hypothesize about this. That's fine. But there must be in the Pentagon a best assessment. And there must be a view of what they're rolling out. We should be told."
