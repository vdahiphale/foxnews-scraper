They have tried to utterly ruin what it turns out to be a good man. No due process, no presumption of innocence and literally no corroboration at all. And shamefully they are using in almost four decades old sexual misconduct allegation as a political ploy, and they are demanding that a man with what is an impeccable 40 year track record prove his innocence from charges featuring again, no corroboration, no location, no date, all because Brett Kavanaugh is appointed by Donald Trump and has a more conservative judicial philosophy.

She doesn't remember how she got to the alleged party. She doesn't remember how she got back from the party and not one person corroborates her story. We also learned today she doesn't remember if she handed \"The Washington Post\" therapy notes just a few weeks ago. Now, in minutes -- just minutes ago, \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board fully endorsed the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and also moments ago, we learned that Senator Mitch McConnell announced the Senate Judicial Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, will, in fact, in the morning, they are moving forward, he said.

It shouldn't be about Democrat/Republican, liberal/conservative at all. They wanted and stated from the beginning, they wanted to ruin Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and over unsubstantiated, uncorroborated claims from nearly four decades ago. For the left at this point, it's not about sexual misconduct. Otherwise they would be talking about Keith Ellison. They would have had more harsh statements about Bill Clinton. This has not been about protecting victims or finding the truth even. To them, from day one, Chuck Schumer leading the way, this has all been political. It is a sad day for the country, what we had to witness today. The worst part of this is, Senator Dianne Feinstein knew about these claims since July.

Only after Brett Kavanaugh's nomination looked imminent did Dianne Feinstein and Democrats announce Ford's allegations. This has been a disgraceful display of politics at its worst. Is reelection more important than another person's life here? Did anyone hear the pain in Brett Kavanaugh's voice today? And, by the way, I would argue too, Professor Ford to come up as Susan Collins has said it, nobody has been served well here. She wished to remain anonymous. The story got leaked. Her name got leaked. And without any corroboration or evidence, then you have politicians smearing Kavanaugh again and again on national TV.

Breaking tonight as you just noted a moment ago, Republican Bob Corker he was sitting on the fence he just announced that he is a yes for Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. We are also learning that the Senate judiciary committee will meet tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. Eastern Time, expecting to vote. Then they hope to get it to the Senate floor and that's going to be the real fight it could come as early as Tuesday. Now after several hours of testimony by Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, these are still uncorroborated charges so lawmakers in both parties are basically unmoved. Some Democrats have imposed -- opposed since the night Kavanaugh was nominated and many Republicans say, as you just heard from Lindsey Graham, this was character assassination and there are several holes to Dr. Ford story. So this is going to come down to a handful of votes. Look at these folks right here. Republican Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, plus Democrat Joe Manchin. Maybe a couple of other Democrats from red states. The four lawmakers you see there, they met tonight behind closed doors for 30 minutes to think about what exactly they are going to do next. They are keeping their cards close for now. Democratic Chris Coons tonight called for a one week delay in the proceedings, perhaps hoping to get momentum for a new FBI investigation that does not seem likely to happen. Republican John Cornyn, meanwhile, said the longer Republicans wait to vote, there will just be more unverified allegations thrown at Kavanaugh. Cornyn declaring that this idea that the judge is guilty until proven innocent is like a police state. Watch. SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R—TEXAS: It's time to vote. The longer the nomination remains open, we know that more and more of these careless anonymous and uncorroborated allegations will be made. Unfortunately, that's part of the search and destroy process, that frankly, I think is an embarrassment to the Senate. That is sort of the lingering core concern here is about his credibility. He's worked very hard to put forward the aspects of his life that are admirable that it require boy narrative, but I think it's undeniable that there is a whole series of incidents and events in his life that also set that frat boy image.",

He said on Twitter, quote, \"Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him. His testimony was powerful, honest and riveting. The Democrats search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham, an effort to delay, distract and resist. The Senate must vote.\" Now there was a lot of concern within the West Wing that Judge Kavanaugh hadn't been forceful enough in his interview on Fox early this week. Clearly today he did not have that problem. It's also clear that the White House was very pleased with Senator Lindsey Graham's performance. Both Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Sanders tweeted about it. During the hearing, the White House press secretary said, quote, \"Lindsey Graham has more decency and courage than every Democratic member of the committee combined. God bless him.\" And you know, Sean, that was -- that was a real turning point, so was Kavanaugh's opening statement after what many in the West Wing considered to be somewhat of a shaky start because even they, some of them at least, conceded that Dr. Ford did appeared to be credible.

They have tried to utterly ruin what it turns out to be a good man. No due process, no presumption of innocence and literally no corroboration at all. And shamefully they are using in almost four decades old sexual misconduct allegation as a political ploy, and they are demanding that a man with what is an impeccable 40 year track record prove his innocence from charges featuring again, no corroboration, no location, no date, all because Brett Kavanaugh is appointed by Donald Trump and has a more conservative judicial philosophy.

Shortly after I was nominated, the Democratic Senate leader said he would quote oppose me with everything he's got. A Democratic senator on this committee publicly referred to me as evil, given comments like those. Is it any surprise that people have been willing to do anything, to make any physical threat against my family, to send any violent email to my wife, to make any kind of allegation against me and against my friends, to blow me up and take me down?

Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready. This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee and by staff. It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits. When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.

They wanted and stated from the beginning, they wanted to ruin Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and over unsubstantiated, uncorroborated claims from nearly four decades ago. For the left at this point, it's not about sexual misconduct. Otherwise they would be talking about Keith Ellison. They would have had more harsh statements about Bill Clinton. This has not been about protecting victims or finding the truth even. To them, from day one, Chuck Schumer leading the way, this has all been political. It is a sad day for the country, what we had to witness today. The worst part of this is, Senator Dianne Feinstein knew about these claims since July. She knew about these charges when she actually met with Kavanaugh in private. She knew about these claims when she questioned him during his public hearing several weeks ago. And when she met privately with Brett Kavanaugh, she had already been recommending attorneys to Professor Ford. Only after Brett Kavanaugh's nomination looked imminent did Dianne Feinstein and Democrats announce Ford's allegations. This has been a disgraceful display of politics at its worst. Is reelection more important than another person's life here? Did anyone hear the pain in Brett Kavanaugh's voice today? And, by the way, I would argue too, Professor Ford to come up as Susan Collins has said it, nobody has been served well here. She wished to remain anonymous. The story got leaked. Her name got leaked. And without any corroboration or evidence, then you have politicians smearing Kavanaugh again and again on national TV. And this is just a small sampling. Take a look. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D—CALIF.: The Senate shouldn't simply rely on hearing two conflicting accounts and decide -- well, we are okay with not knowing. We are okay with the fact that we might be putting someone who committed attempted rape on the Supreme Court of the United States. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D—CALIF.: I believe her. Listen, first of all, anybody who comes forward at this point to be prepared to testify in the United States Senate against someone who is being nominated to one of the most powerful positions in the United States government, that takes an extraordinary amount of courage. SEN. MAIZE HIRONO, D—HI.: Not only do women, like Dr. Ford who bravely comes forward, need to be heard but they need to be believed. They need to be believed."

This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee and by staff. It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits. When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit. Fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.

THEN-SENATOR JOE BIDEN, D—DEL.: The next person that refers to an FBI report as being worth anything obviously doesn't understand anything. FBI explicitly does not in this or any other case reach a conclusion. Period. Period. So, judge, there's no reason why you should know this. The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report, you wouldn't like it if we did, because it is inconclusive. They say he said, she said and they said, period.

I warn people every single two years, every four years on my radio show and right here on this show, Republicans, be prepared to be demonized, racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, you want dirty air and water, you want to kill children and there will be some Paul Ryan lookalike throwing your grandmother over the cliff because Republicans want granny to die. And it's the same now with Supreme Court nominees, same predictable behavior. We've now come to expect this. This has to change, this country deserves better. The people of this country deserve better. These people in D.C., and this swamp, they are supposed to serve us, you, we, the people. It's not about a Republican, Democrat, liberal or conservative here. This is pure human decency that was in play today. They destroyed this man and his family. They bludgeoned him, all for the sake of power. There was zero presumption of innocence here or due process. Now, the Democratic Party, every two, four years, every time we have a nomination to the Supreme Court, we know what to expect, the party of slander, besmirchments, smears, character assassination, the party of no due process, no presumption of innocence, the party that rushes to judgment. Look at all the high profile cases rushed to judgment -- the Duke lacrosse case, the Cambridge police acted stupidly, Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore, Maryland, Richard Jewell, Trayvon Martin. Is this the party that is going to decide the fate of this country? Because in 40 days, that same party wants you to go out and vote for them. Look at your screen. You see these Republican senators? These are the people who will decide the fate of the Kavanaugh nomination right there. Those are the people that will decide if we still have due process in this country. If these principles exist in this country, if we still have laws predicated on the Constitution, let them know how to vote. Call them. Tell them what's at stake. Let them know what you felt today watching these hearings, and if you are in one of the states where Donald Trump won, West Virginia, Joe Manchin, North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp, Indiana, Joe Donnelly, you're a senators up for reelection. If they don't confirm Judge Kavanaugh and they go along with the smear campaign, if they go ahead and do that, are you going to vote for them? There is a lot in the next few days, weeks and months that we're going to decide and we have a lot to get to in the course of this program tonight. I just want to say, what we are looking at here tonight, what we are looking at, you get to hold them accountable for your decisions. Never has a Supreme Court nomination been more important. This country is at a tipping point. Inalienable rights of Americans will continue or we are never going to be able to go back. Our Constitution, all these core principles hang in the balance tonight and we have one party that is throwing all of this to the wind and adopted smear, slander, personal politics and destruction. Unless good senators find a backbone and stick up for these core fundamental rights of every human being, like we've been talking about, due process, justice, law, order. Democrats take down Judge Kavanaugh, a man with impeccable service and 40-year track record, they can take down anybody, any conservative, any politician for any reason on any allegation with zero proof, ever. The Senate cannot let this happen. They cannot reward this behavior. Joining us now, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator, good to see you. Thank you. I've known you a long time."

If I helped him today, it's one of the highlights of my career. And to my Republican colleagues, if this guy goes down, then we don't deserve to stay in power, because it's not about power to me. It is about the process. It is honoring elections. To my Democratic friends -- Joe Manchin, I liked him a lot. Joe, you can't figure this out? Trump won by 40 points. Do you really believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a serial rapist? Do you believe any of this garbage? And I'm sorry that Dr. Ford went through this, she shouldn't have had to go through it, but I am convinced beyond any shadow of a doubt that Brett Kavanaugh is not the man that they are trying to make him and this is all political.

Breaking tonight as you just noted a moment ago, Republican Bob Corker he was sitting on the fence he just announced that he is a yes for Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. We are also learning that the Senate judiciary committee will meet tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. Eastern Time, expecting to vote. Then they hope to get it to the Senate floor and that's going to be the real fight it could come as early as Tuesday. Now after several hours of testimony by Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, these are still uncorroborated charges so lawmakers in both parties are basically unmoved. Some Democrats have imposed -- opposed since the night Kavanaugh was nominated and many Republicans say, as you just heard from Lindsey Graham, this was character assassination and there are several holes to Dr. Ford story. So this is going to come down to a handful of votes. Look at these folks right here. Republican Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, plus Democrat Joe Manchin. Maybe a couple of other Democrats from red states. The four lawmakers you see there, they met tonight behind closed doors for 30 minutes to think about what exactly they are going to do next. They are keeping their cards close for now. Democratic Chris Coons tonight called for a one week delay in the proceedings, perhaps hoping to get momentum for a new FBI investigation that does not seem likely to happen. Republican John Cornyn, meanwhile, said the longer Republicans wait to vote, there will just be more unverified allegations thrown at Kavanaugh. Cornyn declaring that this idea that the judge is guilty until proven innocent is like a police state. Watch. SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R—TEXAS: It's time to vote. The longer the nomination remains open, we know that more and more of these careless anonymous and uncorroborated allegations will be made. Unfortunately, that's part of the search and destroy process, that frankly, I think is an embarrassment to the Senate. That is sort of the lingering core concern here is about his credibility. He's worked very hard to put forward the aspects of his life that are admirable that it require boy narrative, but I think it's undeniable that there is a whole series of incidents and events in his life that also set that frat boy image."

The Democrats search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham, an effort to delay, distract and resist. The Senate must vote.\" Now there was a lot of concern within the West Wing that Judge Kavanaugh hadn't been forceful enough in his interview on Fox early this week.

During the hearing, the White House press secretary said, quote, \"Lindsey Graham has more decency and courage than every Democratic member of the committee combined. God bless him.\" And you know, Sean, that was -- that was a real turning point, so was Kavanaugh's opening statement after what many in the West Wing considered to be somewhat of a shaky start because even they, some of them at least, conceded that Dr. Ford did appeared to be credible. But by and large, Sean, President Trump very pleased with Judge Kavanaugh's performance today."

Here with reaction for Judicial Crisis Network, Carrie Severino, chairman of the American Conservative Union, longtime friend of Judge Kavanaugh, Matt Schlapp, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter. I don't know about all of you. Everybody that I know that watch this today, so many people said it was hard and painful. They cried. It was to watch, it was -- it was -- you saw they destroyed this man's family allegation flying around everywhere. No corroboration on any of them."

And for the first time I think we all realized as a nation, it's not that we are dismissing Dr. Ford. It's not that we are dismissing that maybe something did happen to her. But we're a system based on justice, you are innocent until proven guilty and there was no evidence other than he said, she said corroborating what happened and what Dr. Ford alleged happened to her. And I think at that point, when we hear this man cry out and say, look at what you have done to my family. Look at what you've done to our nation. Is this what we're going to do to each other? I think at that point the country took a step back and people were swayed by Kavanaugh."

He understands the moment, Sean, we are in a very unique moment. We are in a moment where we could get five votes on the Supreme Court for a constitutional order. We can actually have a Senate majority that follows through on promises and we could still hold onto this House majority. It all comes down to this very basic thing, to our supporters out there, our grassroots supporters believe it. When we say we are going to do things like confirm from that list, that tweet from our president, that tweet from our president. Most presidents would have's throne this guy to the side of the first side of all this controversy. He stuck with him and I'm proud of him."

      "utterance": "Yes. I think a lot of people say, again, very, very emotional and compelling testimony from Dr. Ford, but then Judge Kavanaugh as well, you saw that. It looks like, you know, maybe she was, as I think Kavanaugh himself said, she may have very well have experienced real sexual assault sometime in her life, but all of the facts are piling up, go to the point that he isn't the one who did it. You have all the people who she said were there, who testified and said, I don't think this party happened. I was at this party. I don't over -- even her good friend, her lifelong friend who supports her in general but says I don't think I even know Brett Kavanaugh. I don't think I was at this party. So when you get past, you know, trying to sort out the memories over the 30 years, there aren't any corroborating facts. That didn't change, in fact even some of the facts in the story shifted. What you really could see though, is the pain they had both been put through. All of that is the Senate Democrats. I think so many things came out that showed it's on their shoulders. They seem to have been manipulating this whole process, holding back the allegations."

Someone on Capitol Hill just posted on Wikipedia the home addresses of several Republican senators including Lindsey Graham, who you had on a few minutes ago. It's an ugly practice known as doctoring so protesters can try and threaten then. Then there is former Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon, he just called the judge an attempted rapist and threatening to impeach if he wins. Quote, \"If Senate GOP ignores Dr. Blasey Ford, tries to muscle and attempted racist -- rapist on the Supreme Court they will pay dearly this November. Senators up in 2020 will feel intense heat for next two years. Kavanaugh will not serve for life.\" That is a threat tonight from someone on the left, Sean."
