      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And tonight, President Trump will leave the White House now in less than 24 hours. This presidency has been a historic on so many levels. One thing I can guarantee you, this will be studied about and written about for decades and likely hundreds and hundreds of years down the road. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the president signaling today is that this is perhaps just the beginning. We'll have more coming up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And predictably, the vitriol on the left has never been worse. Democrats, the mob, the media, they are just out for a pure vengeance, continuing their never-ending hatred. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as per usual, weak, spineless, pathetic establishment Republicans are all too happy to oblige, and now, a sham unconstitutional impeachment charade trial going to the U.S. Senate. Now, if Republicans allow this, they shouldn't. And in a moment, I'll have a special message for Mitch McConnell and any other Republican in the Senate considering what is in unconstitutional, post-presidential impeachment Schiff show that hurts the country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's start by stating the obvious. The Washington swamp, they don't like Donald Trump. Never have, never will. He's always been an outsider, a disruptor, an iconoclast, a businessman. And you know what? He doesn't apologize for fighting and fighting and fighting to keep his promises to we, the American people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As a matter of fact, I actually have right here -- the White House put it out today -- these are 1,000 Trump accomplishments in the last four years and, yeah, there is real stuff in here, real accomplishments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, they may not like his style, but he connects with the American people from every walk of life. He does it with his America first policies. You know, if you go back to 1964, Ronald Reagan gave a speech, a famous one, it's called \"The Time for Choosing\". Now, he asked the question rhetorically, is it a third party the Republican Party needs and he concluded, no, he said we need a revitalized second party with no bold -- with bold colors and no pale pastels. In other words, a Republican Party that doesn't make apologies, set the bar high, would fight to keep their word and their promises and not let themselves become a watered-down version of Democratic socialists. They would have bold color differences. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Over the past four years, that is exactly everything that Donald Trump did. And earlier tonight, he reflected on some of his many historic achievements, 1,000, at least by the White House tonight. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But ultimately, this is why Americans voted for Donald Trump and not 17 other establishment Republicans, although some were. The establishment Republicans have no backbone, no principle, no courage, no vision. Too many politicians in D.C. are just far too willing to go along, get along, and protect the swamp, and that is why conservatives like myself, well, we're tired of these empty promises and your rehearsed speeches and never getting anything done. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } America voted, and, by the way, you helped elect Donald Trump if you want to know the truth. The American people voted for a president that would deliver even if that meant at times hurting people's precious little feelings and your swamp, and that's what President Trump did. Slashed regulations, cut taxes, unleashed American energy, expanded fracking, opened ANWR, negotiated new trade deals, built 450 miles of new border wall and as promised, no new foreign wars and he believed peace through strength so he built up our military. Under the president, well, we lead on the world stage. Policy, peace through strength and he did all of this and all he could do a lot of times without the help of people like you and other Republicans in Congress like your Senate, you know, two years earlier voted for a straight repeal of Obamacare but then when it mattered, the same bill two years later when Donald Trump was president, you were nowhere to be found in your body. The president -- the president forcefully stood up to the bias and corruption plaguing every corner of America's powerful institutions. You know, Okay, Mitch, I'll give you an A+ on getting constitutionalist judges on the bench. You've been great on judges. But, frankly, it looks like it's time now, you're going to go along with all of this nonsense.

Every Republican in the Senate, let me be even more clear. Not one Republican senator should be wasting a second of precious time. You're off half the year anyway on this post-presidential impeachment charade. Every Republican senator needs to walk out of what would be in impeachment Schiff show, probably Romney, Sasse, and Murkowski will stay, and when it's over, Republican should walk back in and acquit the president of the United States or former president at the time, and stop the unconstitutional Schiff show. And, Mitch, if the choice, to be frank with you, is weak establishment Republicanism versus America first, I choose the latter. If I venture to guess the overwhelming majority of Republicans would agree with me. It's why I'm not a Republican. I'm a registered conservative. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Your fellow Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is absolutely right when he stated that if the Senate but you supposedly lead, Republicans go along with this snap impeachment nonsense, it will be the end of the Republican Party. It's unconstitutional, it's beyond divisive, it's a political ploy by Democrats to seek revenge on President Trump, and, of course, humiliate the 75 million people who voted for him, 93 percent according to a recent poll would vote for him again today. This is also an attempt to banish President Trump from ever running again. Hey, Mitch, that decision should not be yours. That needs to be left with we, the American people, not Republican senators. Now more than ever, we need elected officials to stand up we, the people. The rhetoric from the left downright chilling. It's gotten progressively worse over the last five years with Donald Trump now powerful institutions in D.C. That would include the Democrats, the media mob, big tech, all moving to silence and cancel any opinions they don't like. And as you all know, President Trump has been banned permanently from nearly every social media platform, so to have many of his supporters, American citizens. For days, our friends of Parler who were competitors of Twitter were kicked off the Internet altogether, thanks to an alliance of big tech companies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And meanwhile, the incoming President Joe Biden is actually comparing Senator Cruz and Josh Hawley and propagandist Joseph Goebbels because they supported a legal audit of election results. Oh, something Democrats in 2000, 2001, 2016 and ‘17 and 2004 and ‘05 also called for. Other top Democrats want them to be treated like domestic terrorists put on the no- fly list when they were expressing an opinion and looking for a legal audit. That's all. Students at Harvard now calling for the school to revoke any degree from anyone associated with President Trump. Have you or have you ever been a President Trump supporter? \"The Forbes\" magazine writes that if you worked in the Trump administration, we're going to take note. You better not be hired. What? Is that the America we live in? Now going after the president, going after his daughter, son-in-law, his other son who can even buy a house without being persecuted and live in a neighborhood when they pay -- that's America? A truly insane column in The Washington Post today all but accusing people like me on this network of sedition, wanting us to be silenced, ripped off the air. And that's not all, former PBS lawyer -- thought it was probably an outlier, I was wrong, caught on tape, going to empower the government to take us away from their parents and have them go to reeducation camps and watch PBS all day. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Many other outlets in the mob openly searching ways to deprogram Trump supporters.

The most important of all the documents is what I call the September 2017 confessional, a year after he was fired terminated by the FBI, Christopher Steele sat back down by the agents and he described his motives, his tactics, what he did. And there are some bombshell revelations. First off, as you just reported, his motive for going to the news media and creating the false Russia collusion narrative during the 2016 election was because the email scandal had come and reared its head again against Hillary Clinton, he was concerned it was going to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances so he put the Russia story out there to help kind of distract from her -- from her scandal. Secondly, he admits that another one of his motives was that he considered Donald Trump to be his main opponent. He considered Donald Trump to be bad for Great Britain, for the U.S.-U.K. relationship. So that's another reason he leaked. Now, let's think about that. He's a foreigner interfering in our election by leaking information to help Hillary Clinton and to help Great Britain. That's what he admitted to in this interview with the FBI. Third, he divulges where he got his sub-source, the famous sub-source; the primary sub-sources the FBI called them. This is the person that gave him most of the bad garbage that was ultimately discredited by the FBI, proven disproven. He got that a relationship with that sub-source from none other than Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council for Donald Trump, who became an impeachment witness against Trump in 2019. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why is that significant? Well, beyond the interesting connections, by the time, Fiona Hill turned over this sub-source to Christopher Steele, the FBI was already investigating the sub-source as a possible Russian asset. In fact, they were trying to get a FISA warrant on him when he fled the country and they dropped the effort. So, Fiona Hill, someone who worked for the Trump NSC gave Christopher Steele a bad source that the FBI ultimately feared was a Russian asset.",

Now let me tell you about something we're going to have in the morning, it's going to take some time to develop it overnight. But I think people will be surprised by this revelation. In 2014, the FBI determined that a foreign power was trying to influence Hillary Clinton and her campaign when she ran. In fact, they feared that they were going to do it through the delivery of money. The FBI tried for several months to get a FISA warrant, but they -- according to these documents -- they were turned down or held up by the seventh floor. James Comey and Andrew McCabe is the seventh floor. They ultimately decided not to investigate it any further and unlike what they did to Donald Trump, they went to Hillary Clinton and gave her a defensive briefing and told her what this foreign power was trying to do. They did it through her attorney David Kendall. It shows the entirely different system of justice. Hillary Clinton gets a defensive briefing, no FISA. Donald Trump gets a FISA, no defensive briefing, and three and a half years of pain and suffering to his presidency and campaign. These documents are extraordinary. They were kept from the American public and the Congress as President Trump said today when he declassified the documents. And this is the tip of the iceberg. We're going to have more with John tomorrow night. John, thank you. That is unbelievable, unreal. All right. Now, tonight, there are GOP senators standing up to the madness that's being promoted by Chucky Schumer, the mob, and apparently Mitch McConnell, about what would be an unconstitutional, post-presidency impeachment, because one thing's for sure, Republicans go along with another one of the Democrats Schiff shows on the capital.

Five years and for people like Stephen Colbert who was in a distant third place in late night to mock the first lady in the way that he did with such hate to the governor's point, well, guess what, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Colbert is going to actually have to find a way to be a comedian again because he's turned his show basically into an extension of CNN or MSNBC and serving at the pleasure of the Democratic Party. Now, suddenly, with President Trump gone, so does the gravy train for him go and as a result, you're going to see Stephen Colbert become irrelevant in an awful hurry. Look, Melania Trump was mocked by the Jimmy Kimmels of the world, you remember, Sean, for having an accent. She's an immigrant. So, now, it's okay to mock immigrants for their accent? She speaks five languages which is four more than Kimmel speaks. So I found that pretty interesting. She also once had a kidney procedure and you had conspiracy theorists posing as media reporters on CNN openly wondering where is Melania Trump after she literally had a procedure on her kidney and she was recovering from something like that. So this first lady has been treated worse than any first lady in modern history by a country mile. And as far as Elise Stefanik, she's 36 years old. At last check in New York, it's not really that big of a deal or really that much of a newsworthy item that if you don't have kids in your mid-30s while you're pursuing a career like she is I know in my case and with my wife, I didn't -- I wasn't until I was in my early 40s until we had our first child obviously. My wife, much younger, looking much younger as well, can attest to that. So this whole thing, as far as Elise Stefanik is concerned, if there wasn't an \"R\" next to her name, this isn't a story. But she's mocked as childless at 36 in New York, I'm sorry.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And tonight, President Trump will leave the White House now in less than 24 hours. This presidency has been a historic on so many levels. One thing I can guarantee you, this will be studied about and written about for decades and likely hundreds and hundreds of years down the road. And the president signaling today is that this is perhaps just the beginning. We'll have more coming up. And predictably, the vitriol on the left has never been worse. Democrats, the mob, the media, they are just out for a pure vengeance, continuing their never-ending hatred. And as per usual, weak, spineless, pathetic establishment Republicans are all too happy to oblige, and now, a sham unconstitutional impeachment charade trial going to the U.S. Senate. Now, if Republicans allow this, they shouldn't. And in a moment, I'll have a special message for Mitch McConnell and any other Republican in the Senate considering what is in unconstitutional, post-presidential impeachment Schiff show that hurts the country. Let's start by stating the obvious. The Washington swamp, they don't like Donald Trump. Never have, never will. He's always been an outsider, a disruptor, an iconoclast, a businessman. And you know what? He doesn't apologize for fighting and fighting and fighting to keep his promises to we, the American people. As a matter of fact, I actually have right here -- the White House put it out today -- these are 1,000 Trump accomplishments in the last four years and, yeah, there is real stuff in here, real accomplishments. Now, they may not like his style, but he connects with the American people from every walk of life. He does it with his America first policies. You know, if you go back to 1964, Ronald Reagan gave a speech, a famous one, it's called \"The Time for Choosing\". Now, he asked the question rhetorically, is it a third party the Republican Party needs and he concluded, no, he said we need a revitalized second party with no bold -- with bold colors and no pale pastels. In other words, a Republican Party that doesn't make apologies, set the bar high, would fight to keep their word and their promises and not let themselves become a watered-down version of Democratic socialists. They would have bold color differences. Over the past four years, that is exactly everything that Donald Trump did. And earlier tonight, he reflected on some of his many historic achievements, 1,000, at least by the White House tonight. Take a look."

Now, soon to be Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of other long-serving establishment Republicans, they are trying to reassert control of the GOP. And their playbook, sadly, all too predictable. Instead of picking up the mantle and promoting the president's bold America first agenda, they are tonight cowering in fear, wilting under the pressure from the media mob, liberal Democrats, and big tech companies. Many spineless Republicans are joining forces with their Democratic friends to repudiate all things Trump. In other words, they want to cancel Trump. Mitch McConnell claiming that the Capitol Hill riot was provoked by the president. That's what the mob and the media, that's what Democrats have been saying. So, Mitch McConnell, I'm all ears. Tell the American people exactly what part of the president's speech that you thought was violent. Was it when he urged his followers to peacefully and patriotically march to the capitol so their voices could be heard? And did you know -- you like this snap impeachment process?

Did Senator Cory Booker, your colleague, incite violence when he urged his followers to get up in the face of Republican Congress people? You experience that in a diner. That shouldn't happen to any politician. Hillary Clinton, did she incite violence when she told a crowd you can't be civil with Republicans? Or Eric Holder, when they go low, we kick them? Yeah, all right. Did Nancy Pelosi -- what about her call for violence at the federal courthouse in Portland when she referred to federal law enforcement officers as Nazi stormtroopers who were kidnapping protesters? Where were you then, Mitch? Now, Senator McConnell would have more credibility with now his new eagerness to reestablish the Republican moderates and establishment wing of the party and repudiate President Trump if you were consistent. But ultimately, this is why Americans voted for Donald Trump and not 17 other establishment Republicans, although some were. The establishment Republicans have no backbone, no principle, no courage, no vision. Too many politicians in D.C. are just far too willing to go along, get along, and protect the swamp, and that is why conservatives like myself, well, we're tired of these empty promises and your rehearsed speeches and never getting anything done. America voted, and, by the way, you helped elect Donald Trump if you want to know the truth. The American people voted for a president that would deliver even if that meant at times hurting people's precious little feelings and your swamp, and that's what President Trump did. Slashed regulations, cut taxes, unleashed American energy, expanded fracking, opened ANWR, negotiated new trade deals, built 450 miles of new border wall and as promised, no new foreign wars and he believed peace through strength so he built up our military. Under the president, well, we lead on the world stage. Policy, peace through strength and he did all of this and all he could do a lot of times without the help of people like you and other Republicans in Congress like your Senate, you know, two years earlier voted for a straight repeal of Obamacare but then when it mattered, the same bill two years later when Donald Trump was president, you were nowhere to be found in your body. The president -- the president forcefully stood up to the bias and corruption plaguing every corner of America's powerful institutions. You know, Okay, Mitch, I'll give you an A+ on getting constitutionalist judges on the bench. You've been great on judges. But, frankly, it looks like it's time now, you're going to go along with all of this nonsense. We need new leadership in the U.S. Senate. You can represent the people of Kentucky. You're showing basically right now that you are the king of the establishment Republicans that frankly have always had and remain having contempt for President Trump but more importantly, the 75 million Americans that voted for him. Americans want somebody that will fight for their values and principles, not skiing behind closed doors with your buddy Chucky Schumer. Every Republican in the Senate, let me be even more clear. Not one Republican senator should be wasting a second of precious time. You're off half the year anyway on this post-presidential impeachment charade. Every Republican senator needs to walk out of what would be in impeachment Schiff show, probably Romney, Sasse, and Murkowski will stay, and when it's over, Republican should walk back in and acquit the president of the United States or former president at the time, and stop the unconstitutional Schiff show. And, Mitch, if the choice, to be frank with you, is weak establishment Republicanism versus America first, I choose the latter. If I venture to guess the overwhelming majority of Republicans would agree with me. It's why I'm not a Republican. I'm a registered conservative. Your fellow Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is absolutely right when he stated that if the Senate but you supposedly lead, Republicans go along with this snap impeachment nonsense, it will be the end of the Republican Party. It's unconstitutional, it's beyond divisive, it's a political ploy by Democrats to seek revenge on President Trump, and, of course, humiliate the 75 million people who voted for him, 93 percent according to a recent poll would vote for him again today. This is also an attempt to banish President Trump from ever running again. Hey, Mitch, that decision should not be yours. That needs to be left with we, the American people, not Republican senators. Now more than ever, we need elected officials to stand up we, the people. The rhetoric from the left downright chilling. It's gotten progressively worse over the last five years with Donald Trump now powerful institutions in D.C. That would include the Democrats, the media mob, big tech, all moving to silence and cancel any opinions they don't like. And as you all know, President Trump has been banned permanently from nearly every social media platform, so to have many of his supporters, American citizens. For days, our friends of Parler who were competitors of Twitter were kicked off the Internet altogether, thanks to an alliance of big tech companies. And meanwhile, the incoming President Joe Biden is actually comparing Senator Cruz and Josh Hawley and propagandist Joseph Goebbels because they supported a legal audit of election results. Oh, something Democrats in 2000, 2001, 2016 and ‘17 and 2004 and ‘05 also called for. Other top Democrats want them to be treated like domestic terrorists put on the no- fly list when they were expressing an opinion and looking for a legal audit. That's all. Students at Harvard now calling for the school to revoke any degree from anyone associated with President Trump. Have you or have you ever been a President Trump supporter? \"The Forbes\" magazine writes that if you worked in the Trump administration, we're going to take note. You better not be hired. What? Is that the America we live in? Now going after the president, going after his daughter, son-in-law, his other son who can even buy a house without being persecuted and live in a neighborhood when they pay -- that's America? A truly insane column in The Washington Post today all but accusing people like me on this network of sedition, wanting us to be silenced, ripped off the air. And that's not all, former PBS lawyer -- thought it was probably an outlier, I was wrong, caught on tape, going to empower the government to take us away from their parents and have them go to reeducation camps and watch PBS all day. Many other outlets in the mob openly searching ways to deprogram Trump supporters. You can't make this up. Take a look."

Because our children and our grandchildren deserve better. And, Mitch McConnell, if you're not going to fight, we deserve better. You can go back to representing the people of Kentucky and let somebody that knows how to lead the lead. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Dan Bongino, the host of \"Justice\", Judge Jeanine Pirro. Judge, we'll start with you tonight. Your reaction? JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, HOST, \"JUSTICE\": Well, first of all, I think that your monologue was terrific and what we are seeing with Mitch McConnell right now is he's going to be the minority leader, we saw him is the ring of Chuck Schumer and basically trashed President Trump on his last day in office which to me makes him ineligible as far as I'm concerned as someone who wants to sit on a jury for an impeachment trial. But then, again, I think any impeachment of someone who's not in office is unconstitutional, given the fact that they can't then remove him from office because he is already out of office. But having said that, living out the tipping point right now, where the left is so hateful and so vengeful, and I wrote a book about this, \"Radicals, Resistance and Revenge\", that they are determined to cancel not just the president of the United States who has done more good than you just outlined, but they want to cancel anyone who's a conservative. They want to cancel conservative thought. They want us to lose our jobs. They want us to be arrested. They want us -- you know, people in our faces. This has to stop, Sean. This is America. And Joe Biden is not the guy who's going to stop it for sure. And McConnell seems like, you know what, he's already on the side of the left, and I'm as disgusted with him as you are."

Listen, Mitch McConnell, right, you did a decent job on the judges. Great. Congrats. That's what we hired you to do. You had one job. What does he want? An award. Listen, on my own podcast, I said, hey, nice job, great, that's what you're getting paid what, $200,000 a year to vote for conservative judges while pretending to be a conservative? Congrats, nice job. But if Mitch McConnell wanted to put together a recipe and a cookbook on how to destroy the Republican Party, this is exactly how you do it, by falling right into the trap of falling for media narratives. Now, I want to make a point because it's important, I'm hearing a lot of chatter about we need a third party. Folks, forget it, that's not the solution. It's a strategic disaster. We don't have a parliamentary system and we have winner-take-all congressional districts, it's not going to happen.

In other words, the Russian collusion truthers. Now contained in tonight's documents is more proof that in fact it was Christopher Steele that leaked the Russia collusion story to help Hillary Clinton, telling the FBI, quote, Steele explained that as the election season went on, they as a company were riding two horses, their client and the FBI. And after the FBI Director Comey's reopening of the Hillary Clinton investigation, they had to pick one horse and chose the business client relationship over the relationship with the FBI. Wow, that's pretty deep. And why aren't we trying to extradite Christopher Steele to the U.S. and wasting time on a guy in the media named Julian Assange. Joining us now with the latest, justthenews.com founder, John Solomon, investigative reporter, chief editor. Okay, this is big."

      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it is, Sean. I've been through all the documents at least one time now and I'll give you some of the highlights from the early stuff. The most important of all the documents is what I call the September 2017 confessional, a year after he was fired terminated by the FBI, Christopher Steele sat back down by the agents and he described his motives, his tactics, what he did. And there are some bombshell revelations. First off, as you just reported, his motive for going to the news media and creating the false Russia collusion narrative during the 2016 election was because the email scandal had come and reared its head again against Hillary Clinton, he was concerned it was going to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances so he put the Russia story out there to help kind of distract from her -- from her scandal. Secondly, he admits that another one of his motives was that he considered Donald Trump to be his main opponent. He considered Donald Trump to be bad for Great Britain, for the U.S.-U.K. relationship. So that's another reason he leaked. Now, let's think about that. He's a foreigner interfering in our election by leaking information to help Hillary Clinton and to help Great Britain. That's what he admitted to in this interview with the FBI. Third, he divulges where he got his sub-source, the famous sub-source; the primary sub-sources the FBI called them. This is the person that gave him most of the bad garbage that was ultimately discredited by the FBI, proven disproven. He got that a relationship with that sub-source from none other than Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council for Donald Trump, who became an impeachment witness against Trump in 2019. Why is that significant? Well, beyond the interesting connections, by the time, Fiona Hill turned over this sub-source to Christopher Steele, the FBI was already investigating the sub-source as a possible Russian asset. In fact, they were trying to get a FISA warrant on him when he fled the country and they dropped the effort. So, Fiona Hill, someone who worked for the Trump NSC gave Christopher Steele a bad source that the FBI ultimately feared was a Russian asset."

      "utterance": "Yeah, I think he's fast at work trying to build the final parts of a criminal case that's what my source reporting and indicates and talking to defense lawyers and other people it looks like he is still going forward to build a significant criminal case. Now let me tell you about something we're going to have in the morning, it's going to take some time to develop it overnight. But I think people will be surprised by this revelation. In 2014, the FBI determined that a foreign power was trying to influence Hillary Clinton and her campaign when she ran. In fact, they feared that they were going to do it through the delivery of money. The FBI tried for several months to get a FISA warrant, but they -- according to these documents -- they were turned down or held up by the seventh floor. James Comey and Andrew McCabe is the seventh floor. They ultimately decided not to investigate it any further and unlike what they did to Donald Trump, they went to Hillary Clinton and gave her a defensive briefing and told her what this foreign power was trying to do. They did it through her attorney David Kendall. It shows the entirely different system of justice. Hillary Clinton gets a defensive briefing, no FISA. Donald Trump gets a FISA, no defensive briefing, and three and a half years of pain and suffering to his presidency and campaign. These documents are extraordinary. They were kept from the American public and the Congress as President Trump said today when he declassified the documents. And this is the tip of the iceberg. We're going to have more with John tomorrow night. John, thank you. That is unbelievable, unreal. All right. Now, tonight, there are GOP senators standing up to the madness that's being promoted by Chucky Schumer, the mob, and apparently Mitch McConnell, about what would be an unconstitutional, post-presidency impeachment, because one thing's for sure, Republicans go along with another one of the Democrats Schiff shows on the capital. It would I think destroy the GOP for good. Here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator, Rand Paul said it, you've been warning people, and then you heard Mitch McConnell today."

So that's a good reason not to impeach the president. Another good reason, I think it's unconstitutional to impeach a person who's out of office. That will create never-ending revenge against presidents, particularly former presidents. And as to the Republican Party, if we throw in the towel or perceived to having thrown in the towel and not fighting against this impeachment, the Republican Party as Rand Paul said will crack up. Ninety percent of Republicans at least believe a second impeachment of President Trump is unconstitutional, unfair and should not go forward. So I'm asking Republican leaders in the Senate to lead. I like Mitch McConnell. He did more than confirm judges. He really helped President Trump with everything that he did. He's a street fighter legislatively. He's a smart guy. But what we need right now is for Senator McConnell to unequivocally say that the second impeachment of Donald Trump after he leaves office is not only unconstitutional, it is bad for the country, and stand up and fight back."

That to me is just something we don't want to legitimize in the Senate. In terms of the Senate's role in all this, we have a chance here for the future of the country to say that there's an end to all of this. Once the person leaves office, we're not going to pursue them. We're not going to have a scarlet letter impeachment to bar them for running for office. The Democrats have one goal here and that is to deny President Trump the ability to ever run for office again. That should not be the Republican Party's goal. The Republican Party's goal should be to stand up to unconstitutional impeachments and realize that President Trump did a lot of good for the conservative movement. You can be disappointed with the president's behavior but applaud his actions, and the people who defiled the capital, they did that. Not me, not Donald Trump, and that does not represent the 74 million people who stood behind President Trump and would vote for him again today. So, to my Republican colleagues in the Senate, we have to rise to the occasion. If we don't, we're going to destroy the party."

Five years and for people like Stephen Colbert who was in a distant third place in late night to mock the first lady in the way that he did with such hate to the governor's point, well, guess what, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Colbert is going to actually have to find a way to be a comedian again because he's turned his show basically into an extension of CNN or MSNBC and serving at the pleasure of the Democratic Party. Now, suddenly, with President Trump gone, so does the gravy train for him go and as a result, you're going to see Stephen Colbert become irrelevant in an awful hurry. Look, Melania Trump was mocked by the Jimmy Kimmels of the world, you remember, Sean, for having an accent. She's an immigrant. So, now, it's okay to mock immigrants for their accent? She speaks five languages which is four more than Kimmel speaks. So I found that pretty interesting. She also once had a kidney procedure and you had conspiracy theorists posing as media reporters on CNN openly wondering where is Melania Trump after she literally had a procedure on her kidney and she was recovering from something like that. So this first lady has been treated worse than any first lady in modern history by a country mile. And as far as Elise Stefanik, she's 36 years old. At last check in New York, it's not really that big of a deal or really that much of a newsworthy item that if you don't have kids in your mid-30s while you're pursuing a career like she is I know in my case and with my wife, I didn't -- I wasn't until I was in my early 40s until we had our first child obviously. My wife, much younger, looking much younger as well, can attest to that. So this whole thing, as far as Elise Stefanik is concerned, if there wasn't an \"R\" next to her name, this isn't a story. But she's mocked as childless at 36 in New York, I'm sorry. This is why 86 percent of the American people believe that the media is biased because they see this crap and that's what it is, absolute crap, Sean."

      "utterance": "All right, that's all the time we have this evening. We hope you will join us every night. Set your DVR, simple to do I think. You never miss an episode of \"Hannity.\" Don't ask for technical advice from me. We will always be fiercely independent. We will always stand up for the values of, yeah, America first, lower taxes, less bureaucracy, energy independence, border security. We will stand up for constitutional judges, we'll stand up for better, freer trade deals, peace through strength. But with that, let not your heart be troubled, Laura Ingraham's last show with Donald J. Trump as president starts right now. Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
