      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY. And we begin tonight with a FOX News alert. We're going to take you live to the ground on -- in the ground in Ukraine, where military activity is now ongoing at this very hour. Earlier, a new barrage of indiscriminate Russian bombing completely leveling a local theater in southern Ukraine where hundreds of innocent civilians were sheltering in place, by the way, including many young children. In fact, as you can see there on your screen, the word children was painted on the ground in Russian on either side of the theater. But Russia blew it up anyway, and now, an untold number of innocent kids are dead tonight. Now, many major cities in southern Ukraine are being besieged. There are fears that Kyiv could be next. And today, during his virtual address to Congress, the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy played this very powerful video showing the true horrors of Vladimir Putin's bloody invasion and war. These images show a normal happy country and the aftermath of Vladimir Putin's murdering invasion. Viewer warning: what you're about to see is extremely graphic. For many of you, it will be hard to watch but necessary. You decide.",

The bloodshed is far from over and during his remarks, President Zelenskyy, he urged Americans to remember Pearl Harbor, September 11, 2001, when our country was under attack. Sadly, his country is experiencing their own horror now every single day. He also invoked Martin Luther King Jr. and Zelenskyy said his dream is to protect Ukrainian skies. And now, President Zelenskyy is begging Joe Biden for help. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Many Americans tonight are asking this question what should America's role be when you see horror of mass graves and dead children and women in the streets? What is America's role in this? Let me be clear what it shouldn't be: a no-fly zone over Ukraine, that's not America's role. That can't happen. That would likely put American fighters in a direct fighting position and in war with Russia. We cannot be the world's police force. U.S. boots on the ground, that can't happen either. It hasn't worked out well in the past. This would involve the United States engaging then with Russia in a war, and that could very likely signal the real beginning of World War III, with nuclear proliferation just a button away. But America, we have a conscience and a soul, and we care about innocent men women and children there are many ways that we can help. I go back to Ronald Reagan. He provided, for example, the mujahidin in Afghanistan, the Stinger missiles. Well, that helped Afghanistan defeat the former Soviet Union in the 1980s. Reagan made that happen. Reagan also provided weaponry to the freedom fighters, the Contra rebels in Nicaragua to battle Danielle Ortega and the Sandinistas. He was successful there. Reagan never put a single American boot on the ground. These weapons help these freedom fighters defeat bad actors. We should learn the lessons from Reagan. Give Zelenskyy what he's asking for, the weapons that they need so they can battle back against Russia. The Ukrainian people, frankly, they've shown incredible courage and effectiveness so far against Russia. They are showing their willingness to do their own fighting. They're just asking for the tools of war. The late great Charles Krauthammer once wrote: Enter the Reagan doctrine, which relies on indigenous revolutionaries to challenge (for reasons that parallel but need not coincide with ours) the Soviet empire and its periphery. But this strategy effectively countered the Soviet communists, like I said in places like Central America, again without putting an American boot on the ground and not risking a single American life. This is similar to what President Trump did in 2017 with great success in Iraq. This is after Joe Biden and Barack Obama let this ISIS caliphate build out, without a large group presence. Donald Trump utterly destroyed the ISIS caliphate using modern weaponry and technology to do it, pushing buttons in Tampa, Florida, and with pinpoint precision, taking out one target after another. And two years later, President Trump utilized a similar strategy he took out Iran's top terrorist Soleimani with a drone strike in Baghdad right there on the tarmac of an airport, again without putting a single boot on the ground. Trump projected peace through strength. This is peace through strength. Look, I am a registered conservative. I like to say when people ask me, the media mob like, so how do you describe your political philosophy? Well, I'm a Reagan conservative, I'm Make America Great Again conservative, a save America conservative, and American First conservative. Now, the Reagan doctrine worked. The Trump doctrine worked. We need to remember these important lessons from both Trump and Reagan and apply them to any future conflict where American interests and the cause of freedom are at stake. And now in Ukraine, without the possibility of American air power or boots on the ground it is critical that the U.S. take a moral stand in Europe especially, give Ukraine the ability to protect their own skies and that would include sending dozens of MiG-29 fighters that were offered from Poland. But unfortunately, our weak and frail and cognitively struggling President Joe Biden single-handedly nixed that plan and today he refused to answer any questions about the decision to block these critical planes from being put to good use by Ukrainian pilots. Take a look.",

Anyway, we need to be brutally honest here. I don't trust Biden. I don't trust Kamala Harris and I don't trust Nancy Pelosi. They are all pathetically weak in terms of the leadership. The top three people, there's your chain of command, and they are enthusiastically cheering on Zelenskyy, that's fine, while denying him the planes that Poland was willing to give him. American politicians generally, we learned this through COVID, we've learned it in past wars, they're not to be trusted. I don't trust most of those swamp creatures in Washington. The last 60 years has taught the United States a lot. Politicians, they're all gung-ho. They start their wars. They send our national treasure, our kids, to go fight these wars. They don't fight to win these wars. They politicize them some point thereafter, and then say, oops, never mind. It's hurting my poll numbers and they do that after how many American kids fought, bled and died. How many come home, severely wounded -- I mean, debilitating injuries. Never again, we can never trust them again. But we can stand on our principles. The leading one being freedom. Now, meanwhile, Europe -- Europe, I have a message for you tonight. You've got to step up to the plate. This war is in your backyard, not our backyard. It's time for you to pay your fair share and your full dues to NATO. It's time for you to get these important weapons and supplies to Ukraine and get them there one way or another and stop asking Joe Biden for permission. But here's where things get really strange and very concerning back here at home: the Biden administration is actually forging ahead with their idiotic Iranian nuclear deal which is still according to reports being brokered -- this is unconscionable -- by Russia and China. And according to \"The Washington Free Beacon,\" this deal could include a plan that would let Russia cash in on a $10 billion contract to build a nuclear site in Iran. Now, if you think the world can't get any nuttier, there you go, it just got nuttier. But it gets worse. \"Axios\" tonight reporting that the Biden administration is also weighing a deal to remove terrorists from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard, that's their top-tier terror list, so long as they promise to be good little terrorists in the neighborhoods in the Middle East. Are you going to trust them? They're vile, murdering terrorists responsible even for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq. And remember, by the way, this is a week after Iran nearly blew up our own consulate in Iraq with a ballistic missile, not a peep out of Joe or Kamala Harris. If these reports are true, Joe Biden is truly the Neville chamberlain of our time. And, of course, China, they're watching all of this. They plot -- they plot their violent what they call reunification of Taiwan, really a takeover of Taiwan. Recently, they vowed to impose the worst consequences maybe even nuclear weapons on any country that might help Taiwan militarily, which by the way we already do. And a few days ago, my next guest traveled to Taiwan, a country that is now preparing rightly so for the worst and here with more is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, good to see you. First, let me get your reaction to President Zelenskyy today, and I like the Reagan model and I like the Trump model. Am I wrong in my analysis? Do you have a better idea?",

They were -- they were -- speak pretty softly, but when it was time to swing into action, you did it with full force. You weren't late. You weren't behind, you weren't slow. You were protecting America's interest everywhere you went. In your -- in your opening, you talked about the moral imperative to do this. I think President Zelenskyy talked about that eloquently today. But there's an important American set of interests here as well that we need not forget, right? The American economy is going to be impacted by this. Fertilizer, food, oil and gas all going to be more expensive because the Biden administration put climate change ahead of protecting sovereignty and freedom in this place. I think you have it right. We should be providing all the tools that the Ukrainian people need to defend themselves. We have them. The Europeans have them. They can do an awful lot more too. But instead, President Biden has been behind. He's allowed Vladimir Putin to dictate the pace and the response. He's allowed -- he's allowed Vladimir Putin to dominate how we think about the structure of what's taking place here. And we can do better than this. Americans deserve it. The Ukrainian people deserve it as well. And I think President Zelenskyy spoke to that very, very nicely today.",

I -- it's hard to also explain, Sean, why we're second-guessing what Zelenskyy says he needs to defend himself. He has demonstrated his military leaders have demonstrated their capability to defend against a Russian military that we thought was really capable. If they're asking for certain tools, we ought to do our best to give them to them, and we shouldn't wait, we are months behind. I know this war's nominally only been going on for a handful of weeks. But we've known for months that this was in the offing and we should have been stacking these weapons, Javelins, missiles, Stingers, all the things that the Ukrainians need to defend themselves for months and months and months.

I guess Joe wants to import oil from Iran and I guess Joe might be okay with Vladimir Putin building a nuclear facility for the Iranians. And I guess Joe wants to import oil from Venezuela and Iran.

They're thinking that being stuck in the middle without an American set of leaders that are prepared to assist you when a superpower, a big nation comes to attack you. They're very concerned. It puts them on edge. I think Xi Jinping has watched this too and while I've seen the Biden administration applauding and saying, boy, we have European unity, that unity came only after an enormous amount of destruction inside of Ukraine that continues to this day. I think Taiwan is certainly watching that. I'm confident that the Xi Jinping's not only watching what's going on in Ukraine today, but he's watching us sit at a table in Vienna. While the Russians are killing innocent women and children, we're sitting on the same side of the negotiating table with the Russians about to hand Iran a clear pathway to getting Russian weapons systems. It sounds like we've let the Russians purchase -- or excuse me -- sell equipment to the Iranians as part of this deal as well. I mean, Sean, this is -- this is unexplainable. It is -- it is a level of appeasement that we haven't seen in the United States in an awfully long time. And it is dangerous not only for the Taiwanese, not only for the Ukrainians, but it's dangerous for the United States of America to watch bad guys roll the West. And when you watch the communist Chinese fly their fighter jets over Taiwan air space to the degree that they have, and they talk about reunification to the extent that they have, it seems pretty clear to me that they're they have their own territorial ambitions and they're probably soon going to follow through on them.

Whether you're wrong or not will depend an awful lot on how the United States responds, how the Japanese, the Australians, the South Koreans respond. If we do this well, I promise you, the Taiwanese people are very capable and they're prepared to fight the same way you've seen the Ukrainians fight. They can change the calculus for Xi Jinping. They can make this cost extraordinary for him. But we can't wait. We can't wait until he's got ships at the -- ships at sea and airplanes in the air and a blockade established to say, oh goodness, now we're going to gather it -- gather it someplace and decide what we're going to do. We should be preparing the Taiwanese with all the tools they tell us they need and make sure that Xi Jinping understands that we are serious. When he -- when he raises the specter, as he did just this past week when the Chinese talk about the big price that the United States will pay for sending equipment to Taiwan, he's talking about the use of nuclear weapons, too. We cannot allow tyrants to threaten nuclear weapons to engage in coercive behavior. It didn't happen for four years in our administration. We shouldn't let it happen now.",

We take you live to the ground in Ukraine where our own Greg Palkot is joining us with more. Greg, my understanding is that in fact there's been a little bit of a shift in strategy by Russia. They're using more air power rather than going in on the ground and they still are surrounding Kyiv but to a lesser extent, because of the fire power that's coming in from missiles and et cetera. Yeah, I mean basically, Sean, you've got Russia pounding away at various cities and we just had a really new expansion of offensive activity tonight. Not far from us on the Belarus-Ukraine border, a town was hit by shells coming from Belarus so this western area of Ukraine. It's picking up as well. A lot of attention though is being placed on Kyiv. That's the capital. That's the big enchilada that Russia is going for. It was blasted again. One shelling happened just a mile and a half from the residence of President Zelenskyy, another 12-story building was destroyed. Yes, as you say, the bulk of the Russian forces remains still outside, eight or nine miles outside, but they are being dispersed, getting ready for the big kill. In the port city of Mariupol, a huge theater was -- it was being used as a shelter for civilians was destroyed, including a lot of children. No word on casualties there yet. A hospital was commandeered as a Russian shooting position and aid convoys once again could not get in. And in the city of Chernihiv, 10 people were killed while they were waiting on the breadline when a bomb dropped on them. All this causing President Zelenskyy -- as you've been noting -- to speak to Congress today via a video link. His words: We need you now and also announced today President Biden more additional military aid to the tune of about million dollars. Finally, finally, Sean, the update from the talks going on between officials from Ukraine and Russia, they were described today as serious and realistic, as some very unrealistic horror continues here across this nation.

They're worried about the casualties there, so they'll sit outside the city, they'll cut off all the means of communication, all the means of transportation, they'll pound the place and they won't care about whether they'll hit civilian targets or not and they'll basically try to starve the city out.

Now this ruling came out from the appeals court today after a Cook County judge sentenced last week to immediately begin serving 150 days in jail for his conviction on five felony counts of disorderly conduct for lying to police. Now, the Appeals Court said today Smollett can be released after he posted a personal recognizant bond of $150,000. Smollett's attorneys had argued that he would have finished his sentence by the time his appeal process was completed and that Smollett could be in danger of physical harm if he had stayed locked up in Cook County jail.

Today, President Zelenskyy said, can you please help me get planes? Can you please help me get surface-to-air missiles? I'm not asking for American planes or pilots or troops.

It turns out he's having a full-blown heart attack with me in the tent. Then, shortly after that, the train conductor rushes towards me desperately seeking help for a woman who collapsed on the train. So I rush over to her, her along with many others are suffering from dehydration. They're fatigued. They're weak. They're cold. They're injured. And then, Sean, to add fuel to the fire, the sirens go off, the alarms go off. We have to seek shelter and go underground because of potential, you know, strikes and it -- you know, the cruelty, the inhumanity, it's appalling, and it's the brutality and the incoming refugees, it's not slowing down it's not stopping, it's getting more intense day by day.",

Ukraine officials say Russian troops destroyed a theater where hundreds of residents were sheltering and by the way, they had children are in here written in Russian and they still attacked it. That's evil. It's plain and simple. This is a complete disregard for human life, human dignity, international order. They are war crimes, not that it matters to Putin. But like I've been saying, there needs to be a new rule for the international community. If you're a leader, you invade a sovereign country, you kill innocent civilians and women and children, you forfeit your right to lead any country and you should forfeit your own life and be taken out by whatever means and necessary because when you cut off the head of a snake, the snake dies.

And remember, we got this far, the Ukrainians did and the West with not very many supplies when we had the big controversy about the Trump initial shipment of Javelins. It was only 150 Javelins. So we haven't really geared up yet, I think now, we're gearing up and these weapons are pouring in. I don't know why we don't take Ukrainians out of the country 90 or a hundred of them and train them to do say Patriot anti-missile batteries, and we could train them on that sophisticated weapon that has a lot of capability that SAMs don't. So I think that we can train them to use even more and more sophisticated weapons and ramp the pressure up and I think what's going to happen now is that Putin is going to get wilder and wilder and given more and more threats.

We don't have those in our inventory. In fact, we did away with it in the `60s. We had a data system called the Davy Crockett and they do a demonstration. What that means is you shoot it into the water or shoot it into a big field and there are some kiloton weapons but it makes it a demonstration that is using a nuclear weapon. I hope he's not that stupid or crazy to do it, because to me, a nuclear weapon's a nuclear weapon. But that's going to be the sign of absolute desperation. And the best thing I'm hoping is that we get an interlocutor out there, somebody who can talk him off the wall right now. Biden can't do it because there's no communications between Biden and Putin. But somebody needs to talk to Putin and get him off where he's going because right now, he's in the process of losing a war and when you start losing a war, you do go to extremes.

We made a mistake, Sean, by when they raised their nuclear level, special combat readiness we should have responded in kind by raising our nuclear readiness. We're normally -- what's called defense condition, we're normally at a four. It's one through five, one's the highest you can go. But we raised it to three during 9/11. And everybody took notice. We went it to two during the Cuban missile crisis, just raise it and say, look, you need to understand, you know -- President Trump told Kim Jong-un which was when he said it was pretty funny when Kim Jong-un says, I have a red button, remember President Trump said back to him, well, I've got a red button it's bigger than yours and mine works.

And you know we've had kind of a missile spree, Sean. It's not just in Ukraine. After Afghanistan and this administration, North Korea led off more missiles in January than it has in its entire history, and then we had Iran jump in and send missiles pretty close to a consulate and then we had Putin send missiles near the Polish border. And remember, I think it was in October, the Chinese sent a hypersonic missile. So, all of these players have been watching Afghanistan and this administration, and they're thinking, you know what, there's no consequences and this is a rare moment to get real strategic advantage over the United States and in its allies. I really -- I think we -- looking back, it was really terrible when the Obama administration gave up missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland. If we have those batteries right now, even though they were ostensibly aimed at maybe an Iranian rogue missile, we would have a level of deterrence, if we hadn't cut back on missile defense in 2009 to 2016. So, we're going to have to rethink things. Pump in -- pump more gas and oil really concentrate on continental and forward missile defense, and start arming people before when you have the -- just the faintest scent that Putin's on the move, start arming them in mass and we haven't done it.

In fact, as you can see there on your screen, the word children was painted on the ground in Russian on either side of the theater. But Russia blew it up anyway, and now, an untold number of innocent kids are dead tonight. Now, many major cities in southern Ukraine are being besieged. There are fears that Kyiv could be next. And today, during his virtual address to Congress, the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy played this very powerful video showing the true horrors of Vladimir Putin's bloody invasion and war.

Reagan also provided weaponry to the freedom fighters, the Contra rebels in Nicaragua to battle Danielle Ortega and the Sandinistas. He was successful there. Reagan never put a single American boot on the ground. These weapons help these freedom fighters defeat bad actors. We should learn the lessons from Reagan. Give Zelenskyy what he's asking for, the weapons that they need so they can battle back against Russia. The Ukrainian people, frankly, they've shown incredible courage and effectiveness so far against Russia. They are showing their willingness to do their own fighting. They're just asking for the tools of war."

But this strategy effectively countered the Soviet communists, like I said in places like Central America, again without putting an American boot on the ground and not risking a single American life. This is similar to what President Trump did in 2017 with great success in Iraq. This is after Joe Biden and Barack Obama let this ISIS caliphate build out, without a large group presence. Donald Trump utterly destroyed the ISIS caliphate using modern weaponry and technology to do it, pushing buttons in Tampa, Florida, and with pinpoint precision, taking out one target after another. And two years later, President Trump utilized a similar strategy he took out Iran's top terrorist Soleimani with a drone strike in Baghdad right there on the tarmac of an airport, again without putting a single boot on the ground. Trump projected peace through strength. This is peace through strength. Look, I am a registered conservative. I like to say when people ask me, the media mob like, so how do you describe your political philosophy? Well, I'm a Reagan conservative, I'm Make America Great Again conservative, a save America conservative, and American First conservative. Now, the Reagan doctrine worked. The Trump doctrine worked. We need to remember these important lessons from both Trump and Reagan and apply them to any future conflict where American interests and the cause of freedom are at stake. And now in Ukraine, without the possibility of American air power or boots on the ground it is critical that the U.S. take a moral stand in Europe especially, give Ukraine the ability to protect their own skies and that would include sending dozens of MiG-29 fighters that were offered from Poland. But unfortunately, our weak and frail and cognitively struggling President Joe Biden single-handedly nixed that plan and today he refused to answer any questions about the decision to block these critical planes from being put to good use by Ukrainian pilots. Take a look."

The last 60 years has taught the United States a lot. Politicians, they're all gung-ho. They start their wars. They send our national treasure, our kids, to go fight these wars. They don't fight to win these wars. They politicize them some point thereafter, and then say, oops, never mind.

And according to \"The Washington Free Beacon,\" this deal could include a plan that would let Russia cash in on a $10 billion contract to build a nuclear site in Iran. Now, if you think the world can't get any nuttier, there you go, it just got nuttier. But it gets worse. \"Axios\" tonight reporting that the Biden administration is also weighing a deal to remove terrorists from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard, that's their top-tier terror list, so long as they promise to be good little terrorists in the neighborhoods in the Middle East. Are you going to trust them? They're vile, murdering terrorists responsible even for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq. And remember, by the way, this is a week after Iran nearly blew up our own consulate in Iraq with a ballistic missile, not a peep out of Joe or Kamala Harris. If these reports are true, Joe Biden is truly the Neville chamberlain of our time. And, of course, China, they're watching all of this. They plot -- they plot their violent what they call reunification of Taiwan, really a takeover of Taiwan. Recently, they vowed to impose the worst consequences maybe even nuclear weapons on any country that might help Taiwan militarily, which by the way we already do. And a few days ago, my next guest traveled to Taiwan, a country that is now preparing rightly so for the worst and here with more is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, good to see you. First, let me get your reaction to President Zelenskyy today, and I like the Reagan model and I like the Trump model. Am I wrong in my analysis?

They were -- they were -- speak pretty softly, but when it was time to swing into action, you did it with full force. You weren't late. You weren't behind, you weren't slow. You were protecting America's interest everywhere you went. In your -- in your opening, you talked about the moral imperative to do this. I think President Zelenskyy talked about that eloquently today. But there's an important American set of interests here as well that we need not forget, right? The American economy is going to be impacted by this. Fertilizer, food, oil and gas all going to be more expensive because the Biden administration put climate change ahead of protecting sovereignty and freedom in this place. I think you have it right. We should be providing all the tools that the Ukrainian people need to defend themselves. We have them. The Europeans have them. They can do an awful lot more too. But instead, President Biden has been behind. He's allowed Vladimir Putin to dictate the pace and the response. He's allowed -- he's allowed Vladimir Putin to dominate how we think about the structure of what's taking place here. And we can do better than this. Americans deserve it. The Ukrainian people deserve it as well. And I think President Zelenskyy spoke to that very, very nicely today."

I -- it's hard to also explain, Sean, why we're second-guessing what Zelenskyy says he needs to defend himself. He has demonstrated his military leaders have demonstrated their capability to defend against a Russian military that we thought was really capable. If they're asking for certain tools, we ought to do our best to give them to them, and we shouldn't wait, we are months behind. I know this war's nominally only been going on for a handful of weeks. But we've known for months that this was in the offing and we should have been stacking these weapons, Javelins, missiles, Stingers, all the things that the Ukrainians need to defend themselves for months and months and months.

I guess Joe wants to import oil from Iran and I guess Joe might be okay with Vladimir Putin building a nuclear facility for the Iranians. And I guess Joe wants to import oil from Venezuela and Iran.

They're thinking that being stuck in the middle without an American set of leaders that are prepared to assist you when a superpower, a big nation comes to attack you. They're very concerned. It puts them on edge. I think Xi Jinping has watched this too and while I've seen the Biden administration applauding and saying, boy, we have European unity, that unity came only after an enormous amount of destruction inside of Ukraine that continues to this day. I think Taiwan is certainly watching that. I'm confident that the Xi Jinping's not only watching what's going on in Ukraine today, but he's watching us sit at a table in Vienna. While the Russians are killing innocent women and children, we're sitting on the same side of the negotiating table with the Russians about to hand Iran a clear pathway to getting Russian weapons systems. It sounds like we've let the Russians purchase -- or excuse me -- sell equipment to the Iranians as part of this deal as well. I mean, Sean, this is -- this is unexplainable. It is -- it is a level of appeasement that we haven't seen in the United States in an awfully long time. And it is dangerous not only for the Taiwanese, not only for the Ukrainians, but it's dangerous for the United States of America to watch bad guys roll the West. And when you watch the communist Chinese fly their fighter jets over Taiwan air space to the degree that they have, and they talk about reunification to the extent that they have, it seems pretty clear to me that they're they have their own territorial ambitions and they're probably soon going to follow through on them.

If we do this well, I promise you, the Taiwanese people are very capable and they're prepared to fight the same way you've seen the Ukrainians fight. They can change the calculus for Xi Jinping. They can make this cost extraordinary for him. But we can't wait. We can't wait until he's got ships at the -- ships at sea and airplanes in the air and a blockade established to say, oh goodness, now we're going to gather it -- gather it someplace and decide what we're going to do. We should be preparing the Taiwanese with all the tools they tell us they need and make sure that Xi Jinping understands that we are serious. When he -- when he raises the specter, as he did just this past week when the Chinese talk about the big price that the United States will pay for sending equipment to Taiwan, he's talking about the use of nuclear weapons, too. We cannot allow tyrants to threaten nuclear weapons to engage in coercive behavior. It didn't happen for four years in our administration. We shouldn't let it happen now."

We take you live to the ground in Ukraine where our own Greg Palkot is joining us with more. Greg, my understanding is that in fact there's been a little bit of a shift in strategy by Russia. They're using more air power rather than going in on the ground and they still are surrounding Kyiv but to a lesser extent, because of the fire power that's coming in from missiles and et cetera. Yeah, I mean basically, Sean, you've got Russia pounding away at various cities and we just had a really new expansion of offensive activity tonight. Not far from us on the Belarus-Ukraine border, a town was hit by shells coming from Belarus so this western area of Ukraine. It's picking up as well. A lot of attention though is being placed on Kyiv. That's the capital. That's the big enchilada that Russia is going for. It was blasted again. One shelling happened just a mile and a half from the residence of President Zelenskyy, another 12-story building was destroyed. Yes, as you say, the bulk of the Russian forces remains still outside, eight or nine miles outside, but they are being dispersed, getting ready for the big kill. In the port city of Mariupol, a huge theater was -- it was being used as a shelter for civilians was destroyed, including a lot of children. No word on casualties there yet. A hospital was commandeered as a Russian shooting position and aid convoys once again could not get in. And in the city of Chernihiv, 10 people were killed while they were waiting on the breadline when a bomb dropped on them. All this causing President Zelenskyy -- as you've been noting -- to speak to Congress today via a video link. His words: We need you now and also announced today President Biden more additional military aid to the tune of about million dollars. Finally, finally, Sean, the update from the talks going on between officials from Ukraine and Russia, they were described today as serious and realistic, as some very unrealistic horror continues here across this nation.

They don't seem -- they seem to be worried about getting into street fights with the very savvy, very, very handy and very turning out to be very skilled Ukrainian soldiers. They're worried about the casualties there, so they'll sit outside the city, they'll cut off all the means of communication, all the means of transportation, they'll pound the place and they won't care about whether they'll hit civilian targets or not and they'll basically try to starve the city out.

Now this ruling came out from the appeals court today after a Cook County judge sentenced last week to immediately begin serving 150 days in jail for his conviction on five felony counts of disorderly conduct for lying to police. Now, the Appeals Court said today Smollett can be released after he posted a personal recognizant bond of $150,000. Smollett's attorneys had argued that he would have finished his sentence by the time his appeal process was completed and that Smollett could be in danger of physical harm if he had stayed locked up in Cook County jail.

The West's sanctions on Russia's central bank has hurt Putin and brought him to his knees but it's hurting. So I suppose you could say President Biden has gotten it right once in a row. Point three, the rest of President Biden's economic response to the invasion and military response invasion to the invasion in my judgment has been a wimp fest. Let's take it, first, militarily, President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people are holding their own on the ground. They need air cover. Today, President Zelenskyy said, can you please help me get planes? Can you please help me get surface-to-air missiles? I'm not asking for American planes or pilots or troops.

And a lot of our allies say, well, we have to buy his oil and gas, where are we going to get it? Well, the obvious answer is the United States, except for one problem, the woker darlings and the Democratic Party will not allow President Biden to adopt an all-of-the-above energy policy, which includes oil and gas and the president just doesn't seem to have the courage to stand up to them."

We saw Donald Trump use modern warfare weaponry technology to kick the living Adam Schiff out of that caliphate and feed him, that was grown under Obama and Biden. You're saying no boots on the ground, but if the Ukrainians who I think have shown a real willingness to fight back hard, if they have the right tools and right military equipment, they'll -- they have a shot at winning this war.

But there's an alternative just have Poland either fly or truck their planes flown by Ukrainian pilots either directly into Ukraine or they can put them on a truck and put them next to the border and let the Ukrainians drag them across and President Biden won't even agree to that it's as if he's looking for excuses. I would -- I would ask the president to consider. I know you know you don't want to make Mr. Putin mad, but, you know, when -- in the Vietnam War, you know who supplied planes directly to North Vietnam, Russia. In the Korean War, you know who supplied planes directly to North Korea, Russia. So I don't understand the reluctance of the president.

And remember, we got this far, the Ukrainians did and the West with not very many supplies when we had the big controversy about the Trump initial shipment of Javelins. It was only 150 Javelins. So we haven't really geared up yet, I think now, we're gearing up and these weapons are pouring in. I don't know why we don't take Ukrainians out of the country 90 or a hundred of them and train them to do say Patriot anti-missile batteries, and we could train them on that sophisticated weapon that has a lot of capability that SAMs don't. So I think that we can train them to use even more and more sophisticated weapons and ramp the pressure up and I think what's going to happen now is that Putin is going to get wilder and wilder and given more and more threats. And we've got to be very careful because he's a wounded tiger and he's caged, and he's going to try to expand the conflict even though -- and in a weird way to win while he's losing in his primary objective of taking Ukraine."

Look, he is creating generational hatred what he's doing right now and if I had to write a book on this campaign right now and title it, it would be out of the Forrest Gump movie, stupid is as stupid does. Shelling those cities is just absolutely stupid right now because one he's created rubble and you never want to fight in rubbled cities. He's getting absolute hatred of the Ukrainian people. And it just makes no sense to me. He's not going to take Kyiv. It's a huge city. It's a 2,000-year-old city, and they're not going to give up. They're just not going to quit on them. I think it's reaching a point right now if this was a prize fight, Putin's losing on points. He's never going to get to the west crossing the Dnieper River. I think he's really -- he'd better start figuring out how he negotiates to a settlement because I don't think he can win it. And when we talk about what Victor just made a comment about --"

So beg my -- I beg your indulgence here, but if he goes scorched-earth and he's like a cornered rat, what will he be capable of doing at that point? That's Victor Davis Hanson, I hear that's his concern and I share it."

Yeah, you know, my concern and that is a concern is they do have a military strategy of escalate to de-escalate, and the absolute fear that I've got is he's going to use a as a sub-kiloton nuclear weapon and they've got them in their inventory. We don't have those in our inventory. In fact, we did away with it in the `60s. We had a data system called the Davy Crockett and they do a demonstration. What that means is you shoot it into the water or shoot it into a big field and there are some kiloton weapons but it makes it a demonstration that is using a nuclear weapon. I hope he's not that stupid or crazy to do it, because to me, a nuclear weapon's a nuclear weapon. But that's going to be the sign of absolute desperation. And the best thing I'm hoping is that we get an interlocutor out there, somebody who can talk him off the wall right now. Biden can't do it because there's no communications between Biden and Putin. But somebody needs to talk to Putin and get him off where he's going because right now, he's in the process of losing a war and when you start losing a war, you do go to extremes. And that's the worst extreme we can look for."

We made a mistake, Sean, by when they raised their nuclear level, special combat readiness we should have responded in kind by raising our nuclear readiness. We're normally -- what's called defense condition, we're normally at a four. It's one through five, one's the highest you can go. But we raised it to three during 9/11. And everybody took notice. We went it to two during the Cuban missile crisis, just raise it and say, look, you need to understand, you know -- President Trump told Kim Jong-un which was when he said it was pretty funny when Kim Jong-un says, I have a red button, remember President Trump said back to him, well, I've got a red button it's bigger than yours and mine works.

I don't think you can be the leader of the free world and operate from a position of fear. Do you?"

      "utterance": "No, I think historically anytime you assure an enemy what you're not going to do, you're ensuring them that they will do it, and Biden is always telling Putin what we're not going to do, and that's a mistake. And you know we've had kind of a missile spree, Sean. It's not just in Ukraine. After Afghanistan and this administration, North Korea led off more missiles in January than it has in its entire history, and then we had Iran jump in and send missiles pretty close to a consulate and then we had Putin send missiles near the Polish border. And remember, I think it was in October, the Chinese sent a hypersonic missile. So, all of these players have been watching Afghanistan and this administration, and they're thinking, you know what, there's no consequences and this is a rare moment to get real strategic advantage over the United States and in its allies. I really -- I think we -- looking back, it was really terrible when the Obama administration gave up missile defense in the Czech Republic and Poland. If we have those batteries right now, even though they were ostensibly aimed at maybe an Iranian rogue missile, we would have a level of deterrence, if we hadn't cut back on missile defense in 2009 to 2016. So, we're going to have to rethink things. Pump in -- pump more gas and oil really concentrate on continental and forward missile defense, and start arming people before when you have the -- just the faintest scent that Putin's on the move, start arming them in mass and we haven't done it."

It makes no sense. Otis Campbell on Andy Griffith's Show when he would take the key and let himself in the jail after a three-day drunk made more sense.

Al-Baghdadi is no longer on the face of the globe. You know we had other terrorist leaders that met their demise as well. And so, when you see this, it's all about having a strength and a will to lead. And what we're seeing right now is a real weakness and sadly, the gaffes that you have there, you know, you take no joy in seeing that and obviously the more that they're done, the more problematic they become because you try to make excuses for them. But really where we need to focus is again with our world leaders, whether it's President Xi or President Putin, we need to let them know that we are not going to just roll over and take their domineering uh dictatorship and allow the American people to just sit back in a spirit of appeasement. We've got to -- to really take a leadership role and Donald Trump did that."

And what we've seen with President Biden is that, you know, he fumbles his communication and we would forgive that and not even care if he didn't fumble the policies and fumble the decisions that he has to make at moments like this. But when the fumbling of your communications is equal to or sometimes even less than the fumbling of the policies where people's lives are at stake like we saw in Afghanistan, that's where we have a real problem and that is serious. By the way, next time you guys are on, the hard question is going to go to Mark Meadows, not to Governor Huckabee, and just to be fair and balanced, but we do appreciate both of you.
