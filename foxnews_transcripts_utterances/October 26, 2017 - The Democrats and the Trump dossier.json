I think anything having to do with Russia really has to be, whether it is Uranium One or the dossier, has to be investigated. We have a real problem. This country is really being taken advantage of by an aggressive and I think really shrewd power, and we are ignoring it at our peril. So I think that everyone, I don't really care obeyed for it and I don't really care what it turned up or whether or not it's fake or real.

It has to do with the fact that he fired James Comey, the FBI director, who was investigating. He was launching a probe that had to do with Donald Trump and therefore he is looking to obstruction of justice. There are the things like a misleading statement about his son's meeting with the Russians in June of 2016 that the president helped draft. So he's gotten himself into a different spot of trouble having nothing to do with the dossier.",

There is another idea that you've seen Democrats and the Clinton campaign, people in the intelligence agencies and the media working to undermine Donald Trump and his presidency or his campaign through the storytelling about a Russian narrative. And for that we are starting to see a little bit more evidence in that regard. And so Paul Ryan putting his weight behind those information requests that have been out there for so long to the FBI about why they were playing with this dossier, what they were paying for it, why they used it to secure a wiretap, those are questions that a lot of people are going to want answers for, and it sounds like we're starting to get the ball rolling on that."

      "utterance": "Just fact-checking here, A.B., a lot of different places say Republicans funded this at first. Just to be clear, a Republican group during the primary funded Fusion GPS for oppo research, but it was not until the Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the same group that they hired Chris Steele, the British national who then contacted the Russians, forming this dossier. So that's just to straighten the facts out there."

      "utterance": "Right. And members of the Clinton circle have lied about this throughout and Hillary Clinton is now claiming she didn't know anything about it. John Podesta, the campaign chairman, didn't pay for it. He didn't know what was going on. It all sounds rather suspect. And this is a campaign and a candidate who, she lied about her private server throughout the campaign. I am with Senator Grassley on this. I think anything having to do with Russia really has to be, whether it is Uranium One or the dossier, has to be investigated. We have a real problem. This country is really being taken advantage of by an aggressive and I think really shrewd power, and we are ignoring it at our peril. So I think that everyone, I don't really care obeyed for it and I don't really care what it turned up or whether or not it's fake or real. I think the fact is all this stuff should be investigated. It does not at all exempt Donald Trump for what special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating which is not having to do with the dossier. It has to do with the fact that he fired James Comey, the FBI director, who was investigating. He was launching a probe that had to do with Donald Trump and therefore he is looking to obstruction of justice. There are the things like a misleading statement about his son's meeting with the Russians in June of 2016 that the president helped draft. So he's gotten himself into a different spot of trouble having nothing to do with the dossier."

      "utterance": "What these things have in common is that there have been lies told by virtually everybody at all times on both sides of this. I think the same thing that applied to the Trump campaign and later Trump administration early on when Trump officials one after another had a difficult time telling the truth about what was going on, basic questions, easy questions about contacts with Russians also applies to the Clintons here and the Democrats. It is, shall we say, hard to believe Tom Perez, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, John Podesta had no idea that Democrats had any role funding this. We don't know conclusively that they did."

I'm not suggesting that he knew for sure. I am saying that there needs to be more investigation. If I can make a final point on this, the most important thing going forward is going to be transparency. The American people should see this debate unfold in real time with as much information from primary sources as is possible so that the American people can make their own determination about who is telling the truth and what happened."
