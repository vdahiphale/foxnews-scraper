      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. If you want to understand a country's military, take a look at what its officer corps is reading. Military officers aren't just war fighters, they are trained to be thinkers, even intellectuals. Some of them have advanced degrees. In Russia, officers above the rank of Colonel are required to read a book by a Russian nationalist called Aleksandr Dugin, called \"The Foundations of Geopolitics.\" Dugin's book envisions a Eurasian empire with Russia at the center of it and then outlines the way to achieve that. In China, meanwhile, recruits are told to read \"The Origin and Goal of History.\" It teaches that China is successful because its culture is superior to the West's. Now, you might not agree with them, but these are serious books, and they promote the national interests of the countries whose officers read them, that is why they are assigned, and that makes sense. So with that in mind, what are American military officers reading these days? Well, let's see, a sub-literate pamphlet on how the United States is a disgusting immoral country that must be changed immediately and forever. That track is entitled \"How to be an Antiracist.\" It was written by a former University of Florida professor called Henry Rogers, now that he is rich and famous, he goes by his revolutionary name, Ibram X. Kendi. The book is garbage, actually, it is worse than that. Not only is embarrassingly stupid, it is poisonous. Kendi's premise is as simple as he is. Any system that produces unequal outcomes must be racist. Period. That's it. That's the entire thesis and Kendi applies it to everything. If some people make more money than the other people, then the economy is a racist. If Ibram X. Kendi decides there aren't enough black astrophysicists, then astrophysics is by definition, racist. If it rains in a black neighborhood, but not across town, then what you are watching is weather racism. Actually, Kendi didn't really write that, probably because he has no detectable sense of humor. But there is no question that he believes it, the book is that militantly dumb. So, how do we respond to all of this racism in the United States? Well, Kendi provides a solution. Quote, \"The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination.\" He actually wrote that. In other words, his book against racism promotes racism. Now, you would think that might be a red flag for people, contradicting as it does the founding principles of the country, as well as basic human decency, but no. The people in charge love the book, it's all over Corporate America. You can probably pick up a free copy at your H.R. Department tomorrow morning if you want. But, the military? You can't imagine the U.S. Military would assign a book like that, recommend it to every sailor in the U.S. Navy. Well, yes, actually. On Tuesday, Congressman Jim Banks of Indiana demanded an explanation for this from the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday. Here's how it went.",

Open and honest conversations are racist, Kendi said that many times. So, let's say, open and honestly, you decided that you cared more about the way people behaved than the way that they look. Let's say, you took Martin Luther King at his word and judge people by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. If you were to do that, Ibram X. Kendi says, you are a racist, quote, \"The claim of not racist neutrality is a mask for racism. The language for color blindness is a mask to hide racism. A color-blind Constitution for a white supremacist America.\" That's what the military is reading. So, no, open honest conversations are not allowed in Kendi's America. Here is the choice: you admit you are a racist, or else you are super-duper racist. That's his position. It sounds pretty deranged, honestly. In fact, it sounds like an extremist ideology, just the kind the military is always warning us about. Keep in mind that tonight, right now, The Pentagon is investigating National Guardsmen who have posted unfashionable opinions on Facebook about the last election or may have voted for Donald Trump. So, with all of their investigators running around looking into people's thought crimes, how closely have they looked -- has The Pentagon looked into Ibram X. Kendi?

Right. But how are we defining racism? Ibram X. Kendi couldn't say, despite making a bountiful living on the topic, getting rich talking about racism, he hadn't thought how to define the word. Now, in a serious society, everybody listening, everyone in the room would have walked out and found something better to do, birdwatching maybe. That's racist. Well, the so-called intellectual on the stage turned out to be an idiot, so they should have left, but they didn't. They just laughed nervously. They were worried if they said something about what had just happened, if they pointed out that the former Henry Rogers was in fact a fraud, they would be denounced as well. This is how mediocre people control entire societies, with implied threats. Go along or we will punish you, so they don't say anything. The funny thing is, in his own book, Kendi admits that he himself is a racist. Here is a definition, quote: \"White Democrats stood aside and let Bush steal the presidency on the strength of destroyed black votes. Bush's team transitioned that winter, I transitioned into hating white people. White people became devils to me, but I had to figure out how they came to be devils.\" So, this is the man that Admiral Michael Gilday -- it's hard to believe that Admiral Michael Gilday has any power in the United States Military, but he does -- and this is the man Admiral Michael Gilday believes the entire U.S. Navy should study.

It's important for the American people to understand the difference between equity and equality. One of them is good and the ideal, and the other is not good. We tend to confuse at the moment equality of opportunity, which is the ideal and is something that's a part of America's founding philosophy with equity. It is a new term, it is used wittingly, which essentially means enforced outcomes or enforced inequality. In fact, based on what I've seen in the Department of Defense and now what I'm hearing is permeating institutions across the country, it is essentially even, potentially illegally discriminatory policy. Equity is not good as it is defined, but it sounds good and that's why we use the word. But NASA has historically been, I think a symbol of inclusion and equal opportunity.",

People in uniform, for example, rally around that mission and have historically not been caught up in the kind of identity politicking that you're talking about, that I'm hearing in your monologue, and so I'll just make one point to say that I think, our senior leaders and our national leaders need to think very carefully about whether or not they want to inject tribalism into our long trusted institutions in this country that typically have not been infected with tribal thinking with all that that entails. Do we really want to walk the road that will cause us to abandon Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of having a colorless society where in fact, we're starting once again to judge people by the color of their skin, impugning guilt to other groups of people, based on their group identity, not because of anything that they have ever done necessarily themselves, but based on who they are accidentally even let's say.

Some of them may have encouraged others at the scene to commit crimes. Now, if that happened and we believe it did happen, it would not be out of character for the F.B.I. They've done things very much like that before. That is beyond dispute. But in this case, they are disputing it, not the F.B.I. directly, they haven't said a word, but the obedient minions of the national security state who run the social media accounts of \"The New York Times\" and occupy the anchor desks at CNN. They became hysterical when we mentioned it. \"You can't say that,\" they screamed. \"That's not allowed.\" The geniuses at Twitter weighed in to inform us that the people we had described as agents of the F.B.I. were in fact just F.B.I. informants, so shut up. Hilarious. But we won't shut up, and we shouldn't. It could not be more obvious at this point that the government is in fact hiding something, probably quite a few things. So, best to abandon theatrics and find out what they are hiding. That's our job. To many in corporate media, who claim that we are spreading Russian disinformation, instead, please calmly answer these three questions. First: how many of the so-called insurrectionists on January 6th had a relationship with the F.B.I.? How many of these F.B.I. moles encouraged others that day to break the law at the Capitol? We haven't heard anyone answer these questions or even addressed them. If the answer is none, if none of the protesters were secretly working with the F.B.I. that day, then we were wrong and we will apologize for it sincerely. We'll admit it immediately. But if the answer is not none, and we're pretty sure it isn't none, then people who claim otherwise are liars and hacks and should leave the public stage immediately because they have betrayed their readers and viewers. Two: if the Justice Department knew there were going to be protesters massing at the Capitol that day, and it's clear they did know, then why didn't they do anything to stop the riot? Why did police at the Capitol allow protesters to walk in as video shows that they did? That doesn't make sense. What's going on here? Why is no one asking that question? Third, and finally: why can't we see the tape for ourselves? The government is hiding more than 14,000 hours of video surveillance tape that shows exactly what did happen at the Capitol that day. Why are they hiding that? And why aren't news organizations demanding to see it? You'd hate to think that NBC News for example or VOX or \"The Atlantic\" or \"The Washington Post\" or \"The Daily Beast\" or \"The New York Times\" or any of them are in fact working to protect the regime at the expense of the public. But unfortunately, we are starting to conclude that. Please prove us wrong. Well, a new lawsuit suggests that Twitter has been conspiring with the State of California to censor posts about election fraud. People behind that lawsuit will share the evidence they have gathered in it. That's next.",

Our client Rogan O'Handley was caught up in this dragnet for perfectly legitimate and honest opinions and commentary about seeking audits about these elections and in retaliation for that, he was removed from the Twitter platform.

We've been seeing it every single day, and based off our perspective, it's not going to slow down anytime soon. And we've got some exclusive remarkable video we want to show you of a cartel human smuggling stash house bust. We were tipped off to right here on the Rio Grande Valley. Take a look at this. This appeared to be at an abandoned auto garage. We got there as Border Patrol and State Troopers were busting this. One hundred and seven migrants were being held in there. They were all crammed together right on top of each other in this blistering Texas heat, no air-conditioning whatsoever. What these cartels do, what these smugglers do is they bring them across the border, then they put them in these stash houses and cram them together and they hold them there until they are ready to move them elsewhere further inside the United States. Now, take a look at this photo right here. We took this when we were there. Look on the left side of the wall here, you're going to see the letters, C- D-G spray painted on the wall with graffiti. Law enforcement sources tell me that stands for Cartel Del Golfo, the Gulf Cartel. That is the Mexican drug cartel that operates the Mexican side of the border where we are, big into human smuggling, drug smuggling. That is them staking their claim on that stash house. But that's not the only thing going on out here. Take a look at this video we shot here in this spot yesterday afternoon. We've seen this happen like clockwork, every single day. Rain or shine, night or day, it doesn't matter, these migrants are showing up by the hundreds just in this spot, in this sector every day, and that's why Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis says he is going to start sending some help to Texas. You heard Texas Governor Gregg Abbott say Texas is going to build a border wall. Governor DeSantis says, he is going to send Florida law enforcement out here to back up Texas and get some boots on the ground. Take a listen.",

And it works out pretty well. They flipped California. They flipped Nevada. They flipped New Mexico. They probably have flipped Colorado, maybe Arizona. Who knows, Texas and Georgia, so they are committed to this policy. The only thing that -- if I could use a vernacular -- screwed up -- they were expecting 500 to a thousand a day, maybe a half a million a year. They didn't think in the fiscal year, we're going to get two million people and that means bad optics. All the things they demagogue, Tucker, unaccompanied adults, gang members, cages, cartels -- now, they are happening in spades, and so they don't know what to do. They like the idea that there are these mass influx, they just didn't think -- they thought the media could put a handle on it, but it's so huge they can't.

They are pushing things like race conscious politics in France, ideas about gender identity, gender fluidity in Eastern Europe. So, I think it makes ideological sense for the Democrats to be all in on NATO and sort of the Transatlantic Alliance, and the people who try to take the people who are against Trump within the administration on the first impeachment, I mean, the thing that they were most upset about was that he would dare do what he ran on, which was pull back from NATO, pull back from commitments in Eastern Europe. It's very strange though that the Republicans at the same time are joining the Democrats and voting for NATO expansion, attacking Biden just like they attacked Obama for being too hawkish.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. If you want to understand a country's military, take a look at what its officer corps is reading. Military officers aren't just war fighters, they are trained to be thinkers, even intellectuals. Some of them have advanced degrees. In Russia, officers above the rank of Colonel are required to read a book by a Russian nationalist called Aleksandr Dugin, called \"The Foundations of Geopolitics.\" Dugin's book envisions a Eurasian empire with Russia at the center of it and then outlines the way to achieve that. In China, meanwhile, recruits are told to read \"The Origin and Goal of History.\" It teaches that China is successful because its culture is superior to the West's. Now, you might not agree with them, but these are serious books, and they promote the national interests of the countries whose officers read them, that is why they are assigned, and that makes sense. So with that in mind, what are American military officers reading these days? Well, let's see, a sub-literate pamphlet on how the United States is a disgusting immoral country that must be changed immediately and forever. That track is entitled \"How to be an Antiracist.\" It was written by a former University of Florida professor called Henry Rogers, now that he is rich and famous, he goes by his revolutionary name, Ibram X. Kendi. The book is garbage, actually, it is worse than that. Not only is embarrassingly stupid, it is poisonous. Kendi's premise is as simple as he is. Any system that produces unequal outcomes must be racist. Period. That's it. That's the entire thesis and Kendi applies it to everything. If some people make more money than the other people, then the economy is a racist. If Ibram X. Kendi decides there aren't enough black astrophysicists, then astrophysics is by definition, racist. If it rains in a black neighborhood, but not across town, then what you are watching is weather racism. Actually, Kendi didn't really write that, probably because he has no detectable sense of humor. But there is no question that he believes it, the book is that militantly dumb. So, how do we respond to all of this racism in the United States? Well, Kendi provides a solution. Quote, \"The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination.\" He actually wrote that. In other words, his book against racism promotes racism. Now, you would think that might be a red flag for people, contradicting as it does the founding principles of the country, as well as basic human decency, but no. The people in charge love the book, it's all over Corporate America. You can probably pick up a free copy at your H.R. Department tomorrow morning if you want. But, the military? You can't imagine the U.S. Military would assign a book like that, recommend it to every sailor in the U.S. Navy. Well, yes, actually. On Tuesday, Congressman Jim Banks of Indiana demanded an explanation for this from the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday. Here's how it went."

      "speaker": "BANKS",

      "speaker": "GILDAY",

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"Open and honest conversations about racism.\" Well, that would be nice, but it's an amusing line coming from someone who claims to have read Kendi's book, as Gilday says he has. Open and honest conversations are racist, Kendi said that many times. So, let's say, open and honestly, you decided that you cared more about the way people behaved than the way that they look. Let's say, you took Martin Luther King at his word and judge people by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. If you were to do that, Ibram X. Kendi says, you are a racist, quote, \"The claim of not racist neutrality is a mask for racism. The language for color blindness is a mask to hide racism. A color-blind Constitution for a white supremacist America.\" That's what the military is reading. So, no, open honest conversations are not allowed in Kendi's America. Here is the choice: you admit you are a racist, or else you are super-duper racist. That's his position. It sounds pretty deranged, honestly. In fact, it sounds like an extremist ideology, just the kind the military is always warning us about. Keep in mind that tonight, right now, The Pentagon is investigating National Guardsmen who have posted unfashionable opinions on Facebook about the last election or may have voted for Donald Trump. So, with all of their investigators running around looking into people's thought crimes, how closely have they looked -- has The Pentagon looked into Ibram X. Kendi? Have they checked his social media history? Well, actually, Congressman Banks asked Gilday that question. Watch."

Now, that's odd that once you dig a little, you can see why he doesn't want to talk much about it. Not long ago, Kendi was invited to speak at the Aspen Ideas Festival, a place where ideas go to die. A roomful of academics waited to hear his wisdom. During the question and answer session, one of them dared to ask the most basic question of all: how are we defining racism? How do you define that? Now, you'd think Ibram X. Kendi would be ready for that question, but he wasn't. Here's what he said."

    {

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So, racism is racist stuff, or as Kendi puts it, and we are quoting now, \"It is a collection of racist polities that lead to racial inequity that are substantiated by racist ideas.\" End quote. Right. But how are we defining racism? Ibram X. Kendi couldn't say, despite making a bountiful living on the topic, getting rich talking about racism, he hadn't thought how to define the word. Now, in a serious society, everybody listening, everyone in the room would have walked out and found something better to do, birdwatching maybe. That's racist. Well, the so-called intellectual on the stage turned out to be an idiot, so they should have left, but they didn't. They just laughed nervously. They were worried if they said something about what had just happened, if they pointed out that the former Henry Rogers was in fact a fraud, they would be denounced as well. This is how mediocre people control entire societies, with implied threats. Go along or we will punish you, so they don't say anything. The funny thing is, in his own book, Kendi admits that he himself is a racist. Here is a definition, quote: \"White Democrats stood aside and let Bush steal the presidency on the strength of destroyed black votes. Bush's team transitioned that winter, I transitioned into hating white people. White people became devils to me, but I had to figure out how they came to be devils.\" So, this is the man that Admiral Michael Gilday -- it's hard to believe that Admiral Michael Gilday has any power in the United States Military, but he does -- and this is the man Admiral Michael Gilday believes the entire U.S. Navy should study. Imagine working for someone like Admiral Michael Gilday. Most normal people cannot even imagine that, so they're leaving the military."

It's important for the American people to understand the difference between equity and equality. One of them is good and the ideal, and the other is not good. We tend to confuse at the moment equality of opportunity, which is the ideal and is something that's a part of America's founding philosophy with equity. It is a new term, it is used wittingly, which essentially means enforced outcomes or enforced inequality. In fact, based on what I've seen in the Department of Defense and now what I'm hearing is permeating institutions across the country, it is essentially even, potentially illegally discriminatory policy. Equity is not good as it is defined, but it sounds good and that's why we use the word. But NASA has historically been, I think a symbol of inclusion and equal opportunity."

People in uniform, for example, rally around that mission and have historically not been caught up in the kind of identity politicking that you're talking about, that I'm hearing in your monologue, and so I'll just make one point to say that I think, our senior leaders and our national leaders need to think very carefully about whether or not they want to inject tribalism into our long trusted institutions in this country that typically have not been infected with tribal thinking with all that that entails. Do we really want to walk the road that will cause us to abandon Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of having a colorless society where in fact, we're starting once again to judge people by the color of their skin, impugning guilt to other groups of people, based on their group identity, not because of anything that they have ever done necessarily themselves, but based on who they are accidentally even let's say.

Some of them may have encouraged others at the scene to commit crimes. Now, if that happened and we believe it did happen, it would not be out of character for the F.B.I. They've done things very much like that before. That is beyond dispute. But in this case, they are disputing it, not the F.B.I. directly, they haven't said a word, but the obedient minions of the national security state who run the social media accounts of \"The New York Times\" and occupy the anchor desks at CNN. They became hysterical when we mentioned it. \"You can't say that,\" they screamed. \"That's not allowed.\" The geniuses at Twitter weighed in to inform us that the people we had described as agents of the F.B.I. were in fact just F.B.I. informants, so shut up. Hilarious. But we won't shut up, and we shouldn't. It could not be more obvious at this point that the government is in fact hiding something, probably quite a few things. So, best to abandon theatrics and find out what they are hiding. That's our job. To many in corporate media, who claim that we are spreading Russian disinformation, instead, please calmly answer these three questions."

How many of these F.B.I. moles encouraged others that day to break the law at the Capitol? We haven't heard anyone answer these questions or even addressed them. If the answer is none, if none of the protesters were secretly working with the F.B.I. that day, then we were wrong and we will apologize for it sincerely. We'll admit it immediately. But if the answer is not none, and we're pretty sure it isn't none, then people who claim otherwise are liars and hacks and should leave the public stage immediately because they have betrayed their readers and viewers."

You'd hate to think that NBC News for example or VOX or \"The Atlantic\" or \"The Washington Post\" or \"The Daily Beast\" or \"The New York Times\" or any of them are in fact working to protect the regime at the expense of the public. But unfortunately, we are starting to conclude that. Please prove us wrong. Well, a new lawsuit suggests that Twitter has been conspiring with the State of California to censor posts about election fraud. People behind that lawsuit will share the evidence they have gathered in it. That's next."

A new lawsuit says that the State of California's coordinated censorship with Twitter violates the First Amendment, which obviously it does. Harmeet Dhillon is a lawyer with the Center for American Liberty and one of the country's most important first women advocates. Rogan O'Handley is an activist and attorney.

Well, a lot of us who use Twitter and other social media have suspected that this has been going on for some time, but the Judicial Watch public records act request documents reveal a stunning and broad conspiracy by government agencies, Democrat lobbying firms, and a National Association of Secretaries of State to gather so-called dangerous election related speech, work with Twitter and potentially other social media companies, and get that speech taken down in the name of fairer and cleaner elections. Our client Rogan O'Handley was caught up in this dragnet for perfectly legitimate and honest opinions and commentary about seeking audits about these elections and in retaliation for that, he was removed from the Twitter platform. This is a violation of the First Amendment. It is a Civil Rights conspiracy. It also violates the California Constitution.

And after the election, I am a trained lawyer. I look at evidence. I look at videos. I read sworn affidavits, and I said we need investigations here. I called for the same things that Stacey Abrams called for when she refused to concede the Georgia gubernatorial election. I said, we need to look into this further and specifically, I said, we need to look at it in California. I used to live there. I know how flimsy those elections can be. And so I said, hey, let's look at California elections and then Alex Padilla, Secretary of State, it was a criticism of his actions in office and then he paid this firm SKDK to tell him who to censor -- that was me."

So, he was actually elbowing out of the way other Democrats and this whole contract for $35 million for who to censor is so corrupt that other Democrats in the state protested about it because it was a no-bid contract given to a consultant for the Biden Campaign. SKDKnickerbocker is a Biden campaign consultant, so this is a mess of conflicts of interest, conspiracy, and boondoggle and favor trading."

And you know, this situation feels like David versus Goliath. I don't work for anyone. I'm completely independent, but I'm going to take on this machine. I'm going to take on corrupt California government.

She told them last week, do not come here to the border, but that message falling on deaf ears. They've been coming all week long. We've been seeing it every single day, and based off our perspective, it's not going to slow down anytime soon. And we've got some exclusive remarkable video we want to show you of a cartel human smuggling stash house bust. We were tipped off to right here on the Rio Grande Valley. Take a look at this. This appeared to be at an abandoned auto garage. We got there as Border Patrol and State Troopers were busting this. One hundred and seven migrants were being held in there. They were all crammed together right on top of each other in this blistering Texas heat, no air-conditioning whatsoever. What these cartels do, what these smugglers do is they bring them across the border, then they put them in these stash houses and cram them together and they hold them there until they are ready to move them elsewhere further inside the United States. Now, take a look at this photo right here. We took this when we were there. Look on the left side of the wall here, you're going to see the letters, C- D-G spray painted on the wall with graffiti. Law enforcement sources tell me that stands for Cartel Del Golfo, the Gulf Cartel. That is the Mexican drug cartel that operates the Mexican side of the border where we are, big into human smuggling, drug smuggling. That is them staking their claim on that stash house. But that's not the only thing going on out here. Take a look at this video we shot here in this spot yesterday afternoon. We've seen this happen like clockwork, every single day. Rain or shine, night or day, it doesn't matter, these migrants are showing up by the hundreds just in this spot, in this sector every day, and that's why Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis says he is going to start sending some help to Texas. You heard Texas Governor Gregg Abbott say Texas is going to build a border wall. Governor DeSantis says, he is going to send Florida law enforcement out here to back up Texas and get some boots on the ground. Take a listen."

They don't believe in sovereignty. And in particular, they look at massive illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America especially when people are poor, they don't know English, they're illegal, they become wards of the state and the Federal government when they arrive, and then the left says, we hand you these entitlements, and we expect fealties at the polls. And it works out pretty well. They flipped California. They flipped Nevada. They flipped New Mexico. They probably have flipped Colorado, maybe Arizona. Who knows, Texas and Georgia, so they are committed to this policy. The only thing that -- if I could use a vernacular -- screwed up -- they were expecting 500 to a thousand a day, maybe a half a million a year. They didn't think in the fiscal year, we're going to get two million people and that means bad optics. All the things they demagogue, Tucker, unaccompanied adults, gang members, cages, cartels -- now, they are happening in spades, and so they don't know what to do. They like the idea that there are these mass influx, they just didn't think -- they thought the media could put a handle on it, but it's so huge they can't. So, they send Kamala Harris down there, and I think they do it in a very cynical fashion. I think that they believe a lot of leaks about Joe Biden's cognitive abilities emanate from the Vice President's Office. They know it is -- as I said, it's a toxic political situation because it is self- created and whatever she says is going to have as much negative dipositive appeal."

So all of a sudden, it's pretty hard to get your book published if you've got the wrong political views. That's censorship. Simon & Schuster has led the way on that, but they're not the only ones.

It wasn't the first time they had done something like this, they did the same thing to Milo Yiannopoulos several years before. They neglected to take a second book from best-selling author Candace Owens because they didn't like her politics. Simon & Schuster did that. It's all in a new book that I have just written coming out in August published by Simon & Schuster, which you might want to check out. But in the meantime, in the face of this kind of censorship, this digital book burning, there is a new option in publishing that we want to tell you about tonight. It's called All Seasons Press, Louise Burke is the co- founder. She used to work at Simon & Schuster, a publisher.

Unfortunately, on policy -- and we've seen this time and time again -- it's still basically the Bush-Cheney party. We've expanded NATO in the last few years. The U.S. has added North Macedonia and Montenegro, these countries have militaries that are about the size of a mid-sized U.S. city's police force and nobody even pretends to argue that this in any way defends American interests. Now, you understand why Democrats sort of like NATO, it's become something of a social engineering project, the U.S., through the State Department, through The Pentagon is really pushing identity politics. They are pushing things like race conscious politics in France, ideas about gender identity, gender fluidity in Eastern Europe. So, I think it makes ideological sense for the Democrats to be all in on NATO and sort of the Transatlantic Alliance, and the people who try to take the people who are against Trump within the administration on the first impeachment, I mean, the thing that they were most upset about was that he would dare do what he ran on, which was pull back from NATO, pull back from commitments in Eastern Europe. It's very strange though that the Republicans at the same time are joining the Democrats and voting for NATO expansion, attacking Biden just like they attacked Obama for being too hawkish. I mean, they found the rhetoric of putting America First in their foreign policy. They found that beneficial. Unfortunately, policy-wise it's still the Bush-Cheney party."
