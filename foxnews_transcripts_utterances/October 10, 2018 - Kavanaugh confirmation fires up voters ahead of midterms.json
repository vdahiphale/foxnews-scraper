I mean, I'm shocked. Barack Obama never did anything political. He was a statesman. Oh, wait a second, I've just googled it. Barack Obama had the exact same ceremony for Sotomayor, a day or two after she was sworn in at the White House where he invited the congressional Hispanic caucus, the leaders of the senate judiciary committee, and they talked about single mothers, and they talked about diversity, and immigration.

And most of this could be absolutely avoided, including the embarrassment not only of the Kavanaugh family but also of the Ford family. But it was Democrats who are being so hyper political and that's why they're taking such a big hit with independents. But, also, Judge Kavanaugh, you're right. He isn't polling very well with women right now, but it doesn't matter because he's not running for office, is he? No, he's got a lifetime appointment. He never has to interview for a job ever again. So that is pretty much settled. So now what Democrats are doing is they essentially just making stuff up and acting like they're outraged that a politician would have a political moment.

And this whole thing which has happened yesterday night was a real microcosm of the Trump presidency, because here he is, he's just nominated his second justice and has him confirmed. And he's exposed the left as kind of Me Too maniacs and he's energized his base. And all the left can do is talk about the words he used in the optics of the event. Meanwhile, he's put in 41 district court judges, 26 court of appeals judges, and this is his second justice. What the left needs to do is take inventory about what happened in this fight, pivot to another topic because this is not working. Stop talking about impeachment. Stop talking about the Electoral College and just move forward. Instead, they're acting like he's the first politician to do something political at the White House. I mean, I'm shocked. Barack Obama never did anything political. He was a statesman. Oh, wait a second, I've just googled it. Barack Obama had the exact same ceremony for Sotomayor, a day or two after she was sworn in at the White House where he invited the congressional Hispanic caucus, the leaders of the senate judiciary committee, and they talked about single mothers, and they talked about diversity, and immigration. You know, those kinds of things that made up the Obama political coalition. So, when Barack Obama does something, it's never political, but when Donald Trump does something it's nakedly partisan."

I don't know why it's in a basket, not a bucket.  This is what I will say, we are in a very politically strange time because both people can be right. You can have independents who are outraged by the way Democrats behave because all of this could have been going on before or during the confirmation process, especially early on. And most of this could be absolutely avoided, including the embarrassment not only of the Kavanaugh family but also of the Ford family. But it was Democrats who are being so hyper political and that's why they're taking such a big hit with independents. But, also, Judge Kavanaugh, you're right. He isn't polling very well with women right now, but it doesn't matter because he's not running for office, is he? No, he's got a lifetime appointment. He never has to interview for a job ever again. So that is pretty much settled. So now what Democrats are doing is they essentially just making stuff up and acting like they're outraged that a politician would have a political moment. And if you look at this in contrast with some of the rallies that the president has, like those are hyper political moment, that's when he goes out and really fires up the base. I think what you're seeing here is a lot of people who were supporting Justice Kavanaugh felt like he was going to be blocked from confirmation, and the fact that they actually got a win, and it was fact victorious over feelings, that was the boisterousness in that crowd. You saw a lot of people especially on social media shocked and surprised and relieved and that's why they were celebrating."

You know, I have advice for Democrats and they may not listen to me, but they're trying to create a battle in which all men are the oppressors and all women are the victims. This is part of the leftist identity politics strategy, women as victim, men as oppressors. The problem with this is that women live with men. They love men and vice versa. And the bigger problem with this gambit is that there are black men and Hispanic men in the Democratic Party who are as concerned about false allegations as everybody else in this world. So you may sit there -- it's going to be about oppressors versus victims, but there're people that are sensibly saying, like, well, wait a minute, what about due process?

And I think Hillary Clinton and some of the more progressive women in the Democratic Party, and she puts herself in that camp, although she may not be there honestly. They really want to exacerbate this gender civil war. And it's one of the worst things that can happen. And it's very, in its own way, paternalistic and belittling."

I'm not going to play speculation nation like the rest what the press is doing, you know. She's either going to run for president against Donald Trump, she was the anonymous op-ed writer. She's going to take Lindsey Graham's seat when Graham goes to justice. So, I don't really know. What I do know she's got two young children, and she needs money, and she's been working really, really hard, and I think she'll probably land a very nice contributor ship somewhere possibly, rack up some big speaking fees, may be write a book, become a lobbyist and make a lot of coin, and that's good for her. Right now, there's like -- I think Dina Powell, her name has been floating around. And, as you know, Ric Grenell, his name has been floated around.  But, as U.N. ambassador, she did a much better job than Susan Rice. She didn't lie on all five Sunday shows which is really good. She rallied the U.N. Security Council against North Korea. She spoke very strongly about Iran and Syria. So she had a really good run. I don't know what's going to happen now, but she, you know, was the victim of a lot of fake news too.  Remember the curtains and the really disgusting rumors from Fire and Fury.  And she handled it with a lot of class.

She's very interesting. She has comported herself quite well. She has aligned herself with the president when she thought it was appropriate and she's distance herself when there were areas of disagreement. And I think she's actually created a pretty good template for other people who will follow in her footsteps, not just in this job but in others, how to effectively and honestly deal with the president. I think his cabinet has been better for her presence there and you never know what the timing is.

Dina Powell has experience working for President Trump as the national security advisor. So like Nikki Haley, gained a lot of foreign policy experience in that time. And then, Ric Grenell just got confirmed by the senate. That was a tough confirmation. And President Trump apparently loves what he's doing in Germany and really having an impact there.

And trade and terror, we're entering this new world with China.  This is like the most consequential two years I've seen in recent history of things that are actually going on and taking place.

So this is why Trump, as the real-estate tycoon, is succeeding where other politicians aren't, because he knows the salesmanship. Kanye is in a unique position. No. 1, he's arguably the biggest male pop star, so he can expend the capital that we don't have. He can take the risks. No. 2, he does take the risks. He serves as an example for individuals who will face the mob. He knows what he's saying is not popular among his peers, but he does it anyway.

I think the whole thing might, in fact, be a giant trolling performance piece. I don't doubt that he has respect for the president and he is inspired by him.
