Also this week, the President scoring a major victory with Criminal Justice Reform with overwhelming support from both chambers proving both Democrats and Republicans can agree on something when they try.

In my opinion, you know the only reason we're in Syria is because Bush got us into Iraq then Obama got us out too early and ISIS took over so Trump and Mattis came in, bombed out of the heck out of the Caliphate basically eliminated the Caliphate and Mattis wants to stay and try to secure the peace and hold the allies hands and Trump's thinking to himself, \"You know what, we got in, we got it done.

James Mattis giving his resignation as Defense Secretary stepping down in February after President Trump announced plans to pull out all U.S. troops from Syria and withdraw roughly 7,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan in the coming months. Also this week, the President scoring a major victory with Criminal Justice Reform with overwhelming support from both chambers proving both Democrats and Republicans can agree on something when they try. Here to break this all down, former intelligence analyst and commentator Morgan Ortegus and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, the author of \"Trump's Enemies,\" and that book is very, very, very long. All right, ladies first, we'll start with Morgan. In my opinion, you know the only reason we're in Syria is because Bush got us into Iraq then Obama got us out too early and ISIS took over so Trump and Mattis came in, bombed out of the heck out of the Caliphate basically eliminated the Caliphate and Mattis wants to stay and try to secure the peace and hold the allies hands and Trump's thinking to himself, \"You know what, we got in, we got it done. Let's get out.\" Is that true?"

One of the most important things that any President has to do especially when they're committing young men and women's lives is to explain why we're there and what the mission is. This President has said even before he ran for President as long as he's been in public life that he is very wary of getting the U.S. entangled overseas. He had a very clear mission. What I think we really need as a follow-up action from this announcement is really a plan from the President, his National Security team on when we're leaving, how we're leaving, how we're going to secure - we have a lot of assets on the ground there. You know, military equipment that could fall into the hands of the Iranians and I also want to know from the President ..."

I know the President wants to make sure that when we fight our enemies, we're doing it on their home turf and not on ours and that's very important, but you also have to ask yourself the question, how long are we going to keep our troops overseas in Afghanistan? We've been there 6,000 days if you can imagine that - over 6,000 days in Syria. The question is, you know, we have destroyed and decimated those insurgents over there, but how long are we going to keep our military assets over there and how important is it for the United States to remain there and I understand generals' positions. They want to keep our men and women in those places for strategic reasons, but as an American citizen, I want to bring our men and women home and make sure we're only deploying them when they have the best interests of the United States in mind."

He doesn't see that in the U.S. national interest and he thinks to himself, \"Why are we fighting alongside the Kurds? Does that what America blood and treasure? Does it need to be spilled fighting alongside the Kurds?\" And he's also thinking to himself, \"Listen, we can go back in if we need to and bomb them again,\" but why sustain boots on the ground in Syria for year after year after year, does it really make sense, Morgan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ORTEGUS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's an incredibly complicated question. First of all, when it gets to the Kurds, the reason why there's a lot of people that are concerned about that is because they have fought alongside. They've been - some of the most effective fighters in the Middle East against ISIS, you are right, Jesse, that we can go back in and we did have to do that in the Obama administration when we saw ISIS flare-up in Iraq. I think the conversation that the President is having with the American people is overdue and is incredibly important where we have to --"

The American people need to understand it and I think there's a lot of people - look, if you look at the latest polling on American sentiment on Afghanistan, depending on the poll, there's only 20% to 25% of Americans that really understand our mission there and support it. I'm very supportive of what we've done in Afghanistan. I'm on the Board of the American University of Afghanistan. I believe in this, but the President is right to be very concerned about the amount of money that we have spent in Afghanistan and in Syria, but more on Afghanistan.

Let's bring the troops home and protect our own borders.\" But I can also see the flipside. I could see, you know, hanging out allies out to dry. What kind of message does that send to people in the Middle East that want to fight alongside of us?"

You know, when you look at Afghanistan, just in the last couple of weeks, we've had three more U.S. soldiers killed over there when their Humvee blew up because they drove over an IED, the fourth individual is up at Walter Reed. Look, they don't want us there and I understand that and as it brings back the issue of legal immigration. We have to make sure we're protecting our borders, Jesse, and if that means using our military to build a wall on the southern border so we're protecting Americans first, that has to be the priority of the President. And then we have to reevaluate our forward deployments around the world to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the tools necessary to be successful, but there should be no commitment to have a permanent military presence in Afghanistan where we've been for over 6,000 days."

No one really supports boots on the ground in Syria and the polls show that. Another very interesting poll, this is from Gallup, the country's top problems besides me, we took that out of there. We just didn't want to personalize it, Morgan. Nineteen percent believe government is the biggest problem in America, 19% followed by immigration and then unifying the country. Morgan, what do you think people mean when they say government is the problem specifically?"

This is going on in the Congress, you know, between all of the leadership. So when the average American is tuning into Fox News, and they're watching you know, the Congressional leadership just bicker with each other, it looks like a bunch of overgrown entitled children and that's why the President was elected to disrupt all of this --"

It could be as Morgan said, people look at Washington being dysfunctional over a shutdown or a border wall. It could be people thinking, you know, the government is corrupt that. You know, they've spied on this President. There's people within the administration that are still continuing to try to undermine this President. They could look at the Democrats and say the Democrats and the Congress and the Senate, they haven't done enough to stop the Trump agenda. It could be a whole host of things that the - you know, I'm just mad at the government. I'm not getting my check soon enough, you know, my check is not big enough. It could be everything, so we don't really know what it is. What do you think it is?"

They want roads and bridges they can drive on, so let's get a transportation and infrastructure spending bill done, so bridges aren't falling down around our country. And also let's give access to healthcare across state lines. Look, the government has been stopping this. The bureaucrats in the government, those holdovers from one administration to the other, let's make it so people can buy their health insurance across state lines so that they can be more competitive in the marketplace."

They want to be able to sell individual policies and compete against maybe one or two people in one state because once those borders are opened up across the state lines, prices are going to come down and they're going to have to compete and make less money. All right, let's turn to the media. I'm surprised the media wasn't at the top of the list for the country's biggest problems. I blame Gallup for that; maybe they didn't ask the right question.
