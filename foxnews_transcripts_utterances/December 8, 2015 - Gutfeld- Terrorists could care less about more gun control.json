That terror is but a trifle when compared to evil firearms? But as gun ownership rises, the gun homicide rate plummets by 50 percent over two decades. So that means more guns, less deaths. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But I get it: Mass shootings are truly awful. So let's say we satisfy the president and take all those guns away. Then what's left for the terrorists then? How about box cutters on a jet? Pressure cookers, car bombs, pipe bombs, Sarin gas, small explosive hidden in underwear? Bio-poisons? You see, the armies of the apocalypse hate guns, too. To them, they're inefficient for Armageddon. Guns don't kill thousands or millions at a pop. That's why gun control doesn't resonate with the terrorist or the sober realist who gets the threat. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If the president were honest with himself, he'd wish that guns were all terrorists had, for that's surmountable.
