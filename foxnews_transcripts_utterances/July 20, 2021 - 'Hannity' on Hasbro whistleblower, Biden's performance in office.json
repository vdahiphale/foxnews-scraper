      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY. It's Monday night. Tonight, we're tracking multiple developing stories. Coming up, America's two-tiered justice system, oh, it's way alive and well. A Trump supporter who entered the Capitol building during the January 6th riot assaulted to no one, destroyed no property -- yeah, serious jail time, all while last summer's are left rioters, nearly 300 of them, yeah, they are getting off scot-free even when we have videotape evidence. We'll have more on this double standard straight ahead. Also tonight, the whistle-blower now that is accusing Hasbro Toy Company of trying teach critical race theory through Hasbro Toy products. You will be stunned by the exclusive insider video that we will share with you tonight. Wait until you hear these shocking tapes. But first, it is official. Tomorrow marks six months to the day that Joe Biden was sworn into office. And unsurprisingly -- well, I can start off by saying it's been on unmitigated disaster on multiple fronts ever since. Joe Biden, let's see, the guy that cheated his way through law school, caught plagiarizing multiple speeches as a politician, of course, he coasted on Obama's coattails as vice president. But you can't fake your way through being the president of the United States, except that media mob covers for you and you're in that media mob protection program. But now, sadly, we are all suffering the consequences. So, tonight, the six-month anniversary of Joe, let's break down issue by issue and let us grade Biden's performance, shall we? First up, let's look at the hostile actor, Vladimir Putin, from the hostile regime, the country known as Russia. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden falsely accused President Trump of being too soft on Russia, even referring to Donald Trump as Putin's puppet and Biden's tough talk was apparently reserved just for Donald Trump. Well, his first six months in office, it was Joe Biden that bent over backwards to please Vladimir. It's Biden who is really Putin's puppet, likely compromised due to the three and half million that his sons, zero experience Hunter, got for his company got from the Russian oligarch, former first lady of Moscow. Imagine if that was the Trump kid. We now know that some of that money went to Joe himself. And get this: after the Russian hackers disrupted Americans most important oil and gas pipeline and other hacks that took place, Biden rewards Russia by lifting all U.S. sanctions, granting a waiver on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project from Russia into Germany, our Western European allies, all while firing high paying career jobs for those American workers on the Keystone XL pipeline right here in the U.S. Next, after another Russian hack targeted our food supply and our meat supply, Biden again reward Putin with a one-on-one summit in Europe. The so-called summit produced zero concessions from Vladimir Putin. So Biden's grade will start here for handling Russia and Putin, yeah, that would be a big fat F. No one in modern history has been weaker on Russia then Joe Biden. Now, keep in mind, Russia along with China, they're now supplying Iran with weaponry, the number one state sponsor of terror, and they are providing supplies to conduct their proxy wars and their terror campaign all around the world. That didn't stop Joe Biden from green-lighting and pressuring South Korea to hand over $7 billion of frozen assets to the Iranian mullahs. Now, this is Iran we now know is once again enriching uranium under Joe's watch at an accelerated rate. It's clearly on track to develop a nuclear weapon. That's happening on Joe's watch. Now, remember, this is the same Iranian regime that has a stated goal of wiping Israel and the United States off the face of the planet and the same Iran that chants \"death to Israel, death to America,\" and burns both our flags. The same Iranian regime that just tried to kidnap right here in our country a journalist in New York City. But instead of punishing Iran, Joe is appeasing the mullahs in Iran, even lifting sanctions in spite of these open hostilities. It looks like the Iranian mullahs own Joe Biden. So Joe gets another F as Iran is now more emboldened than ever before. And sadly, Biden's performance surrounding China, well, that might be even worse. Biden is refusing to hold China accountable in any way for the death, destruction, and damage of COVID-19. He remains pretty much silent as China is threatening our ally, Taiwan, and saying oh, yeah, there is going to be reunification. In other words, we are taking over. He can't be bothered to address -- last week, China, their hostile maneuvers in the South China Sea. He has no response to China's public threats. They are making threats against the United States and our ally Japan and our military bases and not a word from Joe. No response whatsoever. And just this week, Chinese hackers, they were responsible for another major cyberattack against the United States. But Joe Biden's response is, once again, nonexistence. Oh, that's right. The Bidens aren't just compromised by Russia and Ukraine and Kazakhstan. That's right, zero experience Hunter got a $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China and the hundred thousand dollar shopping spree for his family from a Chinese national. For these reasons, let's give Joe another well-deserved F. Domestically, Biden is also performing extraordinarily poorly. Inflation is at its highest rate in 20 years. Everything you buy, gas, food, goods, services, you are paying more every single day for every item. He gets a F on inflation. And this is a massive tax on everyone, but it especially hurts those people that live paycheck to paycheck -- the lower, middle class America. They are getting hurt the most. It impacts everything you buy. It impacts heating and cooling your homes. It impacts filling your car with gasoline, a dollar 25 more per gallon for gas, thanks to Joe. And so, another -- well, let's say, F for Joe on energy. And once again, we're energy dependent and Trump made us energy independent for the first time in 75 years, we all benefit financially and for national security reasons. And, by the way, Joe Biden's attempts to ram through the Green New Deal under the guise of human infrastructure -- I thought infrastructure was roads and bridges and tunnels. No, human infrastructure is the New Green Deal, except with a fancier name, while also raising corporate taxes. That's right, as he raises and proposes his corporate tax increase, that means cost will continue to go even further beyond inflation. Beyond the higher cost of energy being used to get products to shelves in the stores, because, yeah, those trucks that bring them there, they are all paying a fortune more. Corporations I've said many times, they don't pay taxes. They are their cut salaries, cut jobs, and then they pass the rest on we, the people, the consumers. So he gets a big fat F on the economy as well. And meanwhile, on our southern border, a major crisis is now ongoing. We have open borders. We've got kids in the middle of the pandemic and overcrowded cages. Laws are not enforced. They are facilitating lawbreaking and they are aiding and abetting in the process. And Joe lifted all of President Trump's successful border protections and all of Trump's policies, and those policies were working. And then he tasked, well, one of Washington's most incompetent politicians with solving the crisis, that would be his vice president, Kamala Harris. It's so bad we're going to give Joe Biden three F's for his handling on the border. Which brings us to an important question. Why did he put Kamala Harris in charge of the southern border? Why is Kamala Harris holding regular meetings with the secretary of state? Why is she routinely the one making and taking one-on-one calls with world leaders and hosting them in Washington, D.C.? Is there something wrong with Joe Biden? Now, keep in mind, President Trump conducted interviews, held impromptu press conferences almost every day at times with very few exceptions. Joe Biden hasn't done an interview with the American press in 68 days. That's on top of the only one that he gave previously. He averages less than one public event every workday. He goes into hiding on every weekend. His public facing time amounts to around maybe three hours a week. That's it. And during his short scripted events, he is usually reading from a teleprompter quite poorly or from a note card and still getting confused. He almost never takes questions because he claims he is going to get in trouble. He they will yell at him, his staff will be not. And still during the rare public appearances, Joe Biden struggles mightily. And he appears to be very blunt, this is objective, he appears to be getting worse almost by the day. Take a look. You decide.",

His radical socialist staff, whoever is in charge, they're promoting horrific policies -- oh, of the squad and Bernie Sanders. His vice president, frankly, seems clueless also. His administration is failing on so many fronts. As a matter of fact, what has he done well? Six months in, it's not going well. Here with reaction, two former press secretaries.

At least every sign points towards that. You want over to immigration, the images on the border today, Sean, were galling. The biggest group that FOX News had ever seen arriving on our southern border -- get this -- as Biden considers rolling back another Trump policy, Title 42, which keeps families out because of COVID health concerns.

A man in Florida, he will enter the U.S. Capitol during the January 6th riots. He carried a Trump flag. He's now been sentenced to eight months in prison after a felony conviction. According to the case, this individual did not assault anyone, did not destroy federal property, but prosecutors wanted him to serve 18 months in prison. Okay. We spoke out loudly and very clearly that can't happen ever again in this country. That can't happen ever again, ever. Meanwhile, keep in mind, nearly all the charges against those that participated in nearly, what, 300 riots last summer, violent riots, they have almost been dropped completely. According to \"The Guardian\", quote, in most of a dozen jurisdictions examined at least 90 percent of cases were dropped or dismissed. No charges for looters, no charges for those throwing bricks and rocks and bottles and Molotov cocktails at the police, nothing whatsoever despite mountains of video evidence, overwhelming, incontrovertible, that's you right here throwing that rock or lighting that fire. The riots were wrong. They were criminal. The same with January 6th. But in many cases, we were consistent in the little actually, but looters and arsonists, rioters, those attacking police and hurting police, 3,000 injured police officers from the summer's violence, they get a pass, despite the mountain of video evidence. Now, we have long condemned the January 6th riots. Can't ever happened again. And we also condemned, rightly so, the violence that was happening in our cities that the Democrats never talked about that said weren't riots, with the help of the media. Tonight, a simple question, why isn't everybody held accountable for the crimes? Are some rights different than other riots? According to the Department of Justice, according to the states, yes. Will anyone in the ever media mob, woke mob ever asked that important question? Of course not. They are too busy obsessing over baseless rumors against President Trump. But recently, that obsession has backfired on CNN's professional, well, FOX stalker, Humpty Dumpty because, you know, Tucker just played it before, we won't play it again. Here with reaction, someone who recently confronted fake new CNN head on, Florida Congressman Byron Daniels, along with nationally syndicated radio host, Dana Loesch. Good to see you both. Byron, let's talk about this with you. Now, there is a group in Congress that's called the Congressional Black Caucus, the CBC. You wanted to be a member. Okay. You're African-American.

But to your larger point there, there is a huge difference in the way that media and Democrats have treated the year-long -- the summer-long riots and arson. I mean, entire cities blocks burn. I mean, you had people claims that they were standing up for black lives but yet you had black-owned businesses that were burning, or people who claimed that they were standing up for law and order were literally engaging in massive violent lawlessness. And there were some Democrats who said that this didn't even exist. They didn't even talk about it. They said that it didn't even -- it was an idea, it wasn't something that even existed. And then, of course, trying to compare this to January 6th -- look, we've always said, as I just -- as I just mentioned, that all of that stuff, violence, it's not a protected form of speech.

That means, in other words, you don't need any vaccine. Are we trusting the signs are we going by whatever they think at any given moment? Anyway, there are people too, very rare cases, but they are out there, where people have serious underlying health conditions that can be aggravated by the vaccine. That's why it's important to research, talk to your doctor, your doctors, et cetera, and that you make the decision in conjunction with your doctor, research on your own that it is best for you. I don't know your medical history. I don't know your current medical condition. And the court so far seem to be on the side of mandates. For example, a federal judge on Monday upheld Indiana University's vaccination requirement for students despite arguments from plaintiffs that such rules violate their right to body integrity, and medical privacy. Just like we've been saying, please take COVID seriously. I can say it enough. Enough people have died. We don't need anymore death. Research like crazy. Talk to your doctor, your doctors, medical professionals that you trust based on your unique medical history, your current medical condition, and to you and your doctor make a very important decision for your own safety. Take it seriously. You also have a right to medical privacy, doctor-patient confidentiality is also important. And absolutely make sense for many Americans to get vaccinated. I believe in science, I believe in the science of vaccination. Now, there are rare exceptions. Tonight, for example, we are spotlighting a story surrounding a young when accepted to BYU Hawaii. This was her dream school, who tried to get and was refused a medical exemption because the condition despite her developing a serious medical condition after taking a vaccine in 2019, where she says she was paralyzed from the waist down for over a month before she eventually regained her ability to walk.

In the socialist likes the ones we have seen in Congress and the comments being made about the Cuban effort to get some kind of democracy going, there's a technique called deceiving, distorting, dividing, and destroying. You can see how that works in a country like Cuba. Well, the Cuban people are suffering greatly under this, and all of that is because the United States isn't doing the right thing by it. I give you the examples of what we have done in other cases and what we should have done. For example, in the Green Revolution back when Obama was president, he ignored -- that was -- might've brought about a democratic outcome in of all places, Iran. So, you're not good people like, what's her name, AOC complaining about the U.S. embargo is, quote, cruel. Well, the fact it, it's made cruel by the dictatorship in Cuba. And what you got, Sean, is in this case, hundreds of U.S. people that we've interviewed, and you and I talked thousands of them over the years, the vets who contributed to this book are deeply concerned, and they are concerned because the so called midterm 2022 elections are crucial to the fate of our republic. So if you listen to these people attacking the United States about critical race theory and about how we're going to teach our people in the military this stuff, this book is how we stop that.

      "utterance": "Welcome to HANNITY. It's Monday night. Tonight, we're tracking multiple developing stories. Coming up, America's two-tiered justice system, oh, it's way alive and well. A Trump supporter who entered the Capitol building during the January 6th riot assaulted to no one, destroyed no property -- yeah, serious jail time, all while last summer's are left rioters, nearly 300 of them, yeah, they are getting off scot-free even when we have videotape evidence. We'll have more on this double standard straight ahead. Also tonight, the whistle-blower now that is accusing Hasbro Toy Company of trying teach critical race theory through Hasbro Toy products. You will be stunned by the exclusive insider video that we will share with you tonight. Wait until you hear these shocking tapes. But first, it is official. Tomorrow marks six months to the day that Joe Biden was sworn into office. And unsurprisingly -- well, I can start off by saying it's been on unmitigated disaster on multiple fronts ever since. Joe Biden, let's see, the guy that cheated his way through law school, caught plagiarizing multiple speeches as a politician, of course, he coasted on Obama's coattails as vice president. But you can't fake your way through being the president of the United States, except that media mob covers for you and you're in that media mob protection program. But now, sadly, we are all suffering the consequences. So, tonight, the six-month anniversary of Joe, let's break down issue by issue and let us grade Biden's performance, shall we? First up, let's look at the hostile actor, Vladimir Putin, from the hostile regime, the country known as Russia. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden falsely accused President Trump of being too soft on Russia, even referring to Donald Trump as Putin's puppet and Biden's tough talk was apparently reserved just for Donald Trump. Well, his first six months in office, it was Joe Biden that bent over backwards to please Vladimir. It's Biden who is really Putin's puppet, likely compromised due to the three and half million that his sons, zero experience Hunter, got for his company got from the Russian oligarch, former first lady of Moscow. Imagine if that was the Trump kid."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "We now know that some of that money went to Joe himself. And get this",
      "utterance": "after the Russian hackers disrupted Americans most important oil and gas pipeline and other hacks that took place, Biden rewards Russia by lifting all U.S. sanctions, granting a waiver on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project from Russia into Germany, our Western European allies, all while firing high paying career jobs for those American workers on the Keystone XL pipeline right here in the U.S. Next, after another Russian hack targeted our food supply and our meat supply, Biden again reward Putin with a one-on-one summit in Europe. The so-called summit produced zero concessions from Vladimir Putin. So Biden's grade will start here for handling Russia and Putin, yeah, that would be a big fat F. No one in modern history has been weaker on Russia then Joe Biden. Now, keep in mind, Russia along with China, they're now supplying Iran with weaponry, the number one state sponsor of terror, and they are providing supplies to conduct their proxy wars and their terror campaign all around the world. That didn't stop Joe Biden from green-lighting and pressuring South Korea to hand over $7 billion of frozen assets to the Iranian mullahs. Now, this is Iran we now know is once again enriching uranium under Joe's watch at an accelerated rate. It's clearly on track to develop a nuclear weapon. That's happening on Joe's watch. Now, remember, this is the same Iranian regime that has a stated goal of wiping Israel and the United States off the face of the planet and the same Iran that chants \"death to Israel, death to America,\" and burns both our flags. The same Iranian regime that just tried to kidnap right here in our country a journalist in New York City. But instead of punishing Iran, Joe is appeasing the mullahs in Iran, even lifting sanctions in spite of these open hostilities. It looks like the Iranian mullahs own Joe Biden. So Joe gets another F as Iran is now more emboldened than ever before. And sadly, Biden's performance surrounding China, well, that might be even worse. Biden is refusing to hold China accountable in any way for the death, destruction, and damage of COVID-19. He remains pretty much silent as China is threatening our ally, Taiwan, and saying oh, yeah, there is going to be reunification. In other words, we are taking over. He can't be bothered to address -- last week, China, their hostile maneuvers in the South China Sea. He has no response to China's public threats. They are making threats against the United States and our ally Japan and our military bases and not a word from Joe. No response whatsoever. And just this week, Chinese hackers, they were responsible for another major cyberattack against the United States. But Joe Biden's response is, once again, nonexistence. Oh, that's right. The Bidens aren't just compromised by Russia and Ukraine and Kazakhstan. That's right, zero experience Hunter got a $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China and the hundred thousand dollar shopping spree for his family from a Chinese national. For these reasons, let's give Joe another well-deserved F. Domestically, Biden is also performing extraordinarily poorly. Inflation is at its highest rate in 20 years. Everything you buy, gas, food, goods, services, you are paying more every single day for every item. He gets a F on inflation. And this is a massive tax on everyone, but it especially hurts those people that live paycheck to paycheck -- the lower, middle class America. They are getting hurt the most. It impacts everything you buy. It impacts heating and cooling your homes. It impacts filling your car with gasoline, a dollar 25 more per gallon for gas, thanks to Joe. And so, another -- well, let's say, F for Joe on energy. And once again, we're energy dependent and Trump made us energy independent for the first time in 75 years, we all benefit financially and for national security reasons. And, by the way, Joe Biden's attempts to ram through the Green New Deal under the guise of human infrastructure -- I thought infrastructure was roads and bridges and tunnels. No, human infrastructure is the New Green Deal, except with a fancier name, while also raising corporate taxes. That's right, as he raises and proposes his corporate tax increase, that means cost will continue to go even further beyond inflation. Beyond the higher cost of energy being used to get products to shelves in the stores, because, yeah, those trucks that bring them there, they are all paying a fortune more. Corporations I've said many times, they don't pay taxes. They are their cut salaries, cut jobs, and then they pass the rest on we, the people, the consumers. So he gets a big fat F on the economy as well. And meanwhile, on our southern border, a major crisis is now ongoing. We have open borders. We've got kids in the middle of the pandemic and overcrowded cages. Laws are not enforced. They are facilitating lawbreaking and they are aiding and abetting in the process. And Joe lifted all of President Trump's successful border protections and all of Trump's policies, and those policies were working. And then he tasked, well, one of Washington's most incompetent politicians with solving the crisis, that would be his vice president, Kamala Harris. It's so bad we're going to give Joe Biden three F's for his handling on the border. Which brings us to an important question. Why did he put Kamala Harris in charge of the southern border? Why is Kamala Harris holding regular meetings with the secretary of state? Why is she routinely the one making and taking one-on-one calls with world leaders and hosting them in Washington, D.C.? Is there something wrong with Joe Biden? Now, keep in mind, President Trump conducted interviews, held impromptu press conferences almost every day at times with very few exceptions. Joe Biden hasn't done an interview with the American press in 68 days. That's on top of the only one that he gave previously. He averages less than one public event every workday. He goes into hiding on every weekend. His public facing time amounts to around maybe three hours a week. That's it. And during his short scripted events, he is usually reading from a teleprompter quite poorly or from a note card and still getting confused. He almost never takes questions because he claims he is going to get in trouble. He they will yell at him, his staff will be not. And still during the rare public appearances, Joe Biden struggles mightily. And he appears to be very blunt, this is objective, he appears to be getting worse almost by the day. Take a look. You decide."

And I've been watching Joe Biden in these six months, you know that's true. But you can extend it now to domestic policy. He has misinterpreted his mandate.

At least every sign points towards that. You want over to immigration, the images on the border today, Sean, were galling. The biggest group that FOX News had ever seen arriving on our southern border -- get this -- as Biden considers rolling back another Trump policy, Title 42, which keeps families out because of COVID health concerns. So, he rolls that back, you're going to see even more and more on our borders. Those are just two issues of many. Your grades were spot on. Instead of three Fs, I had F-minus on my sheet.

A man in Florida, he will enter the U.S. Capitol during the January 6th riots. He carried a Trump flag. He's now been sentenced to eight months in prison after a felony conviction. According to the case, this individual did not assault anyone, did not destroy federal property, but prosecutors wanted him to serve 18 months in prison. Okay. We spoke out loudly and very clearly that can't happen ever again in this country. That can't happen ever again, ever. Meanwhile, keep in mind, nearly all the charges against those that participated in nearly, what, 300 riots last summer, violent riots, they have almost been dropped completely. According to \"The Guardian\", quote, in most of a dozen jurisdictions examined at least 90 percent of cases were dropped or dismissed. No charges for looters, no charges for those throwing bricks and rocks and bottles and Molotov cocktails at the police, nothing whatsoever despite mountains of video evidence, overwhelming, incontrovertible, that's you right here throwing that rock or lighting that fire. The riots were wrong. They were criminal. The same with January 6th. But in many cases, we were consistent in the little actually, but looters and arsonists, rioters, those attacking police and hurting police, 3,000 injured police officers from the summer's violence, they get a pass, despite the mountain of video evidence. Now, we have long condemned the January 6th riots. Can't ever happened again. And we also condemned, rightly so, the violence that was happening in our cities that the Democrats never talked about that said weren't riots, with the help of the media. Tonight, a simple question, why isn't everybody held accountable for the crimes? Are some rights different than other riots? According to the Department of Justice, according to the states, yes. Will anyone in the ever media mob, woke mob ever asked that important question? Of course not. They are too busy obsessing over baseless rumors against President Trump. But recently, that obsession has backfired on CNN's professional, well, FOX stalker, Humpty Dumpty because, you know, Tucker just played it before, we won't play it again. Here with reaction, someone who recently confronted fake new CNN head on, Florida Congressman Byron Daniels, along with nationally syndicated radio host, Dana Loesch. Good to see you both. Byron, let's talk about this with you. Now, there is a group in Congress that's called the Congressional Black Caucus, the CBC. You wanted to be a member. Okay. You're African-American.

It doesn't matter if you're a liberal or a conservative. Black people in America should be able to have that conversation. But it speaks to a larger point. We're having a situation, especially in our media, where they don't want to have a full conversation. They want to talk to their group. They want to have a conversation focused on their ideology.

We've also been incredibly consistent and that any kind of violent, physical reaction or arson or assault, that's not a protective form of speech. And isn't that all the stuff that they said that the Tea Party was, by the way, that the Tea Party never did? But to your larger point there, there is a huge difference in the way that media and Democrats have treated the year-long -- the summer-long riots and arson. I mean, entire cities blocks burn. I mean, you had people claims that they were standing up for black lives but yet you had black-owned businesses that were burning, or people who claimed that they were standing up for law and order were literally engaging in massive violent lawlessness. And there were some Democrats who said that this didn't even exist. They didn't even talk about it. They said that it didn't even -- it was an idea, it wasn't something that even existed. And then, of course, trying to compare this to January 6th -- look, we've always said, as I just -- as I just mentioned, that all of that stuff, violence, it's not a protected form of speech. But are we going to act like there is some gravy SEALs marching up it's the Capitol acting like red dawn warpers (ph) and just trespassing, that that's the same thing as a serious crime? I mean, look, investigate. I know the DOJ is investigating. I know that Congress is investigating. I know the FBI is involved. That's fine. But what about, again, St. Louis when after -- St. Louis when St. Louis burned, or what about in Wisconsin or Portland or Seattle? It's not the same. Sean, last point -- the entire point of our republic is that everybody is equal before the law and everyone is equal beneath it when it's broken. But that's not the case anymore."

This is, you know, identity politics. Dr. Ben Carson pointed out in a new piece, quote, we cannot allow CRT to rob American children of that same hope that was instilled in me. Here with reaction, the man you saw in this video, Hasbro packing engineering, David Johnson, along with FOX News contributor Leo 2.0 Terrell. I'm not going to repeat everything that about kids that are, what, three to six months old, kids that are two and three and four and five. So, David, bring us insight here.

Straight ahead, University in Hawaii, this is fascinating, refusing to grant a student exemption from the COVID vaccine. Now, there's a reason why she can't take the vaccine. We'll explain that to you. And then later, we'll bring you a major program announcement about the show, about this week, straight ahead."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, across the country, with the approval of Joe Biden, some colleges and university are mandating that students take the vaccine, regardless of even whether or not they had natural immunity, well, Cleveland Clinic says you don't need the vaccine if you have natural immunity. That means, in other words, you don't need any vaccine. Are we trusting the signs are we going by whatever they think at any given moment? Anyway, there are people too, very rare cases, but they are out there, where people have serious underlying health conditions that can be aggravated by the vaccine. That's why it's important to research, talk to your doctor, your doctors, et cetera, and that you make the decision in conjunction with your doctor, research on your own that it is best for you. I don't know your medical history. I don't know your current medical condition. And the court so far seem to be on the side of mandates. For example, a federal judge on Monday upheld Indiana University's vaccination requirement for students despite arguments from plaintiffs that such rules violate their right to body integrity, and medical privacy. Just like we've been saying, please take COVID seriously. I can say it enough. Enough people have died. We don't need anymore death. Research like crazy. Talk to your doctor, your doctors, medical professionals that you trust based on your unique medical history, your current medical condition, and to you and your doctor make a very important decision for your own safety. Take it seriously. You also have a right to medical privacy, doctor-patient confidentiality is also important. And absolutely make sense for many Americans to get vaccinated. I believe in science, I believe in the science of vaccination. Now, there are rare exceptions. Tonight, for example, we are spotlighting a story surrounding a young when accepted to BYU Hawaii. This was her dream school, who tried to get and was refused a medical exemption because the condition despite her developing a serious medical condition after taking a vaccine in 2019, where she says she was paralyzed from the waist down for over a month before she eventually regained her ability to walk. Here is how she describes that experience."

Something that BYU Hawaii had made to seem very accessible to those in need of it. After going through the lengthy process to get this exemption, I waited three weeks to hear back from them. BYU Hawaii denied me a medical exemption. I've come to terms that will not be attending BYU Hawaii in the fall, and that is okay with me. But I don't think that this is something that should go on for generations to come."

Here now with the reaction, the woman you just saw, Olivia Sandor. And by the way, she shared her story with Turning Point USA, along with FOX News contributor, Dr. Nicole Saphier.

I was a sophomore in high school and I was paralyzed from the waist down for over a month. I went to several different hospitals and it was a long, extensive process for me. So when I found out that BYU Hawaii would be mandating this vaccine, I got together with my medical providers and we decided that would be best for me not to receive this vaccine because I do not want to relapse and have another episode of Guillain Barre. It's really not worth it to me."

      "utterance": "Well, Sean, Olivia has done everything right. Guillain Barre is a terrifying illness. It's a demyelinating (ph) polyneutropathy, which can actually leave someone paraplegic, can leave them on a breathing machine, and it can actually be fatal. I mean, people end up with PTSD afterwards because they are worried it is going to come back. And about three to 6 percent of the time it can come back. Now, it has a temporal association with vaccinations, yes, the flu vaccine, there have been some links that it may increase the risk of Guillain Barre. We know that can happen following viral infections, that's where you see it the most. And we happen to know people with Guillain Barre have relapses after COVID-19 and can actually get it from a COVID-19. So, I would say for Olivia, while I understand the impetus behind not wanting to be vaccinated, as long she is continuing to protect herself from COVID-19, whether it is masking or whatever she is doing --"

But that being said, I understand why she is not willing to get the vaccine at this point under the emergency use authorization. This is a terrifying illness that she had. She has gone this far without being infected with SARS-CoV-2, then she -- with freedom comes responsibility.

In the socialist likes the ones we have seen in Congress and the comments being made about the Cuban effort to get some kind of democracy going, there's a technique called deceiving, distorting, dividing, and destroying. You can see how that works in a country like Cuba. Well, the Cuban people are suffering greatly under this, and all of that is because the United States isn't doing the right thing by it. I give you the examples of what we have done in other cases and what we should have done. For example, in the Green Revolution back when Obama was president, he ignored -- that was -- might've brought about a democratic outcome in of all places, Iran. So, you're not good people like, what's her name, AOC complaining about the U.S. embargo is, quote, cruel. Well, the fact it, it's made cruel by the dictatorship in Cuba. And what you got, Sean, is in this case, hundreds of U.S. people that we've interviewed, and you and I talked thousands of them over the years, the vets who contributed to this book are deeply concerned, and they are concerned because the so called midterm 2022 elections are crucial to the fate of our republic. So if you listen to these people attacking the United States about critical race theory and about how we're going to teach our people in the military this stuff, this book is how we stop that.
