Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating 17 candidates. Now that he's on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama, held for more than 30 years by Republicans. Steve doesn't represent my base. He's only in it for himself. Steve pretends to be at war with the media which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was.

It's pretty extraordinary.

In every campaign or White House or even an office, there is some staffer who thinks he is the smartest guy in the room and who is the one who is truly responsible for the success of the candidate or the president even just the boss, and Bannon has now added to that rule, the role of disgruntled former employee. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And there are a lot of people after the Alabama disaster who are hoping that Steve Bannon has finally stepped in it big time, has gone too far, and will hurt himself.

It was a .gif in which is shows Mitch McConnell just on a loop smiling. Didn't say one thing. Didn't have any text, doesn't have to say anything. Why is he smiling, Amy Walter? AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": For exactly the reason that Byron brought up is all of these insurgent candidates that Bannon is supposedly responsible for, encouraging this movement now to get in and challenge the establishment, to disrupt the wing of the party built by people like the Senate majority leader, well, now that has become somewhat toxic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we have people who have been endorsed by him saying, well, you know, he's fine, everything, but I like getting endorsements from a lot of different people. In a war between Bannon and Trump, all those candidates are going to pick Trump's side. This is not like the divorce where they really feel like they have to be equal to both partners in this thing. The real question though in my mind though is whether or not this will continue beyond a few news cycles, and when we get into these primaries, the issue of the antiestablishment versus establishment, Senate majority leader and his troubles with the base and the base itself has always been -- excuse me, started before Steve Bannon. It's always been about something bigger than Steve Bannon or Donald Trump. It's been about this frustration from the base with what they see as an establishment pushing an agenda that does not align with their own agenda. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So I don't know that that part goes away. Maybe Bannon isn't the person who's encouraging these people to run, but let's also remember it's not like Bannon was bankrolling these people. He didn't have money. He didn't have an organization. It is the other folks with the money and the organizations that I'm going to be watching. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And you get this thing that comes out, and then over the course of a few hours, into in my inbox comes an \"in case you missed it\" email from the Republican National Committee and from the Senate Leadership Fund which is Mitch McConnell's group.

The chance that Don Jr. did not walk these Jumos up to his father's office on the 26th floor is zero.

He wasn't in the campaign at that time the meeting took place, but he joined in August. Did he learn something during his time in the campaign from the inside that gave him an insight into what was going on with these Russians who had come in teasing explosive information about Hillary Clinton?

He said a lot of stuff about Kared Kushner in the past, but he went after Don Jr., a blood relative, the president's eldest son, insinuated that he was part of potentially a money laundering scheme, insinuating that he was stupid, would be, as he said, cracked like an egg on live television, all sorts of things, described him as treasonous. It's pretty extraordinary. So immediately, it was very interesting because normally when Bannon does something foolish, his allies quickly create an echo chamber of no, everything is great, et cetera, et cetera. We heard none of that today. It was complete silence, and the reason was they didn't think it was brilliant strategic thinking from the former chief strategist."

      "utterance": "This was in the wild west days of the Trump White House when there was all sorts of crazy access being gotten. And Bannon has said a lot of things in different interviews. He said a lot of stuff in a recent Vanity Fair interview. I think one of the keywords in the president's statement was the word \"staffer,\" which is the president's way of downplaying Steve Bannon's role. In every campaign or White House or even an office, there is some staffer who thinks he is the smartest guy in the room and who is the one who is truly responsible for the success of the candidate or the president even just the boss, and Bannon has now added to that rule, the role of disgruntled former employee. And there are a lot of people after the Alabama disaster who are hoping that Steve Bannon has finally stepped in it big time, has gone too far, and will hurt himself. And we are seeing I think some of the effects even now at some of the races where some candidates like Kelli Ward in Arizona are now saying, they are not quite saying who is Steve Bannon, but they are distancing themselves from him."

      "utterance": "What was amazing was when the statement came out from the president, which President Obama was essentially a blowtorch, there was one tweet from the Senate majority's office, one tweet, and here it is. It was a .gif in which is shows Mitch McConnell just on a loop smiling. Didn't say one thing. Didn't have any text, doesn't have to say anything. Why is he smiling, Amy Walter? AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": For exactly the reason that Byron brought up is all of these insurgent candidates that Bannon is supposedly responsible for, encouraging this movement now to get in and challenge the establishment, to disrupt the wing of the party built by people like the Senate majority leader, well, now that has become somewhat toxic. And we have people who have been endorsed by him saying, well, you know, he's fine, everything, but I like getting endorsements from a lot of different people. In a war between Bannon and Trump, all those candidates are going to pick Trump's side. This is not like the divorce where they really feel like they have to be equal to both partners in this thing. The real question though in my mind though is whether or not this will continue beyond a few news cycles, and when we get into these primaries, the issue of the antiestablishment versus establishment, Senate majority leader and his troubles with the base and the base itself has always been -- excuse me, started before Steve Bannon. It's always been about something bigger than Steve Bannon or Donald Trump. It's been about this frustration from the base with what they see as an establishment pushing an agenda that does not align with their own agenda. So I don't know that that part goes away. Maybe Bannon isn't the person who's encouraging these people to run, but let's also remember it's not like Bannon was bankrolling these people. He didn't have money. He didn't have an organization. It is the other folks with the money and the organizations that I'm going to be watching."

      "utterance": "That's what struck me today. The White House puts out this blistering statement that sounds very much like it was dictated by the man himself, just the verbiage of it. And you get this thing that comes out, and then over the course of a few hours, into in my inbox comes an \"in case you missed it\" email from the Republican National Committee and from the Senate Leadership Fund which is Mitch McConnell's group. So you've got the entire Republican Party at war with Steve Bannon, led by the president himself. And I think the trouble for Bannon here is his entire persona is that of a kingmaker. That's how he fancied himself after the Trump victory. And he tried to crown Roy Moore, which was a total disaster for the party, losing an un-losable seat, and how he has tried to shiv the king, thinking that maybe people will be loyal to him. No, in this analogy they are loyal to the king, who is President Trump."

Here's the quote. \"Even if you thought that this was not treasonous or unpatriotic or bad, and I happen to think it is all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately. The chance that Don Jr. did not walk these Jumos up to his father's office on the 26th floor is zero. They are going to crack Don Jr. like an egg on national TV.\" Is that problematic, and does that somehow become part of the Mueller investigation or Congressional investigations on Capitol Hill?"

    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "He gets points for \"Jumos.\" That was good. But I think this buys him a lot of trouble on Capitol Hill because we have heard today already lawmakers who are leading the Congressional investigations, there are basically three fairly big ones, two intelligence committees and House and Senate plus the Senate Judiciary Committee, and they are going to want to hear him say why he has characterized Don Trump Jr.'s behavior as treasonous. He wasn't in the campaign at that time the meeting took place, but he joined in August. Did he learn something during his time in the campaign from the inside that gave him an insight into what was going on with these Russians who had come in teasing explosive information about Hillary Clinton? This is going to earn Bannon a lot of trouble. He has said several times he doesn't have a lawyer, he has no interest in all this stuff. He has an interest in it now."

Remember when this was supposed to be these next couple weeks are about, is the government going to stay open?

He implicated the president in that quote, saying there is a zero percent chance that that Russia quote-unquote collusion meeting did not make it to Trump's office. To me that is the most oxygen that has provided to the Democratic narrative on the Russia story maybe ever, and it comes from Steve Bannon. That's like Maxine Waters level stuff with treason. It's coming from Steve Bannon, you catch your breath. Never a dull moment here."
