As Fox reported last week, he privately told colleagues, he seen evidence of FISA abuse by FBI and Justice Department officials.

From speaking with both Republicans and Democrat Senators, it feels like most are looking for a way out from a government shutdown in the hours ahead.

I mean, after all, there's a bill on the floor that would fund the government for another month, and it would also will fund health insurance for poor kids for the next six years. And the Democrats are saying they're going to reject that bill because they not only want amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants, but they also don't want to take steps to secure our border and stop future flows of illegal immigration and unskilled immigrants as well. I just don't think that some guys are going to fly with the American people."

      "speaker": "COTTON",

You, know, Joe Manchin from West Virginia, Joe Donelly from Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota, I can just tell you there are lot of other Democrats who have to face the voters in 10 months. And they don't want to shut down the government and deprive American citizens of government services to include health insurance for poor kids because they don't get an amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.

Did you pull -- did you pull the president away from the deal that Durbin and Graham thought they had with them?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "No, I didn't speak to Donald Trump that morning until we all walked into the Oval Office. You know, look, the president campaigned on a number of issues but there's no issue that was more fundamental to his victory than immigration. And controlling our borders and getting an illegal immigration policy that works for the American working man and women. That helps create new jobs for them and helps get them wage increases. That's been the president's flat form for two and a half years now. So, it's one thing to get a bill pitched to you on the telephone, it's another thing to start looking at the particulars. So, I think, what happened that morning is the president realized that he will being sold a bill of goods, and he took firm stand that he's not going to have amnesty for illegal immigrants without ensuring that we securing our borders and that we stop future illegal immigration. And then, we begin this shift for the merit by system."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I understand that, but he is made it pretty clear that he loves the Dreamers, that he thinks they're great kids and that he wants to find a solution for them to stay here. So, I guess, you know, what are you willing to give on the other side? You know, to find some middle ground on that. If you guys have given in on allowing them to stay, which is a concession on the Republican side, you know, what do you think Democrats will put in that pot to make this happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, that's exactly right. That's amazing thing about where we are tonight. Is that the president and most Republicans in Congress have said, we're willing to give legal protections to hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants here through no fault of their own. The Democrats now need to come to the table and be willing to offer concessions to secure our border and stop extended family reunification and begin to move towards a merit-based immigration system. That's what we really talking about here because most Republicans agree with the Democrats that we should give legal protections to the persons that have a DACA work permit. The Democrats are refusing to give anything else to returning the will and shut down the government over."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, just one last question (INAUDIBLE). There were some polls done and people who responded to them said, you know that if there was a shutdown they would blame Republicans. But then, when they were asked if there was a shutdown and it was over DACA, who would you blame? And more of them said, Democrats. Do you think that notion has started to sink in tonight with Democrats?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "I think if probably has, Martha. Because it's clear that if we have a shutdown of the government tonight, which I hope that we will not. It will be because the Democrats are unwilling to vote for the spending bill and give seven more weeks before we reach our deadline for a deal on a DACA program. And that's give me very clear for Democrats still a bust to spending bill or don't accept some other reasonable compromise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You got. So, as we watch and wait, and see what is going down there about the spending bill. There is another big story that is brewing on Capitol Hill. The quote, \"shocking and alarming memo,\" detailing government surveillance is sending shockwaves through Washington. Republicans claim the classified document reveals proof of political biased at the FBI and the Department of Justice under President Obama. And it may have massive implications on the Trump-Russia probe as well. Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry, live at the White House as there are growing calls tonight for Congress to declassify this monument, it's all over Twitter. And it is making -- they want them to make these findings public so that everybody at home as well can take a look at them. Good evening, Ed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "That's right. Good evening, Martha. In fact, some Republicans tonight are calling it worse than Watergate. Another congressman, in fact, comparing it to KGB activity inside the old Soviet Union. Which is ironic, of course, because this whole investigation started out as a probe as to whether there was Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Instead, it is morphing into allegations that there was corruption inside the Obama administration, instead. Bottom line is more than 115 House Republicans have seen a four-page memo laying out evidence of what's called FISA abuse by the Obama administration. Congressman Mark Meadows said it was so shocking, he wishes he had not read it because he could not believe it happened in this country. Congressman Scott Perry, says he literally wondered if this happened in America or as I noted a moment ago, in the Soviet Union. These lawmakers say, they can't spell out exactly what's in the memo because it includes some classified info. But, pressure building tonight for that memo to be made public. You noted it \"#ReleaseTheMemo,\" trending on social media. Here's what we do know about the memos, authored by House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes of California. As Fox reported last week, he privately told colleagues, he seen evidence of FISA abuse by FBI and Justice Department officials. Other lawmakers who have seen this memo have told us Nunes was referring to Obama officials using unverified information from that dossier put together by Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and a former British spy Christopher Steele. Remember, last night we reveal that Simpson testified that Obama Justice Department hold over Bruce Ohr, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS asked Simpson to turn over information to the Obama Justice Department. That led Republicans who have seen the memo to declare that Ohr and other top justice officials like Rod Rosenstein, may lose their jobs for letting that info be used to get FISA warrants. Listen."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Now, one former Trump advisor believe to have been under surveillance Carter Page, lashing out at Glenn Simpson for testifying. That Page was targeted by Russians because he was quote, \"greedy and lonely\". Page, telling Fox cor., \"Hopefully if Congress does the right thing and decides to #ReleaseTheMemo, America might soon learn some real facts about the illegal U.S. government propaganda campaign intended to obstruct justice and rig the 2016 election.\" Now, we should note the top Democrat on the House Intel Panel Adam Schiff, says this memo is misleading and that is they're trying to distract attention from the Trump investigation. But the bottom line is that Devin Nunes, could hold a vote within the Intel Committee and with a simple majority, he could push to have this memo released to the public. And as long as President Trump does not object within five days, it would made public, Martha."

But mostly we want the American people to understand what the FBI did, how wrong it was. And again, we're not allowed to talk about it. But the last put we have made is right on target that committee can meet today, can meet tomorrow. And from majority of the committee votes to release this, it goes to the White House. The White House can say, thumbs up or thumbs down. My guess is they're going to say thumbs up, and then it's out there.

Congressman Meadows and I, and others said, make Congress -- make this available to Congress, so we can see it. And then, we think once we see it that there will be such a demand and such an outcry for this to go public -- that it will go public. So, I think that's building."

Remember the text message where they said, \"Walking through Walmart, I can smell the Trump supporters.\" The derision they have for people who supported. The anti-Trump biased, the pro-Clinton biased, and then, think about the text message that talks about an insurance policy, to make sure Donald Trump is not elected by the American people.

If you go against the intelligence committee, they have six ways of someday they getting back at you. So, we know that's take what was in make, we know the unmasking was done, and what do we also know? To date, not one bit of evidence which shows any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election. But what we do know is the Clinton campaign paid the law firm, who paid Fusion, who paid Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier. And Christopher Steele did what? Paid Russians for that information to accomplish what goal? Influence the election, that's the great irony here. So, those are things we do know when this memo goes public, I think it will provide an even bigger and better picture for the American people to see how the FBI did what they did and how wrong it was."

You have to give them credit where credit is do, it's a politically smart move for them if they think that Republicans are going to get blamed. I think the president has done a really good job, especially in the last 48 hours to prove that he is working hard to keep the government open. So, if does shut down, there is a reason it's called the Schumer shutdown. The only person who could really shut this down by himself is Chuck Schumer. How long could it go? I don't think it goes very long. Martha, there is really no benefit to either side to make the military go to work, which they will. The government -- most of the government stays open, people just don't get paid. So, the military will use to be at work. Folks who are fighting the fires out west will stay at work. The borders still secured but we're asking those people to work with no pay. And that's not fair and you would hope that the Democrats would remember what they said in 2013, and not close the government down."

When people look to 2018, and that you know, you can -- you can chime in on the successes for me because there's long list of them. However, what are your concerns as you look towards 2018?"

But, with Apple making the announcements they've had, all of this companies giving the announcements about giving raises and giving bonuses. All the investment, the important -- the long-term stuff. The stuff that we said would happen under the tax bill I terms of money coming back into the country, new money coming into the country. Businesses reinvesting in themselves, those are tremendous success stories. The stock market is another success story. So, I think, what we've done is sort of raised the bar. We had great 2017. So, if I have any concerns, it's probably not the right word. If I had concerns about 2018, it's how do we keep it going?"

Yes, it's not baked in the stock market numbers, you're not seeing at the GDP is the impact of the business decisions now the tax law has kicked in. You saw a little bit in that first, you know, couple of days after the tax bill passed, you saw those businesses give the raises and the bonuses and so forth. But it's going to take some time for businesses to say, \"You know what, I want to build a new factory\" or \"I'm going to move to the United States.\" So, I do think it is sustainable. Importantly, we've not talked yet about the change in the regulatory climate. This is a structural long-term change of the economy. So, we're not just giving the economy a sugar high, it's not a stimulus. We are fundamentally changing the way that we do business in United States, to make it easier to the business in United States. I think we'll reap benefits in that for a long period of time."

And I think one of the reasons that I wanted to write a book was because there're so many of these instances that occurred and I think people just saw one end of the camera or a New York Times reporter or political reporter or some false CNN story. What I wanted to do is walk back through the campaign, the transition, and say this is actually what I was going through at that time, and hopefully shed some light on things that people didn't see through the media's slanted lens."

Not fully understanding that we had a non-traditional president. And so, a lot of the norms and practices weren't what he was about. He campaigned and he said to the American people I'm going to bring change.

There was so much new. And there were so many personalities and so many things that we wanted to get done in a huge establishment that we're fighting. Never mind a just furiously negative media corp. So, I think it's tough to look back and say -- yeah, sure, there's a lot of things that if I knew now, we could have done differently. But I think that, you know, even in Sarah's case she's just doing an absolutely bang up job. But I think she had the ability to look at a lot of the things that I probably could have done better or do differently. And I think has embraced the role and taking it to another level."

      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "That's, obviously, up to the president to decide. But I think that the communications operation right now under Sarah and Mercedes Schlapp and Hope is doing a really good job. They're communicating as with evidence with the tax bill. They did a really, really good job. They've done a fantastic job of branding this as Schumer shutdown and making sure people understood what the president is fighting for and what the president's priority are in terms of the American people. So, I would say keep going with what you got. It's working really well. At the end of the day, I will let the president make the decision about what kind of counsel he's going to keep."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So coming up -- we're going to a break here, guys? So breaking tonight on Capitol Hill, Fox News catching Senator Lindsey Graham just going into senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer's office as the deadline inches closer to a government shutdown, so what are the Democrats doing? How is this being held up on the hill right now? DNC chair, Tom Perez, weighs in next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So everybody is on edge tonight. We have just learned that the senate Democratic caucus will meet at 8:30, the Democrats is essentially holding the budget hostage until they get what they want on DACA. They have said that they will not do a deal unless they get that, and they blame the Republicans if the government shuts down at midnight tonight."

      "speaker": "UNINDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "Republicans control the U.S. senate. They control the U.S. house. And a Republican is in the White House. Please do not shut the government down."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Tom Perez is chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Tom, welcome. Good to have you here tonight. So, you've heard the set up. The suggestion is that from your side that they have all of this control, they ought to be able to keep it open. But we know that they need 60 votes in the senate, they only have 51 Republicans in the senate, so they can't do it without Democrats."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM PEREZ, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, this is unprecedented. There's never been a government shutdown when one party has control the White House, the senate and the house."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "But they don't have 50 votes for the house bill and the senate right now --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "So there's 60 and 50 is not relevant. And, you know, the thing that is so frustrating to me is there was a bipartisan deal that Senators Graham and Durbin have negotiated. And if you brought a clean DACA bill up in front of the house and in front of the senate, it would pass comfortably because the overwhelming percentage of the American people support it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But that's not what we're hearing. What we're hearing is what happened on Thursday that they had, sort of, the sketches of a deal between Graham and Durbin. But then -- we've just talked to Senator Cotton about this a little while ago. Then when they all got back in the room both sides, sort of, has gotten some heat from their base that they were not getting enough. Senator Durbin was pushing for the temporary status of various countries to be reinstituted, and that backed everybody back into their corners. But the question is, does this deal tonight has only a couple of things in it? It funds the government and it also allows for the children's health program to go forward for 6 months. What don't you like in that deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "As the defense department said today, we can't be governing by one week at a time. And when you look at all of the other issues --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But what don't you like in the deal that's on the table that the house passed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "What I don't like is the fact that it doesn't deal with the issues of relief for people who are victims of hurricanes. It doesn't deal with the opioid epidemic. It doesn't deal with huge issues --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So it's not about DACA? It's about those other things?"
    },

      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "It's about DACA and it's about many other things. And it's about the fact --"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But everyone's been told that it's about DACA, that they want DACA in or that's it. No deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "DACA is a very important part of this, but the failure of the Republican White House, the Republican senate and the Republican house to fund the government when they have --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But they can't fund the government. They said we can fund the government and we're going to do it with the children's health program and we're going to keep going."
    },

      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "You know what? And then in a week you have another impasse. And then, in a week later you have another impasse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But it sounds to me like you guys are throwing more stuff in the pot. Now you're talking about opioid -- you're talking about parody, right? So you're saying if you're going to get the defense spending we want more domestic spending. And I think that might have been what Senator Schumer did when he went into the White House today, because they said he started to throw a lot more issues --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "Democrats position throughout because we care about making sure --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So there was no deal then between Graham and Durbin that was done in (INAUDIBLE)"

      "utterance": "Do you want a deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "I absolutely want a deal. But you know what? Last May, if you look at May 2nd on the president's twitter account, he said a government shutdown would be a good thing. That's what President Trump said last year. Well, you know what? He shouldn't have said that last year because it was reckless. And the problem is --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Why is it not reckless now? He's saying he doesn't want a shutdown. Republicans say they don't want a shutdown. And you're saying it would be reckless to have a shutdown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "No, I'm saying the ball is completely in the Republican's court to avoid a shutdown. You simply --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "OK. But the house passed the bill, right? They pass this continuing resolution including the chip program. The senate has that bill. The White House said they'd sign that bill. We can't get that --"
    },

      "speaker": "PEREZ",

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "This is about DACA."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this because there's a lot of federal workers, lot of military folks who hear that, and they say -- so you're saying that we can't continue paying us, all those federal workers out there, because you want to hold the deal up in order to cover people who are here illegally?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "No."
    },

      "speaker": "PEREZ",
      "utterance": "We want to make sure that we pass the budget that addresses all of the functions and responsibilities of government, including making sure that we are providing adequate funding for opioid addiction, making sure that we provide adequate funding for people who are victims of hurricanes. Making sure we have funding for dreamers. That's what we need to do."

      "utterance": "So the last time they passed a budget on time, Donald Trump was married to Marla Maples, Oprah has just started her book club, Bill Clinton became the first Democrat to win the presidency twice, Hillary was wrapped up in Whitewater and testifying before a Grand Jury, and the Macarena was sweeping dance floors across the nation. Those were the days, right? That is our story for tonight from D.C. Stay tune for all of the breaking coverage of the shutdown. Tucker is up next.
