      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Things are moving fast. But think back if you still can to 10 years ago, what were Democrats saying about abortion at that time? A decade ago? Well, they said they believed in Roe versus Wade. They said that abortion was never preferable, but it ought to be legal for the first trimester of pregnancy. They were not, they often told, as pro-abortion, they were pro-choice. And a lot of voters, by the way, I agreed with them. You might not like it. But according to the polls, that was a mainstream position. But that's not where Democratic leader are today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Party's new position is the more abortion, the better. Abortion must be available for any reason at all up until the moment of birth. As an op- ed in the \"New York Times\" this morning, put it quote, \"Pregnancy kills, abortion and save lives.\" In other words, it's better to abort a pregnancy than to bring it to term. That's their view. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How many voters agree with that? Almost none. Most people find it disgusting. Just as most people according to polls, don't think taxpayers ought to be forced to pay for abortion.

It hurts a woman physically, emotionally. And so we need to stop the violence. Mollie did a great job talking about this being a Human Rights issue. The question I had yesterday for this woman and for the presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar that was there was, \"Will you draw line anywhere? When do you acknowledge human life?\" So far, they haven't answered that. I hope they will soon. But most Americans do not support abortion through all nine months like they do. They understand maybe at a heartbeat, maybe at pain capable at 20 weeks, but they're not like this. And that's a good thing.

And he says, in his defense, he was tweeting today, basically, \"I was owed that because I was his lawyer.\" And then you say, \"Well, then why did you have to forge her name? And then why then, did you tell her according to the criminal indictment from the Southern District, why did you tell her that the publisher refused to pay?\" He is lying to her. He is lying to everyone to divert the money, but his defense, I was owed it.\" And that's just one of the small things. I mean, when you look through the whole thing with Nike, he extorted Nike, he waited until earnings period. This is all alleged, and according to what the Southern District is saying the Feds are saying, but they claim that he waited until Nike's earnings period when they would be most vulnerable. And then he said, \"You have done wrong. And I am going to have a press conference, if you don't hire me right now to audit your company for $20 million. And I'll be your internal counsel to audit your company and see,\" or the caveat was, \"You can just give me $22 million, and I'll be quiet and go away.\" Now, this is all in the paperwork that came out today that we read, and he is tweeting back in his defense, I will be exonerated. I was owed this money and all of these different cases. All told, he could go to jail for 404 years.

He filed for bankruptcy. He lied in that proceeding -- all alleged, again, alleged, but this is a lot of piling on in California, in New York, all over the place. And it kind of hits on two themes that our viewers love here. Number one, is hypocrisy. And that's what you really put out there when you had that interview with him where he is standing there holier than thou, filled with sanctimony saying, \"This person broke the law. This person is immoral. I'm standing up for what's right and the law and this and that.\" And here, he according to these officials and these law enforcement officers, he is one of the biggest criminals and predators out there according to what they're saying. The other thing that I think is really interesting that your viewers love is the irony because you've got to think that he was doing this for a long time and when there are many clients he is accused of defrauding and he spent the money on Ferraris they say, and on a private plane, they say. So he was living the lifestyle and defrauding people who were being paid for legitimate things. But he didn't get caught until he went all over television.",

JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, \"THE HILL\": I think you're seeing a pattern here, Tucker. I remember back in January, the term \"manufactured crisis\" was used to talk about what was going on at the U.S. southern border. And then you heard over and over dozens upon dozens of times, and not just from one network, but different networks, different anchors, or pundits, or guests using that same exact term to the word, \"manufactured crisis.\" Now, sure enough, as we know, and even the \"New York Times\" admits, it's no longer a manufactured crisis at the border. That's a real thing. Story for another time. And then we had that the other crisis, which was the \"constitutional crisis,\" and that was two weeks ago, when Bill Barr after he testified in front of the Senate decided not to do so with the House when they changed the rules around as far as staffers being able to question him, which had never happened in Congress before, and he said, \"This is going to be a circus. No, thanks. I'm not going to show up.\" So that became a constitutional crisis. And Pelosi says that as well, and sure enough, the Media Research Center -- and I get their conservative -- but the numbers here are usually accurate. They found that between May 8th and May 12th that on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC that that exact term, \"constitutional crisis\" was uttered 386 times. I'm not very good at Math, but I'm pretty sure that's more than 70 times if you average it out per network. So yes, it goes out one mouth, it comes out another mouth. And now here we are with cover up and that will be the next new constitutional crisis as far as terms that we hear over and over again, as if it's an echo chamber.",

They said that abortion was never preferable, but it ought to be legal for the first trimester of pregnancy. They were not, they often told, as pro-abortion, they were pro-choice. And a lot of voters, by the way, I agreed with them. You might not like it. But according to the polls, that was a mainstream position. But that's not where Democratic leader are today. The Party's new position is the more abortion, the better. Abortion must be available for any reason at all up until the moment of birth. As an op- ed in the \"New York Times\" this morning, put it quote, \"Pregnancy kills, abortion and save lives.\" In other words, it's better to abort a pregnancy than to bring it to term. That's their view. How many voters agree with that? Almost none. Most people find it disgusting. Just as most people according to polls, don't think taxpayers ought to be forced to pay for abortion.

And I asked the girls of that group of eighth graders, \"How many of you girls think that government should be telling us, women, when and if we want to have babies?\" Not a single one of them raised their hands. And then the boys who were there among the 60, I said, \"You know, it's kind of hard for a woman to get pregnant without you guys.\" They got it. \"How many of you boys think that the government should be telling girls and women when and if we're going to have babies?\" And not a single one of them raised their hand."

But he is fervently committed to abortion. So committed to it that if elected, Cory Booker has promised to create something called the White House Office of Reproductive Freedom. The only point of the office would be to ensure that we have enough abortions in this country. Cory Booker believes that abortions are a vital strategic resource like oil or uranium. It'll be interesting to know why Cory Booker believes that. Like most of the Democratic candidates, he refuses to come on the show, so we can't ask him directly. But we'd love to know what he makes, for example of the abortion rate in black America. African-American women are five times as likely to get abortions as white women in the United States. What does Cory Booker, think of that? Is it something to celebrate? Should we be fighting to get the abortion rate even higher? What about sex selective abortions, they are common? Are they morally okay? Would it be all right to abort a pregnancy if you thought the child was going to grow up to be gay? Or short? Or prematurely bald? Thanks to genetic testing, those may soon be real questions. Is there any abortion under any circumstances that's ever bad? Or even a little bad? Or are they all morally neutral? No matter what the cause or stage of pregnancy? Those are the most basic questions about abortion. Nobody on the other channel ever asks them. That's a shame. The answers would be fascinating.

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a difficult situation for Democrats who are running for office because they are beholden to an abortion lobby that requires them to have increasingly extreme positions. And so you're seeing this, just as you pointed out, 10 years ago, you might hear something like abortion should be safe, legal and rare. And now the approved position that Democrats have to take if they want to have a good chance of winning a primary is that it should, you know, abortions can take place, anytime, anywhere, and the taxpayers should fund it. It is a radical shift from what we've seen, and it is far outside of the mainstream of American thought. But it is not far outside the mainstream of the media's thinking. And the media increasingly control our discourse. And of course, they have been overwhelmingly supportive of abortion going back decades. David Shaw at the \"Los Angeles Times\" did a study of this in 1990, showing that something like 80 percent to 90 percent of people in the media supported abortion. And that is far outside of what the average American, you know, thinks on these issues. But our newsrooms do not seem to care about matching American opinion or even reflecting it honestly. And you see that the same euphemisms that Democrats use as they're running for office, or the euphemisms used by the media. You know, we say reproductive rights or whether women have the -- can decide about whether to have children, that's great, because we don't want to talk about what we're actually discussing here, which is whether or not it should be legal to end a human life after it has begun, you know, two months later, four months later, nine months later, and now you're even seeing the certain wings in the Democratic Party saying that even if a child survives abortion, she should be allowed to be left to die and not receive any protection. This is a radical shift in opinion."

That there's something sad, uncomfortable, depressing, and maybe even wrong about abortion?"

      "utterance": "No, it's again, it's a difficult situation for them to be in because they're not allowed to have that position given how much support comes to them from Planned Parenthood, NARAL and other fairly radical abortion rights groups. But what's sad about that is there are a lot of Democrats who are pro-life. There are a lot of people who -- Joe Biden himself used to be pro-life and did not have a voice in that party. It is not good for the party, but it's also not good for the general human rights cause of protecting life and protecting women and making sure that women with children are not, you know, treated as if they should be ending the lives of their children or not getting the support they need. It's important that there be a caucus in both parties for this important -- this most important Civil Rights issue of our time."

Would we tell him he shouldn't be here right now?\" No, we value all lives. The other side of the sign though said \"Love them both.\" And that was a really winsome message. There were even some pro-abortion women who came over had nice things to say about that. And my shirt said, \"Women's rights begin in the womb,\" because they do.

We welcome you. This woman, this poor woman, we want her to come and get healing and not be so angry. But instead she has to double down. And the sad part is she was probably lied to, Tucker. She was really lied to her about her options. She was probably lied to about the so-called need for this. She thinks abortion is empowering for women. It's not. That's what Live Action has been educating on. And we're now training people through an Ambassador's Program to get involved, to share a message because that's how you change hearts and minds. You step into the fray. And that's what I did yesterday, just showing up with a sign to start a conversation, but we need to have it. We can't just yell at each other and the pro-life movement is going to remain peaceful and loving and non- violent until we see this thing through to the end."

      "utterance": "No, I mean, you saw Representative Sims a couple of weeks ago attack pro-life sidewalk counselors, Live Action and other leaders who went up to Philadelphia to say \"Knock it off. Resign. Stop bullying us.\" This increased hostility is concerning. But look, violence begets violence. Abortion is a violent act in and of its nature. It dismembers a child in the womb. It hurts a woman physically, emotionally. And so we need to stop the violence. Mollie did a great job talking about this being a Human Rights issue. The question I had yesterday for this woman and for the presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar that was there was, \"Will you draw line anywhere? When do you acknowledge human life?\" So far, they haven't answered that. I hope they will soon. But most Americans do not support abortion through all nine months like they do. They understand maybe at a heartbeat, maybe at pain capable at 20 weeks, but they're not like this. And that's a good thing. We're going to continue educating so that that momentum continues."

According to the indictment, CPL forged her signature on a letter and then used it to steal her book advance. He blew that on hotels, restaurants, and things like that. All the while, Stormy Daniels worked in strip clubs to pay her bills, the creepy porn lawyer lived luxuriously on her misfortune. Is anyone outside of cable news surprised by this? Melissa Francis cohosts \"Outnumbered\" on this network. She's a friend of ours. And she joins us tonight. Melissa, I know you are not surprised by this. But like the whole primetime lineup in a bunch of other channels must have their jaws open. They wanted him to be President."

And you ran through the details very well, especially looking back at that interview and what you said in him saying, \"Oh, no, I wasn't exploiting her.\" It turns out, right that he was forging her name to divert funds that were coming to her for her book deal, and putting them in his account. And he says, in his defense, he was tweeting today, basically, \"I was owed that because I was his lawyer.\" And then you say, \"Well, then why did you have to forge her name? And then why then, did you tell her according to the criminal indictment from the Southern District, why did you tell her that the publisher refused to pay?\" He is lying to her. He is lying to everyone to divert the money, but his defense, I was owed it.\" And that's just one of the small things. I mean, when you look through the whole thing with Nike, he extorted Nike, he waited until earnings period. This is all alleged, and according to what the Southern District is saying the Feds are saying, but they claim that he waited until Nike's earnings period when they would be most vulnerable. And then he said, \"You have done wrong. And I am going to have a press conference, if you don't hire me right now to audit your company for $20 million. And I'll be your internal counsel to audit your company and see,\" or the caveat was, \"You can just give me $22 million, and I'll be quiet and go away.\" Now, this is all in the paperwork that came out today that we read, and he is tweeting back in his defense, I will be exonerated. I was owed this money and all of these different cases. All told, he could go to jail for 404 years. And in my book, it's really not enough for everything that he did. I mean, he also had bank fraud, wire fraud. He filed for bankruptcy. He lied in that proceeding -- all alleged, again, alleged, but this is a lot of piling on in California, in New York, all over the place. And it kind of hits on two themes that our viewers love here. Number one, is hypocrisy. And that's what you really put out there when you had that interview with him where he is standing there holier than thou, filled with sanctimony saying, \"This person broke the law. This person is immoral. I'm standing up for what's right and the law and this and that.\" And here, he according to these officials and these law enforcement officers, he is one of the biggest criminals and predators out there according to what they're saying. The other thing that I think is really interesting that your viewers love is the irony because you've got to think that he was doing this for a long time and when there are many clients he is accused of defrauding and he spent the money on Ferraris they say, and on a private plane, they say. So he was living the lifestyle and defrauding people who were being paid for legitimate things. But he didn't get caught until he went all over television."

Or did once again the Speaker of the House, deliver the talking point that everyone in cable news eagerly took up and repeated? JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, \"THE HILL\": I think you're seeing a pattern here, Tucker. I remember back in January, the term \"manufactured crisis\" was used to talk about what was going on at the U.S. southern border. And then you heard over and over dozens upon dozens of times, and not just from one network, but different networks, different anchors, or pundits, or guests using that same exact term to the word, \"manufactured crisis.\" Now, sure enough, as we know, and even the \"New York Times\" admits, it's no longer a manufactured crisis at the border. That's a real thing. Story for another time. And then we had that the other crisis, which was the \"constitutional crisis,\" and that was two weeks ago, when Bill Barr after he testified in front of the Senate decided not to do so with the House when they changed the rules around as far as staffers being able to question him, which had never happened in Congress before, and he said, \"This is going to be a circus. No, thanks. I'm not going to show up.\" So that became a constitutional crisis. And Pelosi says that as well, and sure enough, the Media Research Center -- and I get their conservative -- but the numbers here are usually accurate. They found that between May 8th and May 12th that on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC that that exact term, \"constitutional crisis\" was uttered 386 times. I'm not very good at Math, but I'm pretty sure that's more than 70 times if you average it out per network. So yes, it goes out one mouth, it comes out another mouth. And now here we are with cover up and that will be the next new constitutional crisis as far as terms that we hear over and over again, as if it's an echo chamber."

So the challenge that we've got is we actually can't compare apples to apples, and the policies that she is pushing have to do with equal pay for equal work. So not we just pay women more because they're women, it's we pay them in the exact same job as a man the same amount as a male counterpart. So the whole premise."

And so the quickest, easiest way to build up your social media traction is to attack their President. And that's why so many of their commenters got into the habit of attacking the President because it was good for their social media brand. And I think that Bob Iger and James Pitaro have figured out your social media brand doesn't help our television ratings, our television network or the perception of our television network, and the satisfaction of sports fans, and they've told their employees to cut it out.

It does not please sports fans."

Well, most of them -- I am not -- but most of them are now. They're represented by agents. And agents like to go in and argue with executives and TV networks, \"Look how well my employee is doing. Look at his Twitter following. Look at her IG following. My god, you must pay them more.\" And ESPN -- I am telling you, they used to have those conversations and used to pay people based off their social media following and it took them years to figure out that's a whole different group, a whole different audience than sports fans."
