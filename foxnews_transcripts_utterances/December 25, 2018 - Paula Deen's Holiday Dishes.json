      "utterance": " Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans. Using an electric mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt in another bowl. Add flour mixture alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture, beginning and ending with flour. Add vanilla and mix well. Divide batter into thirds. Pour one third into each of the two prepared pans. To the remaining one third of batter, add the spice layer ingredients, folding in well. Pour into the remaining prepared pan. Bake all layers 25 to 30 minutes. Cool layers in pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. To prepare the filling and topping, stir together sugar and cornstarch in a medium saucepan. Add water, pineapple, coconut, and lemon juice and zest. Stir together and cook over medium heat until thick enough to spread onto cake layers. Remove from heat; stir in cherries, and allow to cool slightly. To assemble cake, stack one plain layer, top with a thin layer of filling; add spice layer and more filling. Top with remaining plain layer. Spread remaining filling over the top and sides of cake.

      "utterance": " You may be able to find the uncut slab bacon in the deli section of your grocery store. If none is available, use the thickest cut you can find pre- packaged. Regular bacon will work, but the thicker the better! Lay the bacon in a pan on a wire rack being careful not to overlap. Brush lightly with maple syrup on one side then sprinkle the rub evenly onto one side. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes then flip and repeat the process. Continue to repeat until the bacon is rendered and firm. It should be able to stand straight once cooled. Cook times will vary according to thickness of the bacon. Lady and Sons Chicken Pot Pie"
