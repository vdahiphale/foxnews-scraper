They had the huge Bush incubus on their backs still. Obama could easily have split Republicans. There were plenty of Republicans who did not want to be in the position of opposing a popular president on this first big vote. He passed. He acceded to Nancy Pelosi into the House chairman. They passed stimulus bill. Stuff full of Democratic goodies and that it's now his recovery policy. Joe Biden about six to seven weeks ago, announced that it was going to be the summer of recovery.

They don't expect to see any better unemployment picture between now and then. So what they're trying to do is force Republicans to answer for blocking unemployment, extension of unemployment benefits. Eventually that got through, but being opposed almost universally to that and also procedurally blocking a package of $30 billion in the tax relief for small businesses before Congress recessed. And at the same time, open up this tax cut debate. Will Republicans who would like to see every single bracket in the tax code, all the tax relief with the Bush tax cut extended even to the wealthy, will they come up with any pay-force or offsets or they simply advocate extending all of them. Even though, froze the deficit while they block things like the small business tax relief and unemployment extension, and benefit extensions? That is what they are doing to try to change the subject and to try to look like they're fighting for the unemployed and fighting for small business while they go to September approaching this tax cut debate. The tax cut debate is going to be so definitive in this fall's elections. I think the Democrats -- what they have to do is pick a side. They're a little bit divided right now about whether or not to extend them to all the brackets or to drop the ones for the wealthy, and whether or not they're going to make this announcement to the voters in September or whether or not, they're going to wait. I think they have to decide pretty quickly."

When if the president and Geithner have said, they're going to raise taxes by allowing the Bush cuts to expire, which will be taking a huge amount of money out of the pockets of small business and this is how liberal economics works. The government takes your money in taxes and then it will deign to restore some of it as a loan on which you have to go to bureaucrat and you have to fill out a form, get on your knees and be nice and adhere to all the mandates. Get part of your money back with interest or in targeted tax cuts, which means the government will tell you how to spend your money, how to do your expansion of the business, spend it on the \"x\" and not \"y.\" The answer is I think if you are a Republican, you make a principled argument to better not to raise taxes in the first place, not to raise them on January 1.  Allow small business to keep its money and it will invest as it sees fit. That is the most efficient and it's also the most fair."

It's not going to matter.  The president of the United States and the Democratic -- and his party, his party controls Congress. The president has gotten his agenda through. He wanted stimulus and he got it. He wanted healthcare bill. He got it. The Republicans haven't passed anything. The Republicans haven't blocked anything important. They delayed small unemployment benefit such as trivial $30 billion bill, which is actually -- the equity stakes and banks encouraged them to make loans. No serious economists think it will have an effect. It's Obama's economy. Now, this could last three or four years to get out of it and unemployment could up before it goes down, go up to 10 percent then he might have some running room. He took possession of it.

This is spot that was for hours bathed in the ashes of the Twin Towers and the thousands of innocents who died in it. It's not just any other spot. It's sacred ground. It's not to indict Islam. It's not to indict the vast majority of Muslims who were appalled by this event. But let me give you -- in 1993, Pope John Paul II ordered the Carmelite nuns who established Covenant in Auschwitz to evacuate and to leave it. And the reason is not because Carmelites had any involvement in, of course, Auschwitz or even the Catholic Church was not the perpetrator, but because it was sacred ground and it was inappropriate. It was seen as provocation and extremely insensitive. In this case -- in the case of the Carmelites it was act of goodwill. They prayed for souls of those who died. I'm not sure of the goodwill of this imam who as we heard if he was asked if Hamas was a terrorist organization answered I'm not a politician. It's a difficult issue."
