Let's separate the action from its execution. The act, defensible. The execution, flawed. He could have let him go in August when half the media are drunk picking sand from their naval.

Imagine if the movie \"Jaws\" only had just shark attacks? No character development. Just characters being eaten. That's this White House. There's no off switch. He's our \"Spinal Tap\" president where everything is always set to 11. And maybe one day, but maybe one day he might realize you can't be on DEFCON 5 all the time. Of course, that will be when he invents DEFCON 6.",
