What's amazing is to look back at that coverage and to see how it was wrong in every respect. It was wrong when it came to his response to COVID. It was wrong when it came to the idea that as Steve Schmidt said that he was some kind of heroic figure emerging from this. And the initial brushoff that you made reference to of reporting around these latest scandals is really a travesty in retrospect. What I fear, though, is that the lesson that so many politicians have taken from the experience of Governor Ralph Northam in Virginia is that you can just keep your head down and ball forward and survive anything like this. And I think that that's probably what's going to happen with Governor Cuomo as well. He's a powerful, well-connected Democratic politician. I think he's just going to decide, I'm going to ignore all my critics, including the president of the United States, and I'm going to stick this out.",

Look, you know, whatever the standard is, it seems clear that Andrew Cuomo has certainly violated it in terms of behaving unprofessionally and unethically as it relates to these subordinates. But it is also a situation that I think is unfortunate in the sense that we are focused on this and not on the scandal, the ever running and ever increasing scandal that we've learned so much about as regards to his implementation of his policies related to nursing homes and COVID, an investigation that the Biden administration shut down, not just as it relates to him but as it relates to several other Democrat governors. And so from my perspective, there's no real heroes in this story though I will say the women involved here have to be considered very brave to come forward and to speak out against someone who was so lionized by the press and who had been put up on this pedestal to such an incredible degree as someone who could not, you know, would not just be, you know, potentially - -",

Griff, we talked about the attorney general's report. It is focused on top aides enabling his behavior, trying to keep him away from being alone with certain women.

Here's why. We learned from the report that when Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo's top aide, the one that leaked confidential files to reporters to discredit Lindsey Boylan, the first accuser that came forward, the report finding that unlawful retaliation, the executive assistant participated with the aide, Melissa DeRosa, in whiting out some names before the report on Boylan could be released. She then accuses, of course, the governor of groping her, reaching under her blouse, and touching her breast. And so I think the role that the media has now is to make sure that every single stone is overturned, that everything comes forward, and to use their, I think, fundamental role which is to be the fourth state to hold governors and governments accountable and shine a light.",

I think it is going to be hard for the press to walk away from this one. Let me get a break here. We'll talk about Chris Cuomo's role a bit later.

It's the opposite of respecting these types of guardrails for our politics. It's incredibly damaging.

And it makes everything in retrospect look kind of laughable. One just one more point on this. The people who are actually hit by this eviction moratorium are overwhelmingly America's small business owners and the like who have one house or maybe two that they rent out, a small number of units.

NBC's ratings for the COVID play games down as much as 50 percent. Some pundits erupted on Twitter when a CNN panel was discussing the sexual harassment report on Andrew Cuomo, how on earth was Jeffrey toobin just brought back to the network after pleasuring himself on a Zoom call holding forth on sexual misconduct except it wasn't Toobin. It was CNN political director David Chalian and I don't really think they look alike. Megyn Kelly, Clay Travis and others ran corrections.

She turns out to be a secretary, and she's wearing a dress, not a bathing suit. Obviously, Cuomo didn't expect the tabloid to obtain these paparazzi style photos. But after state investigators found he sexually harassed 11 women, the optics for the governor, not so good. Just made it. That is it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz.

That was the moment of truth, not now, when everyone is revolted by chilling evidence that Cuomo sexually harassed 11 different women. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MEDIA BUZZ. The A.G.'s report found that Andrew Cuomo had engaged in sexual harassment, unwanted kissing and touching and groping.

But when these allegations first surfaced, many just looked the other way, nothing to see here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEN DOMENECH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, FOUNDER AND PUBLISHER OF THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "You know, the look back at the media's performance during this is not going to be a pleasant one for really anyone who lauded Andrew Cuomo as being this incredible leader. What's amazing is to look back at that coverage and to see how it was wrong in every respect. It was wrong when it came to his response to COVID. It was wrong when it came to the idea that as Steve Schmidt said that he was some kind of heroic figure emerging from this. And the initial brushoff that you made reference to of reporting around these latest scandals is really a travesty in retrospect. What I fear, though, is that the lesson that so many politicians have taken from the experience of Governor Ralph Northam in Virginia is that you can just keep your head down and ball forward and survive anything like this. And I think that that's probably what's going to happen with Governor Cuomo as well. He's a powerful, well-connected Democratic politician. I think he's just going to decide, I'm going to ignore all my critics, including the president of the United States, and I'm going to stick this out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, let's come back to that. But Griff, \"The New York Times,\" which kept endorsing him, says that if Cuomo cares about the people of the state, he will step down. \"The Washington Post\" says this is no longer any question about his fitness for office. Usually, an embattled politician has some core of support. Is it now impossible for anyone in the media not to denounce Andrew Cuomo?"

Perhaps there's irony that on August 8th, 1974, President Nixon took to the airwaves to say, I'm going to resign. He knew he was cornered. And it is not just \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post.\" You've also got the \"Times Union,\" the home newspaper there in Albany, along with columnist Maureen Dowd, everybody is savaging him. What will be fascinating to see, as you pointed out correctly with Ben that the press was slow to pick up on defending these victims as they're really rightfully called, will they also go after the members of his staff, the top aides, that in this report, 165 pages of unbelievable accusations, say they conducted something that amounts to unlawful retaliation?"

Let me play for the audience some further comments that Governor Cuomo made in his defense and then we're going to look at Charlotte Bennett who really became the face of the scandal because she was the first of the accusers to go public on TV. Roll it."

      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "Ben, so Andrew Cuomo likes to hug and kiss people at weddings and at disasters. It's hardly the same it seems to me as making women feel uncomfortable. How was that particular part of his defense playing in the press?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "I don't think that the idea that, you know, I'm an old fashioned Italian man who likes to do all these things really works in this day and age of the professional environments where certain, you know, actions that are directed towards subordinates are completely different than the actions that you might have around your family members or something like that. Look, you know, whatever the standard is, it seems clear that Andrew Cuomo has certainly violated it in terms of behaving unprofessionally and unethically as it relates to these subordinates. But it is also a situation that I think is unfortunate in the sense that we are focused on this and not on the scandal, the ever running and ever increasing scandal that we've learned so much about as regards to his implementation of his policies related to nursing homes and COVID, an investigation that the Biden administration shut down, not just as it relates to him but as it relates to several other Democrat governors. And so from my perspective, there's no real heroes in this story though I will say the women involved here have to be considered very brave to come forward and to speak out against someone who was so lionized by the press and who had been put up on this pedestal to such an incredible degree as someone who could not, you know, would not just be, you know, potentially - -"

    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "Sure. And, you know, Bennett also addressed the video calling it fake, saying it was inappropriate, unnecessary, and I believe, in her words, downright weird. Look, you have a governor who almost two years to the day signed a law, the strongest law in any state in the United States, to help women file claims of sexual harassment, and now we're learning from this report that a day later he harasses a state trooper, according to Letitia James's report."

      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "But the larger point to be made, I think, quickly is that this was a taxpayer-funded video which Charlotte Bennett called -- quote -- \"propaganda\" in which the governor continues to call her a liar in the video. So, I mean, it's a continuation, I think, of what the report laid out --"

So, the executive assistant number one, she is called on the report, is going public tomorrow in an interview with CBS, which has now named her Brittany Commisso. She is the one who says the governor groped her under her blouse. Ben, with President Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Gillibrand and a whole bunch of other home state Democrats calling for Cuomo to quit, does that fuel the story? Because we can all now run pieces that say pressuring on Governor Cuomo to resign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "I really don't think it does. I think that this is going to be something that the media sweeps under the rug in part because they're so embarrassed about their performance and how much they lauded Governor Cuomo in the past. I think what that they will try to move on from this as rapidly as they can. And I think that that's just a statement about how partisan, how publicly partisan so many in our media have become. And I'll say this too. This is a reminder about why we shouldn't lionized politicians and our political elected leaders as if they're somehow these perfect avatars of everything we would like to see in leadership qualities. It's a reminder to everybody, regardless of your party or ideology, that you should not put these people on such a pedestal, that you ignore the kind of capacity that they have to do sometimes terrible things, things that we have to be honest about as opposed to pretending and waving our hands away as if that doesn't matter because of which side of the political spectrum they're on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think that is a great point. It wasn't like the press didn't know about this side of Andrew Cuomo's personality. Top editors at the Albany \"Times Union\" say he screamed at them when they ran a story he didn't like and they refused to talk to him off the record. Griff, we talked about the attorney general's report. It is focused on top aides enabling his behavior, trying to keep him away from being alone with certain women. A couple saying they would be fired for doing anything like that. And so it wasn't just Andrew Cuomo but it was the people around the governor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, I think Ben's point about whether or not the media tries to wash their hands quickly or not is significant because of what we're learning and good for CBS and the \"Times Union\" for interviewing the executive assistant number one. Here's why. We learned from the report that when Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo's top aide, the one that leaked confidential files to reporters to discredit Lindsey Boylan, the first accuser that came forward, the report finding that unlawful retaliation, the executive assistant participated with the aide, Melissa DeRosa, in whiting out some names before the report on Boylan could be released. She then accuses, of course, the governor of groping her, reaching under her blouse, and touching her breast. And so I think the role that the media has now is to make sure that every single stone is overturned, that everything comes forward, and to use their, I think, fundamental role which is to be the fourth state to hold governors and governments accountable and shine a light."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, it may well be that you're right, Ben, about that the media will just let this drop. But on the other hand, you have Democrats in Albany who say they have enough votes to impeach the governor. If that were to happen, he would have to step aside and let the lieutenant governor take over during the impeachment process. So, we will see. I think it is going to be hard for the press to walk away from this one. Let me get a break here. We'll talk about Chris Cuomo's role a bit later. When we come back, President Biden just took a major step that he himself says is probably illegal, and the media don't seem to care."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Well, this is insulting on its face in part because so much of what the media did in presenting Joe Biden to the American people in the last presidential election was presenting him as a return to normalcy, a return to respecting the norms of politics. And this is totally flouting those norms. This is going against -- signing something into law with the admission that you acknowledge that this act is not just unlawful but is in all respects unconstitutional is the opposite of norms. It's the opposite of respecting these types of guardrails for our politics. It's incredibly damaging. And to see the way that the media reacted to it, it just puts all this stuff on its face as kind of absurd, that they would be lauding this move by Biden because they really don't care whether those norms are respected or not. And it makes everything in retrospect look kind of laughable. One just one more point on this. The people who are actually hit by this eviction moratorium are overwhelmingly America's small business owners and the like who have one house or maybe two that they rent out, a small number of units. Those are the ones who are hit the most by this and aren't going to be able to continue to make mortgage payments. They will probably end up getting swallowed up --"

I told her the president had his hands tied. He can't extend the moratorium because the Supreme Court said it's unconstitutional. Now, fast forward to what happened this week. Where is the headline, Howie, today that should read metamorphosis of how Democrats justify unconstitutional governance? It should exist because that's what happened. And what's amazing, as Ben points out, we stunningly had the president admit that he was going to simply violate the Constitution, if you will, by doing this, knowing full well that it would be immediately challenged. I think you will see some legal hearings. Something will certainly come this week."

Ben, \"The Washington Post\" editorial page to which credit says what Biden had the CDC do is almost certainly illegal. But when Donald Trump took money from other departments to fund the border wall, the construction part of the wall, the press went haywire, said he had no right to do this, he extended his legal authority.

And so I think that what people should take away from this experience is that the next time that you have an entity from the press come out and pound on the table and defend constitutional norms, say that democracy dies in darkness, understand that they're doing that based on their own perspective on the politicians and the decisions they're making and almost never are they actually basing that on an even-handed and fair look at this type of decision and a nonpartisan manner.

They see the most -- they see the most new cases of COVID, including with the delta variant, in Texas and Florida, and they're just going to keep using them as what they think are a bad example because those governors are trying to give people a choice.

You come to Delaware with the president, no such masking rules. This is an administration, though, where over the course of the last year and-a-half that we were traveling with them, they made a point to get people to take COVID-19 very, very seriously.

Joining us now from Connecticut is Charlie Gasparino, senior correspondent at Fox Business Network. Charlie, Chris Cuomo couldn't address this whole mess on his show under CNN's rules, very different of course than the rules for the Cuomo brothers show last year.

Of courses he's going to speak to his brother about this issue. Where this becomes really dicey for him, and you know, I know Chris for a long time, I like Chris, where it becomes dicey is becoming officially part of the whole thing, the official damage control. Once you become officially part of something like that, Howie, then you know it really gets dicey. You should be disclosing it to your boss, maybe you should take a leave of absence. And by the way, suppose he is part of this thing, this official response team for Andrew, and then he starts, does he think that Andrew is innocent? Maybe he thinks he might be guilty. And then, you're part of damage control for somebody you might think could have done some of this and then you know, you're on CNN. It's just -- it looks so bad and I tell you, I feel --"

And he's not covering, you know, officially the governor's mansion. So, you know, there's a little bit of difference here but he still, still should have disclosed the whole thing and if he was going to be part of the rapid -- Cuomo rapid response team, he should take a leave of absence, he should not be doing both jobs.

I mean, Mario Cuomo I really like Mario Cuomo personally but he had some really sharp elbow as well. So, remember, you know, being a tough guy or tough woman in New York is not exactly -- is not exactly, you know, unique here.

There was a gentleman in that focus group who talked about and I respect it, talked about all the people who got COVID and recovered, talked about all the people who have not gotten covid, some members of the family got it, some members did not. But in the end, it's the responsibility of all of us, Howie, you and I and everyone involved, to be able to communicate the facts sufficiently, effectively and accountably and the key in all of this is the public doesn't know where to go for the truth.

The vaccination rate has actually been rising lately from under 500,000 daily shots to more than 800,000 yesterday.

The Washington Post has always focused on what matters most to people and providing this kind of information. There are news outlets out there, the New York Times has done a good job at this. Most news outlets have been very effective at presenting the details behind it. The problem, Howie, is when you start to add emotion, you start to add passion. I know you've got a clip, I would love you to show it because this idea of humanizing and personalizing COVID while it's helpful in getting people vaccinated, it creates an anger among those who aren't yet, that they're trying to dramatize it and they're not giving the public the full truth."

But when you have that kind of surge in cases, as you know it's concentrated in certain low vax states and counties, how can the media be blamed for reporting that? Isn't that reporting the nature of what's going on with this interminable virus?"

      "utterance": "Yes. And you just said it in that question. You told the truth. And that's what's necessary in all of this. And the problem is, I'm in New York right now. I've had these conversations right here in my building and I've been doing these focus groups as people are coming in and out and they're telling me they don't know where to go to get the facts. After all this time, if the public doesn't trust what they see on television, what they read in the newspaper, then we are -- to use no better term, we are screwed. And that's why it's essential that those who report it be careful. Keep your politics out of it. Keep your ideology out of it. Frankly, Dr. Fauci has a become a horrible spokesman. Right now, he's a brilliant man. And I believe in what he's saying."

Still to come, a stunningly bad New York Times headline, Trump versus the women soccer team, Jennifer Aniston losing friends and more on the buzz beater."

      "utterance": "Time to see if I can beat the clock on the buzz beater. Go. This seems like a parody of a bad headline, the New York Times reviewing a book on Osama bin Laden actually published this. Osama bin Laden, the fanatical terrorist and the devoted family man. Yes, the murderous mastermind of 9/11. Some editor thought that was just fine. After a social media outcry, the Times changed it to a fuller picture of Osama bin Laden's life. Jennifer Aniston is dropping some friends. The actress telling in Style magazine that she is blowing off some of her pals who refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine or won't say whether they have. Quote, \"there's still a large group of people who are anti-vaxxers or just don't listen to the facts and are motivated, she says by fear or propaganda.\" I wonder if such blunt comments will lose her any friends out there known as fans. Speaking of the virus, CNN's Jim Acosta who always claimed to be fair in covering Donald Trump said yesterday maybe we should call the Delta variant the DeSantis variant after Florida's governor. I guess he's liberated that to be totally partisan. Barack Obama had a big 60th birthday blow-out planned for Martha's Vineyard with 500 guests but got hammered in the press for being tone deaf during the Delta surge. So, he announced it will be cut back to close friends and family. But that's an elastic definition. A lot of celebs still showed up yesterday led by Jay Z and Beyonce. Now the papers are investigating who didn't make the cut. The horror. And speaking of Obama, remember that ridiculous media flap when he dares to wear a tan suit. Well, Joe Biden was similarly attired while touting the latest jobs numbers prompting some Twitter snark but no summiting of the wardrobe police. U.S. women's soccer team won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics and Donald Trump who has feuded with star Megan Rapinoe wasn't happy. He put out a statement and said this last night on Fox."

And wasn't it nice after the huge media debate over Simone Biles benching herself on the gymnastics team concern about her mental health that she came back to win a bronze medal. NBC's ratings for the COVID play games down as much as 50 percent. Some pundits erupted on Twitter when a CNN panel was discussing the sexual harassment report on Andrew Cuomo, how on earth was Jeffrey toobin just brought back to the network after pleasuring himself on a Zoom call holding forth on sexual misconduct except it wasn't Toobin. It was CNN political director David Chalian and I don't really think they look alike. Megyn Kelly, Clay Travis and others ran corrections. And this eye-catching New York Post cover on Andrew Cuomo, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with him working at the pool of the executive mansion with a blonde woman on her laptop a couple feet away. She turns out to be a secretary, and she's wearing a dress, not a bathing suit. Obviously, Cuomo didn't expect the tabloid to obtain these paparazzi style photos. But after state investigators found he sexually harassed 11 women, the optics for the governor, not so good. Just made it. That is it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz.

The Senate is still debating the infrastructure bill. It's always on the verge of passing and then somehow it always gets delayed.
