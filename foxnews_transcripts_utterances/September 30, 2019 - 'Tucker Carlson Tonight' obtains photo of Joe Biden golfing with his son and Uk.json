      "sentences": "Well, good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" For just about three years since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, the left has worked tirelessly to end his administration by non-democratic means as necessary, very much including impeachment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, tonight they are closer than ever to reaching that goal. And yet, in another reminder that the human nature is more complex than the human genome, they don't appear very happy about it. In fact, the closer impeachment gets, the more despondent they seem. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As the Buddha himself once noted, man longs to drink from the lotus blossom, only to discover its nectar is the most bitter of all. And so Washington Democrats are close to tears tonight over impeachment. They had such high hopes for President Trump, they want you to know that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They saw his potential, sure, they could be mildly critical from time to time, but only in the most loving way as a parent corrects a child. It is an opportunity for self-improvement because underneath it all, they were rooting for Donald Trump from day one, because honestly, when you strip it all away, they're patriots, too. They just want what's best for this country. But then tragically into the path of their good intentions, rolled Donald Trump's fateful phone call to the President of Ukraine. That changed everything. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now Democrats have no choice but to impeach the President of the United States. Sometimes you've got to overturn a democracy in order to save a democracy. Sad as hell. In fact, it's enough to make even a hardened political operative like Nancy Pelosi a little emotional. Watch her explain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

That's the official position of the Democratic Party on the question of impeachment. They rolled it out. They tested it this weekend, the talking point and the Sunday shows, and tellingly, not a single news anchor challenged them on it. Strangely, though, no one seems to have informed Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, one of the party's most visible members.

Apparently, Nancy Pelosi hasn't had time to call the Congresswoman and recommend instead a weekend of contemplative prayer.

In fact, let's just be clear, they are a lot more honest than schmaltzy windbags like Nancy Pelosi. They don't even bother to pretend to weep and pray. Weep and pray? They're thrilled. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They're a little closer like to seizing power. And from their perspective, that is always an unalloyed good. They could care less about the system. They'd like to turn the system down.

If anything jeopardizes our national security, it's sending -- mindlessly sending military aid to Ukraine in order to antagonize Russia. What do we get out of that? Quick? What's the answer? Oh, there is no answer? Right. We don't get anything out of it -- at all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But of course, no one in the press pauses for 30 seconds to question the core story at the bottom of this, which is we're sending close to half a billion dollars in military aid to Ukraine because, why? Because a couple of neocons think we should. Please. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But while we're at it, by the way, another thing that puts our national security at risk for real is when you make it impossible for the President, any President to have private conversations with his counterparts in other countries, with other foreign leaders. Remember, the closest the world ever came to nuclear war was in 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. How did that end? How did it deescalate? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, it ended, when our President reached a deal with the Soviet President, Nikita Khrushchev, secretly. They made concessions to one another secretly. They couldn't have done it in any other way. If there were self-righteous leakers around in 1962, the world would have blown up. That's probably not an overstatement. So it's a huge problem if this President or any President can't proceed with the expectations that his phone calls, the core of his job will remain private. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, honestly, the Democratic Party really cares about national security? The party that won't enforce our border with Mexico? That refuses to import illegal aliens convicted of felonies? Yes, they are really worried about national security. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This has nothing to do with national security. That's the most annoying of all the lies. It's about power. It's a power grab. And by the way, say what you will about Tlaib and AOC and the rest of those hyper aggressive freshmen, at least they are kind of honest about that. And there's something sort of nice about someone who is honest about his aims, even if those aims are disgusting and contemptible and scary, which power grabbing is. But at least you don't have to wade through a bunch of self-righteous air to get there. Bottom line, the Democratic Party wants to pretend the 2016 election never happened and to make sure it can never happen again. As Washington expresses its fake concerns about national security, they can't even pretend to be worried about corruption at the highest levels. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Nobody thinks Hunter Biden deserved hundreds of thousands of dollars for a no-show energy gig in Ukraine.

It has been Democrats who boycotted President Trump's inauguration saying that he was not a legitimate President, saying that he was a Russian stooge.

You have to at least put on enough intellectual pounds to be like the schmaltzy windbag Nancy Pelosi and do that oh, this is a sorrowful moment for our country.

Congress should be working on these things. They are not. They're distracted by the phony Ukraine drama, and so divided they couldn't agree on what to do about these problems anyway. On most issues, they are divided, but we should correct and say on one issue they are in virtual total agreement. Last Wednesday, that was the same day the House was convulsed with the impeachment debate. Two hundred and twenty nine Democrats and 91 Republicans came together in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement to pass the so-called Safe Banking Act. Safe for whom? Weed dealers. Even though marijuana is still illegal, federally, the bill would allow banks and credit unions to provide banking services to people who deal marijuana. So in the middle of the deadliest drug epidemic in our history, the only thing Congress can agree on is that it ought to be easier to sell drugs to Americans. Oh, okay. Why are they so in favor of this? There are two reasons. One, a small number are getting very rich doing it. A former Republican speaker is now a weed lobbyist, and for another, when you mismanage the country this badly, you want the people to be so out of it, they don't respond. That is really true.

      "utterance": "Well, good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" For just about three years since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, the left has worked tirelessly to end his administration by non-democratic means as necessary, very much including impeachment. Well, tonight they are closer than ever to reaching that goal. And yet, in another reminder that the human nature is more complex than the human genome, they don't appear very happy about it. In fact, the closer impeachment gets, the more despondent they seem. As the Buddha himself once noted, man longs to drink from the lotus blossom, only to discover its nectar is the most bitter of all. And so Washington Democrats are close to tears tonight over impeachment. They had such high hopes for President Trump, they want you to know that. They saw his potential, sure, they could be mildly critical from time to time, but only in the most loving way as a parent corrects a child. It is an opportunity for self-improvement because underneath it all, they were rooting for Donald Trump from day one, because honestly, when you strip it all away, they're patriots, too. They just want what's best for this country. But then tragically into the path of their good intentions, rolled Donald Trump's fateful phone call to the President of Ukraine. That changed everything. Now Democrats have no choice but to impeach the President of the United States. Sometimes you've got to overturn a democracy in order to save a democracy. Sad as hell. In fact, it's enough to make even a hardened political operative like Nancy Pelosi a little emotional. Watch her explain."

They tested it this weekend, the talking point and the Sunday shows, and tellingly, not a single news anchor challenged them on it. Strangely, though, no one seems to have informed Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, one of the party's most visible members. She is still selling t- shirts emblazoned with her most famous quote, \"Impeach the mother-effer.\" You can buy it tonight if you want. Apparently, Nancy Pelosi hasn't had time to call the Congresswoman and recommend instead a weekend of contemplative prayer. She'll get on at some point and God knows what Tlaib will say when she does. Say what you will about Tlaib and her other friends in the squad, but they are a lot more direct. In fact, let's just be clear, they are a lot more honest than schmaltzy windbags like Nancy Pelosi. They don't even bother to pretend to weep and pray. Weep and pray? They're thrilled. They're a little closer like to seizing power. And from their perspective, that is always an unalloyed good. They could care less about the system. They'd like to turn the system down. That's the point. Mainstream Democrats meanwhile, though, ever worried about what normal people might think, are still churning out increasingly implausible lies. We've seen the latest tonight. It's maybe the best. They're telling you that the Ukraine saga is actually about national security concerns. Watch."

By delaying they say, military aid to Ukraine. That jeopardizes our national security. Uh-huh. Yes. If anything jeopardizes our national security, it's sending -- mindlessly sending military aid to Ukraine in order to antagonize Russia. What do we get out of that? Quick? What's the answer? Oh, there is no answer? Right. We don't get anything out of it -- at all. But of course, no one in the press pauses for 30 seconds to question the core story at the bottom of this, which is we're sending close to half a billion dollars in military aid to Ukraine because, why? Because a couple of neocons think we should. Please. But while we're at it, by the way, another thing that puts our national security at risk for real is when you make it impossible for the President, any President to have private conversations with his counterparts in other countries, with other foreign leaders. Remember, the closest the world ever came to nuclear war was in 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. How did that end? How did it deescalate? Well, it ended, when our President reached a deal with the Soviet President, Nikita Khrushchev, secretly. They made concessions to one another secretly. They couldn't have done it in any other way. If there were self-righteous leakers around in 1962, the world would have blown up. That's probably not an overstatement. So it's a huge problem if this President or any President can't proceed with the expectations that his phone calls, the core of his job will remain private. And by the way, honestly, the Democratic Party really cares about national security? The party that won't enforce our border with Mexico? That refuses to import illegal aliens convicted of felonies? Yes, they are really worried about national security. This has nothing to do with national security. That's the most annoying of all the lies. It's about power. It's a power grab. And by the way, say what you will about Tlaib and AOC and the rest of those hyper aggressive freshmen, at least they are kind of honest about that. And there's something sort of nice about someone who is honest about his aims, even if those aims are disgusting and contemptible and scary, which power grabbing is. But at least you don't have to wade through a bunch of self-righteous air to get there. Bottom line, the Democratic Party wants to pretend the 2016 election never happened and to make sure it can never happen again. As Washington expresses its fake concerns about national security, they can't even pretend to be worried about corruption at the highest levels. Nobody thinks Hunter Biden deserved hundreds of thousands of dollars for a no-show energy gig in Ukraine. But nobody seems upset that he got it anyway.

But you set up your adult kids and in the case of the Biden's, Joe Biden was point person for the Obama administration towards two countries -- China and Ukraine -- and low and behold, the two countries that hunter Biden ends up doing the most businesses overseas are China and Ukraine. And the amounts of money are astronomical and the deals that he got have absolutely nothing to do with his background. He had no expertise to sell.

They are interested merely in making up their laws and rules as they go. And so even with impeachment, and if you look at even the testimony that was given at the congressional hearing last week, I mean, Adam Schiff, tried to manipulate all of those terms into just have their own standards, and tried to say -- and Maguire did such a great job at just cutting through all of that, and saying, no, this is the legal standard, not the manipulated definition that you want to provide.

By doing that, he's threatening or democracy.\" And what I find infuriating about what she said there, Democrats are the ones who are threatening our democracy by casting doubt on the legitimacy of President Trump. They are the ones who are undermining our faith in institutions, particularly the electoral process. And remember, it was Democrats and Nancy Pelosi's daughter who was leading the charge in 2016, encouraging faithless electors. It has been Democrats who boycotted President Trump's inauguration saying that he was not a legitimate President, saying that he was a Russian stooge. We've been lied to about the Russia collusion narrative. And now Democrats want to move forward with an impeachment process, upending the 2016 election and 63 million American votes. So they are the ones that are threatening our democracy."

And they would all feign abject stupidity. No, of course not. It's just a charity. Just like what they doing now, by the way, with Hunter Biden. You know, I saw some of this on Sunday. $50,000.00? Is that illegal? Well, it looks disgusting. And by the way, it could be illegal, maybe we should investigate. But looking specifically at the Clinton Foundation, they had a drop after she lost the election of 50 percent. Tens of millions of dollars. I guess all of a sudden climate change, women's empowerment and childhood obesity didn't matter quite as much to folks. The Clinton Global Initiative was shut down. Dozens of people were fired. They had to actually go through that New York State notification process for a mass layoff. What happened all of a sudden? You would think that a politician who was no longer going to be in power would have more time for charitable work. You'd think that the focus could be really on all the good that they were doing.

You know, you shouldn't bundle all these things together, and also this isn't a former politician we are talking about. This is somebody who was the expected to be President, not somebody who could be. The expectation for governments around the world and for the Democratic Party, and I just think it's funny that now, we see something where there's once again the possibility of impropriety with Hunter Biden and we're told how could you even think such a thing?

So he was on CNN over the weekend, talking to that squeaky little spokesman that the Chairman of CNN employees, and the spokesman said, hey, Robert De Niro, famous actor, what do you think of Donald Trump and Fox News? Kind of teed it up for him. Here's what happened next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DE NIRO",
      "utterance": "This guy is -- should not be President period."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "And when you say that folks on Fox come after you. I remember the Tony's when you got up there and cursed. A lot of [bleep]. But you know, this is cable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DE NIRO",
      "utterance": "[Bleep]."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STELTER",
      "utterance": "So it's not an FCC violation, but it is still a Sunday morning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Luckily, nobody is watching, so that's the good news. Author economist, Mark Steyn was not watching, but we did send him the tape."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Nope."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So what do you make of this, Mark?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Well, you're right, there was a bigger audience on the sidewalk outside that New York Courthouse -- but essentially, essentially, CNN and this is fantastic, their booker negotiated for months to get Robert de Niro on the show and give us his insights into the Trump administration. And in the end, he basically just treats them the way he treats his minimum-waged domestic servants, and yells at Brian Stelter exactly the way he did at that poor chauffeur. But what's interesting here is to go back to what you were saying at the top of the show, when you were saying about Rashida Tlaib and preferring her straightforwardness to I think, did you call Madam Speaker a schmaltzy windbag? I think that was the phrase you used. And this is basically the same. Every story on tonight's shows have been the same story that it results from the left not accepting the results of the presidential election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "He said this guy should not be President. Period. But it doesn't work like that. You can't just stick a period on the end of it. You actually have got to --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Wait, wait, wait. Even if you're a famous actor, you can't?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "No. And actually that is, as you said, it is rich white privilege, basically to say that just because you and your friends think this guy shouldn't be President, you can't come up with -- De Niro used to be a great actor. When he played Jake LaMotta in \"Raging Bull,\" he put on 60 pounds for that role. So to go on Brian Stelter's show and assert that this guy should not be President, you need to put on 60 intellectual pounds to bring yourself up to the level of Hillary Clinton who, you know at least says he shouldn't be President because he has colluded with the Macedonian content farmer down on their Macedonian content farm in old Macedonia. You have to at least put on enough intellectual pounds to be like the schmaltzy windbag Nancy Pelosi and do that oh, this is a sorrowful moment for our country. We should all be prayerful because our illegitimate President has colluded with the Macedonian cult. This isn't a bipartisan moment. This is one where we should all be prayerful that he will be delivered from the Macedonian content farming. And the fact that de Niro just says, I'm the greatest actor in the world and all I could do is rain down expletives, as if you, Brian Stelter, are my deputy under footman."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So that's it, and quickly. That was interesting your thought on this. I watched the tape and the first thing I thought was, I think he's a little bit over 70. I'm 50. I don't know how old you are, probably around my age, but we're getting older. Okay. How would you like to be as successful and rich as Robert de Niro, we obviously acknowledge he is a great actor. I'll certainly acknowledge it and be that unhappy. How did that happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he's actually become the kind of potty-mouth grandpa he plays in those witless comedies he has been doing in recent years. And I think has actually addled him. The fact though is that if this is your -- it's not going to do anything. If your object is to remove Trump from office, then actually having de Niro on television just losing a blizzard of F-words at half the population isn't going to do it. I don't know whether the, oh, we should all be sorrowful and prayerful about our poor President who is colluding with all these people. I don't know whether that will do it either. But it's actually a more subtle and nuanced approach than just going the de Niro route."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "The left really is a coalition of the world's most unhappy. I would say. You're not in it, Mark. Mark Steyn, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Thanks a lot, Tucker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, the scandal around Ukraine turns on the question of hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to that country. We're told that aid is sacrosanct. And if we don't send the aid that our national security is in jeopardy. Huh? Is that true? It's actually nuts. We're going to unpack it after the break because nobody else will. Stay tuned."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So as usual, almost nobody in Washington traces the story back to its roots. But it's always worth doing that. And in this case, the impeachment saga can be traced back to military aid to Ukraine. Hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine. Now, why are we sending this? Well, the explicit purpose is to help Ukraine battle Russia. Okay. You can see why Ukraine would be in favor of that. But why should you be in favor of that? Does it help America? Does it make you safer? Christian Whiton is a former State Department senior adviser. He joins us tonight. Christian, thanks so much for coming on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SENIOR ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Great to be here, Tucker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Again, really simple. If I were Ukrainian, I'd be completely in favor of this. Why should I, as an American be in favor of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "Well, you probably shouldn't, you know, actually, the crisis is over. The immediate crisis that was posed when Vladimir Putin sent some and you know, took a small part of Ukraine and then took Crimea, which incidentally, is mostly ethnically Russian. Right now, you just have a lot of aid going to Ukraine that's going -- you know, up to nearly $1.5 billion, if you go back to 2014 when they had this political transformation. And the problem is the place is crooked, it's corrupt. In a lot of places where we poured foreign aid over the years that are corrupted, you get more corruption when you do that. Transparency International says there are about 120 in the world out of 180 in corruptions. That means they're the most corrupt country and all of Europe except for Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So I'm just a little bit confused by the posture I often hear in Washington, where if I'm not really upset about Russia messing around in Ukraine, or Estonia, Crimea or whatever, then I'm a traitor to America. Why do we care so much? I'm confused."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "Why do we care? There's a reason to care. We don't want Russia willy-nilly invading other countries, although they're not threatening to do that now. But we should be concerned. The real question is, why doesn't Europe care? They're right there. They're the ones -- look at Germany alone. Germany's economy is two and a half times the size of Russia. And if you look at the whole E.U., 13 times the size of Russia's economy. Going to be a little smaller at the end of the month when Britain pulls out, but they have the resources to handle this themselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's just funny that my country actually is being invaded by other countries from the south, look at the population movement in the United States without our permission. And nobody cares and caring is itself seen as immoral. But we have to be outraged, morally outraged that Russia is making belligerent noises at Ukraine. Do you think that's weird?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "I think it's weird. I think you have this Europe mafia in our Foreign Service and foreign policy establishment, too that just sort of thinks it's always 1942 or '40 or '91 and they love being the kingmaker over there and giving all this money. But what are we getting in return? And also, are we willing to take this really bad relationship with Russia? Really pushing Russia into China's arms? Do really want to take on two great powers at the same time? We should think about that. We should have a debate before we just sort of happen into that policy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Why wouldn't we be friends in Russia? No one has ever explained that to me. Speak slowly so I can understand. I've never understood that. China is the threat. It's really clear, and yet Washington, loaded with dumb people is forcing us to be at war with Russia. I just think it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. But then I'm a traitor. Christian, great to see you tonight. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "Thanks, Tucker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, Congress is obsessed with impeachment. Obviously, nothing is getting done. Oh, wait a second. Let me revise that. Nothing is getting done except one thing. The other day Congress did pass one important piece of legislation, which shows what they really care about. We will tell you what it was. You'll be surprised."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "America has an awful lot of problems that Congress could and should be working on beginning with the fading middle class that's the central problem, and then crumbling infrastructure, a crisis on the Mexican border -- that really is a crisis -- an exhausted military, still fighting America's longest war in Afghanistan, et cetera et cetera. Congress should be working on these things. They are not. They're distracted by the phony Ukraine drama, and so divided they couldn't agree on what to do about these problems anyway. On most issues, they are divided, but we should correct and say on one issue they are in virtual total agreement. Last Wednesday, that was the same day the House was convulsed with the impeachment debate. Two hundred and twenty nine Democrats and 91 Republicans came together in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement to pass the so-called Safe Banking Act. Safe for whom? Weed dealers. Even though marijuana is still illegal, federally, the bill would allow banks and credit unions to provide banking services to people who deal marijuana. So in the middle of the deadliest drug epidemic in our history, the only thing Congress can agree on is that it ought to be easier to sell drugs to Americans. Oh, okay. Why are they so in favor of this? There are two reasons. One, a small number are getting very rich doing it. A former Republican speaker is now a weed lobbyist, and for another, when you mismanage the country this badly, you want the people to be so out of it, they don't respond. That is really true. They want you to be dumb. Choose sobriety so you can be awake enough to critique them and the crappy job they're doing. That's our advice. That's it for us tonight. Tune in every night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
