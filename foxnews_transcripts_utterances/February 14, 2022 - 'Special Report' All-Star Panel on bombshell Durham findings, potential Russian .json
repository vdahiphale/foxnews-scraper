We don't know, obviously, what he has been assured of privately. Perhaps he has been assured that Ukraine would not join NATO. But that wasn't going to happen any time soon, if ever, anyway. So it's hard for me to picture that as being great win for him that would allow him to say we got what we wanted, so we are backing off.

But Lavrov said to him there is an opportunity to continue talking. And so I guess that was a message that the Russians were trying to send to their domestic audience, Bret. But I do think the message of today to the global audience is that there is a hope that Putin finds some kind of offramp, to pick up what Brit Hume was saying, that there's some sort of offramp, whether it's the Ukrainians, and we heard something from the Ukrainians today about, well, we have no immediate intentions of joining NATO. I don't know. And then also the U.S. saying we were willing to talk about military exercises on that eastern side of the NATO front.

Quote, \"What Mr. Biden hasn't done is explain to Americans the new global dangers and what must be done protect U.S. interests. The problem goes far beyond Ukraine. China wants to capture Taiwan and dominate the Western Pacific. The new Russia- China condominium means they will work together against U.S. interests. Iran is close to getting a nuclear weapon, and jihadists are far from vanquished.\" KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, I think what you're seeing, Bret, is this huge ramping up on the new threat to the United States. And yet you have a White House that seems utterly uninterested in actually stepping up to deal with national security issues. It has been focused almost entirely since the beginning of this administration on domestic programs pushed by progressives. You look at the way they handled Afghanistan. They just seemed to kind of want to get past it and continue to say it all went well. Right now, they are dealing with this because they have to. But what would be great is we need a Biden who has decided that this is the challenge of his presidency, who is going to lead the western world in a response on this, and that's going to be vital to the future security of the U.S.",
