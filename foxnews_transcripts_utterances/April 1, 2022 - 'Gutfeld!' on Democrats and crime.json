      "sentences": "-- in cold. Hello. Hey there, my friendly Friday friends. So how do you know when you're living in a delusion? I mean, other than Joe Biden thinking he's president. I mean, when people suddenly believe something is happening, when it really isn't. And then they come after you if you refuse to play along. The left in this country right now is like that mentally-ill homeless guy screaming at someone on the sidewalk, but there's actually nobody there. But if you tell him nobody is there, he'll attack you for pointing out the reality of the situation. But with our media, such delusions are rewarded with attention and therefore incentivized. The latest delusion that Florida's parental rights bill is an attack on gay and trans people. And that somehow merely stating the distinction between male and female is an affront to them. But sorry, Disney. According to my data, 99.9 percent of gay and trans aren't offended by the terms, boys and girls. Where did I get that statistic? Where I get all my biology stats? The steam room at the 92nd Street Y. But sadly, all you need are a few unhinged voices and control of the blow horn. And by blow horn, I mean the mainstream and social media. Social media is now the vehicle for delusional contagions. Where attention start activist Diem words like boys and girls harmful. Sorry, these people are full of more (BLEEP) than a cage full of chimps with lactose intolerance. And I know that. But like the bubonic plague, it's a rodent spreading the problem. Take it away home of Mickey Mouse.",

We are in the process of changing over those recorded messages and so many of you are probably familiar when we brought the fireworks back to the Magic Kingdom.

It all sounds like Disney is welcoming everyone with a no-girls-allowed sign. Did their customers ask for it? No, it's just a corporation terrified of being unwoke. Most families aren't up to speed with this crap. And why? Because they're too busy working two jobs so they can put food on the table for their kids. And maybe one week a year take them to your stupid theme park and drop a couple grand. Watching a pantless duck speak gibberish. Watch out waste management. Disney's been making family entertainment for 99 years, but now they're switching to garbage It's happening in government too. While we face possible war soaring inflation and rapid crime, what's the White House concerned about? They announced that U.S. airport security procedures will become gender neutral. Yes. They're going to an X for travelers going through precheck who don't identify as male or female. But isn't X the female chromosome? Wait until someone complains about that. I just might. TSA officers will also receive new instructions to make procedures less invasive, which is sad, being married, I started to enjoy those pat downs. But of course, Biden also condemned dangerous anti-transgender legislative attacks without citing actual evidence. Why?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, this raises the question, why do Democrats only condemn crimes that aren't happening? Instead of crimes that are? What about the attacks on elderly Asians or the random murders by homeless maniacs and liberal-run cities? Why doesn't Joe care about that (BLEEP) Could it be that the people feeding him this stuff don't care either? It's the Will Smith slap a politics. While we're talking about this, we are talking about the president needing crib notes to explain why he's trying to trigger World War III. So instead, let's focus our energy on a bill that forbids people from talking to five year olds about sex, when we should be asking why they're fighting to teach indoctrination, when they can't even teach math. Honestly, any adult that wants to indulge a five-year-old about sexual issues that they can't comprehend is the only good argument for remote learning. Delusions become dangerous when your president buys into it and Biden has. Just happy to finally be president. He's OK also being a vehicle for idiocy. And finally, there's this story, a medical student at the Wake Forest School of Medicine purposely missed a patient's vein. Because he giggled at the students she-her pronoun pin could. Kychelle Del Rosario bragged about it, posting, I had a patient I was doing a blood draw. See my pronoun pin and loudly laugh to the staff. She-her? Well, of course it is, what other pronouns even are there? It? So, I missed his vein so he had to get stuck twice. Well, she-her, sounds like a real (BLEEP) so there you go. Corporations, government people all acting irrationally, based on a belief that there's an epidemic about sterility towards gay and trans. It's not true. But sadly, what is true?

I got bounced out of the morning show but I did in the U.K. because Meghan Markle spewed a bunch of lies to Oprah Winfrey about a royal family. I said I don't believe you and was immediately accused of being racist. I don't believe somebody who was biracial. So, this is the way the world has gone. When you look at this Disney furor, in a way, it perfectly encapsulates how mad it's all gone. So, you've got Disney who we know stream all their content to countries where they behead people for being gay. We know that they are silent about the Chinese oppression of the Uyghur Muslims. But we're apparently supposed to believe that they've taken a position. A moral and strong position about this issue down in Florida. Where my god, it's so despicable. The governor has decided that kids of five, six, seven and eight should not be exposed to constant propaganda about their sexuality or genders at a time when there are no 100 genders, including apparently astragender which has an affinity to the stars and the planets. So, why would any parents object to a teacher teaching them that they can be astragender? It's all (BLEEP) and the idea that you can raise a quizzical eye or a concerned brow and say it (BLEEP) without being bounced around being called a transphob, I support -- I think probably most people in this country are tolerant and compassionate people.",

And these same groups are doing the same thing. Because then they will go to the group that they love to hate the most openly is old, white woke men and women and they'll go tell them their story. And they'll feel terrible and blame themselves and write huge amounts of checks. So, it's a money-making scheme. And so, they're never ever going to actually pick a real situation that people can look and go, well, actually, there is more hate crimes against older Asian women right now and women in general than there is these transgender things that you're talking about. So, they're not going to touch that because you can argue that. And so, they're just doing it until they get the big money and they get the marches and then you'll see that they're not helping the poor transgendered in the inner city who's afraid to come out because of the neighborhood they live in.

Even though they cost more to produce and are an abomination before God. And a letter he penned with PETA, using vegan paper and cruelty free Inc., McCartney writes, I understand that in other countries like U.K. and India there is the same charge for both types of milk. And I would like to politely to request that you consider this policy also in Starbucks USA. I sincerely hoped that for the future of the planet and animal welfare you're able to implement this policy.\" Now, when he's not ripping off the monkeys, McCartney has had long history of promoting a vegan lifestyle. And PETA claims cow's milk generates three times more greenhouse gas emissions and uses nine times more land than plant-based options. Well, you could say the same thing about human milk, but it just tastes better. Though if we're paying a little less for plant milk, I bet I can think of one guy who's all for it.",

Apple just announced it will require all employees to come to the office three days a week, starting May 23. Yes, three. You think everybody would be grateful over so much flexibility in their schedules? But like a two-year-old iPhone, people are threatening to quit. That was funny. Got one laugh. Well, \"I don't give a single (BLEEP) about ever coming back to work here,\" one employee wrote on a corporate message board with others agreeing that they would also be quitting. What do you expect from people who call their tech guys geniuses when everyone calls them hairy nerds? Now, I get that working at home can be more, a more pleasant experience; the toilet paper is definitely softer. But this may be a bit of an overreaction considering that employees in Apple's Chinese factories are still required to work 10 days a week, but they do get time off when they kill themselves. Tyrus, thoughts?",

I mean, when people suddenly believe something is happening, when it really isn't. And then they come after you if you refuse to play along. The left in this country right now is like that mentally-ill homeless guy screaming at someone on the sidewalk, but there's actually nobody there. But if you tell him nobody is there, he'll attack you for pointing out the reality of the situation. But with our media, such delusions are rewarded with attention and therefore incentivized. The latest delusion that Florida's parental rights bill is an attack on gay and trans people. And that somehow merely stating the distinction between male and female is an affront to them. But sorry, Disney. According to my data, 99.9 percent of gay and trans aren't offended by the terms, boys and girls. Where did I get that statistic? Where I get all my biology stats? The steam room at the 92nd Street Y. But sadly, all you need are a few unhinged voices and control of the blow horn. And by blow horn, I mean the mainstream and social media. Social media is now the vehicle for delusional contagions. Where attention start activist Diem words like boys and girls harmful. Sorry, these people are full of more (BLEEP) than a cage full of chimps with lactose intolerance. And I know that. But like the bubonic plague, it's a rodent spreading the problem. Take it away home of Mickey Mouse."

We are in the process of changing over those recorded messages and so many of you are probably familiar when we brought the fireworks back to the Magic Kingdom.

Most families aren't up to speed with this crap. And why? Because they're too busy working two jobs so they can put food on the table for their kids. And maybe one week a year take them to your stupid theme park and drop a couple grand. Watching a pantless duck speak gibberish. Watch out waste management. Disney's been making family entertainment for 99 years, but now they're switching to garbage It's happening in government too. While we face possible war soaring inflation and rapid crime, what's the White House concerned about? They announced that U.S. airport security procedures will become gender neutral. Yes. They're going to an X for travelers going through precheck who don't identify as male or female. But isn't X the female chromosome? Wait until someone complains about that. I just might. TSA officers will also receive new instructions to make procedures less invasive, which is sad, being married, I started to enjoy those pat downs.

What about the attacks on elderly Asians or the random murders by homeless maniacs and liberal-run cities? Why doesn't Joe care about that (BLEEP) Could it be that the people feeding him this stuff don't care either? It's the Will Smith slap a politics. While we're talking about this, we are talking about the president needing crib notes to explain why he's trying to trigger World War III. So instead, let's focus our energy on a bill that forbids people from talking to five year olds about sex, when we should be asking why they're fighting to teach indoctrination, when they can't even teach math. Honestly, any adult that wants to indulge a five-year-old about sexual issues that they can't comprehend is the only good argument for remote learning. Delusions become dangerous when your president buys into it and Biden has. Just happy to finally be president. He's OK also being a vehicle for idiocy. And finally, there's this story, a medical student at the Wake Forest School of Medicine purposely missed a patient's vein. Because he giggled at the students she-her pronoun pin could. Kychelle Del Rosario bragged about it, posting, I had a patient I was doing a blood draw. See my pronoun pin and loudly laugh to the staff. She-her? Well, of course it is, what other pronouns even are there? It? So, I missed his vein so he had to get stuck twice. Well, she-her, sounds like a real (BLEEP) so there you go. Corporations, government people all acting irrationally, based on a belief that there's an epidemic about sterility towards gay and trans. It's not true. But sadly, what is true?

So, if you take any kind of constructive critical approach to something was just patently ridiculous. Immediately you're branded. You're transphobic, homophobic or racist, whatever it may be. I got bounced out of the morning show but I did in the U.K. because Meghan Markle spewed a bunch of lies to Oprah Winfrey about a royal family. I said I don't believe you and was immediately accused of being racist. I don't believe somebody who was biracial. So, this is the way the world has gone. When you look at this Disney furor, in a way, it perfectly encapsulates how mad it's all gone. So, you've got Disney who we know stream all their content to countries where they behead people for being gay. We know that they are silent about the Chinese oppression of the Uyghur Muslims. But we're apparently supposed to believe that they've taken a position. A moral and strong position about this issue down in Florida. Where my god, it's so despicable. The governor has decided that kids of five, six, seven and eight should not be exposed to constant propaganda about their sexuality or genders at a time when there are no 100 genders, including apparently astragender which has an affinity to the stars and the planets. So, why would any parents object to a teacher teaching them that they can be astragender? It's all (BLEEP) and the idea that you can raise a quizzical eye or a concerned brow and say it (BLEEP) without being bounced around being called a transphob, I support -- I think probably most people in this country are tolerant and compassionate people."

They made it sound like they were there -- they were going to help black schools and poor neighborhoods but they didn't. They loaded up their own pocketbooks. They bought jets and planes and houses. And these same groups are doing the same thing. Because then they will go to the group that they love to hate the most openly is old, white woke men and women and they'll go tell them their story. And they'll feel terrible and blame themselves and write huge amounts of checks. So, it's a money-making scheme. And so, they're never ever going to actually pick a real situation that people can look and go, well, actually, there is more hate crimes against older Asian women right now and women in general than there is these transgender things that you're talking about. So, they're not going to touch that because you can argue that. And so, they're just doing it until they get the big money and they get the marches and then you'll see that they're not helping the poor transgendered in the inner city who's afraid to come out because of the neighborhood they live in. They're not going to -- they're not concerned with that but everyone who's doing it is in a power play position. And that's what this is really about."

Anyway, Sir Paul McCartney, the former lead singer of an Oasis cover band is urging Starbucks to digit surcharge on plant-based milk options. Even though they cost more to produce and are an abomination before God. And a letter he penned with PETA, using vegan paper and cruelty free Inc., McCartney writes, I understand that in other countries like U.K. and India there is the same charge for both types of milk. And I would like to politely to request that you consider this policy also in Starbucks USA. I sincerely hoped that for the future of the planet and animal welfare you're able to implement this policy.\" Now, when he's not ripping off the monkeys, McCartney has had long history of promoting a vegan lifestyle. And PETA claims cow's milk generates three times more greenhouse gas emissions and uses nine times more land than plant-based options. Well, you could say the same thing about human milk, but it just tastes better. Though if we're paying a little less for plant milk, I bet I can think of one guy who's all for it."

And then reminds him that his own press department walked back what he actually said, and then gets out of Biden, a firm denial of ever saying, either what he originally was saying, or actually having a walk back to what he originally said, is a form of journalistic genius. And I'm a huge fan of D.C. He just -- he's you know, he's like this sort of devil figure that they portray who creeps out and just asks proper questions. The problem with Colbert and the other guys have is, they were all collapsing before Trump came along. He was doing really badly in the ratings. He was going to lose his gig. And suddenly Trump comes and they all go full on Trump bashing. So, the New York Times did it five times subscriptions, called Vanity, gets the number one on the ratings. Everybody else follows that lead. They're all pounding Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, bang, bang, bang, and it works. But of course, like all drugs, eventually the effects start to wear off. Now Trump's not in power. All their ratings have collapsed or their circulations are collapsing. CNN, where I used to work, where you never used to be part of them, drank the anti-Trump Kool-Aid so much that now he's not there, they've completely disintegrated in the ratings."

You think everybody would be grateful over so much flexibility in their schedules? But like a two-year-old iPhone, people are threatening to quit. That was funny. Got one laugh. Well, \"I don't give a single (BLEEP) about ever coming back to work here,\" one employee wrote on a corporate message board with others agreeing that they would also be quitting. What do you expect from people who call their tech guys geniuses when everyone calls them hairy nerds? Now, I get that working at home can be more, a more pleasant experience; the toilet paper is definitely softer. But this may be a bit of an overreaction considering that employees in Apple's Chinese factories are still required to work 10 days a week, but they do get time off when they kill themselves.
