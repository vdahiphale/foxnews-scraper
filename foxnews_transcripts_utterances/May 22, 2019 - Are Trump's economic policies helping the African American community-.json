And meanwhile what has Pelosi actually accomplished. What had she done, except complain, threaten? And think about this like the USMCA. Remember that was supposed to replace NAFTA. That took more than a year of serious good faith negotiations. United States, Canada, Mexico.

WEST: I think that the statistics certainly look good through a narrow lens. So, I give him credit in that regard. But we have to keep in mind that on the one hand you still have grotesque wealth, inequality, you have job insecurity, so many people who are working or working more than one job. We know many people who have withdrawn from the labor force are not counting at all. But I think the problem is though my dear sister is that the President has a language that creates an atmosphere that is so xenophobic against black folk, Mexican, Muslims. He rarely wants to stay in contact with their humanity. So, when you look at the statistics that's one thing. But when you create an atmosphere, an ambience of xenophobia, it reinforces the polarization and therefore many black folk wouldn't even be able to connect the statistics that look good with the language, the atmosphere that feels so bad in that cold hearted mean spiritedness, it's something that cuts very, very deep in the spirit of people, including myself.",

Well, because he's on the road to uncovering just how high up the corruption went at the Obama DOJ. And since Barr appointed Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham to conduct this investigation, Democrats have been turning themselves inside and out on the issue of impeachment. And after the dust up with Trump today, Pelosi ramped up the accusations against Trump throwing acid on the open wound that is their relationship."

And yet Speaker Pelosi today is catering to her ever-radical caucus by dangling the red meat of impeachment in front of them. Now, I still remember maybe some of you do as well when Democrats actually cared about issues like the abuse of government authority. The overreach of the surveillance state. The presumption of innocence. But all of that went out the window. All of those principles when key figures in the Obama DOJ became obsessed to their core, every fiber of their being with taking out Trump. I am now convinced that these are just totally unserious people upon Capitol Hill. They're more interested in grandstanding in the Democrat Party than doing almost anything constructive for the people who put them there. No office. Think though about Trump, despite everything that he's been through. I mean the investigations, all the accusations, he was a trader, he was working with Putin, all these ridiculous charges. He pushed through policies that have revved up this economy, that have resulted in increased wages, stoking manufacturing jobs, consumer confidence way up. And meanwhile what has Pelosi actually accomplished. What had she done, except complain, threaten? And think about this like the USMCA. Remember that was supposed to replace NAFTA. That took more than a year of serious good faith negotiations. United States, Canada, Mexico. And yet Pelosi, she won't even bring it up for a vote nor is she going to do what's necessary to address the crisis at the border, which is beyond disturbing. No asylum reform from her. No additional money for judges to fast track hearings. No money for beds or of any place to put unaccompanied minors or family unit, so they're spilling out of Border Patrol facilities that are never intended to house them. But what does her caucus do? Well, what they do is what she taught them. Finger point and then accuse members of Trump's cabinet."

And then the good that gets even better, they spew poison and lash Trump officials who are operating under the law that they refuse to change or reform. And disabuse you of this notion that the Democrats actually really to their core care about what happens to these kids. If they did, they would allocate the money without question for beds and facilities to take care of these children, who came no fault of their own. But just like they don't care about really working with the President in good faith on infrastructure. They don't really care about those kids. Instead what do they do.

We looked into the scandal that was fast and furious where there was gunrunning and an agent, a border agent lost his life because of that. We looked into the fact that when the tragedy in Benghazi happened and they tried to say well, it was the catalyst for that was some crazy video, we looked into that.

And I want to begin with a simple question Dr. West, are the President's policies, let's just focus now on his economic policies, are they helping the African American community in your view. WEST: I think that the statistics certainly look good through a narrow lens. So, I give him credit in that regard. But we have to keep in mind that on the one hand you still have grotesque wealth, inequality, you have job insecurity, so many people who are working or working more than one job. We know many people who have withdrawn from the labor force are not counting at all. But I think the problem is though my dear sister is that the President has a language that creates an atmosphere that is so xenophobic against black folk, Mexican, Muslims. He rarely wants to stay in contact with their humanity. So, when you look at the statistics that's one thing. But when you create an atmosphere, an ambience of xenophobia, it reinforces the polarization and therefore many black folk wouldn't even be able to connect the statistics that look good with the language, the atmosphere that feels so bad in that cold hearted mean spiritedness, it's something that cuts very, very deep in the spirit of people, including myself."

I have no problem with it. And I wouldn't call you mean spirited. We disagree, but I think if you actually were with the President, you might find that you could accomplish a lot together and you could do a lot together. I really believe that. He'll work with pretty much anybody and that's what I found in my experience. So, I'm just throwing that out there. Candace. But there is this tonality issue that people seize on with the President and let's go back to Charlottesville. They always go back to this SL countries.

He hasn't offered us hot sauce; he's offered us jobs. That makes many people uncomfortable because they're from an era where race hustling is a business. They're used to telling black Americans that they're victims, writing books about victimhood and that is no longer selling in America. And I just wanted to comment back on saying that xenophobia is something that black Americans are afraid of. Xenophobia means that you have a fear, Mr. West of foreigners. Black Americans are not foreigners in this country. We are a piece of the American dream. We've earned a piece of this American dream. And we're getting tired people telling us that we are somehow separate of it. I mean that's really what I have to say. We're doing tremendous under this presidency. There is no candidate that is offering anything on the left to counter what Trump has offered. They're just offering more rhetoric, more fearmongering and unfortunately, time is up on this narrative.

They found that \"anti-black prejudice declined by statistically and significant decree between 2012 and 2016. But then after 2016, it took a sharp dive.

It's something that has impact on the ground, and I give the President credit for that is not as if he has nothing to offer. It just that the dominant orientation is still tied to what I'm critical of both parties, because identity politics for me is milk toast, liberal politics that don't talk about corporate, don't talk about poverty and talk about militarism. But the Republicans still strike me as so cold hearted, mean spirited and they're still tied to corporate power and Wall Street and won't hit poverty head on, but when it comes to prison, when it comes to statistics, I give the President credit for that."
