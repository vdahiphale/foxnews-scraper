And if the House can approve it, they have got $1.2 trillion in spending.

The tax and spend bill, human infrastructure, you want to call that, Democrats do, $3.5 trillion. There are costs to it. Plus, there are programs in there that expire over a certain amount of time, but during that time the people who are getting those programs really would like to keep them. So that's a challenge in the long term. Let's bring in our panel, former education secretary Bill Bennett, Byron York, chief political correspondent of \"The Washington Examiner,\" and Juan Williams is a FOX News analyst. Bill, this really is hanging by a thread, and just doing the vote counting, and there is a lot of different calculations on the Hill, it look like the bipartisan infrastructure bill could go down if progressives really say we have got to do the reconciliation bill first."

She often pulls these things out with a vote or two, but she often has a larger margin than this. But if I could just say, a lot of nerve, chutzpah here, the part of the Democrat Party to be pushing these kinds of bills when we are looking at surrender in Afghanistan and what that means, invasion at the southern border, all sorts of other problems internationally. And they want to go and spend money we don't have to increase inflation. It's just crazy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Byron, just moments ago, Speaker Pelosi said it's still the plan to go forward with the bipartisan vote tomorrow. We'll see. We'll see. That's still the plan right now. Does the president want to go forward with it? You will have to ask the president. There is a lot of iffy wording here about how this process is going to go. But the bottom line is that there is a real battle between moderates and progressives over this. BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Absolutely. And if they put it off again, that will mean they just don't have the votes. But the very fact that Speaker Pelosi wants to vote on this traditional infrastructure bill, the bipartisan infrastructure bill this week, is a surrender for Speaker Pelosi and for the president. Remember, not that long ago the president goes out and issues a veto threat for the bipartisan infrastructure bill that he has just encouraged the Senate to sign because it had to be held hostage to this bigger tax and spend bill, the human infrastructure bill, $3.5 trillion. So now cooler heads have prevailed, and Democrats are looking at $1.2 trillion. It has already made it through the Senate. The bottleneck it got through. And if the House can approve it, they have got $1.2 trillion in spending. So it seems very unlikely to me that in the long run, and by that I mean in the next few days, Democrats are actually going to pass up the opportunity to put into law $1.2 trillion in new spending."

      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Right, and so far the problem is that the Democrats in the Senate, well, here I'm referencing Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, the so-called moderates, haven't said here's what we will buy. And that's the problem. That's the holdup, because the progressives want that number. I'm tempted here to quote Will Rogers, Bret, who said I'm not a member of any organized party. I'm a Democrat. And this arguing and the squabbling, it's loud. It's public. At times it's volatile. But this is how sausage gets made in Washington all the time, and the question is whether or not you finally put it into a package and present it to the public. And Nancy Pelosi's time as speaker, most of the time the plane lands and the passengers are cheering. But I must say, I agree with my colleagues tonight. I think this is looking very messy, and it's petering, it's on an edge, and it's making a lot of Democrats very nervous."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "There is a lot of shuttle diplomacy between the White House and Capitol Hill, the speaker, the Senate majority leader up in the Oval Office. Staff went to Kyrsten Sinema's office. Joe Manchin has been back and forth. He put out a statement, which was pretty telling in and of itself, saying \"All of us regardless of party must ask the simple question, how much is enough? What I have made clear to the president and Democratic leaders is that spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs when we can't even pay for the essential social programs like Social Security and Medicare is the definition of fiscal insanity.\" This is Joe Manchin. \"Suggesting that spending trillions more will not have an impact on inflation ignores the everyday reality that America's families continue to pay an unavoidable inflation tax. I cannot and will not support trillions in spending or an all or nothing approach that ignores the brutal fiscal reality that our nation faces.\" Bill, that does not sound like a guy who is moments away from being swayed into voting for the big package."

      "speaker": "BENNETT",

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Byron, just wrapping up on these two days of hearings about Afghanistan. The House today, the Senate yesterday, \"The Wall Street Journal\" writes it this way about the Biden accountability. \"The scandal isn't that the president ignored military advice -- he's is the decision- maker. It's his refusal to own his decision. Mr. Biden wants political credit for ending America's involvement in Afghanistan, but he is not willing to take the political risk admitting he overruled the brass in the process. The Afghan withdrawal is the greatest U.S. foreign policy humiliation in decades. The damage is made worse by the failure of accountability starting with the commander-in-chief.\" We spent two days really getting to that, the thrust of those questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, I do think the headline from yesterday in the Senate and today in the House is this conflict between what the generals told us, General McKenzie and General Milley told us, and what President Biden told us a few weeks ago in that ABC interview in which the generals say they gave their best advice, which was the U.S. should keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. If they were withdrawn, not only could the Afghan defense forces collapse, the whole government could collapse, which is exactly what's happened. And then we have the president saying, on camera he does not recall anyone ever telling him that. So this is something the president is absolutely going to have to talk about, and that will mean, as you just suggested, he is going to have to address this, not in a speech to the nation, but sitting down and taking real questions and follow-up questions about what he did, why, and when."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And quickly, Juan. They are saying, the White House is saying, listen, he is ending this war, although listening to that testimony, the war is not over, and General Milley testified today that in six months, Al- Qaeda and ISIS could regain a big foothold inside Afghanistan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's all true. But I think that going into this week we were thinking there is going to be some huge rift between the military leaders and the White House, the Biden White House. We really didn't get that rift. Nobody threatened to resign. Nobody said that the president acted without hearing what they had to say. And I think General Milley, all the attacks on him for talking to these writers, he came off as saying, you know what, I acted in terms of my command. I acted openly, and I acted in accord with the Constitution. I think the military came out of this looking pretty good. And we'll see what happens in terms of the Biden-Pentagon relationship."
