With his name, Ralph Northam at the top of this yearbook page. Just within the past hour, I should say, he acknowledged that he is one of the men in this photo. Releasing a statement that reads in part, \"I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo. For the hurt, that decision caused then and now.

It shows two men, one wearing blackface, the other dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. With his name, Ralph Northam at the top of this yearbook page. Just within the past hour, I should say, he acknowledged that he is one of the men in this photo. Releasing a statement that reads in part, \"I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo. For the hurt, that decision caused then and now. This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values that I have fought for throughout my career.\" Joining me now is Xochitl Hinojosa, communications director for the Democratic National Committee. Xochitl, very -- thank you for being here tonight. And we had other topic that we want to cover with you. We're going to try to get a little bit of that in, as well.

And I think that in these proposals, what you're talking about is people that are making $10 million, 50 million. I don't know about you, Martha, but if I were making $50 million, I would be OK with giving some of that money to education and to healthcare. And to people who need it the most. And so, I really excited about the debate that we are going to have in our primary to talk about all of the issues. And the best way to make sure that we're lowering taxes for the middle class.

But he's not going to have that infrastructure, and you can build it overnight. Democrats won in November, and we won races up and down the ticket not only that, but we flipped the House. You can't do that overnight, it took building our party Winning in Virginia, it took winning in Alabama, it took making sure that Conor Lamb was elected in Pennsylvania.

So, we're going to watch your vote very closely on Monday night. You know, with regard to the discussion that we were having also about, about Howard Schultz and the kind of things that he's saying. Because he's saying that this kind of stance is so far out of the American mainstream that he feels like there's a place for someone in the middle. And in some ways, it lines up with some of what you have been talking about over the course of the last couple of years as well. And Marc Thiessen wrote about this today. He said, \"Both sides have decided that the way to win is no longer to persuade those in the middle, but rather to throw red meat at the hardcore supporters and get them worked up, more worked up than those on the other side. Lost in the shuffle are millions of reasonable persuadable citizens who are left to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.\" He's saying there's a new class of forgotten men and women.

So, I think we should be talking not about 2019 and 2020. We should be talking about 2030 and 2040. We should talking about the future of work. We should -- we're talking about the future of war and cyber. We should be talking about whether or not we're passing along an American understanding of the First Amendment to our kids. And frankly, on stuff like this, where you get this governor in Virginia, defending infanticide, this shouldn't be Republican versus Democrat. This is just American, this is just human to believe that little babies who survived an abortion they deserve care and protection. That this town, Washington, D.C. is filled with a whole bunch of weirdoes, who are addicted to screaming all the time. And I think most Americans believe that the architectural most important stuff we believe with ought to unite us all. And one of them is the Governor Northam, ought to get the heck out of public life.

Our conclusion was this it is an alarming conclusion is that if we had to fight a war with either one of them today while the United States military is still primacy, the evaporation of our capabilities have been so severe that the amount of personal casualties to high-value assets and to people would be on a level not seen since the Korean War in World War Two. Not only that, Martha, that we would indeed struggle to win and could possibly lose. The Admiral in the Pacific who just took over out there who would have to fight a war against China a few months ago said this. We would struggle today to win a war against China.

Smollett says early Tuesday morning he grabbed a sandwich at a Subway store in the Streeterville neighborhood near downtown Chicago. He was walking home talking on his cell phone to his manager when two men wearing ski masks attacked him. He says they punched him, yelled racist and homophobic insults, poured a chemical substance on him that he thinks is bleach and tied a thin white rope around his neck. The 36-year-old actor later amended his story saying his attackers also yelled this is MAGA country, a reference to the President's make America great again slogan. When police arrived at his home 42 minutes later, he was still wearing the rope to preserve evidence. Now, so far Chicago Police have scanned hundreds of hours of surveillance video from 20 different cameras in the area. They have found footage of Smollett making his way home including video of him at his building with the rope around his neck but no video of an attack or of the suspects Smollett describes. Though there is video of two possible people of interest, police also have not found any chemical or bleach container in the area and our Fox affiliate is now reporting that Chicago Police say in the video of Smollett in front of his building, he is still holding his sandwich. Jussie Smollett also refusing to give police his cell phone to verify that he was on the phone with his manager during the attack though the manager has confirmed that. Today, Smollett issued a statement saying in part \"I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level.

And because of the way that our constitution works, your child becomes a permanent resident -- permanent citizen, I should say So, the challenge for us is how do we address this? How do we keep these folks either out of the country initially? So that starts with the State Department, right, the visa process. Clearly, that is broken.

You know, when you look at this situation and how to crack down on it, as you say, they basically done it through legal loopholes that exist. And one of the things that I get the biggest kick out of is sort of the way that they teach people how to take advantage of this, like travel, you know, before you are too obviously pregnant.

Then you start to crack down on them that way. Certainly, the consular officers and the embassy officers in different places around the world they are our first line of defense. That's not working.

I mean, that amendment, that process of amending the constitution obviously, it's a tough one.

Irrespective of your party affiliation, we hope you should agree to that. The trick to your question is when somebody comes across the border illegally, perhaps doesn't even know that they are pregnant, do we have extend a degree of compassion for those people or more specifically those kids? Now, I would argue that I think that we can still tighten that down. We can still reject those women who come in and do that because every day the State Department works with the countries around the world to repatriate, that is to send people back to their home country to include these kids.

But the main challenge is it's an incredibly crowded field. And I don't know if this is Cory Booker's moment, but I am glad that he is there pushing the dialogue forward. I thought that he handled that very well today on The View to talk about culture. So many people feel that we are just nasty to each other and just trying to pull each other down and get that sound bite. So, I think he is going to push the dialogue forward.
