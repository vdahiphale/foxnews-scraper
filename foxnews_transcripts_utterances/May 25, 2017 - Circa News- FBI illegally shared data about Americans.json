Now, if they talk about it and put it in emails, then that leak expansion could be a little bit wider, a little bit bigger but still according to my sources, it's very narrow. Another thing that I believe can be done is that congress right now is planning on investigating this. Remember, Section 702 is coming up for review. This FISA section 702 which allows the NSA to basically collect information on non-U.S. citizens overseas and those incidental intercepts are happening where they are collecting Americans information as well. It's coming for review at the end of the year.

The race is now in the national spotlight after the Republican candidate, Greg Gianforte, allegedly body slammed a reporter last night. But first, our top story. President Trump on the world stage meeting with European leaders at the new NATO headquarters in Brussels.

But 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they are supposed to be paying for their defense. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States. And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years."

This comes after President Trump responded to British complaints about intelligence leaks in the United States by saying the federal government will launch a complete review. President Trump promised to, quote, \"get to the bottom of this.\" Plus, there are new questions about selective intelligence leaks aimed at damaging the Trump administration. There are new reports tonight that Jared Kushner, the president's son-in- law and senior adviser, is now under FBI scrutiny in the Russia investigation. According to The Wall Street Journal, Kushner's lawyers said he will fully cooperate. Here now with reaction to tonight's breaking news is former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer and American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us tonight on this busy breaking news evening. Matt, I'll begin with you. What is your reaction to President Trump calling out NATO members for not paying their fair share?"

And I actually think it's kind of refreshing in diplomatic circles to have an American leader just be very direct and very honest. There was a period of time in our recent history where America was so dominant and so big and we were so optimistic about our economic leadership that we could cavalierly just pay for things all over the globe and shed our jobs. And I think Trump has connected with the American people who say, you know, we have lost so much about America that it's time for us to stand up for what's in our interests. It is in our interests to have a strong NATO, but it's the right thing to do for everybody to fulfill their commitments."

When you sign up to belong to an alliance and one of the terms for signing up is that you are supposed to spend 2 percent of your budget on defense, that way we are all strung together, and you don't do it, you're mooching. You're freeloading. You're freeloading off of the only five nations of 28 who do pay. So I was very supportive of Donald Trump doing it. It's a message they need to hear. He needs to break some glass. I would have added one other element. All 28 were standing in front of me, I'd have singled out the four others in addition to the United States who are paying. I would say thank you to the United Kingdom, thank you to Greece, thank you, Estonia, thank you, Poland. And send that signal. I'm not thanking the other 23."

After the Manchester terror attack, you know, isn't President Trump right to continue this push for NATO to do more to fight terrorists? It's not just about your financial obligation, but put some skin in the game here!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely right. Think about how all of a sudden, the military flooded the streets throughout the United Kingdom after this happened. And the U.K. does spend 2 percent or more on defense. But in the other nations, Germany, a wealthy nation, Italy, a wealthy nation, France, a wealthy nation -- why aren't they doing it? They certainly could, but they choose not to because they'd rather spend their money on welfare programs and welfare payments. It's part of the Western European tradition of being quasi-socialist and very expensive and lavish. Well, that means you're not paying what they're supposed to for defense, and it hurts all of us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, once again, I think what President Trump ran on is this idea that we're no longer just going to shed our jobs and our economic opportunity for strategic relationships and purposes. It's going to be about America standing up for what's right for America. So he's got to level-set with these other first world nations about the fact that we want to do business together. We want to have free trade. We want to do commerce together. But he's going to aggressively be a cheerleader for the American point of view. Don't expect America to pick up all the bills, like Ari was talking about, to be the world's patsy. We're going to do what's in our interests, and it's about time we did that. And I think that's going to be part of his message."

    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Certainly. You know, Ari, a lot has been discussed now in terms of the travel ban, extreme vetting. And when we think about this, what has happened here, this very horrifying example in terms of Manchester and what happened and the bombing there, people are looking at this, saying, Wait a second, maybe President Trump I think is onto something in terms of looking at the countries that have been impacted, the travel that allegedly this individual had back and forth from Libya, et cetera."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm in a different place on this one, Kimberly. I just have to say it. When Donald Trump was candidate and he did call it a Muslim ban then, I publicly opposed it. I thought it was the wrong thing to do. And now that it's revised and it's changed around, I'm still not supportive of it with the exception of Syria, where there is no government. We can't possibly vet who's coming..."

    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "...because there's no infrastructure to check some of these names. But for most of those other nations, I don't like that approach. I would much rather keep America being the nation that other nations, other people want to come to. And we can vet them. We should vet them. But I want America to be the nation that's the light of the world, the best nation on earth. People would want to come here, and that would include Muslims. So I'm in a different spot on that. I think you can vet and you can do it in a way that protects our country."

It doesn't do us any good when we destabilize our security because in the interests -- some positive notion we allow people in who could be jihadists. And I think that's what's the bottom line here, which is you have an out-of-control liberal court system which too often puts its values instead of the constitutional values on these decisions. And the fact is, is this. They're using President Trump's rhetoric on the campaign, which Ari alluded to -- got pretty fiery on this topic, but they're using his rhetoric on the campaign..."

However, it is very early in the night. As you mentioned, the polls just closed. But it has been an incredibly tense 24 hours for everyone here in this state, especially for Greg Gianforte because as you mentioned, we were standing in the room and preparing for an interview with the GOP candidate when the Guardian reporter came in, Ben Jacobs, and started asking him questions. And when Gianforte pushed back and said he'll do it later, Jacobs persisted. And that's when Gianforte grabbed him, threw him to the ground, started punching him, telling him he was sick and tired of it. And at that point, that's when Jacobs tried to kind of get his composure, said his glasses were broken and that he was calling the police. Kimberly, I can tell you I was standing there 2 to 3 feet from these two men when this happened. I was also in the room with our photographer from Fox News, Keith Railey, as well as Faith Mangan. She's a Fox News Channel producer. We were shocked. None of us had ever seen anything like that in response to a reporter coming in and asking questions -- Kimberly."

But the really sad thing about all of it is that if it had -- had it happened earlier, it might have helped the candidate because people -- their opinion of the press these days is so incredibly low. But just look at that montage you just showed. You know, when you look at that stuff and you realize these are people who are supposed to be the first defenders of our free speech rights and they don't know the difference between Donald Trump complaining about the press, ridiculing the press and then some wacko who attacks a reporter and tries to beat him up during an interview -- the fact that they don't realize the difference between those two things I think reveals exactly why so many Americans despise the press."

There were people in the room. They thought they reported accurately. As you said, it should have never happened. We should have heard from President Trump about this, not just \"no comment.\" But he should have said something, especially since he made robocalls about it. And they should be saying exactly what Charlie said, which is this guy is a wacko, and he's probably not fit for office. But with 65 percent of the vote in already and high Republican numbers, chances are that he is going to get elected. And we'll find out in a few hours about that.

Or the other thing they say is, We don't believe what anybody is reporting and so we don't think we have the full story. And so I'm going to keep an open mind and I'm still supporting this guy.

What they said was that the FBI was illegally sharing warrantless spy data. That means they did not have a warrant, and they were sharing it with third parties. And in one case, they shared it with a party. They didn't explain who the party was, but it was a forbidden party, a party that was not allowed to have this type of raw intelligence. Another thing that they stated was that not only did they do that, but they were intercepting communications -- attorney-client privilege communications without oversight."

And the more that dig into the spying that went on in the Obama administration and these expansion of powers, the more we see that the 4th Amendment has been abused or certainly put at risk. And I think one of the things that -- you ask -- a lot of times, you hear a lot of talk in Washington about all these leaks. Where do they come from? But the more you pass this stuff down -- it goes from the NSA to the FBI, then the FBI to private citizens -- that's how you're going to get a trail of leaks. And I think that if they want to stop this, they've got to tighten it up."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Well, there's a couple of things that they can do, Kimberly. We know right now that they're going to launch a massive investigation into the leaks. It's going to be very interesting to see where these leaks came from. I believe that some of these leaks came from very high up because some of the information, for example, when you are dealing with Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, that would have been a very small number of people that would have had access to those tax cuts. Now, if they talk about it and put it in emails, then that leak expansion could be a little bit wider, a little bit bigger but still according to my sources, it's very narrow. Another thing that I believe can be done is that congress right now is planning on investigating this. Remember, Section 702 is coming up for review. This FISA section 702 which allows the NSA to basically collect information on non-U.S. citizens overseas and those incidental intercepts are happening where they are collecting Americans information as well. It's coming for review at the end of the year. Darrell Issa, Trent Franks, others who've spoken to I say that they are going to look at this law, they're going to end -- some of them aren't even going to vote for it unless it's revised."

      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, CIRCA NEWS",
      "utterance": "It does. 2011. Barack Obama changed the rules and ever since that time we saw a tripling of the sort of spying on Americans going on and now we see these leaks and violation. And I think an unusual coalition is going to together. You're going to see the ACLU and conservatives agreeing on something for the first time and trying to fix this one as a bill comes up for a renewal this fall."

We have a capabilities gap at NATO right now where some countries are coming under the NATO umbrella and they're not really able to give militarily. So, they're coming under umbrella take get the protection. And what we need to do is work on the capabilities gap so that every country is pulling their weight.

But if we're going to talk about terrorism and we're going to talk about teaching other countries how to deal with terrorists and we have a capabilities gap at NATO, why not make Israel a part of NATO? They are one of the countries that every country could learn from in terms of how do you deal with terrorists? And I think NATO is got to be thinking differently about these issues. If you're going to make NATO of course blocking Russia, that's a standard, that's a 100 percent number one priority. But we also have to update its mission. And we have to think differently about NATO. One of the other things too, Kimberly, is that we should not have countries calculating their pensions towards defense spending. That's a social program. They are important but it shouldn't calculate towards your two percent of defense spending when you talk about military pensions."

There's a bigger issue here which Chancellor Merkel spoke about today with her little friend, President Obama talked where they talk about open borders. This is an issue that obviously in many of these countries in Europe that they're not willing to accept the reality that if they hone in on an agenda where it is about open borders and not controlling the migrants who are coming in and the refugees who were coming in, not knowing who is coming to their country, that is a fundamental problem. NATO can't solve the problem, the United States can't solve that problem. And this is why if they can't track these individuals, for example, in the case of the Manchester bomber who was traveling to Libya, who was going to Syria, where there are these red flags everywhere but they viewed him as sort of a minor figure and not an immediate threat. I think that there's a very clear reality right now that if the European leaders do not under - do not take this seriously in terms of understanding who is coming in and out of their country, that I think is a bigger issue, Kimberly."

America wants to secure its borders, America wants to have legal immigration, people actually complying with the laws that are on the books, respecting the constitution, what's wrong with this? When all of a sudden the United States become the bad guy and all of this?"

      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, it's been fascinating to watch. It's obviously how the courts have ruled on the travel for the president. You know, clearly what they're doing is rather than focusing on what the words are within the law, they decided to go back to Trump -- President Trump's campaign statements and use that as part of their argument to uphold the injunction on the travel ban. But here's the reality that we have which is the fact that you saw former FBI Director James Comey, former Obama administration officials basically very concerned about the fact that you can't vet individuals coming into the United States from Syria."

      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "There's not - U.S. soldiers on the ground that basically are collecting the information of the - of the local population. It makes it incredibly difficult to ensure that people who are as we know ISIS had said that they want to infiltrate through the refugee program. It makes it very difficult I think for the United States to handle these situations when you're talking about countries of concern which is what President Obama pushed through in terms of these seven or six countries that President Obama used in his executive - in his travel ban."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Absolutely. I want to shift gears a little bit here because we are actually going to extend into the next hour because we're waiting results in the Montana special election and The Associated Press is reporting it is a tight race indeed. And after reports of last night's altercation between Gianforte and a reporter, how do we think that might impact the results? So, I want to just get your take on this, Rick and Mercedes. I mean, Rick, obviously this is being closely watched with the breaking news of that physical altercation. This is a seat that matters to Republicans. What are you expecting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRENELL",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think that if everybody was voting after they heard this news, we'd have a different result."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRENELL",
      "utterance": "I hear two-thirds of the voters had already voted in early voting. It's one of the issues why - you know, I have been a part of a lot of campaigns and it's one of the issues why early voting obviously has its advantages but in certain situations, it has its disadvantages. When new information comes out, when some sort of scandal erupts, if you voted too early then don't have the benefit of this knowledge. So, I think this race would be very different if we had everybody voting at the same time. After the fact on Election Day. I mean, clearly Alicia Acuna's first-hand account to me made the difference. She was there. She saw what happened. And I just think that it's unacceptable to ever put your hands around anyone for any reason."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Right. And there's been a lot of equivocation and explaining back and forth and finger pointing about this issue. Mercedes, obviously this is an important seat to the Republicans but you can't discount what happened here and as Rick, you know, points out, there was eyewitness - percipient witnesses right there to say exactly what happened. And you heard the report from our very own Alicia Acuna, one of our camera people and also producer that was there and saw what transpired. There was also some issue as to whether or not there was an inconsistent statement, you know, put out by Gianforte's press team, you know, on this, Mercedes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "I do believe that if Gianforte would have come out with an apology early on, I think it could have definitely been to his benefit. I think in him wait -- for him to wait and not state an apology but kind of push back on the argument was weak. It didn't help him. Now, at the end, I do believe this is, you know, what - this is a safe Republican seat, although I believe it's a - very -- right now it's a very tight race based on the shock value on the last 24 hours of what we've seen. I do believe Gianforte will win. I - but I do believe that it's been unfortunate circumstances and really, I think it's a lesson to candidates all out there. Even when, you know, the temperature is high in a political campaign and there's tension, the last thing you need to do his body slam a reporter. There's enough body slamming that's going on in congress. Use your energy for fighting the Democrats in Congress. Not going after reporters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, Rick, this is really unbelievable. Talk about like a fumble at the, you know, first and goal here. I mean, really a big problem. And by the way, here's what bothers me the most about I, is that people are actually trying to tie this to President Trump and say that this is his fault."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRENELL",
      "utterance": "Yes. That's crazy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "That he created this narrative. That he has encouraged this kind of language, behavior, assaultive conduct against members of the press. That to me is just like, wow, astonishing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRENELL",
      "utterance": "I think at it's astonishing too. And, you know, this seat is going to be a problem for rRpublicans if Gianforte wins. It's going to be a problem for Speaker Paul Ryan. I think that it would be best if the NRCC sea and others came out and just simply said this is unacceptable, violence is never OK. Distance themselves from this before he - you know, before people started voting. One of the best things could -- that could happen for the Republicans would be for him to lose and then they not have this --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "No, I disagree, Rick. I disagree with you. You know how it is with these members of Congress. They bundle up. No one will remember who Gianforte is in two years. You know, if he's going to be - he'll try to do his work as being a congressman of Montana but we'll forget his name soon enough. But - no, I disagree. I think it's important --"

      "utterance": "I would agree with you --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "And I think, you know, it was unfortunate incident. It should have never happened. You know, I wish he would've apologized early on but we need the Republican in Congress in order to stop the Democrats. That's clearly the casing point here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRENELL",
      "utterance": "Sure. I think we need -- I certainly want the Republicans to win. That's not - that's not my point. But I think it would be different if he had some sort of financial scandal or if he was, you know, caught doing something where he had to come out --"

You know, what it did, it just -- it forced me out of my comfort zone and into a world where - what I like to say as Aaron fought for this country kinetically and I decided after his death that it was obligation to fight for this country culturally. So that's what I started doing. I started fighting for the A reform, I primarily started firing for reform and rules of engagement for our war fighters. But then the love of my life finally came to culmination when I got to start writing this book because I captured so many stories about Aaron and so many memories. And when I put it all together, I realize I had written something that could actually help parents across this country learn how to raise kids who were formidable, strong, gritty, confidence children who can overcome obstacles like Aaron did."

You know, you see it throughout their life. You - and there are steps that we can take as parents to make that happen.
