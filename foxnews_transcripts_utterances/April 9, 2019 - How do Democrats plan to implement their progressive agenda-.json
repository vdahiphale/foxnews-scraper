      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to the “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Here's a helpful hint about how your government works. We're full of helpful hints on this show. If you ever see consensus forming in Washington run, something awful is about to happen. For decades, you will remember there was total consensus that our trade deals could not be better. They helped everyone. Meanwhile, as they were telling us that, America's manufacturing sector died and huge parts of the middle class died along with it. Then it was bipartisan consensus on the Iraq War and the stock piles of weapons of mass destruction we'd supposedly find there, but didn't. A few years later, there was consensus on banking regulations that was just before the financial crisis hit. Then there was still more consensus on the creation of an all seeing surveillance state that was supposed to somehow help you, but that is now scanning your face and reading your texts. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There wasn't much debate in Washington about any of those policies. There should have been. So it was with was some skepticism that we note a new consensus forming here. This one about our southern border. It may look bad down there, they're telling us, but calm down, it's fine. Everything is just fine. That's the new word for Max Boot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Boot is a columnist for Jeff Bezos, his newspaper. But more than that, Boot is the living repository of every warmed over cliche, every silly half-truth, every stale scrap of stupid conventional wisdom the buffoons who run this place have thought up recently. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So here's the latest.

He has called for the U.S. to topple the Saudi monarchy. And of course, like so many neo-cons, Boot fell headlong into the Russia conspiracy nuttiness for more than two excruciating years. It's hard to think of anyone in this country more discredited than Max Boot. Going to him for foreign policy advice is like giving Jeffrey Dahmer a cooking show. He'd be the last person you would ask. So of course, Max Boot now has gigs at CNN, \"The Washington Post\" and the Council on Foreign Relations, because that's how Washington really works. The key is never apologize, never admit fault no matter what. Watch Max Boot explain that the idea of toppling the Libyan government, which was deranged, was in fact brilliant.

We can't think about these as being kind of quick in and out engagements. We send some troops, kill some people and then come back home to a victory parade; sadly, it doesn't work that way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Boot didn't explain how exactly it does work, he didn't need to explain.

For perspective, there are only 195 countries total on the entire planet. We're almost everywhere. This map might give you a sense of the scale of it. Keep in mind there is no World War currently in progress. This is what we've signed up for in peacetime. And yet, you may notice that there was one place American troops are not. They are not on our southern border protecting us. They should be, we could use them. Tens of millions of illegal immigrants already live here in the United States. We don't know the exact number. We don't even know who they are. They just show up and a hundred thousand more are showing up every month. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Over time, this is how countries collapse. Max Boot doesn't think that's a crisis. Nobody in Washington thinks it's a crisis. As far as they're concerned, illegal immigration is just some right-wing talking point that Trump throws to his base at rallies in Grand Rapids. You know, what they think is a crisis? You know what they're really concerned about? Medical care and Morocco. That's a problem we must solve immediately. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Luckily, we have exercise African lion. Never heard of it? You're paying for it. In the last year, 1,100 US military personnel have participated in that exercise. All of them working to make Morocco healthier or how about the plight of the Ethiopian Navy? Ethiopian Navy needs a lot of help considering that Ethiopia is entirely landlocked as a country. Thank heaven for our Sixth Fleet, they're on it. The Navy just sent out a press release last week bragging about new talks with the Ethiopian government to quote, \"discuss the exciting task of building the Ethiopian Navy.\" Feel safer? The people of Mozambique feel safer. U.S. military aircraft have flown 60 missions. They've transported more than 663,000 metric tons of relief supplies in there in there in the wake of a cyclone. That was nice. In Honduras, we currently have 400 American troops stationed. Our 612th Air Base Squadron recently helped extinguish a wildfire in a small city called Comayagua. In Malaysia meanwhile, a U.S. Navy amphibious construction battalion is rebuilding water tanks at an elementary school and we could go on and on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now these are all good works, virtuous things, done at taxpayer expense by the most altruistic country in the history of the world. That's us, the United States. But what about us? What about our country? We're being invaded, no offense to the Ethiopian Navy, but we could use American troops a lot closer to Tijuana than the Horn of Africa. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Max Boot and his friends scoff at this.

The reason it's money laundering is because when the parents allegedly paid the bribe money to the ringleader of this scandal, Rick Singer, they funneled it through his purported charity. In other words, they tried to hide the payment and then clean it. The parents were also charged with wire fraud because the Fed say they brought the money from outside of the United States with the purpose of committing a crime in the U.S. Some of the parents have already said they plan to fight the case in court, and prosecutors say a few parents who fessed up early and cooperated may avoid jail time. For Lori Loughlin, her husband and others, prosecutors say they won't listen to any plea deal that does not include at least two years of prison. But \"People Magazine\" now reports that Lori Loughlin has refused a plea deal because she won't accept jail.

But what we're finding here is that there's a part of the system where some young people were pushed out in order to allow these individuals to get in. That's one of the biggest problems here. So when you're especially taking a slot for athletes, who have really worked hard all their lives to get that scholarship, those positions were eliminated. So that's the real harm. Some people are saying, \"Well, what's the harm?\" Well, you know, young people - some young people were shut out of this process. But in addition to the fact that it's cheating, right, I mean, this un-self-aware kind of vulgarity in the actions that have been taken in this regard by individuals who really could have whatever they want. They've got a lot of money. Maybe they're not as rich as Jeff Bezos, but they've got half a million dollars allegedly to get their two kids on a couple of crew positions there in USC.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to the “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Here's a helpful hint about how your government works. We're full of helpful hints on this show. If you ever see consensus forming in Washington run, something awful is about to happen. For decades, you will remember there was total consensus that our trade deals could not be better. They helped everyone. Meanwhile, as they were telling us that, America's manufacturing sector died and huge parts of the middle class died along with it. Then it was bipartisan consensus on the Iraq War and the stock piles of weapons of mass destruction we'd supposedly find there, but didn't. A few years later, there was consensus on banking regulations that was just before the financial crisis hit. Then there was still more consensus on the creation of an all seeing surveillance state that was supposed to somehow help you, but that is now scanning your face and reading your texts. There wasn't much debate in Washington about any of those policies. There should have been. So it was with was some skepticism that we note a new consensus forming here. This one about our southern border. It may look bad down there, they're telling us, but calm down, it's fine. Everything is just fine. That's the new word for Max Boot. Boot is a columnist for Jeff Bezos, his newspaper. But more than that, Boot is the living repository of every warmed over cliche, every silly half-truth, every stale scrap of stupid conventional wisdom the buffoons who run this place have thought up recently. So here's the latest. This is from Boot's appearance on CNN last night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST",
      "utterance": "I'm ready to declare a national emergency. The national emergency is not on the southern border. It's in Washington, DC with a President who is lawless and out of control."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Who is this guy? Well, Max Boot calls himself a foreign policy expert. That's a title that doesn't actually mean anything, but in practice, it allows Boot to agitate for more counterproductive foreign wars. In the year since 9/11, Max Boot has demanded military intervention in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Iran and North Korea and likely many other places. He has called for the U.S. to topple the Saudi monarchy. And of course, like so many neo-cons, Boot fell headlong into the Russia conspiracy nuttiness for more than two excruciating years. It's hard to think of anyone in this country more discredited than Max Boot. Going to him for foreign policy advice is like giving Jeffrey Dahmer a cooking show. He'd be the last person you would ask. So of course, Max Boot now has gigs at CNN, \"The Washington Post\" and the Council on Foreign Relations, because that's how Washington really works. The key is never apologize, never admit fault no matter what. Watch Max Boot explain that the idea of toppling the Libyan government, which was deranged, was in fact brilliant. We just didn't do it right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOT",
      "utterance": "We did a great job of overthrowing Gaddafi, but they had nothing to secure the country afterwards. And there was, I might add, a similar lack of planning for our pull out in the case of Iraq, where there was very little sense of what would happen after U.S. troops left in 2010. We can't think about these as being kind of quick in and out engagements. We send some troops, kill some people and then come back home to a victory parade; sadly, it doesn't work that way. Boot didn't explain how exactly it does work, he didn't need to explain. Everyone knows his assumption. It's the same as permanent Washington's core assumption. Military occupation is always the right answer, no matter what the question is. Sending somebody else's kids to a foreign country is always in everywhere the right thing to do. When Donald Trump pledge to pull Americans out of Syria, Max Boot went crazy, just on principle, because no troops can ever leave -- ever."

      "speaker": "BOOT",
      "utterance": "There is nobody who knows anything about the situation in Syria who recommends doing this. This is a Christmas gift to America's enemies. This will help ISIS. This will help Russia. This will help Iran. This will help Bashar Assad and this will hurt Israel and our Kurdish allies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "What did Max Boot not say? What do you notice about that? Well he never explained how keeping Americans in Syria would help the United States. Why didn't he mention it? Because he doesn't care. Nobody in Washington cares, and maybe that's why you never hear anyone ask questions about our current military commitments. Are we overextended perhaps? We hear the numbers. As of tonight, we have nearly 175,000 active duty personnel serving overseas, American troops are posted in 158 different countries. For perspective, there are only 195 countries total on the entire planet. We're almost everywhere. This map might give you a sense of the scale of it. Keep in mind there is no World War currently in progress. This is what we've signed up for in peacetime. And yet, you may notice that there was one place American troops are not. They are not on our southern border protecting us. They should be, we could use them. Tens of millions of illegal immigrants already live here in the United States. We don't know the exact number. We don't even know who they are. They just show up and a hundred thousand more are showing up every month. Over time, this is how countries collapse. Max Boot doesn't think that's a crisis. Nobody in Washington thinks it's a crisis. As far as they're concerned, illegal immigration is just some right-wing talking point that Trump throws to his base at rallies in Grand Rapids. You know, what they think is a crisis? You know what they're really concerned about? Medical care and Morocco. That's a problem we must solve immediately. Luckily, we have exercise African lion. Never heard of it? You're paying for it. In the last year, 1,100 US military personnel have participated in that exercise. All of them working to make Morocco healthier or how about the plight of the Ethiopian Navy? Ethiopian Navy needs a lot of help considering that Ethiopia is entirely landlocked as a country. Thank heaven for our Sixth Fleet, they're on it. The Navy just sent out a press release last week bragging about new talks with the Ethiopian government to quote, \"discuss the exciting task of building the Ethiopian Navy.\" Feel safer? The people of Mozambique feel safer. U.S. military aircraft have flown 60 missions. They've transported more than 663,000 metric tons of relief supplies in there in there in the wake of a cyclone. That was nice. In Honduras, we currently have 400 American troops stationed. Our 612th Air Base Squadron recently helped extinguish a wildfire in a small city called Comayagua. In Malaysia meanwhile, a U.S. Navy amphibious construction battalion is rebuilding water tanks at an elementary school and we could go on and on. Now these are all good works, virtuous things, done at taxpayer expense by the most altruistic country in the history of the world. That's us, the United States. But what about us? What about our country? We're being invaded, no offense to the Ethiopian Navy, but we could use American troops a lot closer to Tijuana than the Horn of Africa. Max Boot and his friends scoff at this. Troops on our own border? Protecting our own people? That's disgusting, immoral. It's fascism. Only in Washington do people believe that. Douglas Macgregor is a retired colonel. He is the author of the book, \"Margin of Victory: Five Battles that Changed the Face of Modern War,\" and he joins us tonight. Colonel, thanks very much for coming on."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It is in no way to denigrate the service of our troops who are improving the lives of foreigners, a lot of foreigners in a lot of different places. But why do you think it's so repugnant to our leadership class that they would help protect us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACGREGOR",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, let me point out contrary to what Brother Boot is saying, there are no Russian armies massing on the borders of Europe prepared to strike West and conquer Europe, none. There are no Chinese armies massing on the borders of Southeast Asia, or on the border with Korea ready to pounce on the Korean Peninsula or invade Vietnam and Thailand. They don't exist. So there is no imminent threat contrary to popular belief. These troops and do not have to be overseas where they are. So why are they there? Very simply because special interests enrich the ruling class. The lobbies that exist -- foreign and domestic -- have enormous money, and it pays people on the Hill, obviously a great deal of money to support whatever involves overseas contingency. So the overseas contingencies, the overseas presence is a cash machine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACGREGOR",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Title X of the United States Code specifically says just what you've said, and the Army in particular in addition to conducting decisive operations on land has the task of conducting the mission for wide area security. So the U.S. Army belongs on the border right now and it's perfectly obvious to everyone on the border. You can add more patrolman, you can add more customs officers. It's not just a function of the wall, they cannot possibly cope with hundreds of thousands of people marching over those borders, especially when they're told that if you reach the border, you have to be admitted. We need martial law on the border. I just spoke this afternoon to people on the border with New Mexico, Arizona and Texas and they all said the same thing, \"Please send troops. Send the United States Army.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So we're going to put on the screen a list of places the U.S. Military is committed, and I think maybe some of our viewers might not be aware of the scale of the commitment. And again, this is not criticism of those troops who are doing they're doing their duty and doing it well."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACGREGOR",
      "utterance": "Well, the Democrats look south and they see voters moving across the border. The Republicans are afraid of losing votes. And so they lack the courage to stand up and say, \"Stop.\" Those are the two problems. No one on the left is going to advocate for the defense of that border, because they see in the future, a foundation - a human foundation for a permanent dictatorship of the left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So I mean, you spent your life in the military. Tell me if you were to ask your average frontline infantryman."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACGREGOR",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "The U.S. Army, would you rather - would you feel better about protecting your own country's border or protecting our quote \"Kurdish allies,\" whoever they are in Syria? What do you think the answer will be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACGREGOR",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, let's face it, the average American soldier, sailor, airman or Marine who arrives in the Middle East and looks around. He says, \"My God, there's nothing here worth my life.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACGREGOR",
      "utterance": "So as a result, \"I'm not going to take any chances. So if I'm going to fight, I'm going to pull the trigger. I'm not going home in a body bag.\" The average soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine doesn't see anything in Afghanistan or the Middle East or for the most part, in Africa that justifies the loss of his life. So to answer your first question, they would all be delighted to defend the United States, to defend our borders, particularly the Mexican border, without question. The generals, of course, are part of the ruling class here in Washington. They're not interested because they look at the same cash machine. How do we justify bloated ground forces? A huge Marine Corps? A large army? Massive investment in surface fleets if we pull back? And we admit, there really is no justification for it overseas? Can't be done."

David Tafuri is an international lawyer who advised President Obama's campaign and he joins us tonight. David, thanks very much for coming on. So it's a really simple question. It's not an argument against helping the Ethiopian Navy, they need help. They don't even have water. So there's a lot to do.

That's also how we build up militaries in friendly countries. So if we need to work with those militaries in the future, we know that we can rely on them and then we have a strong partnership with them. So places like Ethiopia, like Denmark, other places that you mentioned, our soldiers are doing great work there. It's important. I think we all agree that as you mentioned, America is the most generous country in the world. It's also the most powerful country in the world and it's the country that really needs to lead right now. We are being challenged by China. We're being challenged by Russia. China is doing some of those things. Would you prefer to have America and American troops doing these things around the world or would you prefer to have China? That's one question?

Although I went to Iraq in 2006 and 2007, during the war to try and help out. I think some of -- a lot of the things that our troops have done have made the world safer. We also have new challenges that we didn't have before like the challenge that was posed by Al Qaeda, when we were attacked on 9/11; like the challenge posed by ISIS in 2014.

You had all these people asking really tough questions and Attorney General Barr had these very reasonable responses. And he said that one of the things that he's very interested in doing now is just understanding how did this investigation get going? What were people thinking? You know, we know that it's not true that there was this grand, treasonous collusion issue that we were led to believe had happened. Well, why did people fall for this? Or how did it get started? Were the norms and processes that should have been followed, followed? Obviously, there are some problems there, and so I hope that it's a legitimate investigation. It's kind of crazy that we haven't had a legitimate investigation this many years into it. But finding out how did it start? Finding out a little bit about, you know, all the criminal leaks that were part of this? We had people leaking classified information that should not have been leaked.

Our constitutional system says that Congress should perform oversight of these agencies to make sure that we don't have unaccountable bureaucrats running wild and when you think your job is to protect them and enable them to continue doing whatever they're doing, you're not going to be doing a good job with oversight.

      "utterance": "Tucker, for Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli and 14 other parents, the new indictment adds a money laundering charge, which could up the jail time significantly. The reason it's money laundering is because when the parents allegedly paid the bribe money to the ringleader of this scandal, Rick Singer, they funneled it through his purported charity. In other words, they tried to hide the payment and then clean it. The parents were also charged with wire fraud because the Fed say they brought the money from outside of the United States with the purpose of committing a crime in the U.S. Some of the parents have already said they plan to fight the case in court, and prosecutors say a few parents who fessed up early and cooperated may avoid jail time. For Lori Loughlin, her husband and others, prosecutors say they won't listen to any plea deal that does not include at least two years of prison. But \"People Magazine\" now reports that Lori Loughlin has refused a plea deal because she won't accept jail. Meantime, their youngest daughter, Olivia Jade, finally got her trademark application accepted for her new line of makeup. The application had been denied because of numerous punctuation mistakes. And finally, Felicity Huffman, who pleaded guilty to mail fraud yesterday and will likely avoid jail time is taking a career hit. Today, Netflix announced her new movie, \"Otherhood\" will no longer be released later this month and there is no new date.

      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Well, it is a little bit. I mean, some kids get into school. They've worked hard. Maybe they used scholarships. They're working jobs, of course, while they're going to school. They studied for the for the SAT test, they took it themselves. They did well enough to get in. But what we're finding here is that there's a part of the system where some young people were pushed out in order to allow these individuals to get in. That's one of the biggest problems here. So when you're especially taking a slot for athletes, who have really worked hard all their lives to get that scholarship, those positions were eliminated. So that's the real harm. Some people are saying, \"Well, what's the harm?\" Well, you know, young people - some young people were shut out of this process. But in addition to the fact that it's cheating, right, I mean, this un-self-aware kind of vulgarity in the actions that have been taken in this regard by individuals who really could have whatever they want. They've got a lot of money. Maybe they're not as rich as Jeff Bezos, but they've got half a million dollars allegedly to get their two kids on a couple of crew positions there in USC. So it's a remarkable thing for Americans to watch unfold, and now, and this is the good news, while we're focused on these actresses and they are behaving very differently from each other in this regard. The Department of Education is investigating the eight colleges involved. But I think this tells us, Tucker that this entire system has to be looked at. It's not just the eight colleges that were caught being involved. I think it's an infrastructure of entitlement because of the liberalism that guides that institution as a whole."

But for some reason, the Federal government hands out billions of dollars to these universities instead of financing, I don't know, border security or clean water in Flint, Michigan, or something else that might help normal people. The organization Open The Books has revealed just how much these schools profit from taxpayers.

The American taxpayer last year funded those schools to the tune of three quarters of a billion dollars and you come out with a license to cut hair, do massage or do nails. Now, what's interesting is, the tuition at those schools, sometimes rivals that and exceeds that of big 10 universities, your empire ump schools, your high-end beauty schools now, the tuition is over $20,000.00 per year."

So you know, look, market forces need to come into play. I think some of these policies are outdated. You've got the for example, in our report, we show you've got the 50 worst performing junior and community colleges in the country. Last year, they soaked up nearly a billion dollars' worth of Federal student financial aid funded by the American taxpayer. Their average graduation rate is 12%.

And Tucker, there's a new minimum wage for a Higher Ed employee, and that's $200,000.00 a year. We found 43,000 employees in Higher Ed across the country who make $200,000.00 or more.

And as I said, the start of it is by changing state, not just Federal state election laws, weaponizing the Federal Election Commission to go after people who criticize Federal officials, even on policy, then you create more states. And then I think that the thing that's really the ultimate centerpiece and this sounds like it could never happen, but it's being talked about very seriously and that is to pack the Supreme Court, to actually expand the size of the Supreme Court, so that the narrow balance of power that's currently there would suddenly be tilted radically in one direction and stay that way potentially for a very long time."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Okay, racializing everything only makes people hate each other. There is bias in the country, let's expose it. But saying there's suppression when African-American voters voted in a higher percentage than white voters, it's just -- it's a terror tactic."

There is people that is running nonprofits for homeless and in this state only that are making $250,000.00 as an ED. That's BS. You say you care about homelessness and you're taking home $250,000.00 a year. That's ridiculous. That's ludicrous."

    {
      "speaker": "NOIR",
      "utterance": "I mean, it was very interesting. I hadn't really spent much time in San Francisco. When I went down there, I'd do it for my show. And when I'm speaking to different people and talking to them about the different organizations and private institutions, and how the money just kind of circulates between these institutions and then put back in such a way that almost enables some of the behavior that goes on in San Francisco, especially from a drug-use perspective. It's almost like it's sustaining itself. It's like there's the money and then you kind of move around a little bit and then don't really put them in a position to improve their life, just keep them constant. And then while, as he said in the video, you know, they're pulling home $200,000.00 plus a year in salary. It kind of baffled me in many ways."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's so -- it's a metaphor for how a lot of things work in this society. When you keep people dependent, you increase your own power and make yourself indispensable. I mean, the Democratic Party exists to do that. So it's not like San Francisco is not spending a lot of money on this problem then, they are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NOIR",
      "utterance": "Oh, no, they're spending a ton of money in ways again, like that doesn't really deal with or attack the issue in a way to solve it. It's weird. It's just this massive sweeping under the rug and they've been doing this over time and I think now, what they're dealing with and what they're seeing is, is there's nowhere to put the mess. And so now you just have a bunch of rich people arguing with the richer people about where to put the homeless people. And it's just -- it was really nutty to be honest with you."
