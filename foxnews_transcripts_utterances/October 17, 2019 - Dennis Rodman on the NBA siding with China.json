      "sentences": "We begin with the Fox News Alert. Any moment now, the President will address supporters in Dallas, Texas. He's got quite a few of those. We are going live there as soon as the President begins to speak. Good evening, welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” From the beginning, the 2020 Democratic race has been a different kind of contest. Candidates don't seem to be competing to see who can run the country most efficiently. That's the old style of politics. Instead, these candidates are pledging to remake America entirely. Rip out the old, which is they're telling us irredeemably tainted by racism, sexism and free enterprise and replace it with something completely new and different. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At the heart of this effort is the promise of Medicare for All. Now, you may have heard the phrase. Two of the most Popular Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both have endorsed it. But what exactly does it mean? What exactly is Medicare for All? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's worth finding out. It's not a tweak to some regulation. It's not even Obamacare, which once upon a time Democrats defended and Republicans denounced as socialism. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Medicare for All is actual socialism, for real socialism. Healthcare spending amounts to about a fifth of the entire American economy. Elizabeth Warren demands total control of all of it immediately. That's Medicare for All. If it becomes law, it would amount to the largest expansion of the Federal government since the Second World War by far. So it's worth asking how exactly all of this would work and critically, who would pay for it.

      "sentences": "She will not answer. She won't explain no matter how hard she has been pressed and as you just saw, even some fairly strident Democratic partisans have pressed her. Warren refuses. She will not explain what it would cost or who would pay for it. Well, tonight we have a credible estimate. According to a study by the Urban Institute, in just the first 10 years, Elizabeth Warren's Medicare for All plan would cost an additional $34 trillion. That sounds like a lot. How much is it? Here's some perspective. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Congressional Budget Office anticipates that the United States, the whole United States will collect just $46 trillion in taxes over the same period. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, Elizabeth Warren's healthcare plan alone will consume the overwhelming majority of all tax dollars in the United States. That's before we spend a single dollar on I don't know, Social Security, education, National Defense and everything else. It's demented. Now, you should know that the Urban Institute has no motive to attack Elizabeth Warren. It's not a right wing think tank. It's a little left wing think tank. They likely didn't even account for the cost of one's pledge to give free healthcare to every illegal alien who sneaks into the country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So who is going to pay for all of this? Well think of it this way, $3.4 trillion a year. That's the estimated cost, divide that by 320 million Americans and you get more than $10,000.00 per person, not per taxpayer, per person. That means every child, every retiree, every prison inmate, everybody. That would be the largest tax assessed in American history, by far, nothing even comes close. That would change everything. An awful lot of people would just leave the country and not come back. So how do you pay for Medicare for All? It's not a minor detail, we can settle later. It's the single most important question about the program. Why do you think we don't have it already? Because we can't afford it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Elizabeth Warren pretends that's irrelevant and to her, maybe it is irrelevant. At some point in the last couple of years, Warren stopped functioning as a conventional senator and became a kind of Messianic figure. Details like what things cost or whether something is constitutional or even if the majority of Americans want it. None of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren anymore. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Warren has seen the future and in that future she has complete and unquestioned control of America. She is the most powerful person in the world. It calms her repeating the phrase to herself, the most powerful person in the world. It's intoxicating, clearly. Melissa Francis is an anchor on \"Outnumbered\" and one of the smartest people at Fox. She joins us tonight to assess this plan. So you've taken, Melissa, a close look at Medicare for All, what does it look like?",

The reason why they won't tell you whose taxes are going to go up is because there is literally not enough money. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So if you look at government tax receipts from the IRS, if you've confiscated every dollar that everyone who makes over $200,000.00 a year, you gave them a 100 percent tax, you took away every cent they made and I guess, ostensibly, you sent them to an island and you left them there to die because you confiscated all of their money, that would still not do it. That would be $2.7 trillion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you took everything, every single cent, you're still not paying for it. So slap on top of that, what if you took every cent that every corporation made after they pay taxes, the rest of the profit, everything else when they say we're going to take a little bit of your profit, take all of it. That's half a trillion dollars. You're still not there. So we've taken every dollar -- and these are the IRS is numbers. I mean, this isn't like models and you're guessing and this is only one year because after you've confiscated everybody's money, and after you took away company's profits, obviously they would all cease to exist. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is literally no math that makes this possible that you could pay for this.

There is precedent for this. Some of my friends in the mainstream media may affect me when I say this, but Thomas Jefferson prosecuted Aaron Burr, had him prosecuted and investigated him, a political rival Ravel for treason. He didn't prosecute Burr because he was a political rival. He prosecuted him because he thought he had committed treason, and he happened to be a political rival. To me, this whole length is about intent and I can tell you based on my conversations with the President, he honestly believes that the investigation needs to go forward.

Through our reporting this week, we learned from sources with direct knowledge of the congressional testimony that the administration's point man on Ukraine said Burisma was notorious for having a history of corruption and being investigated for money laundering that's why the Ukraine energy firm would bring in Hunter Biden. Kurt Volker told congressional investigators the firm was quote, \" ... looking to spruce up its image by having prominent named people on its Board.\" On Tuesday, Hunter Biden went and told his side of the story to ABC News that his last name likely played a role in securing the Ukraine position while his father was Vice President and led the Obama administration's regional foreign policy. Hunter Biden also dismissed criticism that he was unqualified to sit on Boards. Throughout the closed door interview this week, Volker said he didn't know the Biden's name came up during the call between the President and the Ukrainian leader until the transcript was released last month. And his read of the call was that the President wanted an investigation into Biden's actions to stop the prosecutor's investigation. And then there was a heated exchange with Democratic Chairman Adam Schiff, after Volker said the Ukrainians likely learned about the temporary hold on military aid from a political news story in late August adding that they had all already got a meeting with a senior administration official quote, \"And in that context,\" he said, \"I think the Ukrainians felt like things are going the right direction and they had not done anything on a [Biden] investigation.\" So think about that information, and how it conflicts with a lot of the public reporting, Tucker.",

      "utterance": "We begin with the Fox News Alert. Any moment now, the President will address supporters in Dallas, Texas. He's got quite a few of those. We are going live there as soon as the President begins to speak. Good evening, welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” From the beginning, the 2020 Democratic race has been a different kind of contest. Candidates don't seem to be competing to see who can run the country most efficiently. That's the old style of politics. Instead, these candidates are pledging to remake America entirely. Rip out the old, which is they're telling us irredeemably tainted by racism, sexism and free enterprise and replace it with something completely new and different. At the heart of this effort is the promise of Medicare for All. Now, you may have heard the phrase. Two of the most Popular Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both have endorsed it. But what exactly does it mean? What exactly is Medicare for All? It's worth finding out. It's not a tweak to some regulation. It's not even Obamacare, which once upon a time Democrats defended and Republicans denounced as socialism. Medicare for All is actual socialism, for real socialism. Healthcare spending amounts to about a fifth of the entire American economy. Elizabeth Warren demands total control of all of it immediately. That's Medicare for All. If it becomes law, it would amount to the largest expansion of the Federal government since the Second World War by far. So it's worth asking how exactly all of this would work and critically, who would pay for it. Elizabeth Warren has been asked that question many times and every time, she has refused to answer. MARC LACEY, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it? Yes or no?"

Warren refuses. She will not explain what it would cost or who would pay for it. Well, tonight we have a credible estimate. According to a study by the Urban Institute, in just the first 10 years, Elizabeth Warren's Medicare for All plan would cost an additional $34 trillion. That sounds like a lot. How much is it? Here's some perspective. The Congressional Budget Office anticipates that the United States, the whole United States will collect just $46 trillion in taxes over the same period. In other words, Elizabeth Warren's healthcare plan alone will consume the overwhelming majority of all tax dollars in the United States. That's before we spend a single dollar on I don't know, Social Security, education, National Defense and everything else. It's demented. Now, you should know that the Urban Institute has no motive to attack Elizabeth Warren. It's not a right wing think tank. It's a little left wing think tank. They likely didn't even account for the cost of one's pledge to give free healthcare to every illegal alien who sneaks into the country. So who is going to pay for all of this? Well think of it this way, $3.4 trillion a year. That's the estimated cost, divide that by 320 million Americans and you get more than $10,000.00 per person, not per taxpayer, per person. That means every child, every retiree, every prison inmate, everybody. That would be the largest tax assessed in American history, by far, nothing even comes close. That would change everything. An awful lot of people would just leave the country and not come back. So how do you pay for Medicare for All? It's not a minor detail, we can settle later. It's the single most important question about the program. Why do you think we don't have it already? Because we can't afford it. Elizabeth Warren pretends that's irrelevant and to her, maybe it is irrelevant. At some point in the last couple of years, Warren stopped functioning as a conventional senator and became a kind of Messianic figure. Details like what things cost or whether something is constitutional or even if the majority of Americans want it. None of that seems to interest Elizabeth Warren anymore. Warren has seen the future and in that future she has complete and unquestioned control of America. She is the most powerful person in the world. It calms her repeating the phrase to herself, the most powerful person in the world. It's intoxicating, clearly. Melissa Francis is an anchor on \"Outnumbered\" and one of the smartest people at Fox. She joins us tonight to assess this plan. So you've taken, Melissa, a close look at Medicare for All, what does it look like?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Okay, so the part that's not in dispute, as you just said, is the cost. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, they all say between $3 trillion and $4 trillion per year. The reason why they won't tell you whose taxes are going to go up is because there is literally not enough money. So if you look at government tax receipts from the IRS, if you've confiscated every dollar that everyone who makes over $200,000.00 a year, you gave them a 100 percent tax, you took away every cent they made and I guess, ostensibly, you sent them to an island and you left them there to die because you confiscated all of their money, that would still not do it. That would be $2.7 trillion. If you took everything, every single cent, you're still not paying for it. So slap on top of that, what if you took every cent that every corporation made after they pay taxes, the rest of the profit, everything else when they say we're going to take a little bit of your profit, take all of it. That's half a trillion dollars. You're still not there. So we've taken every dollar -- and these are the IRS is numbers. I mean, this isn't like models and you're guessing and this is only one year because after you've confiscated everybody's money, and after you took away company's profits, obviously they would all cease to exist. There is literally no math that makes this possible that you could pay for this. And that's why I think it is so immoral and cruel for these two politicians to go out and make this promise on their campaign when she says your costs will go down, I guess because you'll be dead. I don't know. I mean, because she will have taken all your money and you'll have left the country. I don't know in what instance your cost would go down because there is no way to pay for it."

      "utterance": "But you're also saying that neither one of these candidates who collectively have collected tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions and are leading the Democratic field, neither one has bothered to game it out or even explain how they would pay for this. They haven't even tried?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "I don't -- they must know because these are not -- I mean, these are numbers that you just get from the CBO, from the IRS. It's readily available. You can see exactly how much money is available. And this isn't even tax revenue. This is like I'm going to take everything and then that's that. So it's just -- there's no way to pay for it. I guess the only logical answer is that it ends up being Medicaid-for-All or something you know much smaller where you really aren't getting anything, but they're pouring a bunch of money into it. It's just -- it's amazing to me because it's another one of those situations where the math doesn't even come close to working. There's no model. There's no -- with Obamacare, they said we're going to bend the cost curve and with more people on it, the cost will go down."

Go ahead."

They at least went through the motions. And you're saying they're not even trying now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "No. The closest thing I've heard is Bernie Sanders says, well over this period of time, you know, spending is going to be $50 trillion. So 34 is a big savings or 40 is a savings. And that's a weird number where he is putting together, you know, everything the government spends, local and Federal and all of health insurance, which by the way, they would outlaw health insurance. So this is not if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. They're saying, we are for sure taking away your healthcare, your employer based healthcare."

And what would really happen is that people with money, would go buy surgery and buy healthcare from somewhere else to save their lives, and everybody else would be stuck and they would end up with nothing. I mean, Medicare is nice, because people get out four times as much in monetary terms of what they put in. So that's why people are happy with it, because they're getting so much out. And that only works because we have a small fraction of people on it."

We all know about the Native American problem, and I don't think people fully understand how deceptive and manipulative it was for a decade, for employment purposes only, she claimed to be Native American and then she pretends like she didn't think that would help her somehow. And even when she was disclosed in 2012 by \"The Boston Herald\" during her Senate campaign, she spent almost seven years defending being Native American. She blamed her parents for telling her stories. She blamed her Aunt Bee for saying that she had had high cheekbones, like all the Indians do, in her words, which of course, if any other candidate had said that that would be disqualifying."

She baited him, he took the bait. If he asked my opinion, and he hasn't, I would tell him to ignore her. When you argue with a fool, which just proves there are two. Now, I don't expect the President do that. The President is -- I happened to visit with him last Friday. He is angry. And here's why he is angry. He is being charged or I think he will be charged with a high crime or a high misdemeanor. Anybody who knows a law book from a \"J. Crew\" catalog knows that requires and can't mens rea. This whole case against him is going to come down to intent, and I believe whether others believe it or not, I believe that he believes that Ukraine -- the Ukrainian government may have interfered in the 2016 election. I believe that he believes that the Biden's may have been involved in the impropriety in Ukraine and that he believes that it is an appropriate exercise of his foreign affairs powers to withhold Federal taxpayer money until he is certain that the impropriety has been investigated and that any Ukrainian officials who were involved are no longer in the government. There is precedent for this. Some of my friends in the mainstream media may affect me when I say this, but Thomas Jefferson prosecuted Aaron Burr, had him prosecuted and investigated him, a political rival Ravel for treason. He didn't prosecute Burr because he was a political rival. He prosecuted him because he thought he had committed treason, and he happened to be a political rival. To me, this whole length is about intent and I can tell you based on my conversations with the President, he honestly believes that the investigation needs to go forward. The second point I'd make, the Ukrainian government not the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian government is historically and organically corrupt."

No. Instead, Barack Obama meddled in a foreign election and gave an endorsement to a known racist, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trudeau has worn blackface two or three or who knows, maybe 10 times, we don't know, a lot of times he's been wearing blackface. And as they often tell you, that means he's a bigot.

You have to -- if you look at it from Justin Trudeau's point of view, when that fella down in Virginia, the Governor of Virginia, when he wore blackface just once 40 years ago, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, every major Democrat, Hillary called for him to resign immediately. Justin Trudeau has worn blackface multiple times in the 21st Century. He can't actually say how many times he's worn blackface."

We're told they're like, somebody -- I heard somebody on the radio in Canada today who said, well, they're very close. It's like, you know, he's just like his brother from another mother. In this case -- in Justin's case, he's like his brother from another mammy. He's basically the world's wokest mammy singer, and Barack Obama has decided that that is something he is entirely cool with. It's different in Virginia. But if you do it north of the 49th parallel, Barack Obama will endorse you."

I think Justin, he can't remember how many times has been in blackface, but I'm pretty certainly was in white face for the last G7 summit. My memory is a bit hazy. But actually, no American President has actually done this. The last time anyone talked about it was in 1911 when Sir Wilfrid Laurier, asked President Taft, if he would put in a word for him and President Taft thought about it and prepared some remarks and then pulled out at the last minute. This is actually unprecedented. This is actually unprecedented interference. If Canadians were like Americans, we'd be having a three-year investigation to get to the bottom of this foreign interference in a Canadian election."

Dennis Rodman won five NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, the Detroit Pistons, but after leaving the NBA, he has had something of a second career as an informal diplomat. He has been in multiple trips to North Korea where he has befriended the country's dictator. We just spoke with Rodman. Here's how it went."

And basketball is a very, very universal sport. It fixes violence around the world. Now, I think the players -- the players in the NBA had no information about what's going on in China or in Hong Kong. I think they were misinformed or it wasn't known to them what was really taking place at that particular moment."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

And LeBron James has spent, you know, years critiquing American politics. He's got no problem attacking the government here. But anyone who texted government there should be punished. I mean, he said that. That seems like a double standard."

      "speaker": "RODMAN",

I think the fact that a lot of people -- to force the culture in China and Hong Kong, it is very difficult to try to change that culture overnight, because they have a certain way of living and certain way of thinking. I think the fact that the NBA players, any players of any sport -- that has anything to do with sports, if they understand the culture of the Asian community and the Asian countries, I think they should understand the fact that they are very loyal. They are very loyal people. If they say yes, they mean yes. If they see - - if they hear something that's very out of context. They take it in a wrong -- they take it in a different direction and say wait a minute, hold on. You know -- they like to say no --"

Would it be okay if you were an American to say, I know it's a different culture, but you know that's kind of disgusting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RODMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it is disgusting. I think the fact that, you know that's up to the people in Washington, the politicians. I think like I said, sports is sports. I think that people that's playing sports is for sports. Basketball, that's not their concern. I think you can voice your opinion in America. But once you start going across to over the Asia, China, Singapore, Beijing and those countries over. There is a difference. It's a different way of living over there. You've got to be really careful what you say you know, because they take it the wrong way."

So LeBron James goes into a meeting of teammates and team owners and says anybody who criticizes China ought to be punished in the United States. What do you think of that?"

      "speaker": "RODMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it is difficult. Like I said, politicians should understand the fact that, you know, don't involve people like us, sports athletes involved in politics. I think LeBron James is a very smart individual. I think he's very -- he is very caring about the people around the world, and especially his charity he does around the world. But I think that, you've just got to understand that we don't know too much about politics. We don't want -- I don't want to know too much about politics to be honest about you."

      "utterance": "And then LeBron says you have to be punished for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RODMAN",
      "utterance": "But I'm saying, the deal is though, we have no right as American people to sit there and criticize China or any country in the world, in essence because you know why China is one the countries where they really praise American people. They love sports. They love American people. Hong Kong loves American people. China, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, every Asian country love American people, especially sports. Now, I think if people and sports athletes understand that because they're very loyal to people, and for the American people. So I think that LeBron James needs to understand, you know what, keep -- let the politics be politics. Let the basketball players be basketball players."

The Ukraine controversy has moved rapidly from the beginning with a lot of accusations hurled around and not many facts. What do we really know about the Biden family, Burisma -- or is it Burisma?

Well, the President is speaking in Dallas, he should have a lot to say about the impeachment efforts being marshaled against him, as well as Ukraine and this tangled relationship with the Biden family. In just a few weeks, the Ukraine story has become very complex, even if people follow it full time. So where are we? What do we know for certain? There's only one person we know who can untangle that, and that's our Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge and she joins us tonight. Hey, Catherine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Thanks, Tucker. Through our reporting this week, we learned from sources with direct knowledge of the congressional testimony that the administration's point man on Ukraine said Burisma was notorious for having a history of corruption and being investigated for money laundering that's why the Ukraine energy firm would bring in Hunter Biden. Kurt Volker told congressional investigators the firm was quote, \" ... looking to spruce up its image by having prominent named people on its Board.\" On Tuesday, Hunter Biden went and told his side of the story to ABC News that his last name likely played a role in securing the Ukraine position while his father was Vice President and led the Obama administration's regional foreign policy. Hunter Biden also dismissed criticism that he was unqualified to sit on Boards. Throughout the closed door interview this week, Volker said he didn't know the Biden's name came up during the call between the President and the Ukrainian leader until the transcript was released last month. And his read of the call was that the President wanted an investigation into Biden's actions to stop the prosecutor's investigation. And then there was a heated exchange with Democratic Chairman Adam Schiff, after Volker said the Ukrainians likely learned about the temporary hold on military aid from a political news story in late August adding that they had all already got a meeting with a senior administration official quote, \"And in that context,\" he said, \"I think the Ukrainians felt like things are going the right direction and they had not done anything on a [Biden] investigation.\" So think about that information, and how it conflicts with a lot of the public reporting, Tucker."

      "utterance": "Thank you very much. The President will start speaking in a moment tonight in Dallas. We will be going there live once he does. But for now, a recent Gallup poll finds that only 41 percent of Americans trust the news media. That's a massive drop from the 1960s and 70s, when a large majority trusted their own press. Walter Hussman is a newspaper publisher. We just spoke with him recently about this trend and how to fix it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "And so you believe, and I think you make a great case for it that in order to be really informed, in order to have a functioning democracy, you have to have a thriving print media. Americans say, however that they have lost a lot of faith in that medium. Why do you think that is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALTER HUSSMAN, NEWSPAPER PUBLISHER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there's the perception that there's too much bias in the media and there's not enough separation between news and opinion, and I see it myself. About two years ago, I heard some journalists saying things like, don't believe in the false equivalency of giving both sides. Well, I mean, that's what I learned in journalism, you're always supposed to get both sides."

      "speaker": "HUSSMAN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That is, I mean, you just described what I think was universal orthodoxy, just 30 years ago, and you've been running papers for an awfully long time. No one questioned what you just said. But now what you just said is a minority view, what changed do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUSSMAN",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure how it changed. I think it changed slowly over time. But we are trying to take the step to move it back in the right direction again. And so two and a half years ago, I wrote a six paragraph -- short paragraphs -- statement of core values. And we run that in all 10 of our daily newspapers every day on Page 2, because we want the public to know what our journalistic standards are and we want everyone that works for us to know what our journalistic standards are, and we want the public to hold us accountable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So recently, you've seen -- and you see it a lot -- newspaper reporters, not columnists or opinion people but just daily beat reporters, writing books in which they express, in some cases, aggressively partisan opinions. Should that be allowed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUSSMAN",
      "utterance": "No, we don't allow that. We would not allow our reporters to write books about the subjects they cover for, you know, news or anything as controversial. We have had feature reporters that might write a book on hiking trails in Arkansas or a food editor might write a book about recipes. I don't think that endangers our credibility at all, but we would not let a reporter write a book about something they cover."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So when you go -- my last question -- I just can't resist asking you. When you go to conferences with other newspaper publishers and of course you know them all, what do they say about your standards and your approach to news?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUSSMAN",
      "utterance": "You know, they generally agree with it. As a matter of fact, you know, a newspaper group in Kansas, the Seaton family that's owned \"The Manhattan Mercury\" for over a hundred years. They own 10 daily newspapers. They've now adopted our statement of core values identically. And more importantly, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Journalism School has now adopted our statement of core values. So, I hope this spreads and more and more news organizations adopt it and not just newspapers, I'd like to see broadcast and cable and other news organizations to let the public know what your values really are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right and a clear line between news and opinion. That's the big -- I think we have that here. Walter Hussman, thanks so much. And I know our viewers will look up your statement of principles online. They're worth reading. Thanks for joining us."
