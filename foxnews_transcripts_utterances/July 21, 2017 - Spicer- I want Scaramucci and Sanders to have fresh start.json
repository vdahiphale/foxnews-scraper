      "sentences": "Sean, good evening to you. This has been going on for months, but it really came together over the last 24 hours or so. There's no question and no secret that the president was not really thrilled with his communications team. Anthony Scaramucci was supposed to be headed to Paris to become the ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, but he came to see the president yesterday. The two of them started talking about communications, and President Trump said, Hey, why don't you be my communications director? To which Anthony Scaramucci said, Yes, I'd love the job. No problem. I'd love to come here to the West Wing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So the president made the decision to have Scaramucci go into that job, told Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus about it. Apparently, there was a lot of blowback from them, a little bit of a bloodbath overnight and into this morning. When Scaramucci came back to talk to the president about it, he gave him the job. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And immediately after that, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, seeing -- I don't know if it was the writing on the wall more than anything, or if it was the idea that he thought if the president is going to make a change, he probably wasn't going to be part of the future. So he took the opportunity to resign. Now, Scaramucci has got obviously a big job in front of him because it's no secret that this White House has been listing severely from an agenda that has been somewhat stalled, besieged by this Russia investigation, and a president who keeps going off message at inopportune times. So I put the question to Scaramucci this afternoon what he's going to do to try to fix it.

There's no question and no secret that the president was not really thrilled with his communications team. Anthony Scaramucci was supposed to be headed to Paris to become the ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, but he came to see the president yesterday. The two of them started talking about communications, and President Trump said, Hey, why don't you be my communications director? To which Anthony Scaramucci said, Yes, I'd love the job. No problem. I'd love to come here to the West Wing. So the president made the decision to have Scaramucci go into that job, told Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus about it. Apparently, there was a lot of blowback from them, a little bit of a bloodbath overnight and into this morning. When Scaramucci came back to talk to the president about it, he gave him the job. And immediately after that, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, seeing -- I don't know if it was the writing on the wall more than anything, or if it was the idea that he thought if the president is going to make a change, he probably wasn't going to be part of the future. So he took the opportunity to resign. Now, Scaramucci has got obviously a big job in front of him because it's no secret that this White House has been listing severely from an agenda that has been somewhat stalled, besieged by this Russia investigation, and a president who keeps going off message at inopportune times. So I put the question to Scaramucci this afternoon what he's going to do to try to fix it. Listen here."

I'm told that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were both very much on board bringing Scaramucci in -- Sean."

And no stranger to the president, hailing from New York, Anthony Scaramucci, somebody well known on Wall Street, a financier, and someone who for those shrewd (ph) skills has still tried to keep the ego in check. In fact, his first briefing at the White House podium quoted a mentor on Wall Street saying that, You need to grow in your jobs, not swell, and so Scaramucci trying to say that he wants to keep all of this in check and focus on the president, not himself. And interesting that he's very quick to apologize to the president for basically betting on the wrong horse back in the 2016 campaign. Remember, Scaramucci had first backed Scott Walker, and then Jeb Bush, had some harsh comments about then candidate Donald Trump, now obviously on board and made it clear that he wants -- has an audience of one at these briefings when he spoke directly to the president. Watch."

But as I said, I went into the president after we had the discussion early with Anthony and Sarah about what the president's desires were. And I said, Sir, I've had the opportunity to think about this. I think it is the best interests of this administration and your presidency that I give these two individuals the opportunity to operate without me in the way so that they have a fresh start, that I'm not lurking over them. And I think that's in the best interests of the organization, of this administration, and of his presidency. And so, he -- again, there was a bit of a back and forth. He's an unbelievably gracious individual and wanted to make sure that I thought that that was in the best interests of myself, as well. He's always thinking of others. And I assured him that I would be just fine. He assured me that he would continue to be as supportive as he always has been. And I told him I would stay on for a few weeks to ensure a smooth transition. He accepted that, and then we kept working hard to advance his agenda."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "No, as you mentioned, the president obviously wanted to add to the team more than anything. I just think it was in the best interests of our communications department, of our press organization to not have too many cooks in the kitchen. And so I think that's a good quality. They need the team here that works so hard, so tirelessly to advance the president's agenda, needs clear leadership, and I thought it would be a bit confusing having additional people at the top. And so I wanted to move on to give both Anthony and Sarah that clear lane in each of their respective areas. But look, we've been -- we've been working tirelessly trying to advance his agenda. There's a lot of people here doing a lot of amazing work on the digital side, on our research side, on our press operation regionally. We had a very successful \"Made in America\" week this week, garnering over, you know, millions of impressions throughout the country of the amazing things that -- products that come from around the country and that the president's working hard to keep and grow the manufacturing base and the job base around this country.

And I think they'd be shocked and disappointed to see some of the bias that exists in some of the stories that don't get told, or the manner in which they are told. I was increasingly disappointed in how so many of the members here of the media do their job, or rather don't do their job, the bias at which they come from it at. And as I mentioned a while ago, I think that there's become a very clickbait mentality among a lot of reporters, where they're more interested in their clip or their click than they are about the truth and the facts."

Maybe we're not going to do everything on camera, and maybe the person at home, the average person at home, doesn't quite understand that when those guys get their moment, their idea is to get into as contentious a battle with you as they can. And is it 9 out of 10 times that's what airs that night, that they're not really looking for news, they're looking for their moment? Is that a fair assessment, or am I being unfair to the media?"

They're not there for the facts and the pursuit of the truth. Rather, they are trying to figure out, how do I get on TV, how do I become a YouTube star? And that's disappointing. But there are some good reporters that still spend time getting to know, to learn the facts, to get the story out, and they should be rewarded and praised for their journalism.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

I'm not a traditional journalist. I'd be called an advocacy journalist. But when I look at issues like Ukraine and the influence that they tried to have on the election, as long as it's on helping the Democrats, that doesn't seem to get that much play. Or the Uranium One deal, which I would argue is a real Russia Vladimir Putin scandal, they didn't seem to care too much about that in the media, and you know, a whole variety of other issues that I can bring up here. Do you think that they -- that by and large, for the American people, you being on the podium -- do you think conservatives like myself, when we say there is a media bias, a very, very distinct bias, and their obsession with Russia, am I right? Am I in the middle? Are they right? What do you think?"

I'm very proud of the fact that we brought a lot of new voices into the briefing room, whether it's through Skype or getting some talk radio show hosts here and allowing additional voices in because what's important is allowing other people to understand that the questions that we, and stories that we're hearing from around the country, from one coast to another, aren't necessarily the stories and the issues that are being covered by folks here in Washington. And we find that when the president goes on the road, when we talk about an issue and we do regional media days, the questions and the issues that are a concern to everyday Americans are not nearly what they are for the folks, the pack mentality that exists in the briefing room here at the White House, for those people to get trapped in the Washington, D.C., media bubble."

Some of the memes, you have to -- have to laugh at yourself a little bit. But there are times when it goes from funny to mean, and that's -- that's -- there's a difference when that happens.

And he's doing great things, and I think it's a good day for President Trump, to get a person in that coms director that he believes in, and really, sometimes a fresh start's a good thing. Sean did a great job. He's a dear friend, as everybody knows. But it is good to start fresh. And so Sean gets to start fresh. Anthony gets to start fresh.

So Sean leaving doesn't mean that Sean isn't going to be out there supporting President Trump and it doesn't mean that President Trump isn't going to be supporting Sean Spicer. So I've seen how the world around the president works, and it's very healthy and he cares about his people. And the most important thing is that his people know that he cares about his people.

I mean, you just don't care what some of this stuff says because you know it's garbage. You've become conditioned to the garbage, and you have to go with the good, honest reporters, and there are a lot out there, that want to report the truth, that play it straight, and you have to reward those people with the interviews and most of the things that you can give out."

The amount of work and the amount of accomplishments that this president has put forward and accomplished and checked the boxes, it's staggering. And I think his press release said it well today.

They've got to get the corporate middle class tax rates, the repatriated money, energy independence I believe creates millions of high-paying career jobs.

And then, you know, I think we need to get started on infrastructure. Those are the things that President Trump cares the most about. Those are the things he talks about every day. And yes, the leadership in the House and the Senate, they're working hard, too, and we appreciate their partnership. But we have to get results done for the American people. We've got the House. We've got the Senate. Obviously we wish we had 60 votes, but we've got the House and we've got the Senate, we've got a president that works harder than anyone that I've ever seen. I've often joked that, you know, my secret formula has always been that I thought I could outwork anybody, and I've met my match with President Trump and he's working hard for the American people. But you know what? The people out in Wisconsin and in Michigan and Ohio, they know that. We talk to the state chairmen around the country that are in our party. President Trump is popular out there across the country. Obviously, the bubble here in D.C. sometimes is tough to deal with, but working hard, rolling up our sleeves, having good partnerships in the House and the Senate and a president that works harder than anyone else -- that's how we're going to get it done."

So you worked in the Nixon administration, you worked in the the Reagan administration. Did you ever see it this bad? The media this abusively bias, corrupt, or maybe you did. I've never seen it this bad. PATRICK BUCHANAN, AUTHOR, \"NIXON'S WHITE HOUSE WARS\": First, I thought Sean Spicer was very gracious in his departure. But Sean, let me tell you, this is as bad as it was in the final days of Watergate with Richard Nixon, the tremendous overt hostility of the press, the media. Many of those press conferences of Nixon looked like things in a Roman forum. And I think the real problem here is that the president senses that the media are the enemy, and I think the media undeniably if you watch all three networks and you watch the major networks and the press, and the media are as hostile to this president as I have seen to any president or candidate in my lifetime."

They have got investigators and prosecutors who are really steeped in white-collar crime and the rest of it. What is going to happen, Sean, is this. Mr. Mueller is going to make demand after demand after demand.

But let me tell you, during the Saturday Night Massacre, we tried to shut down the special prosecutor's office, and they revived it and they got a new special prosecutor. I'm looking at the confrontation here. And unless I am mistaken, they are going to have something on the president and his family, and he is going to go after Mr. Mueller.

      "utterance": "Mueller and the media, and the Democrats, and weak Republicans, there's your problem. Thank you. Here with more reaction to the exclusive interviews with Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, Air Fleischer, Judge Jeanine Pirro. Judge, let me get to you first to respond to Pat Buchanan, because that was a pretty dire analysis, and I do believe that Mueller is way out there on investigative creep, multiple conflicts of interest. He's hiring Hillary's attorney, Democratic donors, and I don't see one Republican hired."

      "speaker": "JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "You know, Sean if we use the same standards for Robert Mueller that the attorney general used for himself, Mueller would have recused himself. So Mueller's relationship with Comey whose credibility he has to assess as opposed to the president's credibility, that relationship immediately prevents him from being objective. And I'm not even talking about all of the attorneys who he is bringing in who are anti-Trump people, pro-Hillary people, pro Clinton Foundation people."

      "utterance": "Without a doubt. Sean, there is no doubt they have blood in their nostrils. This is about destroying Donald Trump and his family, his children."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Can they succeed? It depends on who they want to give some, maybe bend the rules a little bit or give someone immunity so that they turn around and go after the president. You can make anything look bad. And Patrick Fitzgerald, he's absolutely right. Patrick Fitzgerald was gunning for somebody, anybody. When he didn't get what he wanted, he turned around and went after other people. There is a mandate for this special prosecutor, and they are beyond it."

      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "I hope Pat is wrong because that would be terrible for the nation if it gets to that point. I'm not sure Donald Trump can sustain a Saturday night massacre. So we don't want to go down that road. Frankly, if you are Donald Trump, what you want is Bob Mueller to look at this dispassionately, neutrally, and then come out and say there was no collusion. If that happens, Donald Trump is home free. And if that happens from the hands of Bob Mueller, all of the critics have egg on their face. And that's the outcome what you want to cheer for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I'm willing to take the egg, but do you agree with me and the judge and Pat that it seems a little bit odd to hire Hillary Clinton's attorney and all of these Obama and Clinton and Democratic donors?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Yes. I respect Bob Mueller. I served with Bob Mueller. I think he is a fair and impartial man. But he made a mistake and is hiring, and I said that when the stories came out. He understands how Washington works. He should not have hired people who were Democratic donors, or he should have hired balance on his team. But to hire people who are predominantly Hillary donors and Democratic donors is indeed problematic. If it was not for my respect of Bob Mueller fundamentally, I would have said that that is disqualifying. But I do respect Mueller."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But what does that tell you what you just said? What you just said was based upon what Mueller has done and who he is putting on the team, you draw a negative inference from that. But because he's got a reputation as a good guy, then that overcomes the reality of what he is doing now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "It's not that he is a good guy. It's that he is an impartial man. And I do believe an impartial man can say to a Democrat or a Republican donor, I will watch you. We are doing it straight down the middle. And that's what I believe Bob Mueller would do. I just think he would be far better off if he didn't hire people who created that perception problem, and perhaps a reality problem."

But there are some skits I've seen on late-night television that I had to crack up at. So sometimes it can be funny, some of the memes you have to laugh at yourself a little bit. But there are times when it goes from funny to mean."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Tough job. It's even tougher when you do it for Donald Trump because of the press's animosity to Donald Trump and because Donald Trump doesn't do things the traditional way. And so you are getting squeezed when you are the press secretary. And Sean has taken the high road. That is good to see. It's good for Sean and good for his family. I do have to point out that there is another thing that I think they read between the lines. I think it was increasingly clear that Sean was going to be a man without a portfolio. There was going to be a new press secretary, a new communications director, and what would Sean be doing? So I think that's what Sean was getting at when he said if he was hired, you make these changes if you rev up communications, I won't have a role, and it gets confusing to have me around. I think that's what it ultimately came down to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I was asking him if you have ever seen it this bad, and Pat was talking about it, I have seen it. I've been reporting on it. I've never witnessed such outright hostility, hatred, vitriol, one-sidedness, as the media in this country is showing this president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Do you remember when Donald Trump declared his presidency, The Huffington Post said they were only going to cover him in the entertainment section of The Huffington Post. They wouldn't even take him seriously. And that was a pattern right from the day he announced. And it was an amazing pattern where every time Trump would do something, critics would jump on it. But much of the Republican electorate, and later the overall electorate, responded well to it. And I don't think the press has ever caught up with that story. But every now and then you see them go to the heartland and do some interviews with people who typically they would never quote, and they're trying to do a little bit more of that. But the press missed it, and they really did have a hostility for Donald Trump at the beginning. Donald Trump has returned the hostility as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I think it has gotten worse. I really think this is a witch hunt. And I honestly believe Pat Buchanan is right. They have the smell of blood in their nostrils, and I don't think it ever stops in between the fake news, proven falsehoods that they have pushed out with such breathlessness. Judge Jeanine, I've never seen it this bad. And I don't think it ever stops for the entire time that he is president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, Ari was talking about with The Huffington Post. When I realized it was going to be this bad was on inauguration day when I was in Washington, D.C. and saw hundreds of thousands of people who literally hated the president of the United States, and that has not changed. But here's the thing, to be the press secretary, you have to be tough. If someone is in politics, you run for office, you are kind of use to it. You know you are going to take the hits. You know you need to have a hard shell for a skin. But someone who hasn't done it before, it's very, very tough. And to make no mistake, Sean, these prosecutors right now, special counsel, I call them prosecutors, are in the business of finding a crime. It is no longer a scenario where let's just see if anything was done that we can exonerate. No, they are gunning for someone. And what they don't understand is that Donald Trump is a man who has got skin thicker than any of us. But when it comes to his son, his son-in-law, his family, that is when the president of the United States is really going to take them on and possibly have a Saturday night."

    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Be smart about what you do. Be cautious in your tweets to the point where you don't put out a tweet that ends up hurting yourself. My hope with Anthony Scaramucci in there is the president is going to see that he has such an able and gifted communicator in Scaramucci on TV defending him that he won't feel the need personally to take it all on and do it himself. He knows Scaramucci has got his back and he is good at doing it."
