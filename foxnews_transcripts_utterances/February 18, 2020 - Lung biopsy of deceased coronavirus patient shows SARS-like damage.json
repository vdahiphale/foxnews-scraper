So a lot of people in the know say those are the two that are on the deck next, and this is just him sort of changing the news flow, getting people prepared. It's an interesting group that he -- that he pardoned today. I mean, you can make a good case for each one of them that they should be pardoned, including Michael Milken, who's landed an exemplary life after leaving prison. A lot of people were suspect -- suspected that -- a lot of people said his initial prison deal was much ado about nothing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He didn't do massive insider trading.

Blagojevich, interesting character, he boasted in a -- he was taped boasting about selling a Senate seat for President Obama. Remember, the governor -- he was governor of Illinois. The governor gets to choose the senator, of the sitting senator, if he leaves that seat, as Obama was doing to run for president. A lot of people thought it was kind of an offhand remark. And he served eight years in jail. So you can make good cases for each one of these.

Pretty interesting there. He's -- it's full transparency. He didn't wait until he got bounced out of office or was about to end his term or he gets reelected. He didn't, so the voters can see what he's doing firsthand. And there's got to be a method to the madness to that. And a lot of people think the method to the madness is, he's softening up people for Roger Stone and for Mr. -- and for General Flynn to do something about their sentences -- back to you, Neil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We know what happened then. So be careful about that. But I'm wondering if people are prematurely dismissing Bernie Sanders, because, with all of these polls, his poll support has shot up.

Is President Obama going to weigh in? They just can't resist being the ones that pick who the nominee is. They don't want Bernie to be the nominee.

And they're very hesitant of any actions from the DNC. When the app crashed in Iowa, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg declared victory, you had a lot of Bernie supporters saying that he had stolen the limelight. And if it does come down to a Democratic Convention, that animosity is only going to be furthered, because these supporters remember 2016. They're distrustful of the party establishment, and it could be a very ugly scenario. So that's why I think, right now, among other reasons, Bernie Sanders is pushing his supporters to really come out. He wants a big turnout election, because he thinks that that is the one that he will not only win, but the one that can put aside some of these questions ahead of the convention.",

And those two pardons, as you sort of tipped your hat to right then and there, would be Roger Stone, his former -- former adviser, longtime former adviser, and General Flynn. So a lot of people in the know say those are the two that are on the deck next, and this is just him sort of changing the news flow, getting people prepared. It's an interesting group that he -- that he pardoned today. I mean, you can make a good case for each one of them that they should be pardoned, including Michael Milken, who's landed an exemplary life after leaving prison. A lot of people were suspect -- suspected that -- a lot of people said his initial prison deal was much ado about nothing. He didn't do massive insider trading. He created a junk bond market that helped thousands of companies, new companies get financing. Bernie Kerik, try to find some of the real bad stuff in what he did, and it's -- it gets pretty murky. Blagojevich, interesting character, he boasted in a -- he was taped boasting about selling a Senate seat for President Obama. Remember, the governor -- he was governor of Illinois. The governor gets to choose the senator, of the sitting senator, if he leaves that seat, as Obama was doing to run for president. A lot of people thought it was kind of an offhand remark. And he served eight years in jail. So you can make good cases for each one of these. They are going to get a lot of pressure, a lot of scrutiny. He did it before he -- before he was reelected or voted out of office. Pretty interesting there. He's -- it's full transparency. He didn't wait until he got bounced out of office or was about to end his term or he gets reelected. He didn't, so the voters can see what he's doing firsthand. And there's got to be a method to the madness to that. And a lot of people think the method to the madness is, he's softening up people for Roger Stone and for Mr. -- and for General Flynn to do something about their sentences -- back to you, Neil."

In the end, the president stopped short of a full pardon, commuted his sentence, which means that Blagojevich will be released from prison. And that could happen some time this afternoon. But he still will have a criminal record, the president saying today that Blagojevich had spent enough time in jail, eight years, for his attempts to sell the Senate seat once occupied by Barack Obama. In total today, the president issuing seven grants of clemency, also to Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who spent three years in jail for making false statements, Michael Milken, the former financier, junk bond king, as was mentioned just a moment ago. And Eddie DeBartolo, who was the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers for more than 20 years, who was convicted on a federal felony for not reporting extortion money that he allegedly paid to the former Governor of Louisiana Edwin Edwards to try to get a casino license for a riverboat.

But if the president will let Bill Barr do his job, I think he will get all of that straight. I think one of the things the president is upset about is not really Justice. It's the FBI.

She has to interrogate the resigned prosecutors. Did you people know about this? Did the FBI agents that testified against Stone, did they know about this, and did you not tell us? These are things that she needs the answers to. And she should do this before she sentences Stone, because if she concludes that this is so prejudicial, he didn't get a fair trial, then it would be impermissible for her to sentence him, period.

Look, one wonders about the judge's impartiality, because it's one thing to sentence a -- or it's one thing to gag a defendant during the trial. You don't want him out in front of the courthouse saying things he could never say to the jury, because the jury will pick it up. It's quite another to gag him after he's been convicted.

And Bloomberg does have the biggest bank account. But Bernie Sanders has consistently had the biggest crowds for the last couple weeks.

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, thank you, my friend, Peter Doocy following all of that. Well, we know that Michael Bloomberg has a lot of money, and he's delivering the goods. What's interesting in some of these surveys is how his poll numbers have been very, very strong even with the release of some of these tapes. But more to the point is, the poll numbers go up as the spending goes up. Let's get a view of all of this from Democratic strategist Kevin Chavous. We have got Republican strategist Holly Turner and RealClearPolitics' Philip Wegmann. Phil, what's interesting, even though not all of these polls are post the release of tapes that have come out, like, you know, PEZ candies out of the dispenser over the last few days, he has held up pretty well. What are we to make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS",
      "utterance": "Well, he's held up very well at a moment when each of the Democratic campaigns is really churning out opposition research like you have not seen before, because Mike Bloomberg has a very long career. But even before some of that polling came out this weekend that showed him on the rise across the country, you saw that his campaign put out a statement saying that this is Bernie Sanders' race to lose and ours to win, which basically encapsulates the mind-set of the Bloomberg campaign. They see Joe Biden imploding. They don't think that Amy Klobuchar or Pete Buttigieg are going to be establishment champions who are able to sort of carry the banner. And for the moment, the polls sort of reflect that Michael Bloomberg is doing well. The question is whether or not he can sustain that momentum on the debate stage tomorrow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It's been a long time since he's been in a debate format, if you think about it, Kevin, maybe in his last run for governor in New York. We're going back almost two decades now. I'm just wondering how that factors here. I mean, is he rusty? Is he going to be prepared for the body blows coming his way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEVIN CHAVOUS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAVOUS",
      "utterance": "Because he's rising in the polls, everyone is going to be taking their shots at him. And there's a lot there. They could talk about recently released -- or video that has come up, come to the surface that isn't flattering about how he talked about you can Xerox copy the description of criminals, and it's all black and brown perpetrators, and the recent row about his statements about farming and how it's easy to farm and anybody can be a farmer. So there's a lot of material there. But it's clear that people are afraid of him in the Bernie campaign and I think even in President Trump's camp. That's the one candidate that they know can really come up and beat them. I think Donald Trump Jr. retweeted something the Bernie campaign tweeted out about that farming clip from Bloomberg. I mean, if you get those two to agree on something, obviously, you're doing something right, if they're both taking you that seriously. And he certainly is a threat. He's got the money to spend and it's starting to take root. But he certainly will have to get himself up to speed when it comes to debating, because he will be attacked, and people are looking forward to hearing how he's going to defend some of his previous missteps as governor -- or as mayor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, there's always the challenge. But one thing I have learned about consensus, Holly -- and I think you were among those teaching me it -- question it extensively. I mean, Democrats were praying Donald Trump would be the nominee, and that Republican infighting, thinking it that would divide the party and he'd be easy to pick off, he united the party, and it wasn't so easy to pick him off. In fact, he won. And I can remember when George Bush Sr. and their forces were hoping it would be Bill Clinton, and that any one of those candidates opposing him in '92 were like the seven dwarfs -- and I think they referred to them that way -- and they weren't going anywhere. We know what happened then. So be careful about that. But I'm wondering if people are prematurely dismissing Bernie Sanders, because, with all of these polls, his poll support has shot up. I mean, a lot of people are paying attention to the rise of Michael Bloomberg, but the unheralded story is the rise of Bernie Sanders, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLLY TURNER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And, I mean, his grassroots support is unprecedented in the party right now. His small-dollar donors, they will show up to the polls. And we don't know who's going to show up to vote for Bloomberg yet because he hasn't been on the ballot yet. So it's yet to be seen how his supporters are going to show up. Are these really just name I.D. polls that we're seeing, or are these really true supporters of his? The interesting thing to watch too is what the establishment Democrats are going to do. Is President Obama going to weigh in? They just can't resist being the ones that pick who the nominee is. They don't want Bernie to be the nominee. They feel like that would be a mistake going up against President Trump. But are they going to weigh in and put their foot on the scale and swing this primary towards their chosen candidate? And then what's that going to do in the general election, when it's not a person truly chosen by the people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Then you got to wonder, Phil, if Bernie Sanders enters the convention with the most delegates -- when I talked to his wife, Jane Sanders, on Saturday, she was saying, he will almost certainly have that. A lot of eventual nominees enter the convention not with a majority, but certainly with an overwhelming lead in delegates, and then close the deal. But if he is unable to do so, then it's a second ballot, where those superdelegates come into play. And therein lies the advantage for the others, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEGMANN",
      "utterance": "Right. And before we even have that conversation about what's going to be coming out of the convention, you already have Bernie Sanders' supporters on the ground who are getting the best of both worlds. For instance, their candidate is winning both in Iowa and New Hampshire, and at the same time, they have a martyr mentality, because they do remember 2016. And they're very hesitant of any actions from the DNC. When the app crashed in Iowa, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg declared victory, you had a lot of Bernie supporters saying that he had stolen the limelight. And if it does come down to a Democratic Convention, that animosity is only going to be furthered, because these supporters remember 2016. They're distrustful of the party establishment, and it could be a very ugly scenario. So that's why I think, right now, among other reasons, Bernie Sanders is pushing his supporters to really come out. He wants a big turnout election, because he thinks that that is the one that he will not only win, but the one that can put aside some of these questions ahead of the convention."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Meanwhile, thousands of poor and working-class kids sit in jail for nonviolent drug convictions. That is what a broken and racist criminal justice system looks like.\" So, I'm going to take a leap here and say he was not a fan of these actions on the part of the president today. All right, in the meantime, Joe Biden's lead is shrinking in South Carolina, the former vice president hoping that the first primary in the South will be his firewall, after flaming out in Iowa and New Hampshire.

And what happened is, the virus enters the lungs, and it cause inflammation, irritation to the tiny little air sacs in the lungs cause alveoli. And so those air sacs, they fill up with fluid, they swell up, and then you can't get air in and out. You can't breathe. You can't get oxygen to the heart and to the brain.
