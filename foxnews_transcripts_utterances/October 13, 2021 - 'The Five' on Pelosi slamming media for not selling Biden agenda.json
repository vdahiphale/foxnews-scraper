It comes amid a slew of bad headlines showing Joe's metamorphosis into Jimmy Carter is almost complete. Americans are quitting their jobs at a record pace, 4.3 million left their posts in August. Inflation surging more than expected in September with consumers paying 5.4 percent more for goods compared to last year. And the White House is warning shoppers their stockings are going to look empty. Not mine. Outright saying there will be things that people can't get. Here's the president.",

Why not -- the hardest thing to do is employ inner city kids from 18 to 21. They graduate high school then you have to keep them legal until they can become a member of the police force or something like that. It's very, very difficult.

When it comes to the New York Times and remember the Clinton global initiative, they broke that story all the e-mails, that kind of thing. So, I would always just recommend this. If you're in the private sector and you have to hire a P.R. person, always hire a Republican. They've definitely had to work harder, they don't think anybody is going to be handed to them, they have to be more persuasive in their language and more precise in their -- on the merits.

I mean, he's going to be, in history's eyes, I think, Geraldo, looked at as a much more significant president and consequential to terms in which you know, he fights the KKK. The 14th, 15th amendment are really because of Grant. And he holds the country together and that grand bargain that he makes as the 1876 election is happening. So, he's gone up 13 spots in presidential historians rankings. And I think that they're going to look differently on him in the long, long term."
