But I'm not going to predict what's going to happen because I think even the British aren't capable of predicting what's going to happen in their own affairs.  But here's the international signal this sends, and it's particularly important to the United States.  If you are an outsider, you need to do a better job of figuring out what you are going to do when you have power.  If you are antiestablishment and you want to step away from the establishment, you need to figure out when you win, how do you accomplish it? One of the reasons that bureaucracies have gotten so big and governments have gotten so big in every liberal democracy around the world is those politicians are expert in building it one brick at a time and one day at a time.  Those who want to take those breaks down have not yet figured out how to do it one day at a time.  They want it all to come down now.  And therefore when they get into power they are not effective.  It is a real lesson for anti-establishmentarian people.  Think long-term, have your think tanks realize, if you get into power, how do you accomplish it?

      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "It's important because it shows that governments can work if populist uprisings can work.  And that was my point.  The populist need to get better at governing, because once you win, you need to do something if you want to actually be effective."

      "utterance": "All of those relatives there were attorneys.  The attorney general nominee's grandson Liam was a big hit in today's hearing.  He took a seat there beside Senator John Kennedy before the hearing today.  He was seen writing notes throughout the hearing, passing a few to his grandfather throughout the day.  He was a big hit, mentioned, I think, five times. We're told Senator Dianne Feinstein's sent Liam a care package for making it through the long event. Thank you for making it through this show.  I barely got through.  And thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
