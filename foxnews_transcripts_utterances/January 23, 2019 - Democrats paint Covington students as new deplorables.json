There is also a subtext here that's meant to intimidate, we're going to get into that. The left wants to take away your right to wear whatever the heck you want. Now, this is kind of a - it's weird it's a left-wing version of puritanism. Their own version it, where they get to dictate what goody fill-in-the- blank is allowed to wear.

It's just plain stupid. But this is the defamation and intimidation that the left happily perpetuates, by the way, with little to no pushback. Predictably, of course, \"Never Trump Republicans\" are also taking up the chorus.

You can be offended by it, but you can't purposely use it to intimidate and frighten people and even terrorize them. But today's left, joined by the rabid \"Never Trumpers\" are so desperate to be proven right about the President. They seize on symbols instead of solving problems.

I mean, we're all watching the same - it's like we live in a post- fact Bizarro World universe. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You have a kid standing there in a MAGA hat with a political expression on it motionless, with the smile on his face, while an adult confronts the kid and yet I don't know what tape the bishop is watching. What did these kids do wrong? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then to throw in this random fact and I'm using the dreaded air (ph) quotes because it's an anti-fact, a non-fact that someone scream this about rape which they did, but they were not part of that group, is clearly either an effort to distract from the lack of a point which, I don't believe the gentleman has, or to distract from the video on the screen that we can all see. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These were a bunch of kids waiting for a bus while a group of activist confronted them.

And also where should Trump deliver the speech. Plus, a prosecutor in Kentucky is saying now that those who lob those threats against the Covington Catholic students could face domestic terrorism charges. We have an exclusive with him in just moments. And Raymond Arroyo took to the streets to ask folks whether they know much about any of the Oscar picture nominees? Wait until you see the reaction in \"Seen and Unseen\". But, first, the hat that dare not show its brim, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. There's so much news to cover every day in Trump world that you'd think the press would stick to real reporting and analysis on important political developments.

      "utterance": "So the red hat now is apparently the Annabelle of head coverings, a thing capable of unleashing evil wherever it's seen. There is also a subtext here that's meant to intimidate, we're going to get into that. The left wants to take away your right to wear whatever the heck you want. Now, this is kind of a - it's weird it's a left-wing version of puritanism. Their own version it, where they get to dictate what goody fill-in-the- blank is allowed to wear. And anyone who dares to violate their dictates is either shamed or just labeled hateful and a phobic, misogynistic, unreasonable, stupid and of course, racist. Bishop Talbert Swan, a Harvard Divinity School grad tweeted, \"When Trayvon Martin was murdered, y'all said Black parents shouldn't let their boys wear hoodies if they didn't want them perceived as thugs. But y'all don't want your boys perceived as racist little jackasses for wearing MAGA hats. #CovingtonBoys.\" Mr. Swan will join us in a moment. This leftist narrative that a Make America Great Again hat is akin to wearing some Nazi uniform, it's patently ridiculous and its offensive. It's just plain stupid. But this is the defamation and intimidation that the left happily perpetuates, by the way, with little to no pushback. Predictably, of course, \"Never Trump Republicans\" are also taking up the chorus. Ross Douthat of The New York Times tweeted in part, \"Good rules for life: Don't let your Catholic school's students wear MAGA hats on for a field trip for the March for Life\". And of course Bill Kristol never misses an opportunity to hit the President and his supporters even when he has his facts wrong said, \"The contrast between the calm dignity and quiet strength of Mr. Phillips and the behavior of MAGA brats who have absorbed the spirit of Trumpism - this spectacle is a lesson which all Americans can learn.\" Whether a piece of clothing says Feel the Bern or I'm with Her, it's all the form of political expression, and thus it is speech protected by the First Amendment. You can be offended by it, but you can't purposely use it to intimidate and frighten people and even terrorize them. But today's left, joined by the rabid \"Never Trumpers\" are so desperate to be proven right about the President. They seize on symbols instead of solving problems. All right, guys it's a lot easier isn't it to brand kids races for what they're wearing then to debate adults on things like immigration and trade policy. But for some MAGA, well, it symbolizes something very different."

      "utterance": "Well, Kanye kind of saw this all coming when he said, \"He didn't want people to control him, to tell him what or how to think, because of the color of his skin\". Today's real rebels are the kids who dared to show up for the March for Life last Friday. Today's real rebels are the faithful who refused to genuflect to what's popular and instead defend what they think is right. Today's real rebels, they reject the collectivist mindset of Hollywood, the media, and the universities that obliterate history, instead of actually teaching it. And, yes, today's rebels will wear MAGA hats knowing that they might be abused for doing so like the Covington kids were. Even in the end, it's really not about the hat, is it? It's about 2020. Trump hating fanatics aim to deprive the President of any opportunity to brand his re-election campaign. In other words, any Trump paraphernalia will be verboten. I thought about this today and it's actually in its own way a form of voter intimidation and potentially lethal with consequences that are incredibly destructive. By the way, you can't scream fire, right, in a crowded theater, and you can't scream racist when someone in a crowd wears a hat you don't like and that's THE ANGLE. All right. Here now on what promises to be a pretty fiery debate, Pastor and Activist Bishop Talbert Swan and Dan Bongino, Host of the Dan Bongino podcast. Bishop, I was - looking at Twitter last night, couldn't sleep. And I came across your tweets. We quoted one of them in THE ANGLE. And I really appreciate - first of all, I know we disagree on some issues. I really appreciate your being here tonight to share some thoughts and maybe even get somewhere, so thank you for coming."

You have a kid standing there in a MAGA hat with a political expression on it motionless, with the smile on his face, while an adult confronts the kid and yet I don't know what tape the bishop is watching. What did these kids do wrong? And then to throw in this random fact and I'm using the dreaded air (ph) quotes because it's an anti-fact, a non-fact that someone scream this about rape which they did, but they were not part of that group, is clearly either an effort to distract from the lack of a point which, I don't believe the gentleman has, or to distract from the video on the screen that we can all see.

Someone wants to wear a Hillary button or a Bernie button or a Bernie hat or - good for them. It's their political expression. I don't judge them on the clothes they wear, you shouldn't.

Here to debate, Madeline Morreira, a research attorney at the Bioethics Defense Fund, and Asha Dahya, a reproductive health advocate. Madeline, let's start with you. This New York bill allows, and this is key here for women's health, it allows not only doctors for OB-GYNs, but health care practitioners to perform abortions. That's not necessarily a doctor, right?

So you can effectively go to your doctor or your nurse practitioner or midwife or physician's assistant even and have them determine that your health on some level is threatened by the pregnancy or the impending birth of your baby and up to the due date have an abortion performed, and a doctor is not involved.

This is an unborn child that hears, knows sounds, voices. When someone is pregnant, they don't say we are going to have a fetus shower. They say a baby shower because it's a baby.
