One migrant, a Honduran named Henry Salinas told reporters he plans to overwhelm border agents going on to says quote, \"It's going to be all against one, one against all. All of Central America against one, and one against Central America. All against Trump and Trump against all.\" Joining me now conservative columnist, Ann Coulter. She is the author of \"Resistance is Futile.\" All right, Ann, you know we heard all the last couple of weeks that this was an invasion and I think even Jim Acosta said that you know, \"Mr. President, they're not going to be climbing any walls, that's not going to happen.\" Yet, we see all of this video, they are climbing the walls.

I guess, they are just a little bit more athletic, but the caravan is coming. More caravans are coming.

This is why voters wanted a wall.  That's the only thing that will ultimately work. We do have another Omnibus Bill coming up, and Trump has threatened to veto it if he doesn't get funding for his wall, which again, he doesn't need, but there is no one in the White House who hired all of those people in the White House - no one in the White House to tell him, \"You don't need Congress to build your wall, you are the Commander-in-Chief, just build it.\" We could use some changes at Homeland Security, we could some changes - well, somebody more Sessions-like as Attorney General, but this is - this is the biggest issue facing the country.

There are no Nazis. No, Trump is not Hitler, though yes killing six million Jews and tweeting a lot very similar I am sure in the eyes of a liberal. Peter Brimelow runs an immigration website which is basically Trump's position on immigration except without the grammatical errors and the \"New York Times\" just starts casually referring to an immigration website.

It's not that surprising, but for whatever reason Gillum got more votes than Nelson did. Gillum running for governor, the two Democrats. Nelson for Senate, but what they did, and I think that they are trying to do now, the Republicans better stop them, what they did it in the Minnesota election that elected cheater Al Franken was that they would say, \"Look, this ballot, they voted for Obama, well, surely they meant to vote for Franken.

So you have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who basically wants to give everything away for free, and then you have some of these people that are trying to bring back the blue dog Democrats and she's got to find some way to reconcile that, but hey, personally, the more she is on TV, the better."

I mean, she is running around with drum circles in the Capital, dancing around and high- fiving people. This is the first thing she did when she came to Washington was to protest outside of Pelosi's office. This is going to be a big headache for the Speaker, or potential Speaker."

She knows how to create the coalition.  So, I think that new conversation about leadership is important, but what Speaker Pelosi has done for our party is significant and it should be realized in this effort to talk about maybe new leadership.

By the way, the IRS called Reverend Al. you still owe some money.

I mean, you have platoons of these agenda driven journalists from \"The Washington Post\" to the \"New York Times\" that follow every single move that he makes. So this idea that he's been unchecked is ridiculous, not to mention the amount of freedom of information requests that these left-wing activist groups have been burdening this White House and this President with are unbelievable, and you know what Mr. Schiff? If you're pursuing investigations, finish the investigation into what the FBI did and did not do leading into President Trump's surprise victory with all the deep state activity that has proven to be true, thanks to Devin Nunes.

I know Mark Penn, who wrote that column and he does know the Clintons very well, even though he is on the outs with them right now. He's probably one of the best guests you can have because he doesn't have a horse in the race, but he's got great insight on the Clintons and what's going on.
