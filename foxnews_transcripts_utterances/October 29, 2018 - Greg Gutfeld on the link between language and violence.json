If the actions of evildoers are out of their own control and nothing else could have led to the violence, then how can you even begin to punish these creeps? It's wrong. Meanwhile, for both the bomber and the shooter, President Trump, Mr. Law and Order, pushes the death penalty. There is no ambiguity there. He places the blame firmly on the dirt bags. And like most Republicans seeks out the stiffest penalty, literally, the stiffest. This contradicts the media who see Trump as a hateful ringleader who sympathizes with such cretins. Speaking of those suspects, they were total losers. Failures in life who placed their rage on others and anyone with an opinion could provide a trigger because words can influence. It's why there's advertising. But that's a scary path to take especially for Hollywood, rap stars, and video game makers, or even people paid to speak carefully and thoughtfully.",

When something happens and it's directed at Democrats it is purely Republican and President Trump's fault. But it's also just intellectually dishonest because if you look at the mail bombing suspect, this guy has a rap sheet going back to 1991. He made a bombing -- terrorist threat in 2002. And then, if you look at the synagogue shooting, this guy hated President Trump because he didn't think he was an anti-Semite. So if you actually look at the facts it doesn't drive the narrative that the media's driving, but the only reason they do it is because the midterms are around the corner and they want to hurt President Trump.",

If you ask me when this happened, first the bomber is discovered, two, the shooting of the synagogue, I thought maybe by Sunday, on a Sunday show, some pundit looking to get a network contract would go ahead and say I think the president is to blame. I did not know, the same night, the same day, within an hour, they said, ha, ha, look at what you see. What the president does and it works to his detriment is he watched everybody talk about all this. And it had him seething, as if we were sitting outside the glass listening to The Five talk about us. For him -- he's outraged. So what does the president do? Exactly what he did his entire life, at the Trump organization, and as a candidate, and as president, I'm going to go tweet out. I'm going to speak out. And you guys are blaming me for this.

But to me, what you're seeing here is the president, I think, ramping up. Remember, last week, it was he's going to send some troops to the border, about 800, I believe. Now it's up to thousands. And I think this is all about his upset that the bombing, the shooting are dominating coverage in the American narrative at the moment as opposed to his demonization of these immigrants as some kind.",

And also, the other thing is the Democrats have so much money, tons of money flowing into all these congressional districts.

So you've got a lot of these districts that might not take to the president being in ads, so I think that's a smart decision in their point. I think in the senate -- I feel pretty comfortable where things stand, but the house is tricky just because you've so many Republicans that aren't running for reelection. You have a lot of open seats which are more difficult to win. And there's just so many competitive seats. The Democrats only need to net 23. So, I'm a little bit worried about the house.

If the actions of evildoers are out of their own control and nothing else could have led to the violence, then how can you even begin to punish these creeps? It's wrong. Meanwhile, for both the bomber and the shooter, President Trump, Mr. Law and Order, pushes the death penalty. There is no ambiguity there. He places the blame firmly on the dirt bags. And like most Republicans seeks out the stiffest penalty, literally, the stiffest. This contradicts the media who see Trump as a hateful ringleader who sympathizes with such cretins. Speaking of those suspects, they were total losers. Failures in life who placed their rage on others and anyone with an opinion could provide a trigger because words can influence. It's why there's advertising. But that's a scary path to take especially for Hollywood, rap stars, and video game makers, or even people paid to speak carefully and thoughtfully."

When something happens and it's directed at Democrats it is purely Republican and President Trump's fault. But it's also just intellectually dishonest because if you look at the mail bombing suspect, this guy has a rap sheet going back to 1991. He made a bombing -- terrorist threat in 2002. And then, if you look at the synagogue shooting, this guy hated President Trump because he didn't think he was an anti-Semite. So if you actually look at the facts it doesn't drive the narrative that the media's driving, but the only reason they do it is because the midterms are around the corner and they want to hurt President Trump."

So part of it, and what I heard in your monologue and from Lisa is blame the press, that the press is not fair to him. And he's gone back now to the press is the enemy of the people. But I think this goes, from my perspective, beyond that because his rhetoric is so intense that I think it has, you know, sort of created an atmosphere of more kind of dissidence and vitriol than we're accustomed to. To my mind, you know, what we've seen in the last week or so, it makes me wonder, is this America? How did we get to this point? And then over the weekend, you know, just, you know, put me aside, because I just worry that you'll say, oh, well, that's Juan Williams. There's the press again. But here's 35,000 people, Greg, saying the president will not be welcome in Pittsburgh unless he denounces white nationalism. And here's words from this group, this is a Jewish group, then the ark, they say for the past three years, your words, your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement.

If you ask me when this happened, first the bomber is discovered, two, the shooting of the synagogue, I thought maybe by Sunday, on a Sunday show, some pundit looking to get a network contract would go ahead and say I think the president is to blame. I did not know, the same night, the same day, within an hour, they said, ha, ha, look at what you see. What the president does and it works to his detriment is he watched everybody talk about all this. And it had him seething, as if we were sitting outside the glass listening to The Five talk about us. For him -- he's outraged. So what does the president do? Exactly what he did his entire life, at the Trump organization, and as a candidate, and as president, I'm going to go tweet out. I'm going to speak out. And you guys are blaming me for this. You're making it worst. The way you treat me has my 60 million who voted for me, and maybe more, seething, ready to go. Now that's nothing to do with that lunatic in Florida, and that nutcase in Pittsburgh.

Can I just add one last thing? I know we've got to go. And that is the issue of radicalization of people. We've talked about this a lot during the war on terror. How does it happen, right? Where you have hopeless people, purposeless people, people who are ignorant, and then they find purpose in something that they find somewhere. Now it's online. You have radical Islamists. How do they find it? And there's something -- there's always -- there's something. I don't necessarily think it's speech, but there is a culmination of it. And if you look at this guy's background, Boyers's background, he certainly had it, right? He turned evil and vile into violence. And what we should be talking about as the president says, I'll do everything in my power to stop it from happening again. OK, so what is it in your power to do?

I didn't think it's going to be at the southern border of Mexico, but somehow we have to send a message. And taking the children away from the families, I don't know if you heard, not a good move. It was meant to be a deterrent and ended up being horrendous. So in this aspect, I like the move. I like the check that was signed. It shows he's taking action. What I find stunning from a political point of view is I don't hear any outrage from Democrats. Senator Schumer. Where's Nancy Pelosi saying I prefer the illegals come in here? What I saw was the mocking tone of Barack Obama saying as if people are scared. People aren't scared of these people coming to our border. We understand their plight.

That doesn't make any sense. The logical collusion here is that you waive caravans through, more will come. So that's why you have to be a hard ass in life. That's the sad part. This isn't happening.

And that there should be an effort to make sure that this -- the source of this problem is dealt with back in Honduras, back in Guatemala. But to me, what you're seeing here is the president, I think, ramping up. Remember, last week, it was he's going to send some troops to the border, about 800, I believe. Now it's up to thousands.

You had liberal groups like the center for American progress sending out a memo to Democrats in competitive districts telling them to avoid this issue, don't talk about it. Sanctuary city attacks pack a punch. So that's why Democrats aren't talking about it.

You've got 80 percent of people will pass their first initial interview, but only 20 percent will be granted asylum in immigration courts.

They're not going to pay attention to the caravans, etcetera. We are past the persuasion stage. We are completely get out to vote. And also, the other thing is the Democrats have so much money, tons of money flowing into all these congressional districts. One of the things that's happening for the Republicans is they're realizing that the Democrats map is expanding in the house in very tight races, now they have to put money into them and they're trying to figure out how can we, actually, try to match this money that the Democrats have.

My understanding is President Trump is not on the ad which is probably smart too because there are 24 districts where Hillary Clinton won. So you've got a lot of these districts that might not take to the president being in ads, so I think that's a smart decision in their point. I think in the senate -- I feel pretty comfortable where things stand, but the house is tricky just because you've so many Republicans that aren't running for reelection. You have a lot of open seats which are more difficult to win. And there's just so many competitive seats. The Democrats only need to net 23. So, I'm a little bit worried about the house.

Her motivational messages include \"Never give up,\" \"Smile,\" \"You are loved,\" \"Keep on trying.\" Truman says most of those messages came from what she tells her own children or what you'd want to hear herself. So what happened? The principal, Sharon Shewbridge, posted pictures of the fruit on Twitter. And it all went viral.

Ursuline nuns came here in the 1730s, and it was Andrew Jackson who visited them. And they said, \"If you win, can we stay?\" And he said, \"Absolutely.\" They said, \"We're going to pray for you to win.\" And Andrew Jackson believed that the Ursuline nuns' prayers during the battle gave them the unfathomable victory where we defeated the British in 45 minutes and did something Napoleon couldn't. Napoleon lost."
