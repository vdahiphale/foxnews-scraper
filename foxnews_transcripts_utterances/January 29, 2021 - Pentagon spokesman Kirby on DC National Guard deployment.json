In case you were worried that all of this would sort of fade, it hasn't, by week's end, as volatile and as crazy as ever, GameStop as soon as we got news that Robinhood was raising a whole bunch of dough to allow traders to resume buying and selling the stock, and they did in droves, as you can see, a lot more buying. But it also helped lift a number of other beaten-down stocks, Nokia, Express, for a while, American Airlines. The new sort of fad in town is, if it's shorted and down because some big hedge funds say it's going to go down, along come these rebel populist traders to say, not on our watch. So, how far does this go and how big does this get? Welcome, everybody. Happy Friday to you. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is your very, well, depending on the stock, profitable world. Not so great for the conventional general markets, which are taking it on the chin, namely because Washington right now is going to take its investigations right to GameStop and a host of others, and all these others that have been jumping far and fast. Susan Li on the end-of-week theatrics that I don't think are ending on this end of the week.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Neil. So, the GameStop-Reddit frenzy has driven Wall Street into unchartered territory. We have never seen trading volumes like this before. And that's making investors nervous. We have the Dow Jones industrials briefly breaking below 30000 this afternoon, so, the Dow, along with the broader S&P, finishing the first month of the year lower. And while it was a major sell-off elsewhere in the markets, a GameStop rally was back on, huge moves in the Reddit trading favorites like GameStop, AMC, Express, and Koss. And this is after Robinhood allowed its users to freely trade these names once again, managing to raise a billion dollars in cash last night. So, that ensures that it has enough money to clear the huge volume of trades. But the move also angered Robinhood users, who accused the app of rigging the markets in order to benefit the big money hedge fund guys. Now, the SEC warning this morning that they will closely review actions taken by regulated entities like Robinhood that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade, but also adding that the SEC will also act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity, an investigation, by the way, that Elizabeth Warren said that she asked for. She tweeted that: \"Casino-like swings in stock prices of GameStop reflect wild levels of speculation that don't help GameStop's workers or customers and could lead to market instability.\" Now, despite Robinhood lifting restrictions this morning on trade, that didn't last long, as the stock market sold off into the afternoon. So, Robinhood customers holding GameStop shares were only allowed to buy one additional share and up to five options contracts. And that's not exactly free market capitalism at work there, Neil.",

There's so much we don't know. This much, we do. The market giveth and it can taketh right now. So, all of these people who are holding on to multimillion-dollar fortunes, in some cases, given the run-up in the stock, what happens if they want to get out? What happens when they all want to get out at the same time? That could be problematic. I have the two Charleses with us right now. And I'm very happy to, Charles Payne, of course, Charlie Gasparino. Gentlemen, welcome. Charles Payne, to you. The fact that the government is sniffing around, and something we will raise with Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, what do you make of that, that they're beginning to say, wait a minute, we got to start really looking into all of this?",

      "sentences": "Well, that always raises a red flag, right? So -- and, of course, in this environment, people are wondering, what part of this saga are you going to be sniffing around? Will it be the ability to short 140 percent of a company? Even these shorts -- if you just look at the top 10 shorted stocks, in FIZZ and Tootsie Roll, those kind of names, to short 70, 60, 80 percent of a company, let alone 140 percent, I think a lot of people universally believe something is wrong there. I would start there if I was Congress. And then, listen, if Robinhood is having trouble, they have got to -- they're going to have to look back and understand how they seduce or wooed all of these customers, and maybe, maybe figure that part out. So, I'm worried about Congress, but I'm not -- I'm glad that the attention is reaching certain levels and that this has become a mainstream story, because it's a -- the underpinnings of this are mainstream, in the sense that those who have not had a chance to participate, those who don't think they have a lot of money, those who have felt that their forays into the market in the past have been crushed, either they were in a stock that was shorted or something just didn't work out for them, they feel like maybe, collectively, they now have a voice, and they're being taken seriously.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, I worry about it. Listen, here's the bottom line with short selling, and here's why I'm worried about them cracking down on short selling. Short selling actually exposes so many frauds, because stock markets are much more filled with touters and people who pump up these stocks like GameStop, by the way. I mean, when was the last time you were in a mall? Or BlackBerry. I mean, that -- those stocks are being touted, and investors are getting in those stocks, thinking that they are great, based on flimsy research. And guess what? The short sales come in and give you another side of the story. So, if you think getting rid of short selling is a good thing, think again, because it's going to lead to many more ripoffs. The problem with Washington, I think, on this story, is this, Neil. I don't think there's much they can do. You can investigate the market manipulation. Guess what? You're going to find out it's almost impossible to peel back, because a lot of this -- a lot of this message board stuff is all anonymous. What's the difference between a tout and a real -- and a real belief in something? You have to delineate that. The real thing came down, I think, is -- with what's going on here is that, when you have the Federal Reserve just putting -- having zero percent interest rates forever, you're going to get GameStop that's at $3 a share shoot up to $40 a share, which is when the shorts came in and said, this thing ain't worth it. It's full of -- it's full of irrational exuberance. And that's happening with a lot of stocks. So, I think the big thing is, you want to add some reality to the markets? Add some interest rates and make sure there's -- make sure you have to pay for money here.",

But having said that, Charles Payne I know you have been saying, we don't waste a nanosecond looking the other way when big shorts and some of these big hedge funds are losing a lot of money here and we don't hold them accountable. But God forbid the little guy makes a lot of money. Then we're zeroing in on him. Is it really that way, though? Or is there just a sense right now that this is like a market-toppy event, that we're assigning values to companies that are way beyond the norm? Tesla's one thing, but something that we see happening to these small guys who've been targeted, I guess, because they're small, because of the focus of shorts, they get a disproportionate amount of attention.

Listen, I'm in the market to make money. Two weeks ago, I put out a list of shorts that people should buy. And we took profits on them, actually, most of them last week. The only one I took profits on this week, I think, was SPCE (ph). And they were all grand slams. So, you got to know your own greed level. Also, the assumption that everyone who bought these at 50 bucks is all going to hold it until it goes all the way back down to $1. It's a farce. I mean, these are not dumb people. They may -- some of them -- listen, human nature, some people are going to get greedy. But a lot of people have already made a lot of money. I think the main story here, though, is that Wall Street hedge funds, it's good. You think a stock is 100 bucks and it should be 80 bucks, go short. But they don't just go short. They put together 50-page reports. They get to go on TV. They have their own networks, their own very powerful networks. They don't need to go in a chat room and gather a million people with 400 bucks. They can make two or three phone calls.",

We have the Dow Jones industrials briefly breaking below 30000 this afternoon, so, the Dow, along with the broader S&P, finishing the first month of the year lower.

And this is after Robinhood allowed its users to freely trade these names once again, managing to raise a billion dollars in cash last night. So, that ensures that it has enough money to clear the huge volume of trades. But the move also angered Robinhood users, who accused the app of rigging the markets in order to benefit the big money hedge fund guys. Now, the SEC warning this morning that they will closely review actions taken by regulated entities like Robinhood that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade, but also adding that the SEC will also act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity, an investigation, by the way, that Elizabeth Warren said that she asked for."

Gentlemen, welcome. Charles Payne, to you. The fact that the government is sniffing around, and something we will raise with Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, what do you make of that, that they're beginning to say, wait a minute, we got to start really looking into all of this?"

      "utterance": "Well, that always raises a red flag, right? So -- and, of course, in this environment, people are wondering, what part of this saga are you going to be sniffing around? Will it be the ability to short 140 percent of a company? Even these shorts -- if you just look at the top 10 shorted stocks, in FIZZ and Tootsie Roll, those kind of names, to short 70, 60, 80 percent of a company, let alone 140 percent, I think a lot of people universally believe something is wrong there. I would start there if I was Congress. And then, listen, if Robinhood is having trouble, they have got to -- they're going to have to look back and understand how they seduce or wooed all of these customers, and maybe, maybe figure that part out. So, I'm worried about Congress, but I'm not -- I'm glad that the attention is reaching certain levels and that this has become a mainstream story, because it's a -- the underpinnings of this are mainstream, in the sense that those who have not had a chance to participate, those who don't think they have a lot of money, those who have felt that their forays into the market in the past have been crushed, either they were in a stock that was shorted or something just didn't work out for them, they feel like maybe, collectively, they now have a voice, and they're being taken seriously."

I'm just sort of getting a general sense of where you are on this, but not necessarily for Washington intervening, that it can cause more harm. Could you explain?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I worry about it. Listen, here's the bottom line with short selling, and here's why I'm worried about them cracking down on short selling. Short selling actually exposes so many frauds, because stock markets are much more filled with touters and people who pump up these stocks like GameStop, by the way. I mean, when was the last time you were in a mall? Or BlackBerry. I mean, that -- those stocks are being touted, and investors are getting in those stocks, thinking that they are great, based on flimsy research. And guess what? The short sales come in and give you another side of the story. So, if you think getting rid of short selling is a good thing, think again, because it's going to lead to many more ripoffs. The problem with Washington, I think, on this story, is this, Neil. I don't think there's much they can do. You can investigate the market manipulation. Guess what? You're going to find out it's almost impossible to peel back, because a lot of this -- a lot of this message board stuff is all anonymous. What's the difference between a tout and a real -- and a real belief in something? You have to delineate that. The real thing came down, I think, is -- with what's going on here is that, when you have the Federal Reserve just putting -- having zero percent interest rates forever, you're going to get GameStop that's at $3 a share shoot up to $40 a share, which is when the shorts came in and said, this thing ain't worth it. It's full of -- it's full of irrational exuberance. And that's happening with a lot of stocks. So, I think the big thing is, you want to add some reality to the markets? Add some interest rates and make sure there's -- make sure you have to pay for money here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, well, that could be a whole 'nother phenomena here. There's plenty justification to keep rates where they are. But having said that, Charles Payne I know you have been saying, we don't waste a nanosecond looking the other way when big shorts and some of these big hedge funds are losing a lot of money here and we don't hold them accountable. But God forbid the little guy makes a lot of money. Then we're zeroing in on him. Is it really that way, though? Or is there just a sense right now that this is like a market-toppy event, that we're assigning values to companies that are way beyond the norm? Tesla's one thing, but something that we see happening to these small guys who've been targeted, I guess, because they're small, because of the focus of shorts, they get a disproportionate amount of attention. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's easy now to say, oh, well, Tesla is not the same. For the last five, six, seven years, people were saying the same exact argument. I'm not here to argue value. Listen, I'm in the market to make money. Two weeks ago, I put out a list of shorts that people should buy. And we took profits on them, actually, most of them last week. The only one I took profits on this week, I think, was SPCE (ph). And they were all grand slams. So, you got to know your own greed level. Also, the assumption that everyone who bought these at 50 bucks is all going to hold it until it goes all the way back down to $1. It's a farce. I mean, these are not dumb people. They may -- some of them -- listen, human nature, some people are going to get greedy. But a lot of people have already made a lot of money. I think the main story here, though, is that Wall Street hedge funds, it's good. You think a stock is 100 bucks and it should be 80 bucks, go short. But they don't just go short. They put together 50-page reports. They get to go on TV. They have their own networks, their own very powerful networks. They don't need to go in a chat room and gather a million people with 400 bucks. They can make two or three phone calls."

But, hey, let's remember, Neil, the technology, the innovation of some of these companies that have made a user-friendly app that allows you to trade stocks for free, and including fractional shares of stock, this is a wonderful innovation that is bringing investment opportunities to people of modest means who never would have had that opportunity before.

When this ends, it's going to end badly for the people who buy in late, just as it went very badly for the hedge funds who shorted early. The hedge funds need to live with the consequences of that.

But I can tell you, it's going through the same process that any request for military forces, which comes in from our combatant commanders, goes through. It'll get sourced by the services. And then once we have analyzed it and determined the risk and what that -- what are the best resources to apply to it, then we will be out and about. But Secretary Austin has made it very clear that the Department of Defense does have capability and capacity to assist in this, and he wants to make sure we're leaning forward and leaning in on contributing to the larger federal government mission here."

I know you have reported and mentioned, as has the secretary, that the Taliban's refusal to meet commitments to reduce violence could inhibit or even prevent that. Where do things stand now?"

No decisions have been made about our future force posture there. But the Department of Defense stands fully in support of the State Department's lead on trying to achieve a negotiated settlement. Look, there's got to be a political solution here that's bolstered by a permanent and comprehensive cease-fire. And that's where the Department of Defense wants to, again, help contribute to the diplomatic effort. But I think, right now, General Austin, as he said in testimony, we want to take a look at the negotiations that have occurred between the Taliban, so we can better understand the nature of the commitments. And, clearly, violence hasn't stopped there. And that's a real key component going forward."

      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "I don't want to get into hypotheticals, Neil. Again, we're going to review the status of the negotiations that are going on. And we have made no decisions about future force posture. The secretary looks forward to speaking to commanders in the field and here in the Pentagon, as he gets a better grip on what the troop level ought to be going forward. But we have been hearing that, initially, anyway, the 2,500 troops that they have right now are commensurate with the missions that they have been given. But the secretary says he wants to get -- he wants to get a little bit more knowledge and context about the mission itself going forward. So, we're not making any commitments on force posture at this time."

But, of course, not surprising, as if on cue -- and this happens the beginning of every new administration -- the Chinese take some provocative actions, as you know, in the South China Sea, where they're building up their presence, as well as some other matters, more bellicose regarding Taiwan, and its push for eventual independence, something that, to them, is a nonstarter, the Chinese. Are you -- is the secretary worried that China has emerged as, by far, not only our biggest threat, but maybe our thorniest one right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "The way the secretary described it in testimony just a couple of weeks ago is that he views China as the prime pacing challenge of the United States military. And he's speaking from a military perspective. Certainly, it's a pacing challenge, a strategic competitor. But he's also said and made clear that there's no reason for any of this tension to resolve itself through confrontation, that we have military-to-military dialogue with the Chinese. There's no reason for any of this to resolve itself into some kind of conflict. But we also have an obligation to protect our national security interests in the Asia Pacific. We are a Pacific power. We have -- we have -- five of our seven treaty alliances are in the Pacific region. So, we have alliances that we also need to make sure we're honoring through security commitments. And that's where his focus is going to be, on making sure that the department has the capabilities, the operational concepts, the technology that we need to match this pacing threat."

And that would certainly -- as it would on almost every other level, I think you can expect that that will include these advisory committees and these advisory boards. I don't have any decisions to read out to you today or to announce today, except to say that he's certainly wanting, just like in every other -- just like we talked about with Afghanistan, he wants to take a bottom-up look and make sure that the Department of Defense is doing the right things to protect and defend the American people.

But Governor Cuomo under fire from no less than the New York state attorney general, a Democrat, by the way, who says that the deaths in nursing homes in the Empire State were severely understated by a number closer to 50 percent. In other words, the deaths were at least 50 percent higher than the administration was letting on. Now, the back-and-forth on this doesn't end. But the fact that the attorney general, herself a Democrat, conducted the study and released those findings has added considerable weight to it. Bryan Llenas following the fallout from all of that. Hey, Bryan."

Well, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that it is a tragedy that thousands of people died of COVID-19 in the state's nursing homes, but he did not take any personal responsibility. In fact, he said there's really nobody to blame. And then, in the same breath, he blamed the Trump administration."

Now, Governor Cuomo says that that mandate was simply following federal guidelines and that nursing homes should have alerted the state if they could not handle COVID patients. Well, nursing homes argue they were overwhelmed and the guidance was not clear. Former Assistant Secretary of Health Admiral Brett Giroir says that it's not the federal government's fault. ADM.

That's 4,000 more than had been reported. Now, New York was not counting as part of that final death toll count anybody who was transferred to a hospital and happened to die there. When asked about this discrepancy, Neil, the governor said it was -- part of it was a result of sketchy data that was given to the state by nursing homes. And then he said, frankly, who cares where the person died? They died, and it's a tragedy. But, Neil, if you speak to the grieving families who are looking for accountability, it matters immensely where their loved one died -- Neil."

They are still trying to figure out how many nursing home residents died in the facilities and how many died after they were transferred to the hospital. And the reality is, across the nation, Neil, about 36 percent of all of our COVID deaths in this country are still occurring in long-term health facilities.

So, the idea that it's going to be maybe removing some of the more contentious provisions for Republicans, like aid to states and that sort of thing, it's going to happen, and with them or without them. Is that the right message? Lee Carter with us right now, Republican pollster. Lee, I have heard so many Republican senators who are saying, you talk like a moderate, but you executive order and implement like a much, much, much more progressive guy. What do you think of the language he's using and the executive orders and the stance that he's taken?"

In testing the inaugural address, other speeches, when the president used the language of unity, Republicans reacted all very similarly. They said, it's a great message, but I think what he means is unity for people who agree with me. And I think what he's doing right now is showing that's what he meant. He's saying, I'm going to go it alone. I mean, on my first act, I'm not even going to try to reach across the aisle. I'm not even going to attempt to compromise. I don't believe it's possible, is what he's saying. And that's his prerogative. Elections have consequences. The Republicans lost. The Democrats won. This is what he can do. But it's a really tough pill to swallow when you say that you're going to be the president of unity for all Americans, when you're not even going to have a conversation about it."

He could have a devil of a time getting old Democrats on board. Joe Manchin of West Virginia comes to mind. There are others who are skeptical about where a lot of this money is going. And that's why there was talk, how about breaking this up a little bit, maybe into two measures, keep some of the more controversial provisions out in the first go-round, so you can address states and helping them out later on, which is a real bone of contention with those moderate Democrats and Republicans? But he's not indicating that he's going to do that. What do you think?"

      "utterance": "He's not indicating that he is going to break it apart? And I'm not so sure that anyone on the left would vote against this at this point. I think what's really at play here, right, is, are the Democrats or the Republicans going to be the party of the working class? And that's really what this has been -- this election was a war for. And that's really what's at stake right now. And you saw the speaker of the House, McCarthy, put out the statement this week where he said: \"We must ask the Biden administration at every turn, will it help Americans in need?\" That's the bar that the Republicans are putting by. By obstructing this, they're saying, no, we're not for acting in the interests of Republicans in need, even though they have lots of reasons to break it apart, and there's lots of reasons why they might oppose it. But, symbolically, that's what it looks like. I think Democrats would have the same problem. If they don't pass it, it looks like they're not for Republicans in need. And those particular Democrats who would be voting against it would really have, I think, a hard time within their party."

If you're keeping track of, with along with these companies, AstraZeneca, and you have got Oxford, Pfizer, BioNTech, again, no shortage of premier players offering what could potentially be tens of millions of extra doses of vaccine on the market. That's not the issue then. It's getting into people's arms, which has proven a real, real problem. Dr. Saralyn Mark, the Medical Reserve Corps, American Medical Women's Association head, on all of this. Doctor, that's the one that I don't understand. No shortage of vaccines, right? I mean, we're told now there are twice as many as people who have taken them out already. Now, I understand the problem, the last mile and in states and all.

If you can remember, back in the springtime, we had issues with testing, trying to get the tests to folks who needed it and to get results back on time. I think, as we have seen, we have to deal with supplies, such as the vaccines and all the elements that you need to vaccinate, certainly sites, as well as people to vaccinate, as well as administer those vaccines, to register and to check surveillance. I think now we have a really good game plan to try to correct some of the bottlenecks to move us forward, because we have got to get these vaccines into the arms of individuals. So, by activating the Defense Production Act to ensure that we have more supplies, not just the vaccines, but everything else that you need for them, to get more people to vaccinate, to also check the data management system. How easy is it to register people? How is it to follow? And what does it take to pre-vaccinate, as well as follow folks after vaccinating?"

But that it's less effective against this variant, the South African variant that's popped up in -- like, states like South Carolina, and I notice other vaccines have similar issues, not that they can't deal with it, but not deal with it as well. Should we be worried, Doctor?"

And what we have to do is try to stay on top of things as quick as possible. With these mRNA platforms, with the new antivirus platform, they're able to adjust, perhaps provide boosters. But, Neil, you bring up something that's important. Should we be concerned? And the issue is, yes, but we have tools in front of us. I know we have used the military parlance to talk about this as a war. We have activated, reactivated the Defense Production Act. Just think about it. You don't go into battle with just your guns. You go in with body armor. And so, if you think about your vaccines as guns and your public health measures as your body armor, we have a fighting chance. So, what are those public health measures, which we know work if we use them consistently correctly? And that's masking up, distancing and washing our hands."

Because you have got a lot of exposure here, in lot of sense. And it's -- I don't see it on the side of the retail investors. You get these unsophisticated retail investors. And unless you're going to show some kind of real coordination and collusion to manipulate the market, which is a -- by the way, it's a very hard thing to prove in this country, I think they're the safest ones out of the bunch.

And did they stop trading and halt trading because of the volatility hit that threshold that, under their agency agreement, allows them to stop trading, or did they stop it because they were protecting some fund that's got a big investment in their platform?
