I think he didn't help himself. I agree with this interview. This idea you are asked if you are basically a predator and you say, well, it's out of my customary behavior is sort of a 1988 Dukakis moment of that's not what most of us would respond. It sounded like it came out of his lawyer's BlackBerry. And so that is not a good start for his public campaign."

      "utterance": "Let's keep in mind that this isn't happening in a vacuum. This comes on top of the revelation that he was taking a salary from this charity, which he had denied, a rather large salary, about $180,000 a year. Also let's keep in mind that Alabama voters did run their governor out of office earlier this year after a sex scandal. So they are not going to be OK with just about anything. There is a tipping point."

      "utterance": "Rachael, what about the White House here? We're seen the White House weigh in and say if true Moore needs to step aside, but also emphasizing that someone's life should not be ruined if it's not accurate. And the vice president weighing in today, saying the vice president has found the allegation and the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office. Obviously, the president campaigned for Luther Strange, his opponent."

      "speaker": "BADE",
      "utterance": "I think the \"if true\" are the key words there. We are probably not going to see prove of whether or not this is true. So it will sort of be a draw. But going back to what you're saying, lawmakers have resigned for less scandalous things than this. We saw Chris Smith resign from the House after there were reports that he had sent a shirtless picture to somebody he met online. This sort of, I think, speaks about how the \"Access Hollywood\" scandal has changed politics, and that is the president had his own scandal, he stayed in it, he survived. Clearly, Moore thinks he could potentially stay here."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right, but is Roy Moore Donald Trump? I think that is the question, and a lot of people in Alabama might be saying, maybe not if you can ride out something like this. That is interesting, though, the politics of this and the environment that we are in with all of these cases, you know, from Hollywood to over in England to you name it. It's happening a lot."

If that's true, he could have serious problems with that statement."
