For example, the Palestinian Authority pays terrorists and their families for murdering Israelis and Americans. That's why the Taylor Force Act was introduced on Capitol Hill, and we will see where that goes this year if anywhere at all. But there are questions that Americans have about where their money is being spent, and there is an argument to be made that there are investments made all over the world, but what are they getting in return? And is it being harmful towards their interests?"

This is noteworthy because the United States, Pakistan has spent a number one ally of the United States in terms of fighting terrorism. But people have long known that there are pockets in Pakistan that do harbor extremism. That's where Usama bin Laden was hiding. So he is pointing to that and he is saying you guys have got to get tougher, and they might lose their foreign aid otherwise."
