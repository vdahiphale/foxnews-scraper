      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” One of the most bewildering facts of our current moment is how quickly everything moves. For example, remember the latest \"New York Times\" hit piece on Brett Kavanaugh? The one where they found a brand new accusation of sexual misconduct, but then later had to admit it was all a sham. When did that happen? It feels like about a year ago, but actually, no, it was just last week. That's the Trump era news cycle for you. Scandals that used to go on for months now seem to end in hours. Nothing illustrates that better than this bizarre Ukraine story that we're all living through. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So we could go no one had even heard of it. Last night, we were on the brink of impeachment because of it. And now, it seems to be over already. Just to bring you back and remind you what just happened. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The same angry news anchors who brought you Stormy Daniels and the Russia hoax now wanted you to know that Big Orange's days in the White House were finally over. Why? Because Trump they said threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine. And it's essential that we said military aid Ukraine for some reason, but Trump was going to withhold it unless they did something bad to Joe Biden in his family. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Basically, it was an extortion plot against Ukraine, and that's a crime, the news anchors shouted. A crime. Trump was finished. Well, this morning, they turned out to be wrong. Actual evidence emerged. And it contradicted what they told us yesterday. The administration released a transcript of the President's phone call with Ukrainian head of state, and it shows none of the things that news anchors claimed it would show. Read it for yourself, don't trust us. It's right online. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Try to find the extortion in there. There isn't any. Trump never even mentions military aid. Well, yes, they're saying now, but he asked a foreign government to investigate an American citizen and that is immoral. Okay. Was it immoral when three Democratic senators wrote a letter to Ukraine just last year, demanding investigations into Trump? No answer on that question. Well, we will tell you if we hear back. Instead now, they're telling us that the transcript of the phone call can't be real. It must be doctored. Watch Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff spin their conspiracy theory last night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

What they care about, and you knew this already was winning the 2020 presidential election. That's all they care about. Getting their mitts on the levers of power and exercising power for its own sake. That's what drives them. That's why they get up in the morning. Democratic leaders have decided that impeaching Trump is essential if they're going to win next year. So they're staking everything on this bizarre, flimsy scandal that the rest of us can barely even understand. Will it work?

If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Joe Biden's corruption -- alleged corruption. That can't help us campaign for President. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really. They must have gamed this out. They must know. Is it sabotage? Well, honestly, we don't know. We're not in the room. Maybe it is. Or maybe Democrats and just become so obsessed with destroying Donald Trump, that they're destroying themselves accidentally. Kim Strassel is, of course a member of \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board, one of the smartest people at that newspaper.

Now critics of the President are slamming the transcripts the White House released. They're calling it incomplete and fake, even branding it on Twitter as #NotATranscript. But sources who actually know how presidential phone calls work, say this document reflects very standard procedure. It's how every administration for decades now has documented calls with foreign leaders. They also tell Fox News, they are confident it's accurate. So it's essentially a compilation of what two Situation Room officers wrote down while listening in on the call in real-time. This is what they're trained to do. This document you're looking at now, it was declassified Tuesday by the President. As you can see there, it's marked. It also indicates this call itself took place on July 25th. Now, one source familiar with the White House Situation Room staff today claims the two transcribers who listened in on this call are likely C.I.A. employees detailed to the White House from the agency on an assignment. After the Watergate scandal, Tucker, the White House kind of stopped doing audio recordings of the President's call.

A reporter of the \"Des Moines Register\" decided to basically wreck this kid's life. And so he did. He went digging for an excuse to destroy King. \"The Des Moines Register\" found that excuse in two tweets that King made seven years ago -- tweeted seven years ago when he was 16 years old, in high school. The tweets contain racially offensive humor. The kind that edgy teenagers traffic the world over. I am not defending it, but that's how they talk sometimes. But it didn't matter. \"The Des Moines Register\" decided that this kid had to be destroyed. So they dispatched a reporter called Aaron Calvin and he published a profile of King that highlighted the two ancient tweets. Then he went to Anheuser Busch to tattle on King. Well, immediately the beer company announced it would drop all association with Carson King. And by the way, the offensive tweets were simply jokes taken from the television show \"Tosh.0\" which airs on Comedy Central to this day. Here's the irony. Anheuser Busch is a major advertiser on Comedy Central. So other words, this huge company is happy to crush you for quoting products they fund the creation of. If that doesn't make your head spin, then nothing will. In a bizarre statement posted to Twitter, meanwhile, \"The Des Moines Register's\" Executive Editor, a woman called Carol Hunter, said the paper's behavior was part of -- and we're quoting, \"A routine background check.\" As if some guy raising money for a children's hospital in a viral video needed a background check from a failing stupid newspaper staff by failing losers, which are the people who work there, by the way. But this is common now. Reporters trolling a person's entire life history for excuses to destroy him. That is standard practice. The paper said that it debated extensively whether to publish the tweets -- right? Ultimately they decided they had no choice, but to do it because of journalism. So they destroyed an ordinary person for doing a good deed. It wasn't journalism. It was an act of cruelty and casual malice. One of many, by the way, but we figured we'd highlight this one because it's just completely over the top. And by the way, irony of ironies, the very reporter who tried to destroy Carson King's life, turns out to have his own offensive tweeting history. Now he is under investigation by his own paper, which never conducted a background check. The whole thing, of course, it's originally deserved irony, mutual assured cancellation. But really that shouldn't be happening at all. We don't root for anybody's cancellation for hurting someone because of something he said in high school. Nobody should have his reputation wrecked for dumb jokes made a decade or whatever ago. Cancel culture is a national plague, and the only people it helps are bullies who use powerful platforms to defame and crush those they dislike, often with the help of major multinational corporations. Thankfully, some people are starting to realize that. More than a hundred thousand have signed a petition calling for \"The Des Moines Register\" to apologize to Carson King, and hopefully they will immediately. You should drop your subscription to that paper immediately if they don't. For real. Hopefully, it'll be the last time we need a petition like this here.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” One of the most bewildering facts of our current moment is how quickly everything moves. For example, remember the latest \"New York Times\" hit piece on Brett Kavanaugh? The one where they found a brand new accusation of sexual misconduct, but then later had to admit it was all a sham. When did that happen? It feels like about a year ago, but actually, no, it was just last week. That's the Trump era news cycle for you. Scandals that used to go on for months now seem to end in hours. Nothing illustrates that better than this bizarre Ukraine story that we're all living through. So we could go no one had even heard of it. Last night, we were on the brink of impeachment because of it. And now, it seems to be over already. Just to bring you back and remind you what just happened. The same angry news anchors who brought you Stormy Daniels and the Russia hoax now wanted you to know that Big Orange's days in the White House were finally over. Why? Because Trump they said threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine. And it's essential that we said military aid Ukraine for some reason, but Trump was going to withhold it unless they did something bad to Joe Biden in his family. Basically, it was an extortion plot against Ukraine, and that's a crime, the news anchors shouted. A crime. Trump was finished. Well, this morning, they turned out to be wrong. Actual evidence emerged. And it contradicted what they told us yesterday. The administration released a transcript of the President's phone call with Ukrainian head of state, and it shows none of the things that news anchors claimed it would show. Read it for yourself, don't trust us. It's right online. Try to find the extortion in there. There isn't any. Trump never even mentions military aid. Well, yes, they're saying now, but he asked a foreign government to investigate an American citizen and that is immoral. Okay. Was it immoral when three Democratic senators wrote a letter to Ukraine just last year, demanding investigations into Trump? No answer on that question. Well, we will tell you if we hear back. Instead now, they're telling us that the transcript of the phone call can't be real. It must be doctored. Watch Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff spin their conspiracy theory last night."

      "speaker": "SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So again, that was last night before the transcript was publicly available. Now that it is publicly available for Adam Schiff's conspiracy addled brain, it has lurched into a different direction. Now, he is telling us that the transcript, the one that he has already denounced as fake, is in fact real. But it doesn't show what it should show, which is to say it doesn't show the President doing any of the things that supposedly justify impeachment. Why? Well, Adam Schiff explains because the President, like a Navajo Code Talker, is speaking in secret code."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHIFF",
      "utterance": "This is how a mafia boss talks. What have you done for us? We've done so much for you. But there's not much reciprocity. I have a favor I want to ask you. And what is that favor? Of course, the favor is to investigate his political rival. A classic mafia, like shakedown a foreign leader."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So, you know, we're not psychiatrists here, but honestly, Adam Schiff is a nut case. It's true. It's hard to believe he is in Congress. Poor people of Anaheim, or wherever he is from -- Southern California, the Valley somewhere. It's hard to believe he is in actually in Congress. He is actually a committee chairman. Believe it or not. Too bad the 25th Amendment doesn't apply to Members of Congress. But to be fair, most Democrats are not anywhere near as crazy as Adam Schiff, not even the same ballpark. They're just very cynical -- extremely cynical -- more cynical you've ever thought of being. For example, watch Congressman Al Green, who is not stupid or crazy explain what's actually driving impeachment. Watch this."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I'm concerned if we don't impeach, he will get reelected. I'm concerned that democracy could happen. We've got to stop that. It's about power. Duh. You knew that. That's what it's always about. Power. Nobody pushing for impeachment actually cares about secret deals with foreign leaders. Oh, please, much less justice or the truth. Again, these are the most cynical people in the United States of America. What they care about, and you knew this already was winning the 2020 presidential election. That's all they care about. Getting their mitts on the levers of power and exercising power for its own sake. That's what drives them. That's why they get up in the morning. Democratic leaders have decided that impeaching Trump is essential if they're going to win next year. So they're staking everything on this bizarre, flimsy scandal that the rest of us can barely even understand. Will it work? Probably not. If personal attacks on Trump are effective, if calling him a racist or a traitor actually worked, then Hillary Clinton to be running for reelection right about now? That not going to work. This never works. If you want to impeach Trump, make a case on the issues. He won on the issues. Make a counter case. The geniuses can't figure that out. In the end, really the loser here in this impeachment nonsense is likely to be Joe Biden. Biden, you'll recall is the front runner, supposedly. He is supposed to be the safe choice, the guy who is going to energize the Obama coalition and win back the White House. And yet now Democrats have in effect demanded that we spend the next six months talking about Biden and his son's alleged corruption, because that's at the core of this Ukraine story. If we're talking about Ukraine and impeachment, we're talking about Joe Biden's corruption -- alleged corruption. That can't help us campaign for President. In fact, it's likely to tank it. It looks like sabotage, really. They must have gamed this out. They must know. Is it sabotage? Well, honestly, we don't know. We're not in the room. Maybe it is. Or maybe Democrats and just become so obsessed with destroying Donald Trump, that they're destroying themselves accidentally. Kim Strassel is, of course a member of \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board, one of the smartest people at that newspaper. She joins us tonight. So, Kim, this is not really central. But I can't help but ask you, Joe Biden would seem to be the big loser here. How does this help Joe Biden?"

      "speaker": "KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, you just put your finger on the question that those of us who study politics have been really mystified by this week. We've watched the Democrats for almost three years now run through a complete litany of things that they have wanted to try to impeach Donald Trump on, everything. Russia hoax, obstruction of justice, Stormy Daniels, taxes, financials -- none of it has stuck. But at least in each of those, they could keep it focused or claim to keep it focused on Trump's behavior. And instead, they have now pulled the trigger on the one issue out there that implicates the leader of their front runner of their own nomination process and is likely to do the most damage to their moderate Democrats because of the flimsiest -- of the flimsiness of these charges."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, we'll see. I think that's exactly right. And by the way, you know, I think the impeachment really ought to be reserved for, you know, extreme violations of the law, because you're short circuiting democracy. But you know, I would support impeachment of this or any other President if one of those violations came to light. I mean, I would. I think most people would. But this is so far from that. It's so weird. And just -- there's nothing to it. So you really -- I'm not a conspiracy nut, but you've got to think that may be hurting Biden is the point. Do you think it could be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I don't necessarily think it is that. I think it's mostly driven by extreme hatred for this President, and also timing. Look, the pressure had been building up for Nancy Pelosi to act. They had what they thought might be a good scandal on their hands, and so they pulled the trigger. I think they moved too soon. Look, it's embarrassing now, given that the transcript has come out. But I think you also make a good point that there are plenty of Democrats, especially the radical left, and those are the ones who most dislike this President, who would be perfectly fine if this took Joe Biden out of the race and cleared the field for a more progressive nominee. He has got the support of certain quarters of the party, but those are not part of the party that has got most of the power and the attention at the moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "If you're looking for a scandal, Trump campaigned against the carried interest loophole. Some of the richest liberals in America are paying half the taxes you and I are paying.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, look, I think the reality is here, it is what we're saying is that, you know, Democrats are casting about and this is what the problem is you just put your finger on with impeachment. Americans expect impeachment to be used in a serious and sober fashion. Now, look, let's be honest, Congress has the right, they can impeach the President for laughing the wrong way, okay."

    {

But the American people expect more of that, and I think that what we're seeing now is, as they roll through these litany of things, and from one to the other to the other, and nothing, they're looking for a crime, right? They want something and people then begin to think that this is not -- this is not about accountability or the Constitution that we've heard so much about. This is about redoing the last election, and that is not something most Americans agree with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "No, it's -- and I'm not saying this is some kind of blind Trump partisan. I think that's a threat to our system, our constitutional system, and I think it's bad. I know you -- I know you agree with that. Kim, great to see you tonight. Thank you for explaining all of that. Well, Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler are in charge of impeachment this week, but they had pretty different opinions on the subjects just not that long ago, a few decades ago. One Democrat currently in Congress is about to tell us why he disagrees with impeachment today. But first, Trace Gallagher has to look back at Pelosi and Nadler's view on this suddenly very relevant topic. Hey, Trace."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT",

Most legal analysts even on liberal media outlets acknowledge it would be very difficult to make a case that President Trump broke the law. But back in 1998, President Clinton actually did violate the law and when House Republicans voted to impeach, Pelosi said it was based solely on hatred. Watch."

      "speaker": "REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.",

In the investigation of the President, fundamental principles which Americans hold dear, privacy, fairness, checks and balances have been seriously violated. And why? Because we are here -- we are here today, because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton, and until the Republicans free themselves of this hatred, our country will suffer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Also, back in 1998, Pelosi went on to say that President Clinton was not impeached for one single thing, but for all of the GOP grievances against him.

Well, until just the other day, Democrats appeared to be divided on the question of impeaching the President. This week, they appear to be nearly unanimous. But if you hold out, we're warning that an impeachment push is a mistake, bad for the country and possibly kind of productive politically. One of them is Congressman Jeff Van Drew. He represents New Jersey. He is one of those holdouts, he joins us tonight. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on."

You know, election -- you know, elections need to be dealt with as far as making sure that they're secure. I can give you a whole long list, Tucker. The point is, I really believe the more that we delve into this, the more time we spend on it, especially at a macro level, the more we're not going to be able to spend time on these other issues that are important. And it's not because we can't walk and chew gum at the same time because somebody brought that up. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. The problem is when we're this divided, when we're this split, these two political parties, and this is all going on, people aren't going to work together. So the President is not going to be signing bills. The Senate bills aren't going to be going through the House. The House bills aren't going to be going through the Senate. And at the end of the day, I'm afraid that all we're going to have is a failed impeachment because folks need to understand. I mean, maybe there are those that want to punish the President or make a point and I understand that, but the bottom line is, he is still going to be the President of the United States."

Impeachment is a very, very serious, serious move to take by any political party or political entity. You know, we have to realize that when you impeach somebody, it has to be for really strong reasons, because you are also, you know, removing the power of the people, you're disenfranchising their vote. Whether we like it or not, whether we like who won or not, you're disenfranchising their vote. And it has to be serious to do that."

I really know that you know, this -- and abroad, I think that people could look at this and think that our country is disorganized and in turmoil and that we're split apart. And I think it'll split people in society apart. I think folks in literally, in the United States of America are even going to get angrier at each other. I don't believe it's going to bring people together. And that's what we need to do. And then we have the election. And the other issue, by the way is these are the midterm elections that are going to be going on now.

For example, legal experts appear to be split even tonight about whether the President's phone call with the Ukrainian President was illegal. So we wanted to get to the bottom of that, obviously. So last night, we asked Joe DiGenova on the show. He is a former U.S. Attorney and we put that question to him. He said, no, there's no evidence it is illegal at all. Well, that statement, and some accompanying statements caused quite a firestorm, and so we've asked Joe DiGenova to come back tonight for an update. Joe, thanks so much for coming on tonight. So I want for our viewers who are not familiar with what exactly happened to know. So here's a quick update. So yesterday, Judge Andrew Napolitano, who is a legal analyst at Fox and a very nice guy, I will say, I've always liked him, went on one of our daytime shows, and declared that the President's phone call with the head of Ukraine was a crime. Here's what he said."

He is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. He can ask anyone, a citizen, a foreign leader a question; he can make a suggestion about an investigation because he runs them. And by the way, in the latest set to with the whistleblower, the Office of Legal Counsel has said that requesting information from a foreign government is not a thing of value. It is not a foreign contribution. I really -- I must say this, I've been a U.S. Attorney, an Independent Counsel, an Investigative Counsel on Capitol Hill in the House and the Senate. Judge Napolitano has never been a U.S. Attorney. He has never been a Federal prosecutor. He has never conducted a Federal grand jury. I have done all of those things. If he wants to have an opinion, that's fine. I am not a paid Fox contributor. I am a guest the Fox Network. I come on when they ask me. So -- and I am told, please, whatever you do, tell the truth. Don't make things up. Don't cover. So what I say I believe, of course, as a matter of law, I know what I'm talking about in the law. I try to be truthful. I was very truthful last night."

So as someone who read and edited probably literally hundreds of these types of transcripts at the White House during the Bush and Obama administrations, I can tell you this is as close to a verbatim read out of this call as exists. Now critics of the President are slamming the transcripts the White House released. They're calling it incomplete and fake, even branding it on Twitter as #NotATranscript. But sources who actually know how presidential phone calls work, say this document reflects very standard procedure. It's how every administration for decades now has documented calls with foreign leaders. They also tell Fox News, they are confident it's accurate. So it's essentially a compilation of what two Situation Room officers wrote down while listening in on the call in real-time. This is what they're trained to do. This document you're looking at now, it was declassified Tuesday by the President. As you can see there, it's marked. It also indicates this call itself took place on July 25th. Now, one source familiar with the White House Situation Room staff today claims the two transcribers who listened in on this call are likely C.I.A. employees detailed to the White House from the agency on an assignment. After the Watergate scandal, Tucker, the White House kind of stopped doing audio recordings of the President's call. So this document is as close to the ground truth as you or I are ever really going to get."

And they always -- they're very clever because they use the things, you can see the doors right there, right? It says restricted. So they'll come out of those doors.

Now, what you also have though is you have people who have lied so much, you know, it's the old saying, if you tell a lie enough, eventually it becomes the truth. You have so many that have done that. It's like an everyday they're pouring gasoline on themselves, they're pouring gasoline on the American people. They continue to light these fires out there. Why?

He asked for donations to fund his Busch Light supply. Well, the moment it went viral online, and soon, King was receiving thousands of actual dollars in actual donations. Pretty cool. But rather than take the money for himself, he did something awesome. Actually, King announced that he would donate the money to a local Children's Hospital and he did. Eventually he raised more than a million bucks. Anheuser Busch watched and then announced it would be making a matching donation. Pretty neat.

People caught wind of that. They started donating. Then Busch and Venmo caught wind of it. They're going to match whatever contributions we make. In Children's Hospitals, they do so much for everyone around the country. Obviously, you know, anything you can do to help the kids you have to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Pretty great story, but maybe he shouldn't have gone on Fox News because that clearly caught the attention of the journalistic community. A reporter of the \"Des Moines Register\" decided to basically wreck this kid's life. And so he did. He went digging for an excuse to destroy King. \"The Des Moines Register\" found that excuse in two tweets that King made seven years ago -- tweeted seven years ago when he was 16 years old, in high school. The tweets contain racially offensive humor. The kind that edgy teenagers traffic the world over. I am not defending it, but that's how they talk sometimes. But it didn't matter. \"The Des Moines Register\" decided that this kid had to be destroyed. So they dispatched a reporter called Aaron Calvin and he published a profile of King that highlighted the two ancient tweets. Then he went to Anheuser Busch to tattle on King. Well, immediately the beer company announced it would drop all association with Carson King. And by the way, the offensive tweets were simply jokes taken from the television show \"Tosh.0\" which airs on Comedy Central to this day. Here's the irony. Anheuser Busch is a major advertiser on Comedy Central. So other words, this huge company is happy to crush you for quoting products they fund the creation of. If that doesn't make your head spin, then nothing will. In a bizarre statement posted to Twitter, meanwhile, \"The Des Moines Register's\" Executive Editor, a woman called Carol Hunter, said the paper's behavior was part of -- and we're quoting, \"A routine background check.\" As if some guy raising money for a children's hospital in a viral video needed a background check from a failing stupid newspaper staff by failing losers, which are the people who work there, by the way. But this is common now. Reporters trolling a person's entire life history for excuses to destroy him. That is standard practice. The paper said that it debated extensively whether to publish the tweets -- right? Ultimately they decided they had no choice, but to do it because of journalism. So they destroyed an ordinary person for doing a good deed. It wasn't journalism. It was an act of cruelty and casual malice. One of many, by the way, but we figured we'd highlight this one because it's just completely over the top. And by the way, irony of ironies, the very reporter who tried to destroy Carson King's life, turns out to have his own offensive tweeting history. Now he is under investigation by his own paper, which never conducted a background check. The whole thing, of course, it's originally deserved irony, mutual assured cancellation. But really that shouldn't be happening at all. We don't root for anybody's cancellation for hurting someone because of something he said in high school. Nobody should have his reputation wrecked for dumb jokes made a decade or whatever ago. Cancel culture is a national plague, and the only people it helps are bullies who use powerful platforms to defame and crush those they dislike, often with the help of major multinational corporations. Thankfully, some people are starting to realize that. More than a hundred thousand have signed a petition calling for \"The Des Moines Register\" to apologize to Carson King, and hopefully they will immediately. You should drop your subscription to that paper immediately if they don't. For real. Hopefully, it'll be the last time we need a petition like this here.

So I don't -- I disagree, Tucker, I do think that it has got to be politically motivated in some way. Because it seems like people who identify as liberal left, don't ever get to be the victims of this.

      "utterance": "Well, the press rally to support Democrats after they launched yesterday's impeachment push -- a sort of impeachment push whatever they're doing, pretending to impeach. So the press cowardly backed down today when the transcript showed the entire scandal was fake. Actually, the transcript really did show the President committing crimes, well, maybe it didn't show that -- the press couldn't really agree on what it said. Watch."

They're confident there was absolutely nothing wrong -- nothing at all wrong with Joe Biden's nerduell son getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by a Ukrainian energy company to sit on a Board he wasn't qualified to sit on. That's totally fine."

If what Hunter Biden did was wrong, then, boy, there are a lot of people with the last name of Trump that has some answering to do about their foreign work."

      "utterance": "Chuck Todd wants you to know what Hunter Biden did was totally fine and you should just shut up. Okay, just shut up. By the way, \"The New York Times\" looked into it and they can be trusted. They got a Pulitzer for covering the Russian collusion, the spying that Trump did for Vladimir Putin. Howie Carr remembers all of this. He is a radio host and author of the book, \"What Really Happened.\" He joins us tonight. So Chuck Todd does not want you to show any concern about Hunter Biden did for the Ukrainian energy company, just so you know, Howie Carr."

      "utterance": "Right. Chuck Todd who used to work for a guy who lied about his combat record in Vietnam and you have Jake Tapper -- he is also very concerned about doctored documents. He worked for Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law who was married to a guy who went to prison for bank fraud, which is also known as doctoring documents. I mean, this is ridiculous, you know, and they're telling us that we -- they told us it was a smoking gun two days ago. Now we have to read between the lines, right? I mean, so they're telling us basically, you know, what the transcript says, don't worry about that Trump -- Trump didn't -- Trump meant something he needed to say, but on the other hand, you have the video tape of Biden saying something, but he really didn't mean it. If you noticed the two, Tucker, they are always saying the same thing. You know, first you have Adam Schiff saying it's a mob shakedown. Then you have Blumenthal tweeting out it's a gangster shakedown. Then you have Hillary Clinton's favorite journalist, Andrea Mitchell, saying, you know, it reminds me of the \"Godfather.\" Is there an echo in here or something? And how about Stephanopoulos -- George Stephanopoulos breaks in on the press conference and says, well, you know, this is an unrepentant President. Maybe because he didn't do anything and then he says, and he is also somewhat untruthful. Talk about a guy who should know something about untruthful Presidents. Bill Clinton, he worked for, you know, lost his law license and was impeached, lied under oath. I mean, this is really ridiculous. And how about Ilhan Omar and Hillary Clinton telling us no one is above the law. I thought their whole careers proved they are above the law. And Nancy Pelosi --"
