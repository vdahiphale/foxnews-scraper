Now you may or not be aware that there's a show on this network that airs at 5:00 p.m. and get this, it's called \"THE FIVE\" up pretty clever. How long did it take them to come up with that? It also got five people, I bet you didn't see that coming. But Thursday, something was said on that show that in the words of the media sparked outrage. You know, I love that phrase, mainly because their definition of sparking outrage is when one media outlet reports on tweets that another media outlet reported on earlier. They gossip like a group of high school girls sitting together in the calf. It's not reporting it's repurposing. You know, like Geraldo does with five dead caterpillars to make a mustache. Can't even tell, can you? Amazing. So what was the offending opinion on The Five? Well, let's find out.",

      "sentences": "Who the hell does he think he is? I mean, let's be honest. He's no spring chicken. It's not even a spring roll. And him judging the looks of other people, that seems a little bit ironic. I mean, on a scale of one to 10, maybe he's a 9.4. But looking at him that's maybe twice his body fat. I mean, I guess some people might find him attractive. I don't know. His piercing blue eyes. Those rock hard packs. Gorgeous salt and pepper hair. No wonder the jealous media pounced. My favorite headline, Fox News host, 58, under fire, under fire for bizarre complaints. The college kids aren't hot enough. That's The Independent. That's The Independent. A freaking British paper. But it is true. I'm old enough to be their professor. And they're old enough to be my girlfriend. But I agree. What Gutfeld said was callous, especially to these rioters who let's face it. They're all bow wows. I mean, have you looked at your typical journalist lately? I mean, what a collection of before pictures. They look like something else Fauci made in a lab. On a scale of one to 10, journalists would be a nine. In German that means no, as a no, I would never sleep with you. But the anger was worse among the British journalists. They're very sensitive and I don't blame them. You know, their hottest one and over there is Harry Styles. And their teeth are the best part of their faces. I know. I'm glad you agree with me. But it's not their fault. Ugly people have no protest movement. Well, the Teachers Union is just a coincidence. But the plane -- it's just terrible. But the plane don't protest because how would the chants go? Hey, hey, ho, ho, these skin tags have got to go. But I've always been there by their side. I want you to take a look at this book, the Bible of Unspeakable Truths written in 2007. It's like 15 years ago. It's now available in paperback. I don't know. In a landmark chapter titled The Ugly Have No Gandhi, I go into depth on how the most discriminated group of people are not black or Hispanic, gay or lesbian or trans. It's the homely. It's having a face like Joy Behar. I know. And I hope you're applauding her inspiration for everybody and a body like Joy Behar. See a split up there. Fact is, the homely get fewer job offers fewer dates, and no thanks to Thomas Edison, they have to deal with lights. There are loads of studies that bear that out. And if I didn't live a really cool life, I would have looked them up. So, you got to have to take my word for it. Someone this good looking doesn't have to lie. But I wasn't always that hot. I had to put work into it. I go to the gym, I watch what I eat, I groom all the problem areas. Takes four men to wax my body hair. Three to hold me down and one to videotape. Still dozen articles were written about Gutfeld's comments. Other articles were incomplete because the authors were crying too hard to complete them. Now besides these writers, no one is actually offended by these comments. They're just reporting on the possibility of offense. And all these pieces noted Gutfeld's age which is again 58 to suggest that that age, this kind of commentary would be creepy. But it backfired instead of everyone saying wow, that old guy is gross. It was holy crap. How could that amazing looking guy be 58? That's insane. They're like -- I know, just clap, clap. Even I saw him and I said whatever he's doing, sign me up. But I get it because they couldn't argue the point they blamed the hot messenger. That's got to make Gutfeld smile and what a beautiful smile it is. You could melt the icicles on Brian Stelter's (BLEEP) I don't even know if he has them. So if I ever Gutfeld, you know what I take a good look in the mirror and enjoy the view. And as for the media, that group of homely copycats will continue to bottom feed off their own dreck. I just hope for our sake they do it with a lights out.",

They were at home alone, doing homework at the kitchen table, and also on the gunshots erupted and then they were screaming. They thought that these people were actually coming into the house targeting them. They were -- they were swift. They were smart. They ran upstairs, they locked themselves in the bathroom, they called 911, one of the bullets were found about 30 feet from where they were sitting. The two people who were shot were laying down about 10 feet from where they were sitting. It was a pretty wild moment. We've been running this campaign where we've been talking about rising crime in New York. I wasn't expecting that the next press conference was going to be in front of crime scene tape in front of my own house. And fortunately, my daughters, they were champs.

Although you know who the cops have ID'd? Four members of the Green Goblin Gang who attacked two women on the subway last week. Turns out they're all cast members of The View. Thank you. I think I'm kidding. But they're actually chubby criminals, three of them are in their 20s, one in her 30s and all have -- all four of them have prior arrests. But much like the village people, we still don't have any explanation for the silly costumes.

It's basically a political ad with high school football scores. But that news is about as real as Jesse's hairpiece. Yes, I know. So obvious. So, who's behind the net various plot to undermine the integrity of journalism and thus the bedrock of our democracy? David Brock, hardcore, left wing, Founder of Media Matters, the so-called media watchdog group. So, what happens when a lefty media watchdog decides to create fake media?

Or as we call it in the media is pulling a Geraldo. Kat, I can't believe you wrote that joke. Do you care?",

Now you may or not be aware that there's a show on this network that airs at 5:00 p.m. and get this, it's called \"THE FIVE\" up pretty clever. How long did it take them to come up with that? It also got five people, I bet you didn't see that coming. But Thursday, something was said on that show that in the words of the media sparked outrage. You know, I love that phrase, mainly because their definition of sparking outrage is when one media outlet reports on tweets that another media outlet reported on earlier. They gossip like a group of high school girls sitting together in the calf. It's not reporting it's repurposing. You know, like Geraldo does with five dead caterpillars to make a mustache. Can't even tell, can you? Amazing. So what was the offending opinion on The Five? Well, let's find out."

I'd steer clear at college to."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Who the hell does he think he is? I mean, let's be honest. He's no spring chicken. It's not even a spring roll. And him judging the looks of other people, that seems a little bit ironic. I mean, on a scale of one to 10, maybe he's a 9.4. But looking at him that's maybe twice his body fat. I mean, I guess some people might find him attractive. I don't know. His piercing blue eyes. Those rock hard packs. Gorgeous salt and pepper hair. No wonder the jealous media pounced. My favorite headline, Fox News host, 58, under fire, under fire for bizarre complaints. The college kids aren't hot enough. That's The Independent. That's The Independent. A freaking British paper. But it is true. I'm old enough to be their professor. And they're old enough to be my girlfriend. But I agree. What Gutfeld said was callous, especially to these rioters who let's face it. They're all bow wows. I mean, have you looked at your typical journalist lately? I mean, what a collection of before pictures. They look like something else Fauci made in a lab. On a scale of one to 10, journalists would be a nine. In German that means no, as a no, I would never sleep with you. But the anger was worse among the British journalists. They're very sensitive and I don't blame them. You know, their hottest one and over there is Harry Styles. And their teeth are the best part of their faces. I know. I'm glad you agree with me. But it's not their fault. Ugly people have no protest movement. Well, the Teachers Union is just a coincidence. But the plane -- it's just terrible. But the plane don't protest because how would the chants go? Hey, hey, ho, ho, these skin tags have got to go. But I've always been there by their side. I want you to take a look at this book, the Bible of Unspeakable Truths written in 2007. It's like 15 years ago. It's now available in paperback. I don't know. In a landmark chapter titled The Ugly Have No Gandhi, I go into depth on how the most discriminated group of people are not black or Hispanic, gay or lesbian or trans. It's the homely. It's having a face like Joy Behar. I know. And I hope you're applauding her inspiration for everybody and a body like Joy Behar. See a split up there. Fact is, the homely get fewer job offers fewer dates, and no thanks to Thomas Edison, they have to deal with lights. There are loads of studies that bear that out. And if I didn't live a really cool life, I would have looked them up. So, you got to have to take my word for it. Someone this good looking doesn't have to lie. But I wasn't always that hot. I had to put work into it. I go to the gym, I watch what I eat, I groom all the problem areas. Takes four men to wax my body hair. Three to hold me down and one to videotape. Still dozen articles were written about Gutfeld's comments. Other articles were incomplete because the authors were crying too hard to complete them. Now besides these writers, no one is actually offended by these comments. They're just reporting on the possibility of offense. And all these pieces noted Gutfeld's age which is again 58 to suggest that that age, this kind of commentary would be creepy. But it backfired instead of everyone saying wow, that old guy is gross. It was holy crap. How could that amazing looking guy be 58? That's insane. They're like -- I know, just clap, clap. Even I saw him and I said whatever he's doing, sign me up. But I get it because they couldn't argue the point they blamed the hot messenger. That's got to make Gutfeld smile and what a beautiful smile it is. You could melt the icicles on Brian Stelter's (BLEEP) I don't even know if he has them. So if I ever Gutfeld, you know what I take a good look in the mirror and enjoy the view. And as for the media, that group of homely copycats will continue to bottom feed off their own dreck. I just hope for our sake they do it with a lights out."

They were at home alone, doing homework at the kitchen table, and also on the gunshots erupted and then they were screaming. They thought that these people were actually coming into the house targeting them. They were -- they were swift. They were smart. They ran upstairs, they locked themselves in the bathroom, they called 911, one of the bullets were found about 30 feet from where they were sitting. The two people who were shot were laying down about 10 feet from where they were sitting. It was a pretty wild moment. We've been running this campaign where we've been talking about rising crime in New York.

So if you haven't been following the New York Crime Wave or your name is Kathy Hochul. Here's where we're at. Last week a guy got hit and killed by a truck in midtown Manhattan. This is video of the aftermath. Now, before this, there was tape of a woman pick-pocketing him. While one onlooker filmed and laughed. Yes. In New York, the thief actually gets there before the ambulance. Cops are now trying to use dental records to identify the guy since his wallet was taken by the crook who also remains unidentified. Although you know who the cops have ID'd? Four members of the Green Goblin Gang who attacked two women on the subway last week. Turns out they're all cast members of The View. Thank you. I think I'm kidding. But they're actually chubby criminals, three of them are in their 20s, one in her 30s and all have -- all four of them have prior arrests. But much like the village people, we still don't have any explanation for the silly costumes. But criminals like that Green Goblin girl gang need the harshest punishment a New York governor can authorize. Make them spend the weekend with Andrew Cuomo. Meanwhile, former New York Governor David Paterson noted that subway assaults like these are making the city unsafe like never before."

So, who's behind the net various plot to undermine the integrity of journalism and thus the bedrock of our democracy? David Brock, hardcore, left wing, Founder of Media Matters, the so-called media watchdog group. So, what happens when a lefty media watchdog decides to create fake media?

Has ruled that polyamorous relationships deserve the same legal protections as two person relationships. The decision came out of where all beautiful love stories begin, housing court. Two guys were living together, but one of them was also married to another guy who lives somewhere else. And if you have trouble following any of that, then you must be a bigot. When the married guy died, the live-in boyfriend wanted to be able to pick up the lease. The building's owner said he couldn't, but the judge ruled that this was wrong. That just because the relationship had three people in it instead of two, that didn't mean it couldn't be recognized, which opens the door for the rest of us. And with rented insurance costs the way they are, it seems like a smart financial move, which means that the next open house marry everyone who shows up. Or as we call it in the media is pulling a Geraldo. Kat, I can't believe you wrote that joke. Do you care?"
