And it's not going to be very difficult for the president to come up with a message that's hopeful. That seems to be his foundational premise from the start. ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS: I mean, that's absolutely right. You heard the president say it today, and I think it was just a poignant line -- where Joe Biden sees American darkness, he sees American greatness, and that's just a little bit of a look ahead of the message that you always hear from President Trump but you will certainly hear from him coming up next week as he reaccepts that nomination to lead the Republican Party and America for four more years. The contrast is clear: Joe Biden took a dark and divisive tone, and it was really hard to tell where the media ends and Democrats begin with all of their tripping over themselves, applauding the bare minimum participation trophy effort that Joe Biden gave, reading a teleprompter speech. Congratulations, Joe, you managed to do it. But let's look at the facts here, he was dark and he was dismissive and he didn't talk about what's actually going on in this country, the greatness achieved under President Trump. He had to try to veil that. He couldn't even respect the office, he called him the occupant of the office. Hey, a friendly reminder, Joe, there's a big difference between you and President Donald J. Trump and it's not just the fact that the president is Donald J. Trump as a direct rebuke of the Obama-Biden administration, is that America has great leadership with President Trump, something Joe Biden has never done in his 47 years in the swamp.",

Loughlin told the court, quote: I made an awful decision. I went along with a plan to give my daughter my daughters an unfair advantage in the college admissions process and in doing so I ignored my intuition and allowed myself to be swayed from my moral compass. And Giannulli saying, quote: I do deeply regret the harm that my actions have caused my daughters, my wife, and others. I take full responsibility for my conduct, I'm ready to accept consequences and move forward with the lessons I've learned from this experience. According to U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, Giannulli was more active than his wife in the cheating scheme. Lelling saying Giannulli directed bribe payments and, quote, personally confronted his daughter's high school counselor to prevent the scheme from being discovered, brazenly lying about his daughter's athletic abilities. As a result, Giannulli was sentenced to 5 months in prison along with a $250,000 fine and Loughlin two months in prison and a $150,000 fine.

But, Matt, let me start with you. You know, when we talk about their lack of willingness to talk about policy details, isn't it possible that they've been promising both the left and their so-called pragmatic moderates the same thing?

If it got -- you know, if it got the sunshine that it deserves, people would be appalled. Chris Christie says they would scare the bejesus out of people, they're actually not really into bejesus at all. If you look at what policies would do for economic recovery, you can't raise taxes on everybody in this country and also say you're going to bring the economy back. You can't say you're going to take all of those Obama era regulations that Trump has taken off the economy to stop domestic energy production, to allow small businesses to prosper. If you put those all back on the economy, there's no way we're going to have a recovery because America won't become competitive again. If America isn't competitive, that helps China's -- China and our adverse -- economic adversaries overseas. And how about this, Tammy?

We know the difference Donald Trump has brought forward. We know what has happened now with China and the China virus. Do you really think the American people can be gas-lit in this way?

On the one hand, he's talking about how racist America is, how awful America is, how unfair America is, and then, on the other hand, he has to acknowledge which you pointed out, he's been part of the problem in Washington for 47 years. And if America is this horrible place, he's never done anything to fix any of it. In eight of those years, he was the number two guy in the White House. So, whatever it is that he's attacking Donald Trump for, he has to take some credit for that himself, which is why really all of this is political, it's all nonsense. You know, Barack Obama on the night that he spoke said that he -- when he blamed Donald Trump for 170,000 deaths in America because of the Wuhan plague, I thought to myself wow, Barack Obama doesn't want Joe Biden to win, because he would never say that if you wanted a politician to win. And then Joe Biden turns around and says it himself. It's such a nasty line of attack and it's so hopeless and so dishonest. I think the American people realize that.

It's certainly not the American way that's not how we ensure our future. That will be a gambit as you said, Charlie. It's an interesting way to put it, we'll see. Gentlemen, thank you for joining me. Matt Schlapp, Charlie Hurt, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Now, unlike Joe Biden, President Trump will actually visit another state during his convention.

Donald Trump was also in Wisconsin, the state where Joe Biden has his convention that he never showed up to, and President Trump continues to travel this country and bring messages of hope and talk about the greatness of America, throughout the country. So, in our convention, you're going to see this aspirational message, the president is going to put forward a plan for the next four years. He's going to talk about how his policies have directly affected real people. It's going to be the American story, not the Hollywood script and fiction that was put forward by the Democrats this past week."

I don't know what he thought maybe at the beginning of the campaign, but when he began to meet us, he realized the potential in who we were and that we were worth saving. And we recognize that as well, even though we've been told for a number of years prior through the Obama-Biden administration that we weren't really worth saving. And, you know, his travel to states, I think this speaks to that as well, recognizing the value and importance of the states as they exist versus an overarching federal response to things.

He ran for the farmer, for that blue collar worker on the line in Michigan. He ran for the everyday man who didn't have a voice in Washington. And he said, you deserve better, you deserve better from your politicians, I'm going to drain the swamp and I'm going to do things better. And he has with regulation and cutting taxes and policies that have unleashed our energy independence and made people's lives better across the country.

And in New York City this week, another debacle. A retired NYPD sergeant was horrifically, brutally beaten in the garment district. That's pretty much midtown.

And let's not forget that Biden previously said that he would be willing to, quote, redistribute funds away from police departments, saying that police had become the enemy, while Kamala praise the defunding of the LAPD. So, why is -- you saw her nodding as he was talking, why is Biden ignoring the crime wave and chaos in America's major cities? Well, joining me now with reaction, attorney and Fox News contributor Emily Compagno, civil rights attorney, a man with very little to say, Leo Terrell, and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors to President Obama, Austan Goolsbee. Everybody, welcome aboard, thanks for joining me tonight. I appreciate it. Now, let me start actually Austin with you. You know, I've heard Barack Obama make specific statements that what is happening now and even in violence that is occurring during his administration was not the way to go, that this was not acceptable, that things had to be done differently. And yet, not only in the convention, but in general, we haven't heard leading Democrats and the party except about the defunding the police when the messaging prior to that had been the opposite. Are they realizing now, it's a bigger problem that they looking at the polls, why suddenly the shift?"

I mean, you started by trying to portray that as a partisan thing, I would point out that eight of the ten highest violent crime rates are red states and if you take the reddest city in America, it's Oklahoma City, it has the same population as Portland, Oregon, and its murder rate is double that in Portland. Crime is a bad issue. I think Democrats were more focused on the lawlessness coming out of the White House than they were on general lawlessness or the crime rate."

Regardless, we've got at least President Trump taking action against that with Operation LeGend, being very aggressive in that regard but Democrats seem to be silent or passive.

And to respond Austan's point, it's actually aptly said, and the focus indeed is on the federal government, but to the point where it's missing the voter, we absolutely understand we are being ignored, all of the cities that are being rocked by violence. I don't understand why there's an inability to acknowledge that there can be zero tolerance for violence and also a commitment to amplification of black voices and also a commitment to synthesis and participation and a whole host of other things were so many things can be true at the same time, I think the average voter isn't a partisan hack and isn't totally obsessed with President Trump and therefore deserves a nuance, acceptable answer. I think hearing Joe Biden's comments made sense and it was interesting why he isn't saying it before. And for Kamala Harris referring to herself at the top cop, but then, of course, it's telling that the police union isn't enforcing them, or isn't endorsing them because as they say, they are sick of being considered a punching bag. So, I think they are losing millions of voters, frankly, with the inability to articulate that many things can be true at the same time as well as a commitment to law and order."

Are you going to be safe in your own city and can there be law enforcement and can they be empowered? Leo, you and I come from the same general area in Los Angeles and, you know, people are afraid everywhere now.

Let's be clear, the Democrats go to the convention, didn't say one thing about the chaos in those cities -- why? Because they are basically supporting Black Lives Matter. Austan, Black Lives Matter? Which black lives? Black, the black police officer or is there black on black crime in Chicago? And what about the Police Officer David Dorn? For Austan to come in and talk about Oklahoma City and not talk about the chaos -- the Democrats cannot talk about crime in these cities because they are run by Democratic mayors. The thing that is amazing about it, they play the race card throughout the entire convention, isn't it amazing, Austan? I hope you answer my question, is that Chicago is run by black people, black police chief and you call it racism. So, all the Democrats try to do is talk about racism in Democratic cities and ignore the crime in Democratic cities. One last point, President Trump offered help to these Democratic cities."

We've been seeing now weeks later that they are going after local law enforcement. So, gentlemen, thank you.

Now, Biden's adoring fans in the press will defend him at all costs even as he makes it clear he's not interested in taking any of their questions. So, ask yourself, why is that? Much of the media is refusing to critically cover Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, why is it that they ignore the violent crime and rioting, plaguing America's Democrats run cities and why is it that they downplay the historic achievements under President Trump? Like the recent UAE-Israeli peace deal, remarkable achievement. Why is it they continue to ignore Joe Biden's decades of failure inside the Washington swamp? It's because the mob in the media are nothing more than an arm of the Democratic Party, reciting the same talking points, repeating the same fake news narrative and living in the same echo chamber. But the good news is, you get the final say, because in 74 days, we will vote in the most important choice election of our lifetime and you have the opportunity to shock the world again.

And this was a convention of grievances, and airing of grievances, a Festivus, and therefore, a show about nothing.

And it's not going to be very difficult for the president to come up with a message that's hopeful. That seems to be his foundational premise from the start. ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS: I mean, that's absolutely right. You heard the president say it today, and I think it was just a poignant line -- where Joe Biden sees American darkness, he sees American greatness, and that's just a little bit of a look ahead of the message that you always hear from President Trump but you will certainly hear from him coming up next week as he reaccepts that nomination to lead the Republican Party and America for four more years."

Congratulations, Joe, you managed to do it. But let's look at the facts here, he was dark and he was dismissive and he didn't talk about what's actually going on in this country, the greatness achieved under President Trump. He had to try to veil that. He couldn't even respect the office, he called him the occupant of the office. Hey, a friendly reminder, Joe, there's a big difference between you and President Donald J.

When Dr. Fauci and others testified under oath that President Trump made the right decision, and in fact, that President Trump's decision saved American lives, not just blocking flights from China, blocking flights from Europe, those are all things that Joe Biden criticized, and it was scientists that actually said President Trump saves lives. So, Joe Biden has been all over the board on this, but what he's really been is wrong on this from the very beginning. He just wants to criticize the president when he talks about -- you know, he's now saying he's not for defunding the police, he was just on video a few weeks ago saying he wants to reallocate money away from the police.

They said that's like a problem, you don't need to -- stop it. So, you're going to get whiplash if you're making decisions every now and then based on what scientists are going to be saying -- the Europeans science, the American science. But Americans agree our instinct is -- we understand the situation, we tend to agree.

      "utterance": "That's exactly right, Tammy. President Trump has been strong proactive leader on this right from everything from the flight bans to reducing regulation, et cetera, and allowing public-private partnerships to develop cures and prophylaxis as well. But here's the thing, Joe Biden wants control. That's what the mask mandate is. And President Trump understands very clearly while he -- while he's the president, he doesn't have authority to issue a nationwide mask mandate. And so, he has respected state sovereignty on some of those issues like masks. And that's really part of the key to all of this that I don't think Joe Biden gets and I don't think the Democrats get. They just want the power. They just want the control and I think if they are going to start shutting down over flu every year as well, you're going to have a big problem going forward with centralized power."

In addition, we do have history with the Obama-Biden administration with the H1N1 flu, and their own health experts saying that had been really just luck that that didn't turn into worse than what it was because they had no idea what they were doing. So, we do have a history. That is good news. Thank you, gentlemen, for joining me and I appreciate it. Obviously, this conversation is going to continue. Now, up next, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli were sentenced today for their role in the college admission scandal. We'll have a live report. Next, plus, Hollywood elites prove just how out of touch and how unfunny they really are at this week's DNC. Stay right there."

Now, actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli have both been sentenced for their role in the college admission scandal. Jonathan Hunt is standing by at our Los Angeles bureau with more -- Jonathan."

      "speaker": "Loughlin told the court, quote",
      "utterance": "I made an awful decision. I went along with a plan to give my daughter my daughters an unfair advantage in the college admissions process and in doing so I ignored my intuition and allowed myself to be swayed from my moral compass."

      "speaker": "And Giannulli saying, quote",
      "utterance": "I do deeply regret the harm that my actions have caused my daughters, my wife, and others. I take full responsibility for my conduct, I'm ready to accept consequences and move forward with the lessons I've learned from this experience. According to U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, Giannulli was more active than his wife in the cheating scheme. Lelling saying Giannulli directed bribe payments and, quote, personally confronted his daughter's high school counselor to prevent the scheme from being discovered, brazenly lying about his daughter's athletic abilities. As a result, Giannulli was sentenced to 5 months in prison along with a $250,000 fine and Loughlin two months in prison and a $150,000 fine. Tammy, the total of those two fines is less than they paid it to cheat their daughters way into college and deprive students of those places, students whose parents didn't have a spare half a million dollars lying around -- Tammy."

Thank you for that update very much. Now, per usual, we saw a lot of Hollywood elites making an appearance at this week's DNC and unsurprisingly it was more awkward than ever. Watch this."

You know, you guys, Rachel, I'll start with you, I've always worried there because Hollywood is always so good and smart and clever and creative and they can, you know, charm you -- that went out some window somewhere. Rachel, what happened to them?"

      "utterance": "I don't know, I used to think there was nothing she couldn't do, now I know there is, she can't put on a performance at the DNC convention without making me cringe. You know, what I picked from this -- what I picked up from this, Tammy, is look, they are elitists. They had elite celebrities there. You know, hearing Eva Longoria and, by the way, Michelle Obama who is also celebrity these days lecturing us about income inequality was -- was laughable. All of them -- both of them could redistribute their wealth or live more modestly, but they choose not to. What I really gather from this is that there is a real difference in these parties and the greatest legacy Donald Trump has is that he wrestled the Republican Party away from country club Republicans like Mitt Romney and the Bushes and he handed it to the working class. The Republican Party is the party of the working class, of the truckers, of the machinists, of at home moms. That's -- that's the difference I think we're going to see between this week and next week."

You watched some of that, you probably loved a lot about that didn't like some of it, you had to be somewhat disappointed in how awkward the celebrities were and why wasn't Cher or Barbra Streisand there? I mean, it's almost like there's no enthusiasm even amongst the big celebrities. They didn't have to leave their house."

      "utterance": "Well, I just say, Tammy, that I thought the Democrats missed a real opportunity, with the celebrity culture, they forgot about the working man, blue-collar voters, the voters without college educations who are interested in jobs. I mean, these jokes fell flat, the celebrity culture doesn't work and I would advise my party move away from that and talk about real issues that people care about, not cheap jokes at the expense of the sitting vice president."
