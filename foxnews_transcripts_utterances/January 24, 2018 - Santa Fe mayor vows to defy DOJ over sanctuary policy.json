But on the other hand, it could fit right into the strategy that's been pushed for a long time behind the scenes by White House Lawyer, Ty Cobb. He has been saying for a long time, you see him on the right there, that Mueller is close to wrapping up this investigation, and that they have nothing to fear from sitting down and cooperating, contrary to all of these leaks we've seen recently suggesting the opposite. That Mueller's probe will drag on for months or even years, and his investigation is intensifying, because he's been conducting all of these high-level interviews with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others.

The idea that he's going to be under oath is something that I'm sure his lawyers are very worried about, not because the president would go in with any intention of lying or covering up, but because any number of this special counsel or independent counsel investigations have resulted in charges that have nothing to do with the matter for which the council was appointed to investigate, that these are crimes or problems or charges that occurred and growing out of things that happened during the course of the investigation.

Everything we've learned about Comey conduct during the Clinton investigation and going forward suggests that there was ample reason to act against this guy. So, you know, I -- we don't know, Martha. What Mueller has. But there's plenty of reason to think that this may not end up in charges.",

The events of 2016 revealed that Trump knew a lot more than most members of his class about how the American middle and working class felt. For that reason, if no other, he can expect more than a cold shoulder from the globalist this week. So, which Donald Trump do you think we're going to see at Davos?",

On the other hand, it is a world's economic forum, and it's predominately business people who are there. And whatever they may think of Trump's views on issues like immigration, they secretly love the economics here. And so, my sense is, whatever they may say in public, and I imagine there'll be a few frosty disavowals, in any private meetings, I think they're going to be high-fiving President Trump because he's given the world economy, certainly the U.S. economy, something of a tail wind at the moment.",

To your point on Iran, I don't think that's being discussed. Look, you have a rich country that wants nukes, that's Iran, and you have a very poor country that potentially has nukes. We can see how that's going to go.

But first tonight, a chilly meeting at the White House as Democrats mayors refused to show up for their meeting with the president. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is THE STORY. The Justice Department announced that sanctuary cities must now prove that they're not unlawfully restricting information sharing with federal authorities, and there was a fierce backlash to that as mayors from New York City to New Orleans snubbed the president's invite today and they were proud of it. Here's President Trump."

The bottom line here is that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice are very bluntly informing these 23 jurisdictions that protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities is against the law. And the DOJ is demanding these cities, counties, and states either willingly turn over information about their sanctuary policies or they will be legally compelled to turn it over. What the feds are specifically looking for is any guidance local leaders have given their police force when it comes to dealing with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE. But the DOJ demands have infuriated several Democratic mayors in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. Those mayors were supposed to meet with President Trump at the White House today to talk about infrastructure, but instead, they boycotted the meeting. Here's New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. Watch."

The president doesn't know the people that I know in our community that are hardworking people there are immigrants that have come to this country seeking a better life. They participate in our communities. They participate in our economies, in our schools. And there's a broken immigration system that is not allowing them to be able to have recognition --"

    {
      "speaker": "GONZALES",

What do they tell the police officers in Santa Fe in terms of whether or not they need to turn in people who have been requested to be turned over by ICE, or people who are brought into, you know -- brought into police stations across the city? And are -- what do you tell them about how they should deal with people who are potentially here illegally?"
    },

But anyone who is living in our country peacefully -- we don't ask for papers when we stop someone on the street. We don't ask someone to show their citizenship. That's not our requirement that we see to right there we make sure that we keep our communities safe."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

You know, at what point do you draw the line and say, you know what, we have to take care of the people who that are here illegally in our country? We have to deal with them first.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GONZALES",

What we do, is we make sure that we protect our communities by working along with federal law enforcement officials to make sure that any individual who wants to commit a violent crime -- I don't care if they grew up in Santa Fe or they came to our city -- we will do everything we can to stop them before they commit any type of violent crime. If we pick somebody up and through our database, we know they have committed a violent crime, we work quickly --"

    },
    {

A wall? I can tell you, New Mexico is not going to keep violent criminals from coming out of our estate and inflicting harm on our citizens.

Building an economy is our priority."

But let's be very clear here, what he's also saying is, if I stop you for a traffic ticket or if I stop you because of a noise ordinance, I'm not going to ask to see your papers. What Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump are saying is that everybody that gets stopped, everybody who commits any type of crime, whether violent or nonviolent, we should ask to see their papers, and that is the problem. And he's saying that his police officers won't do that and they shouldn't be allowed to do that because the Supreme Court clearly says ---"

If he had been acquitted in the feds, hadn't immediately filed charges, he would've been released from jail, and either San Francisco, Chicago, or L.A., would've rolled out the red carpet, and he would've been right back living comfortably in one of those cities. So, Jeff Sessions, as he has said he would all along, is getting tough by threatening, revoking, and removing federal funding to these cities. And more importantly for these mayors, under Code 8 of the -- U.S. Code 8, Section 1324, these mayors can be prosecuted for harboring illegal immigrants, keeping them away from law enforcement, and they face, if convicted, up to ten years in federal prison.

Surprising reporters and start talking -- starting to talk about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. And in addition to what you just reported there, the president said he's looking forward to doing an interview with Robert Mueller, said he's willing to do it under oath, and even put a timetable on it, saying he thinks it's probably going to happen in the next two to three weeks, in what would be a historic session that also carries a lot of political and legal risk for this president to sit down with the special counsel. But on the other hand, it could fit right into the strategy that's been pushed for a long time behind the scenes by White House Lawyer, Ty Cobb. He has been saying for a long time, you see him on the right there, that Mueller is close to wrapping up this investigation, and that they have nothing to fear from sitting down and cooperating, contrary to all of these leaks we've seen recently suggesting the opposite. That Mueller's probe will drag on for months or even years, and his investigation is intensifying, because he's been conducting all of these high-level interviews with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others. Instead, the president's comments could mean the probe is winding down, just as scrutiny of some of his critics is heating up. You see right there, the FBI Officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Republicans today, demanding answers about how five months of their text messages were not uploaded into the FBI system. And new tonight, a federal law enforcement official tells Fox, cell phones belonging to a few thousand FBI employees were affected by that technical glitch which led to the five months of texts not being stored. Officials stressed they're taking steps now to possibly recover those messages as two Republican senators stepped up their pressure on the FBI and the Justice Department. Chuck Grassley accusing the FBI of playing hide the ball on key information about Fusion GPS and the dossier, while Ron Johnson claims he has an informant who says there was a secret society of FBI officials trying to undermine the president."

Meanwhile, sources familiar with the letter tell me that the Justice Department, late today, sent a letter to Devin Nunes, the Republican chair of the House panel until the panel saying it will be dangerous to release that memo that has classified information.

      "utterance": "Ed, thank you very much. So, joining us now: Brit Hume, Fox News Senior Political Analyst. Brit, this is a president who is always full of surprises. You know, he could have just slipped off to Davos this evening, but he took that moment, and you could tell that he wanted to say this to those reporters that, you know, \"bring it on\" was the message. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not the first time that he has said there's no collusion or anything else wrong, including, of course, obstruction of justice. And the fact that he has said this over and over again, can lead you and two directions: one is that this is the guy who's protesting too much because the Mueller team is going to find something, and he's denying it ahead of time. And the other we're looking at is, he's awfully confident about this and awfully certain and awfully strong and has been from the start. And the fact that he is now apparently on the verge of going to talk to Mr. Mueller or have Mr. Mueller come and talk to him, and he seems eager to do it, suggests that he feels, at least, that he has nothing to hide. The idea that he's going to be under oath is something that I'm sure his lawyers are very worried about, not because the president would go in with any intention of lying or covering up, but because any number of this special counsel or independent counsel investigations have resulted in charges that have nothing to do with the matter for which the council was appointed to investigate, that these are crimes or problems or charges that occurred and growing out of things that happened during the course of the investigation. So, here you have the president with a lot at stake going into a situation under oath, where, you know, he slips up, misstates, and, of course, this president is not phenomenally articulate. He could get himself in trouble. So, it'll be interesting to see if, indeed, he does do this conversation with Director Mueller -- I mean, with Special Counsel Mueller, under oath."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, it's interesting, I remember him saying once, not long ago, well, if I could get the same deal that Hillary Clinton got -- you know, a holiday discussion not under oath, not with the lead investigator, because James Comey was not in the room when Hillary Clinton was spoken to, and, you know, others who were in the room get immunity, even though they're part of the investigation. You know, he thought that would be a pretty good situation that would give him equal treatment. If he does go in there under oath, as you say, he opens himself up to an inconsistency that perhaps has been laid down by some of the prior people who were interviewed. But it does look like the focus, just based on who they've been talking to, Brit appears to be obstruction of justice, and go back to the firing of James Comey and Michael Flynn. So, you know, if that is the case, and a lot of lawyers that we have spoken to in this program, I know you have too, say that, you know, obstruction -- that he has every right to fire James Comey, that obstruction of justice is a pretty tough bar to meet here. So, perhaps, the president feels, you know, that legally, he's on the decent ground here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, he certainly has a right to fire the FBI director at any time for any reason. However, if he acted, if it can be shown that he acted with corrupt motives, that would be the kind of thing that he would refer to the House of Representatives for potential impeachment. I doubt that Bob Mueller is interested in trying to put some kind of indictment against the president that would be without precedent and extraordinary. So, the question arises is whether the president, you know, in firing Mueller, did so for a good reason. And everything we've learned about -- I said Mueller, I mean Comey. Everything we've learned about Comey conduct during the Clinton investigation and going forward suggests that there was ample reason to act against this guy. So, you know, I -- we don't know, Martha. What Mueller has. But there's plenty of reason to think that this may not end up in charges."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, and we should also mention that there is another -- there's another part of this audio where the president says something to the effect of, you know, subject to agreement by my attorneys. I mean, that's a pretty big hole that you could drive a truck through. I mean, he could walk this entire thing back and say, you know, it was my desire to speak to Robert Mueller, and I have nothing to hide. My attorneys feel like it isn't something that I should do. Do you think that -- go ahead."

      "speaker": "HUME",

Not with the history of what happens with these independent counsels and special counsels. I just think it's ill-advised and probably not necessary. I think the president likes to talk about it because, I think, he thinks he's innocent and he's not afraid of, you know, telling his story under oath. But I still think it's, you know, from a lawyer's point of view, representing him trying to protect his interests, I'm not sure a good lawyer will want him to do that. That doesn't mean the president won't override that."

So, I don't make much at all of the off-site meetings with small groups, different networks, those exist in every organization, they exist in the FBI. The secret society part is a little bit different. I've not been part of an FBI secret society, even though, perhaps, some homework for me or knew of me thought I was part of a secret society because senior leadership gets to promote junior leadership, or decide that somebody's not going to be promoted, and I think they can be perceived as a secret society. Sometimes their deliberations are in secret and they make hard decisions about the organization -- who moves up and who doesn't. I can see perception issues, but I would like to see the facts."

I have my own. And I will tell you, I share their pain and the struggle, the notion of the corruption of what Hillary Clinton did with that server and the idea of her walking away essentially unscathed. The FBI was not in a position to pull her revoke her clearance, they made a decision not prosecutor her based in my estimation on a good-faith analysis of the facts and the president of what the statute said. I differ in material ways with the outcome. To me, it was completely offensive, what she did, and a complete failure of the department of state, top to bottom. However, I have to depend on people who I know who are in the decision loop making good faith decisions with prosecutors to come to a certain outcome may be based largely on precedent. I don't like it, I don't agree with it, but it is what it is, and I believe that good people acted in good faith."

      "utterance": "So, I want to start with a quote from the piece that you wrote today. Let's put that up in the screen. It says Trump exemplifies the ugly American. Davos will accept him anyway. And it goes on to say, one of my favorite lines about Davos comes from JP Morgan boss, Jamie Dimon, who says Davos is where billionaires tell millionaires how the middle class feels. The events of 2016 revealed that Trump knew a lot more than most members of his class about how the American middle and working class felt. For that reason, if no other, he can expect more than a cold shoulder from the globalist this week. So, which Donald Trump do you think we're going to see at Davos?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERGUSON",
      "utterance": "Well, we'll see Donald Trump as he always is, unfiltered and probably making no concessions at all to the globalists. I think a lot of people expect him to be given a very cold shoulder. After all, a lot of his views on immigration or free-trade run counter to the conventional wisdom of the kind of people you meet at Davos, especially the Europeans, who certainly don't like him. On the other hand, it is a world's economic forum, and it's predominately business people who are there. And whatever they may think of Trump's views on issues like immigration, they secretly love the economics here. And so, my sense is, whatever they may say in public, and I imagine there'll be a few frosty disavowals, in any private meetings, I think they're going to be high-fiving President Trump because he's given the world economy, certainly the U.S. economy, something of a tail wind at the moment."

      "utterance": "Angela Merkel has said that unilateralism and protectionism is not the way forward. She said that in her initial comment, which is a pretty clear reference and criticism, I would think, of President Trump. However, she has encountered a lot of problems, to say the least, in Germany, based on her own open-door policy, and it hasn't worked out for her politically very well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERGUSON",
      "utterance": "That's right. I think the tendency of the kind of global elite to see Angela Merkel as a hero and Donald Trump as a villain starts to look a little bit more problematic when you just look at the way German politics is going at the moment. I mean, there was a tremendous backlash against Merkel's open-door policy in 2015 and 16 when more than a million migrants came into Germany. At the most recent German election she's only clinging onto power just barely. It's not even clear yet that she can form a coalition in Germany. So, my sense is that the narrative of last year, which was that Angela Merkel is a hero -- oh, and let's not forget, Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader who was the toast of Davos a year ago. I think that narrative looks a little less compelling now, suddenly from the vantage point of many ordinary European voters, it's Trump who's been right on immigration issues, not Merkel."

The one thing those people did not expect was that their tools, their software, their apps, would end up being used by a populist campaign, Donald Trump's campaign, to propel him to victory over Hillary Clinton. And the heads were exploding all over Silicon Valley on November 9, 2016, when it was clear what had happened. But it took a long time for everybody to start admitting how crucial Facebook, as well as twitter, had been to the Trump campaign. And also, took a long time for Facebook to concede how far they had allowed their tools to be used by the Russians and Russian bots to spread what was unquestionably polarizing messages to American voters. At first, Mark Zuckerberg was dismissive, oh, it's absurd to think that fake news had any part played in the election.

McMaster, the national security apparatus, to brief the president with all the options, and it has to be options in between doing nothing and all-out war. In this case, a preemptive strike, of course they're going to brief him on the downside and the risks there of a massive North Korean retaliation. But on the other hand, I want Kim Jong-un to know that's on the table and know that's something that the president is considering. But there's also real risk to doing nothing here. The North Korean program is only going to progress in sophistication, mobile launchers, submarines, decoys. It's going to make it much harder to destroy down the road if we just let this progress. To your point on Iran, I don't think that's being discussed. Look, you have a rich country that wants nukes, that's Iran, and you have a very poor country that potentially has nukes. We can see how that's going to go. The proliferation of missile technology, of nuclear technology, heck, of submarine technology, has been ongoing between Iran and North Korea for years, and if we let this program developed, it is going to proliferate, and then we're going to even have a more massive problem on our hands."
