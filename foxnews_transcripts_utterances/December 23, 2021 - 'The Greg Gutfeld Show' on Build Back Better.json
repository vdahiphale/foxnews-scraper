Or maybe someone accidentally clicked on Toobin's feed. That would cause me to gas. Turns out they were devastated. They didn't get the trillion-dollar spending bill, they neither bothered to debate or much less read. Yes, they were mad that their side lost and that was it. It was once again politics as sports and they bet 20 grand on the heavily favorite team and they lost. I'd like to cry babies they are, they lost in wanting to take their ball and go home. Although in Stelter's case it was probably a meatball. Does he likes to eat? Just in case you didn't get it. Hardy eater, Susan. And poor Jennifer Rubin one of the truly broken casualties steamrolled by Trump. She wrote that democracy is now hanging by a thread which is exactly how your family will find you in the basement if you ever read her on a regular basis. That crackpots been wrong more times than Boris Johnson's barber. She makes no sense. Manchin operated just as our political system should. It's a republic. He stood up to both the hard left progressives and the media's hysterical pressure and told them to shove it up their collective puckered asses. So it's the biological description. He put his constituents first. You know, those rubes that the media despise, loathsome gas bag. Bette Midler described West Virginia as \"Poor, illiterate and strung out.\" All things you'd have to be to sit through one of her movies. I'd rather be water boarded with Mountain Dew than watch beaches. Yes. I don't care what you're going to do to me. Later, she was forced to apologize for saying what she believed and what the media entertainment and academia believe too. That they're smarter than all of you. But of course they aren't. They're stupid. I mean, who mourns for the death of a bill that they didn't even read? And the bill sucked from the start. It's based on a strategy meant to make it impossible to analyze. Fact is everything the government produces is gigantic on purpose. Including their mistakes. You know, it's like an insurance company that puts you on hold. The goal is to wear you down so you give up. Remember this great line?",

      "sentences": "Yes. But there is a bigger picture here. When Biden ran for office, he had to clear a very low bar. A return to normalcy is what he called it. He pushed that bit of business and then he returned to the basement curled up in a doggy basket next to an old Bowflex machine. Everybody has one. Normalcy meant his resting heart rate of zero. But yes, after four years of wearing the leather jacket of Donald Trump, it was time for America to put on that fuzzy warm cardigan that was Old Joe. Except it turned out that cardigan was made of a type of wool that everybody's allergic to. And even MOFs couldn't stomach the taste. With soaring inflation and escalating crime wave still denied by the Democrats and a pandemic panic worsened by a befuddled president. A new poll finds that 70 percent of voters call this a bad year, with other half saying it was awful for them personally. And that doesn't even include the Cuomo brothers, or Alec Baldwin. Of course, that poll is from Fox News. So you know, this is -- it's gauging how the voters feel, and not the politicians or the media. And it shows yet another record low for Biden. So how's that for normalcy? Others in the media don't look at it this way. They don't ask you about it. When they see that you're suffering they frame it as, how does it affect the party we support? That's why they ignored the crime wave because it was bad news for them. Even though it was bad news for everyone, including you. Politico worries that Dems will lose at least one if not both houses of Congress in the midterms. While average Americans worry they'll lose their real houses as the economy tanks. It says everything that the media mourns is a bill that would have taken inflation to new heights because it meant their party lost. Everything is how it will affect their party, their bottom line. Meanwhile, America didn't expect much, or even asked for much. Just a little bit of order, a little comfort, a smidgen of optimism. Instead, we got everything royally eff up. We were promised a comfy bathrobe and we got a onesie made of steel wool. Sounds kind of good at this point. Period.",

Elon Musk revealed to be paying over $11 billion in taxes this year. If he's smart, he'll spread it out over a few months then it won't seem like that much. Pay quarterly, that's what I do. Musk tweeted this weekend, \"For those wondering, I will pay over 11 billion in taxes this year. In return, he got bad roads and a senile president.

The tweet was clearly directed at Senator Elizabeth Warren who last week claimed Elon wasn't paying his fair share. But like most claims from Elizabeth Warren, they're not even 1/64 true. Turns out, Elon pays more in taxes than the entire GDP of several countries. And not just some of the (BLEEP) one, Susan. He pays half of a NASA's budget while having infinitely more spaceships.

Or maybe someone accidentally clicked on Toobin's feed. That would cause me to gas. Turns out they were devastated. They didn't get the trillion-dollar spending bill, they neither bothered to debate or much less read. Yes, they were mad that their side lost and that was it. It was once again politics as sports and they bet 20 grand on the heavily favorite team and they lost. I'd like to cry babies they are, they lost in wanting to take their ball and go home. Although in Stelter's case it was probably a meatball. Does he likes to eat? Just in case you didn't get it. Hardy eater, Susan. And poor Jennifer Rubin one of the truly broken casualties steamrolled by Trump. She wrote that democracy is now hanging by a thread which is exactly how your family will find you in the basement if you ever read her on a regular basis. That crackpots been wrong more times than Boris Johnson's barber. She makes no sense. Manchin operated just as our political system should. It's a republic. He stood up to both the hard left progressives and the media's hysterical pressure and told them to shove it up their collective puckered asses. So it's the biological description. He put his constituents first. You know, those rubes that the media despise, loathsome gas bag. Bette Midler described West Virginia as \"Poor, illiterate and strung out.\" All things you'd have to be to sit through one of her movies. I'd rather be water boarded with Mountain Dew than watch beaches. Yes. I don't care what you're going to do to me. Later, she was forced to apologize for saying what she believed and what the media entertainment and academia believe too. That they're smarter than all of you. But of course they aren't. They're stupid. I mean, who mourns for the death of a bill that they didn't even read? And the bill sucked from the start. It's based on a strategy meant to make it impossible to analyze. Fact is everything the government produces is gigantic on purpose. Including their mistakes. You know, it's like an insurance company that puts you on hold.

He pushed that bit of business and then he returned to the basement curled up in a doggy basket next to an old Bowflex machine. Everybody has one. Normalcy meant his resting heart rate of zero. But yes, after four years of wearing the leather jacket of Donald Trump, it was time for America to put on that fuzzy warm cardigan that was Old Joe. Except it turned out that cardigan was made of a type of wool that everybody's allergic to. And even MOFs couldn't stomach the taste. With soaring inflation and escalating crime wave still denied by the Democrats and a pandemic panic worsened by a befuddled president. A new poll finds that 70 percent of voters call this a bad year, with other half saying it was awful for them personally. And that doesn't even include the Cuomo brothers, or Alec Baldwin. Of course, that poll is from Fox News. So you know, this is -- it's gauging how the voters feel, and not the politicians or the media. And it shows yet another record low for Biden. So how's that for normalcy? Others in the media don't look at it this way. They don't ask you about it. When they see that you're suffering they frame it as, how does it affect the party we support? That's why they ignored the crime wave because it was bad news for them. Even though it was bad news for everyone, including you. Politico worries that Dems will lose at least one if not both houses of Congress in the midterms. While average Americans worry they'll lose their real houses as the economy tanks. It says everything that the media mourns is a bill that would have taken inflation to new heights because it meant their party lost. Everything is how it will affect their party, their bottom line. Meanwhile, America didn't expect much, or even asked for much. Just a little bit of order, a little comfort, a smidgen of optimism. Instead, we got everything royally eff up. We were promised a comfy bathrobe and we got a onesie made of steel wool. Sounds kind of good at this point. Period."

Elon Musk revealed to be paying over $11 billion in taxes this year. If he's smart, he'll spread it out over a few months then it won't seem like that much. Pay quarterly, that's what I do. Musk tweeted this weekend, \"For those wondering, I will pay over 11 billion in taxes this year. In return, he got bad roads and a senile president.

The tweet was clearly directed at Senator Elizabeth Warren who last week claimed Elon wasn't paying his fair share. But like most claims from Elizabeth Warren, they're not even 1/64 true. Turns out, Elon pays more in taxes than the entire GDP of several countries. And not just some of the (BLEEP) one, Susan. He pays half of a NASA's budget while having infinitely more spaceships. So, yes, it's a lot of money, but it's still slightly less than what Brian Stelter spends on pie. Guy, sick of the fair share phrase, it's, it's inherently meaningless.
