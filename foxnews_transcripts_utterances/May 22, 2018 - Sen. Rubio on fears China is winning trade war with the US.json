So, he predicted in this session you mentioned with the South Korean president that the specific date does not really matter and agreement is still possible. President Moon Jae-in declaring he has every confidence that Mr. Trump will make history by negotiating a strong deal to get North Korea to denuclearize. But the president acknowledged he's not happy about the recent behavior from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who has suddenly said, he's having second thoughts about giving up his nuclear weapons. But keep in mind, Kim has already turned over those three American hostages and is hours away from dismantling a nuclear test site. So this may just be bluster. President Trump may still prevail with his approach, but it is very much up in the air tonight. Likewise, there was tons of skepticism when the president -- you remember in March of last year, alleged that President Barrack Obama's administration had conducted surveillance on the Trump campaign.

They shouldn't be mixed. We have a huge trade problem with China. It's structural, it's not just how much they buy from us, it's what they do to our companies. They force our companies to turn over intellectual properties, secrets, you know you can't do business in China unless you do that. If you can do it at all, I mean, while their companies can do whatever they want here, OK? That's what's got to be fixed because that's long term and it's problematic. ZTE is a cell phone and technology company. They got caught violating the Iran deal and they got caught violating the Iran sanctions in North Korea, OK? They got hit with a billion dollar fine and they were told they had to fire the employees who did that. You know what they did, they didn't do it. They lied. They didn't fire those employees. They gave them a bonus, they tried to cover that up as well like they tried to cover up the violation. So now, we hit them and said fine, you can't buy our semiconductors anymore and that put them out of business. That's a good move. That's what we need to be doing when people are violating these things. But now it appears that some are saying well, let's find them again and let's make them change the Board of Directors. That's the same deal they've broken already once. Meanwhile, all these phone companies, they have to report to the Chinese government, OK?

He has made a lot of news today, so we're going to go there. He's going to make the keynote speech tonight at the Campaign for Life Gala, and we will take you there as soon as he gets on stage. But first, it's primary that again. It's the final primary day, actually, of May. Stakes are very high as they wrap up voting in four States. Very crucial to the House races and to the governor's races. Is that Georgia, Kentucky, Texas, and Arkansas, all having elections this evening? President Trump tweeted his support for the incumbent Republican Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who is up against Jan Morgan. And will history be made potentially in Georgia this evening? Where Democrat Stacey Abrams, could be on our way to becoming the first black female governor in the United States of America. That we will give you that call as soon as we get it. Also, this evening, a crucial moment for the highly anticipated North Korea summit. President Trump, today welcoming South Korean President Moon Jae-in to the White House. Uncertainty hangs over this previously announced June 12 Singapore summit. The president today offered some assurances, and also made it clear that he is OK with putting this off if that's what has to happen."

I mean, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, this afternoon trying to put the best phase on this by saying, the administration is still working toward that June 12th summit as if it's not a done deal after President Trump, bluntly admitted that it may not come together next month. But the president was clear in saying that he's still confident that there will be talks either on June 12th or some later date. Remember, this is a president will literally wrote the art of the deal and it's constantly counted up by critics only later to sometimes secure victory against the odds. So, he predicted in this session you mentioned with the South Korean president that the specific date does not really matter and agreement is still possible. President Moon Jae-in declaring he has every confidence that Mr. Trump will make history by negotiating a strong deal to get North Korea to denuclearize. But the president acknowledged he's not happy about the recent behavior from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who has suddenly said, he's having second thoughts about giving up his nuclear weapons. But keep in mind, Kim has already turned over those three American hostages and is hours away from dismantling a nuclear test site. So this may just be bluster. President Trump may still prevail with his approach, but it is very much up in the air tonight. Likewise, there was tons of skepticism when the president -- you remember in March of last year, alleged that President Barrack Obama's administration had conducted surveillance on the Trump campaign. But now with some evidence starting to emerge that could vindicate the president, he teed off today. Watch."

Now, Fox has also learned that on Thursday, House Intel Chairman Devin Nunez, as well as, officials from the FBI and the Justice Department are going to meet to review some of that sensitive intelligence he's been demanding.

And if this meeting happens, then, it happens. Nobody preceding this president has gotten talks to this level of sophistication. This is a man who's the best deal-maker, but if this meeting takes place, great if it doesn't, they will continue to have economic sanctions to put a stranglehold on North Korea."

I would say that this president's maximum pressure campaign, which is clearly working, it is clearly bringing that man, Kim Jong Un, to the table to talk, whether it's on that day or another day, we won't know. But clearly, the president's relationship with President Xi of China has made this happen. And it helps to make this happen. And great relationships like this president has with world leaders is what is moving the ball forward down the road."

We have a $500 billion trade deficit with China. And what this president has said is he has a good relationship with President Xi, but when it comes to the issue of trade, and having a fair trade is going to be fair on both sides, and a $500 billion deficit is not fair to the people of America."

And we heard today, he said very clearly that he offered security, safety, to Kim Jong Un, because he doesn't want to end up like Muammar Gaddafi, years after he gave up his nuclear weapons. You know, if the president -- if this summit doesn't happen, are we back -- we're back to aggressive military posture and options?"

And I believe this president is 100 percent committed to making a good deal for the United States of America and the world when it comes to the dictator in North Korea. So, I'm very pleased at where we are. And I think the outcome, which is a long way off, and we have to go back to the garbage of the Reagan days of looking at that it took multiple meetings over many years, many summits to get to a deal. I don't mind if we come out of a deal -- come out of a meeting where they build a relationship for the future."

The point is you've got the United States at the highest levels of the government having conversations with the leader of North Korea that has never happened. The 30 years of failed Washington, D.C. policy prior to this, never occurred. So this president doing something no one has ever done before him."

And now, the timeline seems to be pushed back further, back to March 21. So now, we're talking early spring. And what it links up with is the formation, David, of the foreign policy team. And we all remember, asking questions of your campaign, who's on the foreign policy team? Who are the big foreign policy advisors for this campaign? I asked the president him -- that myself in New Hampshire, who is going to be your advisers. And it was a long time whether it wasn't an answer that question. And all of the sudden, March 21, you've got five people on the list that include Carter Page, that include George Papadopoulos. Was that team put together under any pressure? And you know, were those people manage to drive any idea that they might trigger, David, potentially, any sort of questions about connections to Russia?"

Carter Page was recommended to the campaign by a well-known New York individual who has been involved in national party politics for 40 years. So you know it was at the recommendation of a trusted source. Now, do we have the time with five people on the campaign to go back and do a deep vetting, a background check? Of course not, right? But did they did those two individuals have any role in the campaign that was decision making? Absolutely not."

And I have a lot of questions about whether it was chicken or egg that started this. And I think that's what we all really have to look very closely at. But what about Paul Manafort, did anyone say to you, you know, related to the government or otherwise like you know, you might want to take a closer look at that. I think there's some potentially questionable relationships with financial arrangements with the Ukraine, all that kind of thing."
    },

Look, I was never contacted as when I ran the campaign by the FBI or any other government agency as it related to potential people who were hiring or we're going to potentially be involved in the campaign, never. And you know, if there was a spy placed on the Trump campaign there had better become accountability somebody had to be -- had better be walked out in handcuffs because it is the most egregious, most disgusting thing that our country as a democracy has ever seen. And if that's been done by a government official with their knowledge or their tacit knowledge, then that person better be walked out in handcuffs as well."

Did anyone ever approach either one of you and say, you know what, we've got some Hillary Clinton emails whether it was from the 30,000 batch or whether it was from the stuff that came out at the DNC and say, hey, wouldn't you like to take a look at this?"

We were forced -- we were going every which direction to try to force those into the public eye and no one ever came to me, ever came to me at any point, before I joined the campaign, while I was on the campaign to ever say that. So I just find it remarkable that today all of a sudden we're seeing this. This is -- it's an outrage. This President should be you know, I believe he is very upset about this and I am very upset about it. To know that all of us that worked on this campaign and worked hard for our candidate to have to think that the United States government was spying on us is outrageous."

Nobody ever came to me, nobody ever said to me, hey, do you want to see crooked H's emails because she acid- washed them, you know, 33,000 emails disappeared all of a sudden and there's still been no investigation of it. Look the bottom line is Donald Trump won this election through his sheer hard work. He outworked Hillary Clinton, he outworked the 16 Republican opponents in the primary and he's the president of the United States and it wasn't a close election everybody knew what Hillary Clinton was and nobody want to vote for. Nobody came to me and asked me to see her emails, they just knew she was a terribly flawed candidate, she forgot where Wisconsin was, she forgot what Pennsylvania was and they ran a terrible campaign and no one wants to admit."

There was a moment when the -- apparently James Comey and National Security Council members at the White House were talking about all this They were worried about these individuals that I just mentioned. And they considered having a defensive briefing saying you know, why don't we bring in -- somebody suggested, why don't we bring in the Trump campaign and tell them what we're concerned about so at least they know about this potential or these concerns about these people.

      "utterance": "Yes, well, I think we have a norm right. There's -- people asked all the time, could they put -- was it legal to put in an informant in there or a spy. When I was a prosecutor, the -- we called them informants and the defense lawyers said they were spies. It's a -- that's the how it goes. But what -- we actually have a political or a constitutional norm where we don't -- in law enforcement or intelligence bother the electoral process unless there's a really good reason. So I think when you get down to the end of it, there's no law that says you can't send an informant virtually anywhere. So what we're going to get down to in the end is did they have a good reason to be worried? And if they did have a good reason to be worried was this -- was it an appropriate response to say I'm now going to look at the Trump Campaign as if they're in a conspiracy with Russia or would it have been more appropriate to say they may have a few rotten apples in there let's see if we can either interview the rotten apples and see how rotten they really are or maybe we should tip off somebody in the campaign and ask them you know, to be careful."

One of the things that should be pretty easy to know is what date did the National Security Council principal's meeting happen.

And then the next thing we heard was Papadopoulos. Well they didn't know about Papadopoulos until July, August, right? This meeting where they talk about Carter Page in the National Security Council happens according to them in late spring. Now, what's happened before that that they'd be talking about Carter Page of all people in a National Security Council meeting? Carter Page joined the Trump Campaign on March 21st. Manafort joined it on March 29th. It doesn't look like there was anything there in the interim other than they have concerns about these people who have brought you back --"

Here's what we know about Carter Page. He was you know, they attempted to recruit him at some point then he ended up you know, coming on to their side. Russia tried to recruit him and then he came on to the to the intelligence side in the U.S. Why did they not do that? If they were so worried about the infiltration of Russia affecting our election, why didn't they do that?"

So I'm going to assume that they must be in an espionage conspiracy with Putin to steal the election. I mean, it doesn't work that way. And I think in a normal prosecutor's office or a normal investigators office or a normal place where they do intelligence analysis, you would not go from you know, a few disturbing facts to DEFCON 1. I mean, it just doesn't happen that way. So what you have to wonder is did they -- were they truly concerned -- sounds like they had grounds to be concerned -- and did they at the same time perceive this is something that could be really politically useful --"

We'll see what he has to say this evening. In the meantime, the President appears to be backing away from proposed restrictions on China's ZTE telecom company therefore giving the company a bit of a lifeline amid a potential trade war. It could be though part of a larger strategy. But remember, trade imbalance was a major motivator that drove Mr. Trump into politics in the first place.

      "utterance": "Well, I just heard the President speaking. If that's the direction we're going, that's good news. I'm going off the news reports and say that some in his administration are pushing for a quick deal on ZTE. Here's what concerns me. First of all, trade and ZTE are two separate issues. They shouldn't be mixed. We have a huge trade problem with China. It's structural, it's not just how much they buy from us, it's what they do to our companies. They force our companies to turn over intellectual properties, secrets, you know you can't do business in China unless you do that. If you can do it at all, I mean, while their companies can do whatever they want here, OK? That's what's got to be fixed because that's long term and it's problematic. ZTE is a cell phone and technology company. They got caught violating the Iran deal and they got caught violating the Iran sanctions in North Korea, OK? They got hit with a billion dollar fine and they were told they had to fire the employees who did that. You know what they did, they didn't do it. They lied. They didn't fire those employees. They gave them a bonus, they tried to cover that up as well like they tried to cover up the violation. So now, we hit them and said fine, you can't buy our semiconductors anymore and that put them out of business. That's a good move. That's what we need to be doing when people are violating these things. But now it appears that some are saying well, let's find them again and let's make them change the Board of Directors. That's the same deal they've broken already once. Meanwhile, all these phone companies, they have to report to the Chinese government, OK? You use those phones, they can steal our secrets, they can spy on us, they even have subcontractors in ZTE that work for -- people right now could be using ZTE and Huawei technology and not even know it because it says AT&T or something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. So in your mind, is there no negotiation that could allow us to allow ZTE to survive? Because basically, they told the Trump administration, we're going to go bankrupt. You know, this company is going to go out of business and so we need to figure this out. Is there any way that you would be comfortable with dealing with ZTE again ever?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, what about the American companies the Chinese have bankrupted, like the American companies that partnered with the Chinese company? The Chinese steal everything you do and once they figure out how to do it they say we don't need you anymore, we're going to do it here, we're going to do it cheaper because our government subsidizes us and you're out of business. Number two, we didn't put them out of business, we're just saying we're not going to sell them any more semiconductors, American semiconductors. And that's what's put them out of business apparently, but that's not our problem, that's their problem. I'm not going to be feeling bad for it. I don't work for the Chinese government."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I understand it. But you know, you're looking at it -- the way that you look at it which I completely understand and it's the way that we've done this for a long time. And the president is linking a lot of things that many people are not comfortable with having linked. But this is definitely the way that the Trump foreign policy doctrine if you will, is emerging. He's saying, look, I want them to help us with North Korea. I want to lower the trade deficit with the Chinese and I want to figure out a way to do it. So they said -- they said to the administration in some form or another, look give us some slack here on ZTE and then we're going to buy a lot more American goods and we're going to help you with the North Korea situation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Yes, so you said something actually I disagree with. This is not the way we've always done it. The way we actually have always done it is the way they're going now and that is the Chinese go to a bunch of American companies, the semiconductor company or some others and they go to them and say, can you go to the White House and Congress and lobby them to change their mind. And that's what they do and then we back off. And every president before now has backed off on China and that's why they've gained this advantage on us. Number two, here's the problem with the deal, North Korea is in China's interests. It's in China's interest. Because if North Korea and Kim Jong Un goes down, you have a bunch of North Koreans coming across the border. So they're not doing us any favor helping us on North Korea. They're closer to that crazy guy than we are. So they should be worried about it. Number three, what kind of deal is it where they say, OK, we're going to buy more agriculture from America, and in return we're going to do that anyway by the way, so they're not giving anything, in return we're going to keep stealing your stuff. In about five or eight years, they're going to dominate biotech, aerospace, they are going to be able to listen in to all of our military secrets, and use those. I mean, they are building airplanes -- our airplanes that took us 20 years to innovate, these guys are coming up with these things in two years. You think they're either that brilliant, which they're not, or they're stealing it from us. And using they're using ZTE in place to do it."

And sometimes you have wars because of this imbalance. Right now, it's a total imbalance. Chinese companies come to America and can do whatever they want, whatever they want. American companies some of them are not even allowed in China, and if they let you into China they let you partner with one of their companies until they steal your secrets. That has to be balanced. Until that's balanced we're going to have this problem. So China is taking advantage of the fact that for 20 years, American presidents, before this one, made the decision that, don't worry about it, we'll let them keep cheating because once they're rich, they're going to act more like us. Well, it didn't work out that way and now we finally realized that and it's almost too late. So, I don't want China to be an enemy. We are actually turning them into an enemy in some ways by allowing this imbalance to exist. They are taking advantage of that imbalanced like any country in the world would, and until we get this thing balanced out against structurally, the threat of a conflict is actually going to grow, not diminish."

But here we have Democrats now trying to figure out how they are going to position themselves going forward. They've got Stacey Abrams, who is the minority leader of the Georgia legislature. Stacey Evans, two Stacey. Stacey Evans who is also in the Georgia legislature, but they have really contrasting approaches. Abrams very much trying to bring out minority votes, people who are strong anti-Trumpers and believe that they can win that way. Stacy Evans on the other hand is much more about reaching out, creating some kind of bridge of unity, rural, whites, urban black, saying you know, she's the common sense, she offers hope scholarships, and I think to give kids a chance.

In fact, A.P. says its reporter was not only denied entry, but grabbed by security and forcibly shoved out of the building. The EPA didn't comment about anyone physically removing a journalist, but it did say the plan was always to allow just 10 reporters inside, saying, quoting, \"This was simply an issue of the room reaching capacity, which reporters were aware of prior to the event.\" But a report by The Hill said that during the conference, a handful of seats in the press room remained vacant. Another reporter told Politico there were dozens of empty seats, and CNN also showed pictures of space for cameras. For the record, Fox News was not there. Instead we decided to use the pool camera, which was provided by CBS. But all three of organizations not allowed in, later released statements. CNN said, quoting, \"We understand the importance of an open and free press, and we hope the EPA does too.\" The Associated Press called it, quote, \"alarming and a direct threat to the public's right to know about what is happening inside their government.\" E&E said the topic being discussed was critical to their readers, and quote, \"Our reporter deserved to be in that room to ask smart questions of EPA officials.\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders first said she would look into the matter, and then she was asked if it's ever acceptable to physically turn away reporters.

And dear friends, and people of good conscience, we are on the cusp of changing history, and restoring our rights to fight for the laws that protect children and women in every state in this country.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have the incredible honor, and privilege, to introduce to you tonight a man who has led, as he campaigned, who has been as good as his word in fighting for life, a man who is worth fighting for because they are worth fighting for.
