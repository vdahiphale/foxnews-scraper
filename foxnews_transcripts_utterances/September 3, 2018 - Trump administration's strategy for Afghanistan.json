So what I'm looking to this week is that Secretary Pompeo is headed to the region. He's going to be meeting in India, in Pakistan. Clearly a lot of these discussions will be about Afghanistan and we have seen of course the funding withdrawal from Pakistan from the U.S. side. And we have also seen, interestingly, Pakistan continue to get closer to nefarious countries from our perspective, like Iran. Minister Zarif was just there recently and welcomed with open arms. So Afghanistan has been a struggle for past 17 or 18 years for three administrations, but the right approach I think is the one this administration is pursuing now, which is taking into account a regional context. We had 100,000 troops there and we still could not completely decimate the threat from the Taliban, from terrorist organizations, so we're not going to do it with the 13,800 that have there now. We're going to have to do it by holding Pakistan's feet to the fire clearly once and for all.",

      "utterance": "I think actually Canada and Trudeau especially have very much overplayed their hand. There was an FTA between the U.S. and Canada pre NAFTA, and so if NAFTA goes away, we would go back to the provisions under that FTA. But I think that Mexico was smart to engage this president very early on on the tough issues. Canada has negotiated with this administration on the easier issues, but on the tougher things, dairy, autos, I.P., they are leaving all of that stuff to the last minute. And Trudeau is going to have to concede on these issues. So while he waited until the 11th hour to try to talk with the president on the toughest issues when he's in the most vulnerable position I think was a big flaw."
