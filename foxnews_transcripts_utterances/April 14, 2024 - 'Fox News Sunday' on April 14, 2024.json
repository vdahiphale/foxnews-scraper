Because what the attack that came in was the largest swarm attack that we've ever seen in history. And there's frankly no putting the genie back in the bottle after this one.

The David Sling is one down, and then the bottom one is the Iron Dome. So they had to use everything in conjunction.

People say that foreign policy or the people look the polling instead of foreign policy doesn't weigh in on voter's minds heavily and it's not ordinarily at the top. I would differ. I think when Karl and Dana were in the White House, the '04 reelection, foreign policy was at the forefront. They said to the American people, you haven't been attacked in that John Kerry campaign. 1980 Ronald Reagan was elected, I think on a foreign policy issue. And in 2016 Biden was helped. The litany that you just enumerated are things that this White House is going to have to deal with in a -- in a more forceful way. This issue here in the Middle East is -- I think that region is more susceptible to a blow-up more so than it's been since perhaps the early '90s, late '80s, early '90s. And it feels different this time because of our proximity to it through technology and the way we're able to access it. I don't know. As I listened to Senator Kennedy and even Admiral Kirby, the options we have, because I listened to Senator Kennedy, I don't know. Should we go to war with Iran? What happens in the region if the offensive a response in the Israelis? And I agree with Dana that we should not tell the Israelis not to respond, but we have to be willing to share. This is what will happen if you go for it as aggressively, as you say, you -- that you plan to. This is a tough pickle that we're in. And I think one of the things we should do is two things in America. First, the White House should say, we're standing with Israel, we're ironclad with them. And anybody suggests otherwise is wrong. We massively coordinated with them. Without our help, there would have been more of those missiles that would have landed. And two, the Congress, Democrats, and Republicans. We should provide Israel. We should provide Ukraine. And we should provide Taiwan every tool and resource they need. For those of us who believe we should do at the beginning, this is the beginning. Actually, it's really the middle. But if we don't do it now, we will disadvantage our allies even more.",

We could see here on the skyline of Tel Aviv as Israel's advanced Arrow system worked to intercept some of this missile and drone fire launched by Iran. We do understand after the attack took place that included air raid sirens in Jerusalem, Israel's largest city and explosions overhead, that there was a phone call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Also, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant speaking with his counterpart, Secretary Lloyd Austin.

But I don't think you can look at what happened last night in any way shape or form and not come away convinced that the president meant every word he said, ironclad commitment. I mean, several hundred drones and missiles launched in the course of several hours and almost every single one of them knocked out of the sky and they didn't make it into Israel. And that's -- that's not by accident. That's a terrific testament to the superiority of the Israeli military, but also to our own military superiority and the effort, the risk, the resources that President Biden committed to helping defend Israel."

    },

      "speaker": "KIRBY",

I've been around allies and alliances my whole professional life and I can't think of a single one where if it's a real alliance where you can't -- you can't have honest conversations with one another a little bit every now and then and take issue with the way something might be done. We're not bashful about that with our good friend Israel, but the other thing we're not bashful about and certainly President Biden's not been bashful about is making sure that when we say we're going to help Israel defend itself, my goodness, we're going to -- we're going to put something behind that and we did that last night."

      "utterance": "-- in the region. And let's take a look at that ballistic missile. Okay, so they launched more than 100 ballistic missiles and how many got through? And the reason it didn't get through is because President Biden made sure that we pre- positioned forces in the region to help Israel shoot them down, so this vaunted ballistic missile program of theirs didn't turn out to be so vaunted last night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",

    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Again, Shannon, just look at the -- the sanctions that we put in place against Iran. Look at the resources we put in this in -- into the region. It's hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we've somehow gone soft on Iran. It was the previous administration that decided to get us out of the Iran deal. And now Iran is so much dramatically closer to potential nuclear weapon capability than they were before -- before Mr. Trump was elected."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "You and I have had this fungibility argument before. I obviously take a different issue or take an issue with that characterization. The sanctions relief that has come about or -- it's not even sanctions relief but the additional funds that have been made available to Iran due to sanctions relief program that the Trump administration put in place can only be used for humanitarian goods. It doesn't go to the regime. And the idea that the regime was somehow felt like they were freed up to support these proxies because of that, it just doesn't comport with the facts. They have been supporting these proxies for many, many years."
    },

      "speaker": "BREAM",

But this comes at a time, first of all, that we know China is the number one oil customer for Iran, and also this week reports that they are supplying critical elements to Russia to help it, you know, gin up its weapon system and be able to go after Ukraine. This relationship with China does not seem to be working to our advantage. They don't seem worried about any of the warnings from us, any of the visits from us."
    },

      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Well, look I won't dispute the fact that China can do more, China should do more in terms of the Middle East, in terms of the relationship that they have with Tehran, and yes, we've asked them to use that influence to a positive effect. I'll let President Xi speak to what he is or wasn't - - isn't willing to do, but they have not put that kind of pressure on -- on Tehran, and we certainly want them to do that. But China's also not the leader in the region that maybe they want to be or to claim to be. The United States however, as demonstrated last night, very much is in a leadership position in the region."

More sheep is not going to solve the wolf problem. I expect -- I don't know but I expect the Speaker of the House probably next week to put an Israel bill, Israel support bill on the floor of the House. I think it will be followed by a bill to support Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific. And number three, I think he will put a bill to support Ukraine. Now, I think his bill is going to make the money alone -- alone and away in. I think it will require Ukraine to pay it back. I think we will see some Russian assets to pay for it. I think the bill will be limited to military aid, not humanitarian aid. And I think there will be some strong encouragement to make Europe which is vastly more wealthy than -- than Russia to do a better job of putting its money where its mouth is. And I think the bill will pass. It'll come back to the Senate. And unfortunately, I predict that if it comes back to the Senate the big issue on those bills will not be -- of Ukraine.

Senator Schumer is coming up with all kind of excuses and -- and -- and talking about how many lawyers can dance on the head of a pen. He's trying to muddy the water to make it look deep.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KELLOGG",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Shannon, well it's an integrated system when it comes to air defense. We have to remember the allies were there too. Both the Brits, the Saudis were there, the Jordanians were there, we were there with the aircraft. So it was a comprehensive defense that you saw. Because what the attack that came in was the largest swarm attack that we've ever seen in history. And there's frankly no putting the genie back in the bottle after this one. It was a very complicated attack. When they had to use all the systems they had, meaning the Israelis from the Arrow system, that's their high-end system. That's the anti-ballistic missile system. The David Sling is one down, and then the bottom one is the Iron Dome. So they had to use everything in conjunction. With 300 drones coming at you, you know, you have to get that comprehensive attack to prevent that comprehensive attack, and they were doing it. They did it pretty effectively. But here's something to remember in the back of everybody's mind is, because now they're saying, OK, well now we go back to the respective corners. No. 99% of those things were destroyed in route coming in. Think about the attack that they had on us after we killed Soleimani. They sent 16 missiles, 16. This was 300 drones and missiles as well. So this is one of those, how the Israelis are going to react. You're not going to go back to the respective corners. The genie's out of the bottle. Now where do they go?"

There are concerns, because you heard me talking with Admiral Kirby about this, the fact that apparently our President has telegraphed to Israel. They don't want to be involved. The U.S. will not support a massive counterstrike. We do have a lot of assets in the region. But what does this mean now with the back and forth? You say the genie's out of the bottle. How does it resolve? Because Iran says, it is concluded. We're done. I'm guessing Israel doesn't feel the same way."

You add another one, like the Ford battle group, whatever you want to put in there. It's not the amount of assets that you have. It's the will to use those assets going into a fight and going into danger. And when we should have basically said to the Israelis, we've got your back, full stop. Don't go any further. Not that we're not going to support a comprehensive strike from the Israelis back on the Iranians, because they will -- they will go back. That doesn't mean they're going to go downtown. That doesn't mean they're going to go after the Ford nuclear facility. But they will respond to a degree because they have to. You know, it's sort of like dancing with a bear. You know, you don't decide to stop dancing when you want to. You stop dancing when the bear wants you to stop. And I think now the Israelis are the bear, and the Iranians have got to realize that. You've got to reestablish deterrence in the region. And the only people really establishing deterrence in the region are the Israelis, not us."

We're relieved because this cooperation between Israel and America has actually provide us also an incredible defense for our family and for our children. It means that this vicious and violent attack by Iran on our communities, on our nation, was intercepted in 99 percent. And it means that the money that we've invested, billions of dollars and the best minds and our heart and time into defending our country, actually worked.

And we have a mutual goal and it is to fight it together. I mean, Iran is attacking not just Israel. Iran is the most destabilising (ph) force that we have. It's attacking our values. This is radical Islamist regime that's attacking our values, the way that we live, our liberties, our freedom. And it has to be stopped. If this attack from last night would have happened in any -- to any other country, the results would have been devastating with probably thousands of dead.

      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD, JR., FORMER UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "Well, first off, happy Sunday. It's good to be with you. I'd say a few things. People say that foreign policy or the people look the polling instead of foreign policy doesn't weigh in on voter's minds heavily and it's not ordinarily at the top. I would differ. I think when Karl and Dana were in the White House, the '04 reelection, foreign policy was at the forefront. They said to the American people, you haven't been attacked in that John Kerry campaign. 1980 Ronald Reagan was elected, I think on a foreign policy issue. And in 2016 Biden was helped. The litany that you just enumerated are things that this White House is going to have to deal with in a -- in a more forceful way. This issue here in the Middle East is -- I think that region is more susceptible to a blow-up more so than it's been since perhaps the early '90s, late '80s, early '90s. And it feels different this time because of our proximity to it through technology and the way we're able to access it. I don't know. As I listened to Senator Kennedy and even Admiral Kirby, the options we have, because I listened to Senator Kennedy, I don't know. Should we go to war with Iran? What happens in the region if the offensive a response in the Israelis? And I agree with Dana that we should not tell the Israelis not to respond, but we have to be willing to share. This is what will happen if you go for it as aggressively, as you say, you -- that you plan to. This is a tough pickle that we're in. And I think one of the things we should do is two things in America. First, the White House should say, we're standing with Israel, we're ironclad with them. And anybody suggests otherwise is wrong. We massively coordinated with them. Without our help, there would have been more of those missiles that would have landed. And two, the Congress, Democrats, and Republicans. We should provide Israel. We should provide Ukraine. And we should provide Taiwan every tool and resource they need. For those of us who believe we should do at the beginning, this is the beginning. Actually, it's really the middle. But if we don't do it now, we will disadvantage our allies even more."

And here is a member of Congress, Greg Stanton who is a Democrat from Arizona saying this. \"I've never seen anything like this in terms of people just viscerally angry that this has happened in our state.

And he did have this long social media posting in which he in part-- he said in part Arizona to the governor to the legislature out there like, you got to do something. We're counting on you. Now, whether they decide to preserve it for the ballot in November, something to see, but he's trying to say, look, what I pressed on Alabama, they closed this loophole on IVF. Now, I'm calling on Arizona to the same thing with abortion. TALCOTT. What's interesting about this, and I think you make it a good point. Because when I talk to people close to the Trump campaign, they've pointed out to me that by Donald Trump talking about this issue more, it has sort of muddied the waters for the Biden campaign to attack him over it. Because remember, a few weeks ago before Donald Trump came out and talked it all about it, they were saying he supports national abortion ban."

So they're having to explain their argument more now than they were before. And I think on the -- on Donald Trump's messaging. It has also opened the floodgates for Republican lawmakers to sort of start talking about the issue of abortion in more political terms, right? Donald Trump has always said throughout this entire campaign that you need to be thinking about this in part from a political standpoint because you need to win the election in order to do what you want in office. And so that's been interesting to see the shift. And we're seeing more and more lawmakers come out and say some of these restrictions are too severe."

Fox News has signed on to a letter with a number of other media groups saying this, the stakes of this election are exceptionally high amidst that backdrop. There's simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other. And before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation. So we've joined these other media group to say we think both the presumptive nominees should agree that they will have debates and do them before the voting begins, or at least before the November vote. Show of hands, who thinks that debates actually happen between these two? OK, Dana (ph). Do you think the debates happen?"

The 12 jurors ultimately seated, along with some alternates, will be asked to consider 34 felony counts against the former president in connection with money paid to an adult film star who says she had sex with Trump and then took the money to keep quiet. Each of those counts carries a possible four-year jail term. Prosecutors are trying a novel legal theory that elevates misdemeanor charges related to falsifying business records to felonies by claiming they were falsified to conceal another crime. The case is expected to take a couple of months. It will not be televised. High-profile witnesses may include former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. The defense will try to paint him as unreliable and self-interested. It's possible former Trump aid Hope Hicks, Stormy Daniels herself, and another woman who claimed she had an affair with the president could take the stand, but will the former president? Let's ask someone who could answer that question. Joining me now, attorney for the former president, Will Scharf. Good to see you. Welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

      "utterance": "OK, so the president - first of all, let's talk about jury selection. This is an area where Manhattan -- roughly 84 percent, 85 percent of the vote last time around went for President Biden. How tough is it going to be to get a jury you think can be neutral?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHARF",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's a really important point. At the end of the day what we're talking about here is a show trial. It's a six-week-long media extravaganza in the media capital of the world where the only realistic consequence, even if President Trump were convicted, is frankly a talking point for the Biden campaign. Jury selection is going to be difficult. I have a lot of faith in our team up there, that they're going to be able to get the best possible jury. But I think it's really important to note that the fact that this case is being brought at the height of election season makes the possess of picking a jury even more difficult, makes the - the possibility of having a biased jury even more likely. And that's a real problem."

And there are those out there who say - one legal analyst said, if he was my client I'd beg him not to do it. Michael Cohen, who is also expected to be on the stand, is skeptical the president will take the stand. Here's what he said last night."

      "speaker": "SCHARF",
      "utterance": "I think that's going to be a decision for President Trump and the trial team depending on how the trial progresses. I would say that I think if he does take the stand, President Trump will be a compelling witness. He did nothing wrong here. The truth is absolutely on his side. So, that's a decision that's going to have to be made down the road. But one way or the other, I have full confidence in both President Trump and the team that he has around him."

In fact, Lanny Davis, who's been a legal advisor to him, says this. \"The case against Trump involves multiple witnesses besides Cohen to corroborate the crime of paying illegal hush money under New York law, as well as under federal law, backed up to multiple witnesses, documents, text messages, telephone call records and documents.\" You guys clearly are going to go after Cohen, but he says it's not just me, there are all kinds of other things that will back up my story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHARF",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I'm somewhat limited in what I can say here because of the wildly unconstitutional gag order entered against President Trump by Judge Merchan in this case, which just goes to show how outrageous this whole process has been. With respect to Michael Cohen, as we've said consistently in pleadings, this is a man who numerous courts have found guilty of perjury in the past. And I think ultimately the jury is going to have to weigh the credibility of the various witnesses. But I truly believe the truth is on President Trump's side and there's nothing that any of these witnesses or anything the New York D.A. can do to change this basic fact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Would the legal team consider this idea that's being floated out there of, when you get to the jury, before they get to deliberations, asking for lesser included offense, meaning, giving them an opportunity to say, we will convict on misdemeanors instead of these felonies? Or do you guys want to go for broke, it's felonies or nothing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHARF",
      "utterance": "Well, one of the craziest things about this case, and you teased this a little bit in your intro, is the fact that what we're dealing with here are misdemeanor offenses that through this weird, legal alchemical (ph) process, Alvin Bragg has attempted to convert into felony offenses. If these were merely misdemeanors, there's no question the statute of limitation would not allow this case to have been brought in the first place. So, that's a real legal problem with - with the case itself, and I expect that that will play out in court in the coming weeks."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

As we speak, the Israeli war cabinet is meeting, trying to determine if and how Israel will respond to this unprecedented Iranian attack overnight that included hundreds of drones and missiles. Just before the meeting began, war cabinet member Benny Gantz, the former defense minister, released a statement saying that Israel was reviewing its options and wanted to build an international coalition to respond against Iran. He also said Israel reserved the right to respond at a time and place that best suits Israel. Right now the Israeli people are bracing for the possibility of continued attacks from Iranian proxies across the region. Remember, they are still fighting the war inside Gaza. They've faced renewed fire from Yemen and from Lebanon. And again, this fire overnight, the first time in history that Iran launched an attack on Israeli soil. Shannon."
