      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News Alert. Tonight, CNN facing a massive credibility crisis. President Trump is now calling out the network's fake news and their extreme bias. Laura Ingraham will join us tonight with reaction. Also tonight, Monica Crowley, Eric Bolling, Sara Carter, John Solomon and Jay Sekulow will all join us. Now, I also want you to get a pen and a pad out. I'm going to explain the six things that America now needs to be investigating. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight, our explosive interview with a former elite American soldier on how the Obama administration absolutely blew the opportunity to take out the leader of ISIS. It will be a \"Hannity\" exclusive. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first tonight, the Clinton news network is now unraveling before your eyes. It is now being exposed for what it really is, fake news, anti-Trump propaganda and a political smear machine. And that's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right, the \"Clinton News Network,\" which is constantly competing with NBC News to be the most anti-Trump news outlet in the country, is under fire yet again, once again pushing fake news. Now, three employees supposedly resigned last night after the network had to retract a completely false story about a Trump ally, friend of mine, Anthony Scaramucci, claiming that he was being investigated for colluding with the Russians through dealings with a Russian investment fund. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now President Trump rightly slammed CNN once again and the rest of the destroy Trump media on Twitter today, writing, quote, \"Fake news CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russia stories. Ratings are way down.\" The president continued, \"So they caught fake news CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS, ABC? What about the failing New York Times and Washington Post? They're all fake news.\" Now, CNN is claiming that the only reason this hit-piece article was published was because, quote, \"standard editorial processes were not followed.\" Now, CNN may want to review those so-called editorial processes that they have because they've been forced to now retract several other fake news stories -- in other words, lies to the American people -- in just the past month alone. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For example, on June 16th, CNN, well, they had to delete a tweet and issue a correction for claiming that only Democrats were praying before the congressional baseball game. I was there. Not true. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And just before, one day, one day before that, CNN senior White House correspondent, the very angry Jim Acosta, tweeted and then had to remove fake news about President Trump not visiting Congressman Steve Scalise in the hospital. Of course, that's not all. Earlier this month, before the former FBI Director James Comey's congressional testimony, well, CNN had to again change a story that falsely stated that Comey would contradict President Trump's statements about not being under investigation by the FBI. Now, all that appears to just be the beginning of the network's problems, because today, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas, well, they came out with a new video that apparently shows a CNN producer admitting the network's massive anti-Trump agenda. Now, Fox News has not been able to independently verify the content of the video. But here are some of the key parts. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Now, in response to this very damning video, CNN issued a short statement. It read, in part, quote, \"CNN stands by our medical producer. Diversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN strong. We welcome it. We embrace it.\" I'm actually glad this producer will not be losing his job simply for being honest and truthful. But here's what is so ridiculous about that statement. CNN didn't address, didn't even bother to react to the network president, Jeff Zucker's, comments about, quote, \"getting back to Russia\" and using the false Russia collusion conspiracy theory to drive up ratings for money. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, the blame on all of this should be at the feet of Jeff Zucker. And if anyone faces consequences here, it should be Zucker. As we have explained, Zucker is the person who is overseeing and steering CNN and the destroy Trump fake news coverage over there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And here's the funny part. Take a look at this headline from earlier this month. \"Jeff Zucker: Viewers trust CNN 'more than ever.'\" Only someone like Zucker who leads a fake news network that constantly pushes conspiracy theories and fake news -- you know, it's bizarre he'd try to make that claim. CNN has now gone overboard. They've jumped the shark. They're completely biased. And by the way, they are now one of the preeminent pushers of the fake news propaganda in the country today. They have an agenda, take down the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at a recent Harvard study, of all places. From January 20 until the end of April, 93 percent -- a whopping 93 percent! -- of CNN's coverage of President Trump was negative. Now, I said last night on Twitter that I think Zucker -- he needs to face the consequences. He is a left-wing ideologue. He doesn't care about facts or truth or getting any stories right. He is a Trump-hating political operative who's pretending to be the president of an unbiased news network! Well, with all due respect, as you know, Zucker and CNN are not alone. Now, the mainstream destroy Trump media so-called journalists -- there's a ton of them. And here's more proof, by the way, of exactly what we've been exposing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Our friends over at Media Research and their center have put together this chart analyzing ABC, NBC, CBS and their newscasts for over a month. What did the MRC find? Well, that the newscasts have a clear obsession over Trump, Russia, Comey and the investigation despite, of course, no evidence so far of any actual wrongdoing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, instead of obsessing over fake news, Russia collusion, conspiracy theories, black helicopter theories, the destroy Trump media should be focusing on real scandals that they have been ignoring for months. We have been covering them. Here are the top six. James Comey, remember, had his friend leak the memo to The New York Times to bring about a special counsel. Now, Comey may have committed a crime by unlawfully removing FBI property, which could be a violation of the Federal Records Act. And according to Judicial Watch, by the way, Loretta Lynch -- look at her, obstructing justice. Bipartisan group of senators, now they're calling for an investigation into this. Why isn't the media? Remember, Lynch told Comey to call the Clinton email investigation a \"matter.\" By the way, Clinton talking points. And we also know that Lynch met Bill Clinton on the tarmac for 40 minutes before Comey let Hillary go free. And by the way, after saying she was extremely careless in her handling of top secret and classified information and destroying classified information. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, also, number three, speaking of Hillary, her email server that we just described -- well, that deserves an investigation and, frankly, a grand jury because, as we've been explaining, the original one was compromised by Comey and Lynch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, of course, number four. There's also the Clinton-Russia collusion Uranium One deal, real collusion! Hillary, secretary of state, signed off 20 percent America's uranium going to Vladimir Putin, the foundational material for a nuclear weapon! And while people who were involved in that deal, by the way, at the same time are kicking back millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and her husband's doubling his speaking fees in Moscow. Now, the only law in this case that we know was broken in this whole Russia collusion story was, of course, the unmasking and the leaking of intelligence against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. And he's paid a price for that. That's a felony, a violation. That's the Espionage Act. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And finally, number six, special counsel Mueller is inexcusable, his illegal, many conflicts of interest and investigative creep here. And of course, Mueller, best friends with Comey. Also, members of Mueller's team. Let's see. He picks one of Hillary's lawyers and picks people that donated to Obama and Hillary Clinton to investigate Donald Trump? Are you serious? And one of the lawyers that represented the Clinton Foundation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, those are the stories we're helping the media hear. Those are the scandals that the media should be focused on instead of the destroying of the president, like CNN, like NBC, like the major networks, like The Washington Post and The New York Times. Here with reaction to all this, editor-in-chief, Lifezette, FOX News contributor, nationally syndicated talk show host -- she's actually funny occasionally -- Laura Ingraham.

At the time it was my job to hunt down some of the most senior leaders within the Islamic State. And we're talking about some of the most evil human beings on the planet, folks that are here coming after Americans, looking to hurt Americans on our soil. And what is going to surprise a lot of people about what they read in my book is just how close we brought the Islamic State of Iraq to the brink of extension. And at the time when I was doing this, al-Baghdadi was maybe four or five in the organization. He wasn't the top leader, but when he popped up on the radar we just saw how close this guy was to the top and how very quickly he rose through the ranks. And so when we hunted Baghdadi we actually used him originally to kill the original two leaders of the Islamic State which allowed him to fill this leadership gap and eventually take over as number one.",

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News Alert. Tonight, CNN facing a massive credibility crisis. President Trump is now calling out the network's fake news and their extreme bias. Laura Ingraham will join us tonight with reaction. Also tonight, Monica Crowley, Eric Bolling, Sara Carter, John Solomon and Jay Sekulow will all join us. Now, I also want you to get a pen and a pad out. I'm going to explain the six things that America now needs to be investigating. Also tonight, our explosive interview with a former elite American soldier on how the Obama administration absolutely blew the opportunity to take out the leader of ISIS. It will be a \"Hannity\" exclusive. But first tonight, the Clinton news network is now unraveling before your eyes. It is now being exposed for what it really is, fake news, anti-Trump propaganda and a political smear machine. And that's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, the \"Clinton News Network,\" which is constantly competing with NBC News to be the most anti-Trump news outlet in the country, is under fire yet again, once again pushing fake news. Now, three employees supposedly resigned last night after the network had to retract a completely false story about a Trump ally, friend of mine, Anthony Scaramucci, claiming that he was being investigated for colluding with the Russians through dealings with a Russian investment fund. Now President Trump rightly slammed CNN once again and the rest of the destroy Trump media on Twitter today, writing, quote, \"Fake news CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russia stories. Ratings are way down.\" The president continued, \"So they caught fake news CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS, ABC? What about the failing New York Times and Washington Post? They're all fake news.\" Now, CNN is claiming that the only reason this hit-piece article was published was because, quote, \"standard editorial processes were not followed.\" Now, CNN may want to review those so-called editorial processes that they have because they've been forced to now retract several other fake news stories -- in other words, lies to the American people -- in just the past month alone. For example, on June 16th, CNN, well, they had to delete a tweet and issue a correction for claiming that only Democrats were praying before the congressional baseball game. I was there. Not true. And just before, one day, one day before that, CNN senior White House correspondent, the very angry Jim Acosta, tweeted and then had to remove fake news about President Trump not visiting Congressman Steve Scalise in the hospital. Of course, that's not all. Earlier this month, before the former FBI Director James Comey's congressional testimony, well, CNN had to again change a story that falsely stated that Comey would contradict President Trump's statements about not being under investigation by the FBI. Now, all that appears to just be the beginning of the network's problems, because today, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas, well, they came out with a new video that apparently shows a CNN producer admitting the network's massive anti-Trump agenda. Now, Fox News has not been able to independently verify the content of the video. But here are some of the key parts. Take a look."

Like, you have no smoking gun. You have no real proof.\""

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, in response to this very damning video, CNN issued a short statement. It read, in part, quote, \"CNN stands by our medical producer. Diversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN strong. We welcome it. We embrace it.\" I'm actually glad this producer will not be losing his job simply for being honest and truthful. But here's what is so ridiculous about that statement. CNN didn't address, didn't even bother to react to the network president, Jeff Zucker's, comments about, quote, \"getting back to Russia\" and using the false Russia collusion conspiracy theory to drive up ratings for money. And by the way, the blame on all of this should be at the feet of Jeff Zucker. And if anyone faces consequences here, it should be Zucker. As we have explained, Zucker is the person who is overseeing and steering CNN and the destroy Trump fake news coverage over there. And here's the funny part. Take a look at this headline from earlier this month. \"Jeff Zucker: Viewers trust CNN 'more than ever.'\" Only someone like Zucker who leads a fake news network that constantly pushes conspiracy theories and fake news -- you know, it's bizarre he'd try to make that claim. CNN has now gone overboard. They've jumped the shark. They're completely biased. And by the way, they are now one of the preeminent pushers of the fake news propaganda in the country today. They have an agenda, take down the president. Look at a recent Harvard study, of all places. From January 20 until the end of April, 93 percent -- a whopping 93 percent! -- of CNN's coverage of President Trump was negative. Now, I said last night on Twitter that I think Zucker -- he needs to face the consequences. He is a left-wing ideologue. He doesn't care about facts or truth or getting any stories right. He is a Trump-hating political operative who's pretending to be the president of an unbiased news network! Well, with all due respect, as you know, Zucker and CNN are not alone. Now, the mainstream destroy Trump media so-called journalists -- there's a ton of them. And here's more proof, by the way, of exactly what we've been exposing. Our friends over at Media Research and their center have put together this chart analyzing ABC, NBC, CBS and their newscasts for over a month. What did the MRC find? Well, that the newscasts have a clear obsession over Trump, Russia, Comey and the investigation despite, of course, no evidence so far of any actual wrongdoing. Now, instead of obsessing over fake news, Russia collusion, conspiracy theories, black helicopter theories, the destroy Trump media should be focusing on real scandals that they have been ignoring for months. We have been covering them. Here are the top six. James Comey, remember, had his friend leak the memo to The New York Times to bring about a special counsel. Now, Comey may have committed a crime by unlawfully removing FBI property, which could be a violation of the Federal Records Act. And according to Judicial Watch, by the way, Loretta Lynch -- look at her, obstructing justice. Bipartisan group of senators, now they're calling for an investigation into this. Why isn't the media? Remember, Lynch told Comey to call the Clinton email investigation a \"matter.\" By the way, Clinton talking points. And we also know that Lynch met Bill Clinton on the tarmac for 40 minutes before Comey let Hillary go free. And by the way, after saying she was extremely careless in her handling of top secret and classified information and destroying classified information. Now, also, number three, speaking of Hillary, her email server that we just described -- well, that deserves an investigation and, frankly, a grand jury because, as we've been explaining, the original one was compromised by Comey and Lynch. And then, of course, number four. There's also the Clinton-Russia collusion Uranium One deal, real collusion! Hillary, secretary of state, signed off 20 percent America's uranium going to Vladimir Putin, the foundational material for a nuclear weapon! And while people who were involved in that deal, by the way, at the same time are kicking back millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and her husband's doubling his speaking fees in Moscow. Now, the only law in this case that we know was broken in this whole Russia collusion story was, of course, the unmasking and the leaking of intelligence against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. And he's paid a price for that. That's a felony, a violation. That's the Espionage Act. And finally, number six, special counsel Mueller is inexcusable, his illegal, many conflicts of interest and investigative creep here. And of course, Mueller, best friends with Comey. Also, members of Mueller's team. Let's see. He picks one of Hillary's lawyers and picks people that donated to Obama and Hillary Clinton to investigate Donald Trump? Are you serious? And one of the lawyers that represented the Clinton Foundation. Now, those are the stories we're helping the media hear. Those are the scandals that the media should be focused on instead of the destroying of the president, like CNN, like NBC, like the major networks, like The Washington Post and The New York Times. Here with reaction to all this, editor-in-chief, Lifezette, FOX News contributor, nationally syndicated talk show host -- she's actually funny occasionally -- Laura Ingraham. How are you?"

That's just another in a long list of problems that CNN has had. And I was theorizing today in Lifezette, which you can read the story on Lifezette.com, that Jeff Zucker received a lot of criticism -- he's the president of CNN -- he received an enormous amount of criticism, Sean, for airing so many of the Trump rallies during the campaign. And you do get the sense that this obsession with Russia now is -- there's something that seems like it's, like, almost atoning for the past since of giving Donald Trump such a wide platform during the campaign because he's been slammed by the left.

But now, as I've been telling you, it's now boomeranging back on them, and more directly to former president Obama. Now, remember, during the election last year when President Obama said it wasn't possible for our elections to be rigged and told then candidate Donald Trump to stop whining about it? Remember this?"

He did nothing about it! Why? Because he assumed Hillary Clinton would win. And since Hillary lost and President Trump is in office, well, now election meddling is suddenly a serious issue. Joining us now with reaction, conservative commentator Monica Crowley and author of an outstanding, brand-new book, \"The Swamp: Washington's Murky Pool of Corruption, Cronyism and How Trump Can Drain It,\" the co-host of \"The Fox News Specialists\" Eric Bolling.

So he's going back and forth and back and forth a few times. They flip-flop. But the bottom line is, the beauty of this is, you know, you have videotape, Sean. You have good producers who'll pull up some of these ideas that he says on tape, and you can show him his own words. It's -- the hypocrisy is limitless and boundless."

And it was President Obama who chose to do nothing when he was confronted with credible intelligence in early August of last year of Russian interference! All of that is true.

Why? Because he didn't want to play into Donald Trump's theme that the election could be rigged. And he didn't want to discredit the outcome and the expected Hillary Clinton win.

It's facing opposition, though, from some conservative and moderate Republicans, and there simply aren't enough votes to pass the Senate bill. And another cyber-attack is crippling computer systems around the world. It started in the Ukraine and quickly spread, paralyzing hospitals, government offices, and businesses.

Joining us now from Circa News, Sara Carter and John Solomon, and the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice as well as the president's attorney, Jay Sekulow.

And they wanted to get it out there. When you think of Robyn Gritz, I want you to think of a woman who by everybody's standards, I talked to Admiral Losey, the letters that poured in in support of her were incredible. She was one of the top counterterrorism agents in the United States. She worked on cases like Robert Levinson in Iran and other cases that are highly classified. She worked closely with John Brennan as well. So this was somebody that was greatly admired. And what was so fascinating about this story was not only was it Michael Flynn who intervened and tried to intervene three times, he was willing to testify on her behalf, but the FBI pushed back and tried to block him from testifying on her behalf.

When you couple this with Andrew McCabe and the report that you guys released yesterday in a possible violation of the Hatch Act which prohibits anybody, FBI agents, from campaigning in partisan races, and then you see the money and the funneling and huge amounts of dollars for a race that never gets that kind of money.

That's under investigation. So the investigator is under investigation. And then you take the possibility that he was investigating Mike Flynn because he was a hostile witness in another case, a real conflict of interest, real questions surfacing."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

What did he know back in August about Russia trying to influence the election? Why didn't he act? And we have Loretta Lynch, the tarmac, it's not an investigation, it's a matter. And of course John and Sara's report that she may have put the kibosh on any indictment for Hillary, that would be obstruction. Then we've got of course Mueller and all of his conflicts of interest, hiring Hillary's attorneys, Obama, Hillary donors. Then we've got Comey, did he violate the Records Act leaking to the \"New York Times\"? Then we've got Hillary herself, the pay or play scheme, Uranium One deal, and then the e-mail server scandal, mishandling and destroying of classified information. And on top of that General Flynn which we were just talking about, and certainly the Espionage Act violated. I want all of these matters investigated.

So you have the acting FBI director -- you cannot -- the acting FBI director was a defendant in a case where General Flynn was going to be the witness. This was two years, by the way, before General Flynn had anything to do with the president's political campaign. And then you have mysteriously now the investigation by that office of the FBI, director's office, which again is Mr. McCabe's, investigating the whole situation with General Flynn. Then you have the layer on top of that where you have a significant campaign contribution coming from Terry McAuliffe's campaign to the wife of the acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And all of this is going on simultaneously. And you say to yourself, first of all it's not fair to the president. But the American people should be saying, this is an outrage.

Now that the administration is forcing Acosta out of the spotlight by hosting a few audio-only press briefings because they only want to play gotcha, CNN's White House darling is really starting to become unhinged, kind of like liberal Joe.

In fact it appears that Acosta is very much in line with his colleagues at CNN led by Jeff Zucker who are using fake news now as a political weapon against the Trump administration. For example, as we told you earlier, Acosta was forced to delete a tweet earlier this month after he claimed President Trump did not visit Congressman Steve Scalise when he was in the hospital. Turns out totally fake news. And that misguided tweet is only one of many examples of what is now a pattern of Acosta's corrosive coverage and biased coverage of President Trump. Sadly, for a White House correspondent claiming to be an unbiased journalist, Acosta has a pretty extensive history of trashing the Trump administration -- isn't he supposed to be objective and fair and balanced? -- including multiple combative exchanges with Sean Spicer, White House officials, and even the president. Why? So he gets to look good for himself on camera. Is he really looking for answers to questions for you, the American people? We'll let you decide. ACOSTA, JUNE 19: It's like we're just covering bad reality television is what it feels like now. The White House press secretary is getting to a point, Brooke, where he's just kind of useless.

And we're talking about some of the most evil human beings on the planet, folks that are here coming after Americans, looking to hurt Americans on our soil. And what is going to surprise a lot of people about what they read in my book is just how close we brought the Islamic State of Iraq to the brink of extension. And at the time when I was doing this, al-Baghdadi was maybe four or five in the organization. He wasn't the top leader, but when he popped up on the radar we just saw how close this guy was to the top and how very quickly he rose through the ranks. And so when we hunted Baghdadi we actually used him originally to kill the original two leaders of the Islamic State which allowed him to fill this leadership gap and eventually take over as number one."

      "utterance": "They were Abu al-Masri and another individual named al- Baghdadi as well at the time, Omar al-Baghdadi. But at the time, again, Baghdadi was the number four or five in the organization so he was able to take on the ranks and really have the opportunity to bring ISIS into --"

      "utterance": "What happened when you identified, located him, were ready to take him out or capture him, what happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VELICOVICH",
      "utterance": "The rules of warfare had changed. So that's what happened. When the teams had actually located Baghdadi and pinpointed him to a house on the ground, by that time U.S. troops had been told to get out of Iraq. They had been told to leave. So typically a raid that would have occurred that same night by an assault force, a team of special forces guys going in there to extract the target from a compound, they then had to essentially wait two weeks for the call to be made to allow these guys to go in, and by that time he was gone. And Baghdadi doesn't stay anywhere for two weeks. And so that's essentially what happened because of these new rules of engagement that had taken place where U.S. troops were told to leave."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And now as a result of these rules of engagement, now this madman, you know, cold-hearted brutal killer is on the loose, and we could have taken him out. That's a fact?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VELICOVICH",
      "utterance": "You see what ISIS has done today. At this time we were going after these guys before really anyone necessarily cared about them and we were talking out them constantly because we knew, a small group of people in our organization knew how bad these guys were. And so you saw what they did when they came back into Mosul and they took over."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Number one, thank you for all of your hard work, thank you for your dedication. It's sad that this happened. All of the rules of engagement, all of the guys that have been arrested protecting their platoons and put in jail in some cases, it's outrageous. Thanks for being with us. Appreciate you telling your story."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Time for the \"Question of the Day.\" This is really important. So the president knew back in August that Russia was trying to influence our elections. But you know what, he didn't tell anybody because he wanted Hillary to win. Should he go under oath? Does he owe you, the American people, an explanation why he did nothing? In other words, confront Russia meddling in our election, why didn't he do that? Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. That is all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. Remember this show, always fair, always balanced. We'll see you back here tomorrow night. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
