I asked for his letter of resignation, felt great about it. His nickname was \"Chaos,\" which I didn't like and changed it to \"Mad Dog.\" His primary strength was not military but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, battles to win, but he seldom brought home the bacon. I didn't like his leadership style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he's gone.\" Quickly, his former chief of staff, John Kelly, also a former general, said \"The president did not fire him. He did not ask for his resignation. The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused. Jim Mattis is an honorable man.\" Clearly has a lot of supporters, Mattis does, in both Capitol Hill and in the military. What's the fallout from all of this? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I'm not sure how much fallout there is at all. Mattis is clearly a better tactician than he is a politician, and of course his tactics were also in dispute when it came to how he was handling the situation in Syria and Iran. But thinking about the content of what he said, he was saying that Donald Trump is not unifying the country, and this was something that pleased a lot of people, who said yes, yes, Donald Trump isn't unifying the country. I think the problem is that the grounds for unity right now are being set by a mob that is demanding subservience to a very far leftwing position. Jonah said that 95 percent of the country opposes rioting. Unfortunately a poll came out and something like 17 percent of people think that rioting and looting can be justified, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's actually a dangerously high percentage. And there is a lot of support or refusal to condemn some of these positions. There is a political group named Black Lives Matter, and that political group has some very particular policy positions. One of them is that the police should be defunded nationwide. Probably 70 percent of the country at least does not agree with that policy position, and being told that they have to agree with that policy position or be called a racist, that is not a way to have unity.

Whenever you have a big political fallout, you have big political fallouts, and people are divided, and I think we all have to be careful with some of the rhetoric.

As we sit here today, his numbers are down. He's got five months. I do think presidents in the middle of a crisis, a real crisis like we are facing, instead of pointing to the issues and ideas that may excite their base, be it a group on the left or a group on the right, the president has got to rise above it. I think the president's real challenges, Bret, is that he seems to be more concerned about self and himself and how he looks holding a Bible upside down and turning it right side up in front of a church that he really didn't get permission to go in front of, the American people want something a little different.

NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" MAGAZINE: Violence is when an agent of the state kneels on a man's neck until all the life is leeched out of his body. Destroying property which can be replaced is not violence."

And some breaking news, literally just moments ago, a spokesman for \"The New York Times\" tweeted regrets for publishing that op-ed, apparently referring to the Tom Cotton piece, Senator Tom Cotton. This apology reads, \"We've examined to the peace and the process leading up to its publication. This review made clear that a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an op-ed that did not meet our standards. As a result, we are planning to examine both short-term and long-term changes to include expanding our fact-checking operation and reducing the number of op-eds we publish.\" Again, this is an op-ed from a Republican senator from Arkansas. That's not the only apology tonight. New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees is apologizing for saying he opposes kneeling during the National Anthem. Brees says his comments were, quote, \"insensitive and completely missed the mark.\" Brees was roundly criticized by other professional athletes after comments, and he was cursed by some protesters in New Orleans. Brees, by the way, was one of the biggest supporters of charities for communities hit hard by hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Next up, the panel on the memorial for George Floyd and disagreement within the Trump administration, plus the next steps against groups organizing violence. That's next."

Let's bring in our panel, former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., now currently the chairman of RX Saver, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" Harold, your thoughts on the memorial. The family obviously portrayed a picture of George Floyd from a personal point of view, but then at times it obviously got political as Reverend Al took over."

He was cheerful, he was loved, he was loved by his family, and like all of God's children, he was ordinary, he was flawed, and he was human. And he will have a big impact. Ordinary men and women often do, the ones that really make big impacts in life. He'll have a big impact on how we think about policing and how we think about the way prosperity is spread across the country. And there is no doubt it got a little political. Reverend Sharpton, who I have great respect and admiration for, reminded us that we are in a political moment. And all of that will play out here over the next several months. I do hope as people think about this, we find ways to try to rally the country and try to be more united. As much as we may be divided in the political decisions we make here over the next several months, what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong, and our country has always risen to that moment and risen to that occasion, and hopefully this is one of those moments again."

      "utterance": "Yes. There are times of the day when you feel like you're taking crazy pills. My sense is that in the Venn diagram of attitudes in the United States of the America, somewhere close to like 95 percent of Americans think looting, arson, rioting, mob violence are bad, and that protesting, even if you disagree with it, is an important right in this country. And I think that's something that a lot of people of people agree on. But we live in an age of shibboleths and speech codes where if you don't -- if you sound like you're referring to a protester as a rioter or a rioter as a protester, everyone gets triggered in all sorts of ludicrous ways. It makes it very difficult to navigate, when in reality I think the vast majority of Americans have a very commonsense attitude about all of this, which is that violence is bad. The violence that was done against George Floyd was worse than vandalizing some store, but that doesn't mean vandalizing some store is good or something that we should praise or just simply dismiss. And the lack of moral clarity in all of this rhetoric is maddening."

      "utterance": "Mollie, we talk about the former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, General Jim Mattis' comments, his letter that he wrote to \"The Atlantic.\" As predicted, the president responded today via Twitter saying \"Probably the only thing Barack Obama and I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world's most overrated general. I asked for his letter of resignation, felt great about it. His nickname was \"Chaos,\" which I didn't like and changed it to \"Mad Dog.\" His primary strength was not military but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, battles to win, but he seldom brought home the bacon. I didn't like his leadership style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he's gone.\" Quickly, his former chief of staff, John Kelly, also a former general, said \"The president did not fire him. He did not ask for his resignation. The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused. Jim Mattis is an honorable man.\" Clearly has a lot of supporters, Mattis does, in both Capitol Hill and in the military. What's the fallout from all of this? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I'm not sure how much fallout there is at all. Mattis is clearly a better tactician than he is a politician, and of course his tactics were also in dispute when it came to how he was handling the situation in Syria and Iran. But thinking about the content of what he said, he was saying that Donald Trump is not unifying the country, and this was something that pleased a lot of people, who said yes, yes, Donald Trump isn't unifying the country. I think the problem is that the grounds for unity right now are being set by a mob that is demanding subservience to a very far leftwing position. Jonah said that 95 percent of the country opposes rioting. Unfortunately a poll came out and something like 17 percent of people think that rioting and looting can be justified, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's actually a dangerously high percentage. And there is a lot of support or refusal to condemn some of these positions. There is a political group named Black Lives Matter, and that political group has some very particular policy positions. One of them is that the police should be defunded nationwide. Probably 70 percent of the country at least does not agree with that policy position, and being told that they have to agree with that policy position or be called a racist, that is not a way to have unity. And so we are seeing a lot of battle lines being drawn, and that can be a good thing even if it's difficult to go through."

      "utterance": "Look, I am African-American and I am not for defunding the police. I think it goes hand-in-hand, honest and good policing, with one to get rid of bad cops. Those four cops are bad cops that we saw in that video. But they're not representative of everyone. Whenever you have a big political fallout, you have big political fallouts, and people are divided, and I think we all have to be careful with some of the rhetoric. There's no doubt General Mattis' comments touched a nerve with a lot of Republicans, but so did Admiral Mullen, General Dempsey, Senator Murkowski, Senator Romney, and even Senator Scott to an extent has been a little critical of President Trump. As we sit here today, his numbers are down. He's got five months. I do think presidents in the middle of a crisis, a real crisis like we are facing, instead of pointing to the issues and ideas that may excite their base, be it a group on the left or a group on the right, the president has got to rise above it. I think the president's real challenges, Bret, is that he seems to be more concerned about self and himself and how he looks holding a Bible upside down and turning it right side up in front of a church that he really didn't get permission to go in front of, the American people want something a little different. And this is not to say he can't turn it around, but he's in a bind right now. We can use labels all we want, but at the end of the day the president has to bring the country together during moments of crisis, and I think we are lacking that right now."

This is the same newspaper that has run op-eds by a leader of the Taliban and by President Erdogan.

Some light in the darkness, peaceful protesters in Denver also held a moment of silence for Floyd as they held their cellphones in the air and lit up the sky for just under nine minutes. And finally, another kind of peaceful protest in New Jersey, demonstrators and police dancing to \"The Cupid Shuffle.\" A number of those protesters and police dance videos popped up all over the country today on social media.
