      "sentences": "Hey there, Bret. Good evening to you. And good evening to all of you, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story.” You know, there's a saying that you're entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts. And perhaps that is more true now than ever in America. In the past, Americans agreed to disagree, but there were moments in our history that were largely indisputable regardless of your political leanings. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The attack on Pearl Harbor meant the United States must enter World War II. The 9/11 attack required a firm response and American solidarity in the face of terrorism. So, now we know that there was an attempt by Russia mostly to sow discord in the 2016 elections. That's a heads up for our future elections, of course. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And thankfully, we know, thanks to a two-year investigation that no American aided them in that effort. But we also now know that just as being afraid or changing your lifestyle after 9/11 was seen as letting the terrorists win is not accepting the Mueller reports findings in a way letting the Russians win if their goal was to sow chaos in American politics. They seem to still be winning on that front. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Economist Paul Krugman who predicted the day after the election that the markets would \"never recover\" from Trump's win. Here's what happened by the way. As you can see, this guy did not fall. Now, says that the report confirmed that Republicans \"no longer believe in American values. And it's very much up in the air,\" he writes. \"Whether America as we know it will survive.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And he's not alone. Hillary Clinton writing tonight. \"The Mueller report isn't just about a reckoning of our recent history, it is a warning about the future. This is an urgent threat, unless he's held accountable, the president may show even more disregard for the laws of the land and the obligations of his office.\" Joining me tonight, Hogan Gidley, Dan Bongino, and Austan Goolsbee. We begin with Hogan Gidley, the deputy press secretary, live from Washington tonight. Hogan, good to have you with us tonight. So, you know, in that sense in terms of sowing discord in the country, we do feel as politically divided as ever even after this report. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Instead, the exact opposite has happened, and as you know, we have record low unemployment with African Americans, Hispanic American, Asian Americans, women. We are going gangbusters in this -- in this economy, and that's something that he failed to predict. In fact, he has been woefully inaccurate on so many predictions up to and including what would happen after this Muller report. Let's be honest. We've seen 2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, 500 warrants, 40 FBI agents, 19 attorneys, and a partridge in a pear tree. There is no collusion, no corruption, no obstruction, a complete and total exoneration, and we are moving forward despite what Mr. Krugman claims. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But what do you think -- you know, the White House should do in terms of communication to try to quell the discord?

But during the period that they're incarcerated, it's going to be like a complex issue because of the logistics. You got people that are incarcerated in states that they actually are not from. So, therefore, their vote will be technically consideration with their states count as well as the logistics. You have the Election Commission as well as to prison whether it's an alignment Department of Corrections or state facility or the Federal Bureau of Prisons all working together to make sure that this person has been registered to vote because where the candidates and their positions.

Only in Vermont and Maine is that true. So I think this is very normal to him and the rest of us are like this is a crazy idea. The idea that we're actually going to let this Tsarnaev, one of the Tsarnaev brothers vote on American issues when he attempted to kill -- actually, he did kill and injured hundreds of Americans is really crazy. And so I think that we have to open this discussion to a broader topic and I think that restoring the rights of those who have already served their time. As we've seen in Florida they have 1.4 million former felons that are now going to be allowed to vote.

      "utterance": "Hey there, Bret. Good evening to you. And good evening to all of you, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story.” You know, there's a saying that you're entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts. And perhaps that is more true now than ever in America. In the past, Americans agreed to disagree, but there were moments in our history that were largely indisputable regardless of your political leanings. The attack on Pearl Harbor meant the United States must enter World War II. The 9/11 attack required a firm response and American solidarity in the face of terrorism. So, now we know that there was an attempt by Russia mostly to sow discord in the 2016 elections. That's a heads up for our future elections, of course. And thankfully, we know, thanks to a two-year investigation that no American aided them in that effort. But we also now know that just as being afraid or changing your lifestyle after 9/11 was seen as letting the terrorists win is not accepting the Mueller reports findings in a way letting the Russians win if their goal was to sow chaos in American politics. They seem to still be winning on that front. Economist Paul Krugman who predicted the day after the election that the markets would \"never recover\" from Trump's win. Here's what happened by the way. As you can see, this guy did not fall. Now, says that the report confirmed that Republicans \"no longer believe in American values. And it's very much up in the air,\" he writes. \"Whether America as we know it will survive.\" And he's not alone. Hillary Clinton writing tonight. \"The Mueller report isn't just about a reckoning of our recent history, it is a warning about the future. This is an urgent threat, unless he's held accountable, the president may show even more disregard for the laws of the land and the obligations of his office.\" Joining me tonight, Hogan Gidley, Dan Bongino, and Austan Goolsbee. We begin with Hogan Gidley, the deputy press secretary, live from Washington tonight. Hogan, good to have you with us tonight. So, you know, in that sense in terms of sowing discord in the country, we do feel as politically divided as ever even after this report."

He is fawning over the Soviet Union and places like Venezuela. And he wants our economy to mimic that even though this president came in and bucked all of the predictions by people like Mr. Krugman himself. Who said we would irrevocably be damaged by President Trump's economic policies. Instead, the exact opposite has happened, and as you know, we have record low unemployment with African Americans, Hispanic American, Asian Americans, women. We are going gangbusters in this -- in this economy, and that's something that he failed to predict. In fact, he has been woefully inaccurate on so many predictions up to and including what would happen after this Muller report. Let's be honest. We've seen 2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, 500 warrants, 40 FBI agents, 19 attorneys, and a partridge in a pear tree. There is no collusion, no corruption, no obstruction, a complete and total exoneration, and we are moving forward despite what Mr. Krugman claims."

He also -- you know, we know that the report said that based on the available information, the investigation did not establish such coordination. But what do you think -- you know, the White House should do in terms of communication to try to quell the discord? Because what we're seeing so far is a lot of pushback to these subpoenas, pushback to everything that the other side is wanting to do to continue this discord.

It's still happened, right? Despite the findings of the Mueller report."

Listen, we've reached across the aisle, the president has had Democrat leadership, and the rank-and-file over to the White House to have conversations about how we move forward with things like infrastructure, things like immigration, health care. In the State of the Union, he said, you guys have a choice, we can move forward on getting some policy, accomplishments for the American people, bettering our country, or you guys can focus on investigations. They have done nothing in the first 100 days except push lies on to the American people with no proof and no evidence. And they wanted it to be true so badly that now they have nothing to say. And while I understand, the reason they cannot backtrack, they have to double-down is because then they would be admitting that the last two years of their life has been a complete and total a waste of time."

You know, did the criticism against the White House is that not recognizing the attempts that were made in terms of the hacking, and in terms of the -- you know, the Facebook purchases. And we heard Jared Kushner talking about that yesterday, you know, saying that really, in terms of the actual technical attempts, they were not really that significant. But are you concerned about future elections, and do you feel like the president looks at that as sort of some kind of acceptance that they were able to middle -- meddle in the elections as something that he doesn't want to talk about as Kirstjen Nielsen said?"

    {
      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, we -- that conversation never happened. Mick Mulvaney said it never happened. And the fact remains that while the Democrats continue to push this lie, we know a couple of things. One is that the Russians did not affect the outcome of this election, the president was elected freely and fairly. And we also understand that this happened under Barack Obama in 2014, he did nothing in that time. This administration has now done something that no other administration has done in history. We now work with state, local, and federal officials to share intelligence. We've brought in the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the FBI. We're already conducting at the local level breach tests. We're working on trying to hack into our own elections to see how we can better protect the American people and the vote. The Barack Obama administration did none of that. We are stopping it, it's unacceptable. This president has called out Russia from the get-go when other cut -- when other presidents like Barack Obama sat in the Oval Office and told Dmitry Medvedev that he'd be happy to work with him after the election was over. He'd have more flexibility, we've done the office."

And I said before the report came out that I hope that's what it would find because that would be a really awful day for this country."

Now, I hope that's not an accurate rendition. But it certainly seems like there are a lot of Republicans in the White House who are the ones describing his behavior that way.

I assure you, I would come up with negative information on you too. Austan, this is not a standard for criminal prosecution to put handcuffs on somebody. There's one more thing on this. You know it's fascinating, you know on July 5th, 2016 when James Comey laid out in his speech, a basically 20-minute diatribe against Hillary Clinton. That was all negative information too. And at the end, he says, \"Well, let's not prosecutor her.\" And Democrats clapped. And now, they get the Mueller report and some Democrats want to keep going.

So, he has very little credibility on the prediction front. But secondly, what rights of you lost? Why is democracy under threat? You have more of your money back under Trump, you have more economic liberty, you're not now forced to buy health care by the government, because they wiped out the individual mandate, and he hired an advocate for school choice as his education secretary.

Here now joining me tonight is Mr. Matthew Charles who is a former prison inmate. He was the first prisoner released under President Trumps criminal justice system reform law called the First Step Act. Mr. Charles, we've had you on before and it's nice to have you back again. Thank you very much for being here this evening, sir. You know, so I guess -- I want to get your reaction to this and your thoughts on this question of whether or not you know, rapists and the Boston bomber for example still in prison should be -- have the right to vote while they are still incarcerated."

But my thing is once a person has been completely released and they paid their debt to society, and they're back in society, actually functioning paying taxes, then they should have their rights restored to vote. But during the period that they're incarcerated, it's going to be like a complex issue because of the logistics. You got people that are incarcerated in states that they actually are not from. So, therefore, their vote will be technically consideration with their states count as well as the logistics. You have the Election Commission as well as to prison whether it's an alignment Department of Corrections or state facility or the Federal Bureau of Prisons all working together to make sure that this person has been registered to vote because where the candidates and their positions. So there's a lot of logistics that have to be worked out. But my thing is that restorative justice, means that once a person has paid their debt and has been released back into society, I fully believe that then they should also have the right to vote."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

That's the heart of this matter is whether or not someone should have to wait until they have paid their debt to society and they are released from prison or whether or not some of these hardened criminals that he was questioned about here should have the right while they are still in prison. And it sounds to me, and I don't -- are you saying that you think that while these hardened criminals are still in prison that they -- that they have not earned that right yet?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLES",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't necessarily want to say. I've not earned that right yet. I'm just speaking you know, from my perspective that I fully understand that once you go to prison, you do lose certain liberties while you are incarcerated. And I know at that time you know, even for people that are in jail, some states allow the people that are in jail to continue to vote because they haven't yet been convicted of a crime. So once a person is convicted of a crime, then there's a punishment that is sent forth and that punishment is contingent on the crime that they committed. So I don't understand logistically how it worked like I said you have to have all those different organizations working in concert with one another which is kind of difficult because even after a person has been released from prison, they still run into barriers just to get the certification of registration to vote once they're released. So while they're incarcerated, I really don't want to get in a perspective of separating certain individuals based on the crimes that they committed, but I truly understand why the public was you know, making the statement that they made."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, African Americans are not the only ones that are incarcerated right now so that's the first fact. I hate when people continue to correlate African-Americans with prison reform all the time. Here's the deal. This is why I think that Bernie Sanders sort of sees this idea of allowing inmates to vote. This is normal in the state of Vermont. In his state, incarcerated people are actually allowed to vote. Only in Vermont and Maine is that true. So I think this is very normal to him and the rest of us are like this is a crazy idea. The idea that we're actually going to let this Tsarnaev, one of the Tsarnaev brothers vote on American issues when he attempted to kill -- actually, he did kill and injured hundreds of Americans is really crazy. And so I think that we have to open this discussion to a broader topic and I think that restoring the rights of those who have already served their time. As we've seen in Florida they have 1.4 million former felons that are now going to be allowed to vote. So I could see the argument for maybe allowing those people that are incarcerated for low-level offenses being able to vote but not murderers, rapists, and certainly not domestic terrorist."

Everything you know, to the whole point of racial identity politics is to sort of divide voters into all these groups and then appeal to one group and you know, maybe not appeal to another group or whatever. It's nonsense. It's divisive and it's terrible for America. And so you know, what Karen Finney said is just sort of I think probably -- I think it's moronic but who knows, maybe that's exactly what Bernie Sanders is thinking because whatever it is that he's thinking it's absolutely nuts.

The court documents say RDC's own compliance department actually identified and red flagged a list of pharmacies that had no legitimate need for opioids and yet the company still distributed them tens of millions of dosages of Oxycodone and Fentanyl and other drugs. Look at the numbers. From 2012 to 2016, prosecutors say RDC flagged 8,300 potentially suspicious orders but only reported four of them. And in that time the company's sale of Oxycodone went from under five million tables to more than 42 million tablets. Fentanyl sales went from 63,000 dosages in 2012 to 1.3 million dosages in 2016.

The Dutch resistance relied on young people and children to -- because the Germans did not take them seriously. They didn't think children would be doing anything bad.

She delivered the resistance newspaper which was called (Inaudible) which was this little, just like a sort of a, napkin-sized piece of paper because paper was in such short supply. She delivered that. But most importantly, Audrey Hepburn danced. She was the most famous ballerina in Arnhem, the city in Holland. And after she could no longer perform because she refused to join the Nazi artists union, then she began to do underground performances where she would raise money for the people in hiding in the resistance by doing these ballet performances."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And you talk about how they would, you know, put paper over the windows so that they could perform in private and they would just collect what little money they could to support the resistance. These are beautiful stories. Just go back for a moment because earlier in the story both of her parents had some interaction with Hitler, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATZEN",
      "utterance": "That was the secret that Audrey took to the grave. The thing that she was most scared about was that it was going to come out that her mother had been pro-Nazi. Her mother had met Hitler in 1935. She was what I called a lipstick Nazi. It was all the rage, all the fashion for aristocratic society to be, you know, pro-German at that time. And so, her mother remained pro-German up to the beginning of the occupation into the occupation. And it got dicey then. It wasn't until one of Audrey's close relatives was executed by the Germans for no reason that Audrey's mother changed sides and joined the resistance as well."

This is a quote from one of her sons -- from her son, rather, excuse me, and it talks about how her family harbored an English pilot who was shot down over the Netherlands hiding him in the house and his presence brought the war home to Audrey in a way that a 15 -- you know, as a 15-year-old could -- only a 15-year-old could and it dug, they went into the archives in terms of documenting all this. Excuse me. But she says \"My mother told me that it was thrilling for her, it was risky, it was a stranger in uniform, a savior, and therefore a knight and hero,\" Robert."

As an example of how there are things more important than life itself. It's much more important to do the right thing and that was -- that was the story she used to illustrate that."

Many of us who were working during the day don't have the opportunity to listen to him on the radio. He's a real thinker, intelligent while spoken a true gentleman,\" she writes.
