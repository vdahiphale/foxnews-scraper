It's time to wake up, America. The death of Otto Warmbier broke just before we went to air yesterday. It hit me like a ton of bricks. Maybe because I have a son about the same age when poor Otto wandered innocently into North Korea on a travel junket, something my son might do, or maybe because I have a long memory. I remember that obviously staged North Korean press conference where Otto admitted to taking a poster from a hotel for which he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, again, a poster from a hotel. Now look at the video. Otto breaking down in fear of the fate he waited, doesn't take a UVA degree to see that this was a coerced confession, that young man right there was scared to death, possibly, probably, literally. But I also remember the shameless way the liberal left media treated poor Otto. Despicable -- ran this headline, check it out, this might be America's biggest idiot frat boy. That has been deleted but it got worse. Huffington Post made the incident about race and blamed Otto, they said, quote, North Korea proves your white male privilege is not universal. So according to the Huffington Post, Otto Warmbier was abducted by North Korean war criminals because he was white and the whole matter is his own fault. Huffington Post, you owe the Warmbier's an apology. But leave it failing liberal websites inserts race and white privilege to literally everything. Can we just please stop? Apparently we can't. Check out this tweet via website that claims to represent millennials, said, quote, watch whiteness work. He wasn't a kid or innocent. You can't go to another country and try to steal from them. Respect their laws. That was Affinity Magazine and they tweeted this after the news broke of Otto's demise, blaming poor Otto for the cruel and unusual punishment -- by the way that is lonesome, it's sub-human. But reasonable people on both sides of the political spectrum should see that as horrendous. Nobody deserves the fate of Otto Warmbier, nobody. And those who think it's cute, funny, or an opportunity to highlight social justice issues, maybe you should spend a few months in a North Korean prison, let us know how American life and liberty look to you then. Any takers in at Affinity, by the way? I doubt it. After a severe backlash, Affinity took down that asinine tweet. I'll bring Curtis Sliwa right away, what is going on with the left that they will insert white privilege into all their debates, all their dialogues? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We are \"The Fox News Specialists.\" Outrage over the death of Otto Warmbier is intensifying, the 22-year-old American student death just days after his release from North Korea with severe brain damage, now being called murder by top U.S. lawmakers. This afternoon, the White House responded to questions about whether the U.S. would retaliate against the rogue state."

      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's get right to this. Let's meet today's specialists. He's the CEO and founder of the Guardian Angels, he's the New York State Reform Party chairman, and he's the cohost of the Curtis and Eboni Show on 77WABC radio, and he specializes in rocking a red beret better than anyone we know, Curtis Sliwa is here. And he's the associate editor of the Spectator, he's the associate editor --director, I'm sorry, of the Henry Jackson Society, a U.K. foreign policy think tank, and he's the author of a new book, the strange death of Europe, immigration, identity, Islam, which is out today, and he specializes in being an Englishman in New York, Douglas Murray is also here. But I have a few more things to say about this. It's time to wake up, America. The death of Otto Warmbier broke just before we went to air yesterday. It hit me like a ton of bricks. Maybe because I have a son about the same age when poor Otto wandered innocently into North Korea on a travel junket, something my son might do, or maybe because I have a long memory. I remember that obviously staged North Korean press conference where Otto admitted to taking a poster from a hotel for which he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, again, a poster from a hotel. Now look at the video. Otto breaking down in fear of the fate he waited, doesn't take a UVA degree to see that this was a coerced confession, that young man right there was scared to death, possibly, probably, literally. But I also remember the shameless way the liberal left media treated poor Otto. Despicable -- ran this headline, check it out, this might be America's biggest idiot frat boy. That has been deleted but it got worse. Huffington Post made the incident about race and blamed Otto, they said, quote, North Korea proves your white male privilege is not universal. So according to the Huffington Post, Otto Warmbier was abducted by North Korean war criminals because he was white and the whole matter is his own fault. Huffington Post, you owe the Warmbier's an apology. But leave it failing liberal websites inserts race and white privilege to literally everything. Can we just please stop? Apparently we can't. Check out this tweet via website that claims to represent millennials, said, quote, watch whiteness work. He wasn't a kid or innocent. You can't go to another country and try to steal from them. Respect their laws. That was Affinity Magazine and they tweeted this after the news broke of Otto's demise, blaming poor Otto for the cruel and unusual punishment -- by the way that is lonesome, it's sub-human. But reasonable people on both sides of the political spectrum should see that as horrendous. Nobody deserves the fate of Otto Warmbier, nobody. And those who think it's cute, funny, or an opportunity to highlight social justice issues, maybe you should spend a few months in a North Korean prison, let us know how American life and liberty look to you then. Any takers in at Affinity, by the way? I doubt it. After a severe backlash, Affinity took down that asinine tweet. I'll bring Curtis Sliwa right away, what is going on with the left that they will insert white privilege into all their debates, all their dialogues?"

And yet, I'm looking at this and I'm saying, hey, Mr. President, how about putting on a travel ban to any American who is crazy enough to go behind the kimchi curtain of North Korea, and you know with the evil seed of Kim Jong-un mentally ill. That's where we need a travel ban. When Otto decided to go with everyone else, you're taking a risk. These are countries with totalitarian dictators. Kill their own people. Why wouldn't they kill a tourist or a visitor? And we're not prepared to go to was. I hope Eric you're not suggesting this is like weapons of mass destruction. This is like Gaddafi in Libya.

It had no sense of what the outside world believes or knows about it. The people have been brainwashed. When the regime does fall it will be -- you will need millions of psychiatrists to deal with the people in that country alone.

We can't wipe out everything, especially the way the terrain is. There's a lot of ways to hide things. And like you said, all those people there, there'd be a huge vacuum -- look what happened in Libya, see that in steroids in terms of a vacuum of power, even if we did take him out, people being able to come in and have the same terrorist type organizations there.

It's the same lack of empathy I've seen in the wake of the tragic death of Philando Castile, whatever you think happened, because people are so attached to their political ideologies, right, and they ran in their respective corners. And they get so caught up in their feelings around it that when innocent people die there is no room in their heart and in their emotional capacity for empathy. And I think that's very, very important because no matter -- you know, I wouldn't advise anyone to go to North Korea, obviously, but this young man is dead and it's unnecessary."

But incidentally, this comes after new calls from ISIS for revenge strikes following Sunday's London mosque attack that was carried out by a white British citizen. Douglas, your new book deals about these problems, so we will start with you. Specifically, I want to ask you this, many people use the phrase, divide and conquer, and it seems that this is an effort by these terror forces to divide the civilians, Muslim, anti-Muslim, and then be able to conquer, your take."

And then on Sunday night, when we had the news, the immediate instinct was, my God, it's another Islamist terrorist attacked, but then we discover it had this awful, dark, extra thing, which is -- this is the first really significant terrorist attack by a white British citizen against Muslims just coming out of a mosque."

Where trying to find an answer for problem that the politicians have given us. And they're looking around France, but it's not easy because they've given us this problem. And they don't want to admit it. One other thing that's worth pointing out, you know this guy on Sunday night, everyone from the media and everyone else will be crawling over his contacts. Was he part of a cell, was he ever involved with something that said go and kill Muslims, because if it's so, we will all come down on all of this like a ton of bricks. But you know what, the Manchester bomber, the other week, who bombed the Ariana Grande concert and killed 22 people, it turned out the local mosque was handing out anti-western literature. Nobody cared. Nobody wanted to look into it. We're really good and rightly so about looking at it when it's a white extremist doing something.

They don't want to be jihadist anymore. They don't understand the mind of a young man. Give a young man a gun, give him a weapon, and it's all like a symbol. And these fiery imams they let go into their mosques, and they subsidize these mosques, many of these governments of the European Union. They get up there on the bully pulpit on the day of prayer, -- on Friday, and they talk about violence and killing and doing jihad in Syria, and Libya, and the Middle East, and North Africa, and around the world.
