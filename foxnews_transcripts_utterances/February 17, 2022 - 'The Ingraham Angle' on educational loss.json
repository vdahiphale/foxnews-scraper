If there's one person other than Joe Biden himself, who's most responsible for the woes of today's Democrat party, it's this woman. Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. Now with a radical political ideology and a huge budget to advance it, she has more influence on what happens in our schools than any superintendent or school board member. AFT's massive donor base has translated into major political clout. Now whether we're talking woke curricula COVID mandate school closures, educational choice, Weingarten's views carry an enormous weight among Democrats. The three members of the San Francisco school board who were just recalled on Tuesday night cared more about satisfying Weingarten and the teachers' unions than the parents whose children they serve. Now, whenever overpaid educates work overtime to protect teachers and advanced the Leftist political agenda, the AFT is super happy. What's best for children is never their primary consideration. No matter how much Weingarten tried to argue to the contrary.",

      "sentences": "You heard her the masks down until there's no transmission in schools ever. That means zero COVID. That means mask forever. This woman is a menace. She couldn't get elected to pick up dog poop in San Francisco today. Now, during his campaign, Biden proudly promised to be a puppet for the teachers' union. And that's one promise he has kept. But if Biden continues to do that woman's bidding, he may find himself struggling even in liberal states. A new UC Berkeley poll found that Biden only has like 47 over 48 approval disapproval in California. And get this, Kamala Harris, she's had 38 percent approval in California, that's her home state, need I remind you. So, things are really dire for the Democrats here. The guy who's really in- charge though, you know who he is. His name's Ron Klain, Biden's Chief of Staff. He headed up to Capitol Hill today to reassure Democrats that the White House will seek bipartisan solutions going forward. Well, those are nice words, but we've heard him before. The Democrats need something all right. They need a clean break with the human wrecking ball, who smashed our schools to smithereens these past two years. But I'm not holding my breath. But now is the time for conservatives to make inroads in these states, states like California, New York, Illinois, where parents of all political stripes are - they're waking up. Kevin Robinson of San Francisco told the LA Times that he found himself nodding along in agreement was staunch Republicans, people on Fox, Right- wing news groups. We were the biggest district in the country that was the last to open up schools. We became a laughingstock of the world. How could this happen, he said. He's just one of many Democrats who suddenly found themselves voting with Republicans against school board members who just wouldn't listen. So, with all of this, I just refuse to believe that states like New York and California, the home states of Bill Buckley and Ronald Reagan are forever lost to the Left. These are fellow Americans, and we should do everything possible to help them. The Democrats policies have led to high crime and high prices, and they devastated our public schools. But because of our commitment to keeping the schools open, and parents in control, look what we did, we took back Virginia, we nearly unseated Phil Murphy in New Jersey, and we reclaimed school board seats all across the country, this is only the beginning. So, if Biden and Harris aren't popular in California, and they're not, then the Democrats are vulnerable everywhere. The longer the Democrats dance to Randi Weingarten's tune, the stronger our populist movement will become. And only by beating them in 2022 and 2024, can we finally put this nonsense behind us and return our kids back to schools, real schools that really teach that are not only open, but responsive to the will of the parents? And that's the angle. All right. Joining us now is Jennifer Sey, the former brand president of Levi's who famously left $1 million on the table over her values. Jennifer, good to have you on tonight. Now, you left San Francisco last year. So, you can't be surprised about what happened this week, with those three school board members being thrown out of office. But are you surprised that so many Democrats now are speaking openly even to members of the media about what finally broke them?",

I am surprised it was this decisive. I mean, it was 70, 30. So you know, that is surprising to me. And the reason it's surprising is, I was outspoken about school closures in San Francisco since March of 2020. And I certainly felt like I was in the significant minority. But what this says to me is that there was a silent majority of parents that were incredibly frustrated, outraged that schools were closed for seven months. And they showed up, and they voted in the special election to recall in a really, truly decisive manner. And I think this is causing people to rethink party alignment. For me, it's not about party, I'm going to vote for candidates that support the causes that I care about. I'm an independent now that I got to Colorado, I'm going to vote for the candidates.

And for hospitals, that's counterproductive because you had this nurses and doctors who worked on the COVID works in 2020. Many of them got sick, they were home and they recovered and they were back in the job.

I'm talking about Dr. Fauci and the White House coronavirus task for, Dr. Birx, who were so committed to the lockdowns as the only way to say people. And those lockdowns that they got, they failed. But meanwhile partly because there is this unhealthy financial relation between the universities and the NIH, they really cannot, they can't disagree. It would take a certain kind of character to disagree. Some of the universities get over $1 billion a year in NIH funding. Stanford gets over $500 million a year. And so that's a problem right there. But you have universities does more than just the financial aspect. There is a moral, really an ethical lapse going on university campuses. We have universities who are mandating vaccines and boosters for people who are extremely low risk. Healthy people under 20 have extraordinarily low risk for anything serious, yet they're being forced to take vaccines and boosters. And by the way, at my own university, they are still testing students twice a week who are asymptomatic when the CDC, the CDC itself in October, 2020, wrote it is unethical to force students to be tested if they don't want to be. There has a complete abrogation of the ethical structure that we trust universities with. Now beyond that, we see this big idea of stopping the debate. You mentioned it. When you stop the free exchange of ideas, you are literally doing the opposite of what we have universities for. That's the whole purpose of universities. And by the way, you cannot teach our children to think critically if they don't hear all the sides of their argument. There is no such thing as critical thinking without the free exchange of ideas. So by their censures, by their really petty op-ed pieces and smears and character assassinations, they've done so much harm.

If you want to clear the roads, clear the roads. You don't need this act to do that. But he wanted to do something more. And when you listen to him in the parliament this week, it was really shocking what he was telling other members, that if they support the truckers, they are supporting Nazis. There's obviously an effort here by Trudeau to ratchet up the tension. I'm not too sure why.",

If there's one person other than Joe Biden himself, who's most responsible for the woes of today's Democrat party, it's this woman. Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. Now with a radical political ideology and a huge budget to advance it, she has more influence on what happens in our schools than any superintendent or school board member. AFT's massive donor base has translated into major political clout. Now whether we're talking woke curricula COVID mandate school closures, educational choice, Weingarten's views carry an enormous weight among Democrats. The three members of the San Francisco school board who were just recalled on Tuesday night cared more about satisfying Weingarten and the teachers' unions than the parents whose children they serve. Now, whenever overpaid educates work overtime to protect teachers and advanced the Leftist political agenda, the AFT is super happy. What's best for children is never their primary consideration.

      "utterance": "You heard her the masks down until there's no transmission in schools ever. That means zero COVID. That means mask forever. This woman is a menace. She couldn't get elected to pick up dog poop in San Francisco today. Now, during his campaign, Biden proudly promised to be a puppet for the teachers' union. And that's one promise he has kept. But if Biden continues to do that woman's bidding, he may find himself struggling even in liberal states. A new UC Berkeley poll found that Biden only has like 47 over 48 approval disapproval in California. And get this, Kamala Harris, she's had 38 percent approval in California, that's her home state, need I remind you. So, things are really dire for the Democrats here. The guy who's really in- charge though, you know who he is. His name's Ron Klain, Biden's Chief of Staff. He headed up to Capitol Hill today to reassure Democrats that the White House will seek bipartisan solutions going forward. Well, those are nice words, but we've heard him before. The Democrats need something all right. They need a clean break with the human wrecking ball, who smashed our schools to smithereens these past two years. But I'm not holding my breath. But now is the time for conservatives to make inroads in these states, states like California, New York, Illinois, where parents of all political stripes are - they're waking up. Kevin Robinson of San Francisco told the LA Times that he found himself nodding along in agreement was staunch Republicans, people on Fox, Right- wing news groups. We were the biggest district in the country that was the last to open up schools. We became a laughingstock of the world. How could this happen, he said. He's just one of many Democrats who suddenly found themselves voting with Republicans against school board members who just wouldn't listen. So, with all of this, I just refuse to believe that states like New York and California, the home states of Bill Buckley and Ronald Reagan are forever lost to the Left. These are fellow Americans, and we should do everything possible to help them. The Democrats policies have led to high crime and high prices, and they devastated our public schools. But because of our commitment to keeping the schools open, and parents in control, look what we did, we took back Virginia, we nearly unseated Phil Murphy in New Jersey, and we reclaimed school board seats all across the country, this is only the beginning. So, if Biden and Harris aren't popular in California, and they're not, then the Democrats are vulnerable everywhere. The longer the Democrats dance to Randi Weingarten's tune, the stronger our populist movement will become. And only by beating them in 2022 and 2024, can we finally put this nonsense behind us and return our kids back to schools, real schools that really teach that are not only open, but responsive to the will of the parents? And that's the angle. All right. Joining us now is Jennifer Sey, the former brand president of Levi's who famously left $1 million on the table over her values. Jennifer, good to have you on tonight. Now, you left San Francisco last year. So, you can't be surprised about what happened this week, with those three school board members being thrown out of office. But are you surprised that so many Democrats now are speaking openly even to members of the media about what finally broke them?"

      "speaker": "JENNIFER SEY, LEFT SAN FRANCISCO OVER SCHOOL CLOSURES",
      "utterance": "Well, I will say I'm not surprised that the school board was recalled. It's a campaign that was started about a year ago. I know some of the folks that started it. I am surprised it was this decisive. I mean, it was 70, 30. So you know, that is surprising to me. And the reason it's surprising is, I was outspoken about school closures in San Francisco since March of 2020. And I certainly felt like I was in the significant minority. But what this says to me is that there was a silent majority of parents that were incredibly frustrated, outraged that schools were closed for seven months. And they showed up, and they voted in the special election to recall in a really, truly decisive manner. And I think this is causing people to rethink party alignment. For me, it's not about party, I'm going to vote for candidates that support the causes that I care about. I'm an independent now that I got to Colorado, I'm going to vote for the candidates. I'm not going to pledge loyalty to any particular party. I'm going to vote for candidates that connect with me and support the causes that matter to me."

But they didn't even talk about getting schools open until the last half hour, they'd spent hours and hours on renaming schools. OK, maybe valid, maybe not, but certainly not in the middle of a crisis when schools have been closed for six months, eight months, nine months, a year and kids are really suffering. So, they just so showed no urgency on the matter. And it's a true dereliction of duty. They're elected by the people of San Francisco. They are responsible for the children. And they are responsible to the families in San Francisco. But that is not who they answered to. They were answering to the teachers' unions."

And you saw this repeatedly that the sort of diversity equity inclusion, new curricula was being kind of shoehorned in during this period of remote learning and teachers at home and some teachers in, but that was a real opportunity I think a lot of activists thought they had, because everyone was so overwhelmed with the virus, we can do this other stuff. Do you find that to be the case?"

And I know a ton of people there still, I don't know, a single person that didn't vote to recall. And I will say this about teachers, I know a ton of teachers who were also pushing for open schools. So, I don't think it's a uniform bunch. I know a lot of teachers who saw the harms, but were afraid to speak out and go against what the position, the union was officially taken."

And the problem I have with that is being biracial. Listen, everybody in my family loves me. And they're white, black, everything, blonde, blue eyes, everything. And that's the story that this great country put together. The best social experiment in history is thriving, America is doing wonderful."

I'm talking about none other than Dr. Martin Kulldorff, who joins me now. Also with me is the aforementioned Dr. Scott Atlas, former White House COVID Adviser, author of A Plague Upon Our House. Now Dr. Kulldorff, you say we need to build up new scientific institutions because universities are failing us. You're a Nobel Prize recipient, just a few years back in chemistry, it's not just small, little small. Well, you - at least - that's what I thought you are, you're not. But why does this matter?"

      "utterance": "Well, science is important. Having trust in science and trust in medicine and trust in public health is important. So, university presidents and medical school deans deny natural immunity after having had COVID infection. That's amazing, because we've known for about natural immunity for two and a half thousand years since the Athenian plague in 430 BC. And to have a university president that doesn't trust natural immunity, that's like having a university president who is questioning whether the earth is flat or round. And even though they might not say anything about it, they fired people who had natural immunity instead of vaccines. And for hospitals, that's counterproductive because you had this nurses and doctors who worked on the COVID works in 2020. Many of them got sick, they were home and they recovered and they were back in the job. And then even though they have better immunity than any of the vaccinated people, they were fired by administrators who are working from home, who were vaccinated. And so, instead they should have been used at the geriatric wards where they are at high risk older patients because they're the least likely to transmit the virus to them."

      "utterance": "It's tough to say. I think there was a lot of misinformation brought forth really out of the leaders of the NIH. I'm talking about Dr. Fauci and the White House coronavirus task for, Dr. Birx, who were so committed to the lockdowns as the only way to say people. And those lockdowns that they got, they failed. But meanwhile partly because there is this unhealthy financial relation between the universities and the NIH, they really cannot, they can't disagree. It would take a certain kind of character to disagree. Some of the universities get over $1 billion a year in NIH funding. Stanford gets over $500 million a year. And so that's a problem right there. But you have universities does more than just the financial aspect. There is a moral, really an ethical lapse going on university campuses. We have universities who are mandating vaccines and boosters for people who are extremely low risk. Healthy people under 20 have extraordinarily low risk for anything serious, yet they're being forced to take vaccines and boosters. And by the way, at my own university, they are still testing students twice a week who are asymptomatic when the CDC, the CDC itself in October, 2020, wrote it is unethical to force students to be tested if they don't want to be. There has a complete abrogation of the ethical structure that we trust universities with. Now beyond that, we see this big idea of stopping the debate. You mentioned it. When you stop the free exchange of ideas, you are literally doing the opposite of what we have universities for. That's the whole purpose of universities. And by the way, you cannot teach our children to think critically if they don't hear all the sides of their argument. There is no such thing as critical thinking without the free exchange of ideas. So by their censures, by their really petty op-ed pieces and smears and character assassinations, they've done so much harm. And setting that as the model for our young children who are the next leaders of this country is very frightening to me."

If our schools aren't going to teach our kids in the right way and the way we want, we are going to switch our votes over to Republican. And I think the suburban parents are in play. I think education and what has happened here is going to be one of the major issues. But remember, we've got inflation, we've got crime, we've got the border, we've got international affairs.

If they see an erosion among suburban women, Hispanics, and even some among African American men, they have lost rural voters, it looks like altogether, John Tester saying that the other day, where does this leave the Democrats?"

You have got to reach independents and moderates. And to your point, Laura, the data that we have been seeing on independents and moderates, suburban voters, women, Hispanics, even African Americans, they look like they have been shifting rather dramatically away from the Democratic Party. It was a big part of their coalition in 2018, 2020. But without him in 2022, Democrats are going to take a beating in the House and the Senate, and then of course, 2024 will decide the presidency."

But in a way it already has. Remember last year we learned that Bank of America handed over financial data of 211 of its clients who had used credit card, debit card charges, done them in the days surrounding January 6th. Well, look, authorities often do request help from financial institutions when they have a specific suspect in mind. But casting such a wide net? That's unusual. Joining me now, Jonathan Turley, George Washington University law professor, FOX News contributor. Professor Turley, we understand that they are going to clear the trucks imminently, the Canadian police are set to do that in Canada. They have apparently had enough. But this freezing of crypto and bank accounts, what is happening?"
    },

      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it's chilling, and it is also unnecessary. They always have the power to clear roads. That is a basic power that is possessed by both the federal government and local governments. And this emergency powers act that they are using is supposed to be designed and most extreme possible circumstances and when those existing laws really are not sufficient. They are sufficient if they want to clear the roads, as they say. But they wanted to do something more. And it's ironic because Trudeau's father was the one for the first time used the War Measures Act, which was the predecessor to this act. He was the first time, I should say, to use in peace time. It had been used twice before in wartime. And he then used that act to effectively suspend the civil rights Canadians. Now, what the current Trudeau is doing is really quite alarming. That is, he's putting pressure and barriers on citizens in supporting these truckers. And that's an attack on free speech and association. And there is no reason for it. If you want to clear the roads, clear the roads. You don't need this act to do that. But he wanted to do something more. And when you listen to him in the parliament this week, it was really shocking what he was telling other members, that if they support the truckers, they are supporting Nazis. There's obviously an effort here by Trudeau to ratchet up the tension. I'm not too sure why."

And so, under emergency authorities, he didn't need emergency authorities, correct, to do that? Whether support the truckers or don't, they have the ability to do that if they're blocking roads, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Right, he did. This is an act of civil disobedience. It's used by plenty of groups, environmental groups, BLM. It is a very standard form of protest. And if you don't move, you can be arrested. It is the most basic of existing laws."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But when you freeze people's bank accounts for merely donating to the truckers -- could that ever happen here? The monitoring and stuff has happened here. We saw that after January 6th. But could we be facing something like this down the road if emergency powers are declared again? Really quickly."
    },

      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "I think we have to be worried. The level of support for Trudeau in the media and our own government is striking. But also, you just had one of these sites hacked and the names of donors released. You had GoFundMe freeze millions of dollars with the support of many in this country. All of that is an attack on core free-speech and associational rights. And yet there is barely a whimper from the media and people who would normally support civil liberties."
