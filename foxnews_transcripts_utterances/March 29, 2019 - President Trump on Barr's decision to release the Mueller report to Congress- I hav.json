The attorney general adding that the White House will not be reviewing the report before it's sent to Capitol Hill, and this is part is getting a lot of attention.

They're obviously concerned that there will be redactions with regards to material that is subject to the Grand Jury or anything that would hurt a third party that was on peripheral, and also anything that's intelligence- related?

And he said at that time he thought it would be, again, mid-April, which is what he confirmed in this letter today. But what's the news out of the letter for people who are looking at it as Trump critics, is that he said that people are overvaluing the earlier missive, which was simply said here's the bottom line in terms of conspiracy and obstruction. He says it was not intended to be an exhaustive report on what Mueller had found."

Bob Barr -- William Barr, I should say, has done a tremendous service to the president and his supporters because they've allowed them now to treat this as if it's a fait accompli. It's all done. We know what the bottom line is When in fact there may be tremendous amount of evidence -- there're maybe tremendous amount of testimony, although, again, we're not sure. We'll see grand jury testimony indicating that there was involvement. It just didn't rise to the level of indictment and prosecution. But that's, you know, a nuances at this point. But nonetheless, I think today is good news. I would say this to people on the left. I don't think that you should get excited and expect that, you know, you've got to dial back your expectations. I don't think it's going to be damning even in the full report.

You have the ability then to contact them throughout the campaign whether small dollar donations, getting people to volunteer, put up a sign, maybe make sure your neighbor gets to the voting booth because they only won Michigan by 11,000 votes.

And now that we have the numbers from Michigan, they said about 30 percent of these people at the rally were Democrats. And a massive amount of them were independents and a lot of them were also new voters who had never voted before. And so, they get their cell phones and then they can make those kinds of determinations and he actually said, they are harvesting a million new votes per week in each key swing state across the country. It's a phenomenal job that they're doing out there and they actually said, they're going to start expanding the maps of the Democrats aren't necessarily going to be playing defense in the Rust Belt. Brad was talking about having them play defense in states like Minnesota and New Mexico. So, I don't think the Democrats are even going to realize what hit them. And to be honest with you, they didn't even really deserve to win the midterms elections, because if you think about why Juan, they had the clout of the Russia hoax hanging over them. They had Republican members of the House retiring early. The base of the Democratic Party was all jacked up from impeachment because of the Russian hoax.

And he's absolutely right. Congress has not done their job and they have created so much more chaos and so many more uncertainties. And if you talk to individual members of Congress. Oh! Yes, well I really want to do something about it, but my colleagues they certainly don't, because they're lazy and they only work 12 days a year.

But the Democrats are lying about the border just as they were lying about the Russia hoax. We now have Jeh Johnson, who is the DHS Secretary under Barack Obama saying, it's a crisis. You had today on CNN, the Chief of the Customs and Border Patrol Deputy who's Hispanic say, it's an absolute crisis. They don't have the capacity. They don't have the manpower or the infrastructure. They can't handle it. Right now, they're projecting over 100,000 illegal entries this month alone that is over a 10-year high. And if Congress doesn't do anything about it, the President has to act."

And secondly, of course there are the laws that say that people coming from Central America as opposed to Mexico are to be treated differently, Dana.

That's what a compromise is going to be about. But I don't think the President is suggesting shutting down the border because he wants to. I think he very much does not want to. But I think that they're leaving him no choice, because the Homeland Security Secretary is pleading for help. She is saying, I cannot guarantee who is coming into this country. I need help. I don't know what else she can do to try to convince people that she has absolute has to have some help. Remember what happened with Angela Merkel saying, I'll take a million refugees here in Germany and then we all look at that and go wow that was - ultimately was a terrible decision.

Look you can't - Democrats liberals have to understand, you can't have a no fuss border and great government programs. You can't have them at the same time. Right.

They are making some creepy stuff at that place. And the thing is they don't return anybody's calls. So, I think Boston Dynamics could be evil and run by actual artificial intelligence.

Ms. Blouch has seven grandchildren, three great grandchildren live in a senior's community in Seattle and there she's taking up boxing. Now my dad trained boxer, so I grew up around fighters and I can tell you boxing is great exercise, strengthens your upper body, incredible aerobic exercise and of course for the elderly it improves your balance. Blouch says it also makes her brain stimulated. And it's not only the elderly whose strapping on gloves. Here in New York, models and actors that put boxing in position to challenge yoga as the fitness activity of choice. So, Bernice at 93 years young, kid you are a champ. Go for it, Bernice."
