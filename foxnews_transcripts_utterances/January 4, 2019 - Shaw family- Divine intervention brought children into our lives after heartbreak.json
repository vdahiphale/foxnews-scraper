And investigators say when some of those seals first tried to report Gallagher's misdeeds, he threatened to kill them. But Eddie Gallagher also has numerous supporters including top Iraqi military leaders who claim to be eyewitnesses saying the 15-year-old Isis fighter died from enemy gunshot wounds and that Eddie Gallagher and others healed medics were trying to save the boy so they could eventually interrogate him. And there are also accusations stating that the Navy SEALs who accused Gallagher of killing the boy were malcontents who Gallagher reprimanded for not wanting to engage in combat. Today in court a number of Eddie Gallagher's fellow seals spoke on his behalf saying they would trust him with their lives even under these allegations. Watch.",

It says with more women in the race you are less likely to become a caricature of ambition and more likely to have your qualities come to the fore and be examined. Here's another quote from it. \"It's going to allow a really serious conversation about the extent to which Americans are sexist.\" That one was from Jennifer Lalas (ph), a politics professor at the University of Virginia.

Obviously, the job's number was extremely strong. Then you've got that juxtaposed to this showdown over the shutdown. And then, you have this looming investigation that continues to go on. So, the question of impeachment against that backdrop, Governor Huckabee, let me start with you. Was greeted with some pretty strong language by one of the newest members of Congress.

But, but it's disturbing that someone would say that. It's profane, it's vulgar, it's unnecessary, and frankly, it's nonsense. First of all, a lot of Americans don't seem to understand that, they don't care she does either that impeachment isn't removal from office. And as long as the Republicans have 53 members in the Senate, it would take all of the Democrats in 20 Republicans to get to a supermajority in order to remove the president. So, this talk about impeachment is utter nonsense. I only quite frankly would hope that they would pursue it, and push it, and go all the way with it.

And he has surrounded himself -- the administration is filled with family members, associates, advisors, who are under investigation for a long list of influence peddling and money laundering. And I mean, the list is so long.

Democrats are playing games. My party is absolutely on the losing end of this issue. We have handled it ridiculously. Representative Bustos, today, in fact, said that she would be open, and the party would be open to a partial wall. So, let's just dispense with this ridiculousness about the wall and why would this government shutdown. And let me address secondly, this whole garbage of cursing, all right? Well, I'm not concerned about a Representative cursing. What I'm concerned about is the Democratic Party spending two years telling themselves in this country that there is evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia and there is not. So, what else do we expect? We have set the brush fire alive in this country that the president is guilty without evidence. That is the issue that your friend -- this -- the divided colleague -- the speaking just before me is avoiding when you asked her a tough question. There is no evidence, there are allegations. Let's wait until the evidence comes in. But let's not pretend the Democratic Party hasn't been lit on fire by all these ridiculous allegations that have yet to be proven, one shred of evidence."

I thought it was very interesting. You know, Nancy Pelosi was calling the wall immoral which just leaves me to wonder if she would -- and I mean this in a serious way. Does she believe that we should dismantle the existing parts of the fence and wall that, that are there now? Are those also immoral? Because they do attempt to block people from entering the country."

      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "That is the fairest question of all. Because if it's immoral, if it's really immoral issue to protect our borders, then we shouldn't have any protection, and the 650 miles that we currently have, the Democrats should introduce legislation that would dismantle it. And we also should call out the Pope for having a wall around the Vatican. We should call out every major institution including our prisons for having walls if they're really immoral. I think that's a ridiculous statement and it's an indefensible one. There's surely a way that we can bring this. I'd love to see us resolve DACA, get the border secure, this ought to be a bipartisan issue, it shouldn't be politicized, and it shouldn't be one of the things that it's thrown in, in this ridiculous discussion of impeachment because it's simply not going to happen. And I think American people are looking for people to lead, govern, and resolve issues. Not just to standoff in corners and scream at each other."

But Navy prosecutors paint a picture of highly trained fighter who during his eighth deployment went off the rails. A man used drugs, indiscriminately fired at Iraqi -civilians and fatally stabbed the captured Islamic State fighter who was thought to be about 15. Prosecutor say, Gallagher then took photos of himself holding a knife and the boy's body. Later, sending the picture to a fellow Navy SEAL, with the caption \"I got him with my hunting knife.\" More damning is the prosecutors built their case on the testimony of Gallagher's fellow Navy SEALs, a military Brotherhood like no other. And investigators say when some of those seals first tried to report Gallagher's misdeeds, he threatened to kill them. But Eddie Gallagher also has numerous supporters including top Iraqi military leaders who claim to be eyewitnesses saying the 15-year-old Isis fighter died from enemy gunshot wounds and that Eddie Gallagher and others healed medics were trying to save the boy so they could eventually interrogate him. And there are also accusations stating that the Navy SEALs who accused Gallagher of killing the boy were malcontents who Gallagher reprimanded for not wanting to engage in combat. Today in court a number of Eddie Gallagher's fellow seals spoke on his behalf saying they would trust him with their lives even under these allegations. Watch."

My brother reprimanded a couple guys in combat who buckled under his leadership because they were new and inexperienced and because they put men's lives in danger by not wanting to take the fight to the enemy. My brother called them out on this, he reprimanded them, and when they got back, only months later they spun up these stories. And so every allegation you just heard stems from a couple of malcontents who even admitted to tampering with my brother's rifle so that he couldn't fire at the enemy in combat. This is how reckless they were. And so this entire investigation, I want to make it clear, crystal-clear, is based upon lies. It's based upon the testimony of these malcontents who were so concerned about their own reputation that they spun stories to paint my brother as a villain so they could escape criticism."

There are nine that prosecutors claimed to be on their side but have actually just lawyered up and don't want to talk to them because they're afraid they're going to be gone after the same way my brother's then gone after. So you have to look at this case it's just an overzealous out-of-control prosecution that's trying to make a career out of taking down a Navy SEAL which should make every American's blood boil because of the premise. The premise of this thing is that my brother killed an already dying Isis fighter in combat. That's brass tacks. He denies all of it. We have mounds of evidence that exonerate him. And yet even in spite of all of this, prosecutors try against these nine guys and against other guys of Eddie's teammates to try and intimidate them. And by saying I'm going to go after your career, I'm going to end your Navy SEAL career if you don't start lying about Eddie Gallagher. And this is the kind of treatment that we've you know, experienced horrendously over the past four to five months."

Their official payday is not -- the period ends on Monday, they wouldn't get paid until next Friday. So if they resolve it between now and then, nobody will have missed a payment. Employees still on the job include more than 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers, 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents, and 42,000 Coast Guard employees. Those told not to report to work, 21,000 people at the Commerce Department, nearly all of NASA, 10,000 State Department employees, and 45,000 people who work at the IRS so maybe we'll get a little extra time on the taxes. Here to help separate fact from fiction, Chris Stirewalt Fox News Politics Editor. You know, Chris, I look through you know, some of the -- I mean obviously nobody wants anyone who lives paycheck to paycheck to be put in a dire situation. But just listening to politicians and looking at some of the examples that have crossed so far, it does not appear that anyone at least as of right now has entered that dire situation since the paycheck wouldn't even be here till next Friday."

Those things don't get rectified at the end and our government relies on a lot of contractors so there are some people who have not -- who in fact have missed paychecks. But for the bulk of these more than 800,000 workers that you're talking about, one week from today is D-day. That's when they miss a paycheck because they're on the -- I think the 22nd of December, they're on a long pay cycle and they're due next Friday. And for a lot of families, of course, that would be consequential. But you're right, to this point, this isn't missed paychecks for full-time government employees."

There's another story floating around out there about a death in Yosemite which is obviously tragic, a man fell and fell into a river and died of a head injury.

It's been a rocky December but a good start to the year. So in the jobs number, a trend that we have been seeing for months is the recovery is strongest among less educated workers who are now being hired in some jobs that they might not have been hired in, in the past. So why is that? What is all of these really signal underneath all of the noise? Joining me now is Kimberley Strassel, Wall Street Journal columnist and member of the editorial board.

This is a reminder that when it comes to growth, when it comes to the jobs, hiring, all of those numbers and indicators, they're fine. What's driving the stock market is uncertainty about things like trade, for instance what the Fed is going to do next, that's a legitimate concern. But if you're just looking at the U.S. economy, we're in great shape in part because of the tax cuts and deregulation."

It's kind of hard to see on this because it shows such a long period of time but if you look towards the very end of it, you see uptick and it's a 5.6% increase for the people without a high school education. The other two categories of education are also elevating over recent months but that group is elevating the most. Why do you think that is Kimberley?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a great but underreported aspect of the economic growth that we are seeing is that the deregulation in particular and the tax cuts have re-inspired the whole sectors of the economy. In particular, we're talking about places like manufacturing that do rely more on the low- skilled workers. I think it also doesn't get enough attention. This is an administration earlier this year or earlier last year, I should say, in 2018 was making a big push for more vocational education. Back in the summer, the President signed an overhaul of a career in technical education bill. All again designed, making sure that we're looking at those parts of the economy that too often get neglected. We spent so much time talking about college education which is important but it takes all type of workers to make an economy go. And what we have is a situation where the jobs are there and we have people who can fill them."

And again, we have a lot of focus, especially among our upper echelons in Washington and different parts of the society focused entirely on a college education. And what that forgets is that there are millions of jobs out there that are very well paying, that are trade-based, skills-based, vocational-based. And again, we are seeing an uptick in the areas that want those kind of jobs. Anytime by the way too Martha that an economy is growing, you're putting in more infrastructure, utilities, grid, if you need pipefitters, you need electricians, these are all well-paying good jobs and we're seeing a resurgence in that."

But you know, we took three at once, so that was quite a lot but like Allen said, we have had lots of support. Theresa Nealy was there with us side by side, helping us and teaching us, my mom, my church family members. I mean there has been a lot of people supporting us through this journey, so it's been -- it's been wonderful. So, I can't say it's hard -- hard at all but it has its challenges. But you know when we sit down at the end of the day and we see these beautiful kids in the floor rolling around with tons of energy with each other, we are like this is work but it's a beautiful work that god has called us to. And it's worth seeing them actually together. It's worth seeing them together and living a life, that they are just full of love and joy as well.

And I will say that as a mother of a 5-year-old boy, I was a little offended by that tweet that he did 10 years ago saying if he found his son playing with a dollhouse he would bang it over his head or something. That's not OK, I think we all agree that is not OK. But if he truly was remorseful at the time, why didn't he just come out and say, look, I apologize for it then and I'm going to apologize for it now.

He said I've done this over and over in the past, it was that I knew that if I took the stage on Oscar night it would be about Kevin Hart and it wouldn't be about the awardees. And I thought that was a really salient point. He said I -- this was on my bucket list, right at the top there. There are only four African-Americans who have come before me who have hosted the Oscars and this felt so important to me that I didn't want to possibly jeopardize this opportunity with bringing my own stuff to the forefront."

And I applaud Ellen DeGeneres for sitting down with them because I think the two things we're missing from society is forgiveness and also dialogue. And she allowed forgiveness to him and also had a dialogue with him. And she tweeted out I believe in forgiveness. I believe in second chances and what a novel concept.

When you get something in life, you know, I think of like Donte DiVincenzo, who is a Villanova basketball player, you look at Kyler Murray, the Heisman Trophy winner, someone who gets success is instantly open to this army of people who start trolling through things they tweeted a million years ago and say huh-uh, you're not going to succeed. I got something that can knock you down, that's wrong."

I mean we had people who were just for civil unions and now they are liberal icons like a Bernie Sanders for instance. And I believe in redemption and change and forgiveness. And the reason that it does apply here is because he did apologize."

      "utterance": "An evolution of your thought process. I mean we all are constantly evolving. I want to take look one other piece with you which was something that really caught my interest today. Why 2020 could be different for women? And it basically points out that there could be four women running for President. And let's pull up some of the quotes from this piece. It says with more women in the race you are less likely to become a caricature of ambition and more likely to have your qualities come to the fore and be examined. Here's another quote from it. \"It's going to allow a really serious conversation about the extent to which Americans are sexist.\" That one was from Jennifer Lalas (ph), a politics professor at the University of Virginia. The suggestion in this piece is well if four women run and don't -- none of them win, then that will be obvious that we live in a sexist nation."

And to say that the two of them are inauthentic and unlikable is not sexist, it is pointing out the obvious. And I find it ridiculous to try to apply sexism to pointing out what is simply obvious. Also, who cares if a woman runs or man runs, I would rather just have the best candidate. And I think the focus on gender is ridiculous. Isn't equality removing that and just nominating and voting (ph) for their best candidate?"
