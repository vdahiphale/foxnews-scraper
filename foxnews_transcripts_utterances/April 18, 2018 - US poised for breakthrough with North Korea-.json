How is it that Blumenthal, the senator from New Jersey, can say -- or Connecticut, that Pompeo has a disdain for diplomacy? When he spent his Easter weekend flying to North Korea to sit down and actually talk to Kim Jong-un, which I believe is diplomacy. The president also benefits from this being the beginning of his administration when this is happening. For example, Madeleine Albright when she went it was at the very end. Like, it was in the last -- they only had two months left. And President Clinton had a choice. He could work on Middle East peace or North Korea. He chose to Middle East peace. That deal fell apart. And later, tells Madeleine Albright, I wish I would have gone and done the North Korea deal. So, things happen. President to president. I feel like the Democrats are picking a fight that they do not want to have. I don't think they will win it. It is not sustainable to have this argument. The other thing about Senator Menendez being frustrated that Pompeo didn't tell them. He's saying, well, he wasn't forthcoming in his testimony. Well, yeah, because he had a secret meeting to go to North Korea, and he is the CIA director. They confirmed him a year ago. And to assume that he can't be CIA director -- he can't be state department head, but he can run the CIA in nine months is preposterous to me. I think that this is a really bad example for the United States to set for the world. You don't have to like Mike Pompeo, but you should confirm him and let him do his job.",

Now, before the media gets on their high horse and chides the president for weighing in, be aware that every single media mouthpiece is doing the very same thing. The sketch invites comparisons. And in a circus like this, a circus made more absurd every day by media and legal hysterics, it's just another mad attraction that challenges any decorum we have left. After Stormy shows up in court as a publicity gimmick and reveals the sketch on a morning gabfest usually reserved for discussing Kardashians' glutes, it's hard to take any of it seriously, especially as the president makes potentially historic progress with North Korea. So who's the guy in the sketch? Is it this guy or that guy or this guy?",

She's no stranger to going against the odds, because she is one of the first female fighter pilots in the United States of America, in our military. And a classmate of Shults described her as a true pioneer who outworked her male counterparts not only for herself but for all the women fighting for a chance.

He's very smart, but he gets along with people. So, I think that Mike will be in good shape. We'll see what happens. You know, a lot of people are predicting other things.

I think it's a wise choice. And it also shows the United States is willing to engage in diplomatic line of discourse to be able to solve complex geopolitical problems. This should be a positive for everybody, because he's saying, you know what, we're taking this seriously, we're putting focus and attention on it, we're being open-minded. We want to talk to them and work out something in a good way that is going to be beneficial, not just to the United States and North Korea, South Korea, China, but globally, the world at large.

How is it that Blumenthal, the senator from New Jersey, can say -- or Connecticut, that Pompeo has a disdain for diplomacy? When he spent his Easter weekend flying to North Korea to sit down and actually talk to Kim Jong-un, which I believe is diplomacy. The president also benefits from this being the beginning of his administration when this is happening. For example, Madeleine Albright when she went it was at the very end. Like, it was in the last -- they only had two months left. And President Clinton had a choice. He could work on Middle East peace or North Korea. He chose to Middle East peace. That deal fell apart. And later, tells Madeleine Albright, I wish I would have gone and done the North Korea deal. So, things happen. President to president. I feel like the Democrats are picking a fight that they do not want to have. I don't think they will win it. It is not sustainable to have this argument. The other thing about Senator Menendez being frustrated that Pompeo didn't tell them. He's saying, well, he wasn't forthcoming in his testimony. Well, yeah, because he had a secret meeting to go to North Korea, and he is the CIA director. They confirmed him a year ago. And to assume that he can't be CIA director -- he can't be state department head, but he can run the CIA in nine months is preposterous to me. I think that this is a really bad example for the United States to set for the world. You don't have to like Mike Pompeo, but you should confirm him and let him do his job."

And, by the way, I think it was a week ago or so, we're talking about how Comey, you know, said that he compared Trump to a mafia boss and the media was like, oh, this is terrible. I think we realized that a mafia boss beats a massage therapist. It's not a bad thing to have somebody who talks tough, who reset the table, and it comes down to a system that we have noticed -- Trump enters, he kind of throws the table over, says everything has changed now. He takes the hardest position, and you have to walk towards him. They understand that language.

Now, before the media gets on their high horse and chides the president for weighing in, be aware that every single media mouthpiece is doing the very same thing. The sketch invites comparisons. And in a circus like this, a circus made more absurd every day by media and legal hysterics, it's just another mad attraction that challenges any decorum we have left. After Stormy shows up in court as a publicity gimmick and reveals the sketch on a morning gabfest usually reserved for discussing Kardashians' glutes, it's hard to take any of it seriously, especially as the president makes potentially historic progress with North Korea.

Because the real sin here is that she overshared at the expense of her kids. She decided to sacrifice her kids' feelings for some fame. It gave me an idea for a website, called Fame Tokens. You reward it to people who attract attention for good things, and then you take them away for people seeking attention for bad things."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

It says, \"Every day is a victory.\" And on the other side, \"Full-court press on ALS.\" ALS is Lou Gehrig's disease. And I have a special guest here, my man Michael Hanricks (ph), over here in studio, who came up to visit and watch the show today. He's behind the organization that raises awareness for ALS. And also raises money for funding for medical research, as well. So I just want to give a special shout out to my man Mike, who's in studio today. Greg Gutfeld."

Go to FOXNewsPodcast.com. It's with King Buzzo the legend, the guy from the Melvins, who created grunge music, which he regrets. But this interview is amazing. We talk about Thomas Sowell. We talk about pop music. It's pretty awesome."

So I want to take a moment here to honor in the girl power Captain Tammie Jo Schults, who is a pilot and being hailed as a hero for the way she handled an emergency like none that she had ever encountered before. And you'll remember after the engine of the Southwest airplane failed and it torpedoed shrapnel through a window mid-flight. Captain Shults calmly steered the plane towards safety. She's no stranger to going against the odds, because she is one of the first female fighter pilots in the United States of America, in our military. And a classmate of Shults described her as a true pioneer who outworked her male counterparts not only for herself but for all the women fighting for a chance. So Captain Tammie Jo Schults, you are a true American hero, and you're an inspiration to all of us. Very cool story."

But you should know two other prominent people have also died: Radio broadcaster Carl Kasell and professional wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino. Kasell was a friend from my days at NPR. Every NPR listener knew his voice. A terrifically friendly, North Carolina-accented baritone. In fact, his voice became a prize for contest winners. They got Carl Kasell's voice on their greetings for their answering machine. Sammartino, the longest reigning world champion in pro wrestling history, was called the Italian Superman. He was an immigrant who had a 30-year wrestling career, sold out the Garden many times. Two men who made their mark on America. Rest in peace."

You might have heard that The Washington Post and The New York Times. But you might not have heard about the Press Democrat. It's a daily paper published in Santa Rosa, California. They got the Pulitzer for their coverage of the wildfires there. Adam Housley, who is a reporter here for FOX News, says that is an amazing paper. They do terrific work. They have a lot of clarity for their readers. And congratulations to them. Local papers are so important to communities."
