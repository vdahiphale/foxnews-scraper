A number of lawmakers are now pushing to unmask members of Congress who have secretly settled sexual harassment lawsuits on Capitol Hill. Good evening, everyone. I am Trish Regan in for Martha McCallum. The new push includes a ban on using taxpayer money to flip the bill for these lawsuits. A practice that one lawmaker calls \"subsidizing predatory behavior on the backs of the American people.\" All this as we are hearing for the first time from one of the women accusing in Democratic Congressman John Conyers of harassment. Melanie Sloan worked for Conyers as a House Judiciary Committee staffer in the late 1990s. In a new interview, Sloan details disturbing instances of verbal abuse and \"sexual discrimination\" and she makes this troubling claim about the culture in Washington. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Well, two more women came forward this week. They claim he touched them inappropriately during campaign events in 2007 and 2008 to which Senator Franken responded in part, \"I'm a warm person. I hug people. I have learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters I crossed the line for some women and I know that any number is too many. I feel terribly that I have made some women feel badly and for that, I am so sorry.\" He is now facing an ethics investigation on Capitol Hill. And so is Democratic Congressman John Conyers. He's denied that he sexually harassed a female aid leading to a reported five-figure payout funded by taxpayers. Well, the Congressional Office of Compliance says 17 million taxpayer dollars have been used to settle more than 200 claims over 20 years, though not all for sexual harassment. So now, pressure is mounting on Congressional leaders to release the names of lawmakers who have secretly settled sexual harassment claims at taxpayers' expense. Even President Trump said this week that he believes Congress should disclose those settlements. Republican Congressman Ron Desantis proposed a bill last week that would require the public disclosure of all sexual harassment settlements settlement. It would also ban Congress from footing the bill in the future. So there's a lot of momentum building to unmask any other sexual harassers and that's making some folks on Capitol Hill very nervous, Trish. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But -- so, you -- we see this as the kind of, of course, whether they waste our money or in this kind of a case protect themselves using it. But I do find it rather amusing that suddenly everyone in Congress or a few at least are really outraged about the fact that this has been going on. This has been going on since at least 1995. So they know that this is how-- it's been 20 years. What was suddenly wrong with paying -- using taxpayer money versus, you know, 10, 20 years ago when they knew it was happening? All of this though is I think is a little bit of foe outrage. Congress we know of course does not take its responsibility seriously. Let alone when it comes to their own misbehavior, it's always about pushing it off for ignoring it whether it's ethics committees.

I hug people. I have learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters I crossed the line for some women and I know that any number is too many. I feel terribly that I have made some women feel badly and for that, I am so sorry.\" He is now facing an ethics investigation on Capitol Hill. And so is Democratic Congressman John Conyers. He's denied that he sexually harassed a female aid leading to a reported five-figure payout funded by taxpayers. Well, the Congressional Office of Compliance says 17 million taxpayer dollars have been used to settle more than 200 claims over 20 years, though not all for sexual harassment. So now, pressure is mounting on Congressional leaders to release the names of lawmakers who have secretly settled sexual harassment claims at taxpayers' expense. Even President Trump said this week that he believes Congress should disclose those settlements. Republican Congressman Ron Desantis proposed a bill last week that would require the public disclosure of all sexual harassment settlements settlement. It would also ban Congress from footing the bill in the future. So there's a lot of momentum building to unmask any other sexual harassers and that's making some folks on Capitol Hill very nervous, Trish."

But -- so, you -- we see this as the kind of, of course, whether they waste our money or in this kind of a case protect themselves using it. But I do find it rather amusing that suddenly everyone in Congress or a few at least are really outraged about the fact that this has been going on. This has been going on since at least 1995. So they know that this is how-- it's been 20 years. What was suddenly wrong with paying -- using taxpayer money versus, you know, 10, 20 years ago when they knew it was happening? All of this though is I think is a little bit of foe outrage. Congress we know of course does not take its responsibility seriously. Let alone when it comes to their own misbehavior, it's always about pushing it off for ignoring it whether it's ethics committees. Things that will never really occur because they don't see themselves as being under the same umbrella of law and order and responsibility as the rest of us would."

But this is what's really important here. The chambers has continued to look at their harassment policy. And we as taxpayers should say we need to put in checks and balances in that harassment policy that speaks to issues like this.

You have a sense of integrity or -- and dignity. And you know how to treat women. That becomes the issue. Why is it and it is systemic. I agree with my sister here on the other side that this is a cultural dynamic. And you notice when there is unlimited power and money, like in Hollywood, like in journalism, and, of course, in Congress, it's interesting, isn't it? When you have billions of dollars and extraordinary power but it's also in other industries at different kinds of levels. But as a society, this conversation has to happen, so that other women know that you are not alone and so that men who have thought because it has been normal for so long that maybe this is just normal life.

In fact, he wants to convince everyone in Minnesota that he should be elected again, despite -- can we show the photo again? I mean, this is -- this is-- this is so disgusting what he did to a woman who is sound asleep. You see it there. I don't want to describe it. You see it. Wendy, why won't he back off now?

It's going back to this like, you know, elementary school behavior whereas like no, you do it, no, you do it. And quite frankly this is a bigger issue. This is about misconduct. This is about women. But let me say something here that's really important. Even though, you know, so far he's had some two women who have given back the money that he's helped them raised within their campaign, history has shown us that when men who are in these positions of power do something, it doesn't necessarily take their career. Bill Clinton had an approval rating between 34 and 62 percent before his impeachment proceedings. After the hearing, his approval rating went up to 74 percent. It was historical high. So, I mean, Al Franken is not just one person who's done this. We've seen this time and time again.

It sent that message over the last generation that this -- if you -- if you put out enough messages about the feminist agenda or women's rights, you can then do whatever you want effectively ruining individual women's lives in the name of the collective.

And he also made some international very important foreign policy phone calls from Mar-a-Lago at the Winter White House today. The most recent one 3:00 p.m., a phone call to the president of Egypt, where President Trump offered the United States' condolences and perhaps some strategy advice or talks regarding that deadly and massive terrorist attack today. The first call of the day around 9:00 a.m. went to Turkish president Erdogan. Turkish media says that conversation hit on three key points, recent and ongoing developments in Syria, bilateral ties between the two NATO members, and a summit in Russia's Sochi. Looking ahead to next week on Tuesday President Trump will -- for the very first time join the weekly GOP policy lunch. On the menu, big tax cuts and getting the Senate tax cut bill passed, which GOP leaders have said could happen next week. The tax cut plan crafted by Republican leaders and Trump calls for a big cuts to corporate taxes, potentially individuals as well. Shrink the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four and repeal inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar at stakes. Also on Tuesday as we reported the other day, President Trump will host the big four Congressional leadership at the White House. That is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. That meeting will also likely talk tax cuts. But the bigger topic for them will be avoiding a Federal government shutdown next month. At least a short-term budget extension is a must by December 8th. And White House is calling this a \"working vacation.\" So today President Trump did incorporate some of that vacation part that was playing a round of golf about 30 minutes north of here in Jupiter with Tiger Woods, also Dustin Johnson, the current number one golfer in the world and PGA pro-Brad Faxon.

But Trish, let's take a moment and compare with the last eight years where I think the morale was terrible. And folks were offended. Let's look at under President Obama constant talk of withdrawal from Iraq and actual withdrawal from Iraq and talk withdrawal from Afghanistan. Ignoring the genocide in Syria while Americans were being beheaded on international television. Trading the top five Taliban commanders in Guantanamo Bay for a deserter. You know, these things were not good for morale and what also wasn't good for morale was being micromanaged from Susan Rice's desk when they're out there trying to fight a war. So, you know, I think we couldn't see a bigger contrast now to the president of the United States and President Trump saying you're out there to win. I'm going to give you a strategy and the resources to win.

And instead, in the president's Afghanistan strategy now, it's we're going to stay until the job is done. And oh, by the way, we're taking our gloves off, you know, the military is taking the gloves off. So enemies, you better be on notice. Same thing with Iran. Same thing with North Korea, you know. And then, more broadly, he's accused of kind of being somewhat of a warmonger or exacerbating the situation. Diplomacy must have the credible threat of military force to work.

And thanksgiving is not necessarily wonderful for indigenous people in this country. So Colin Kaepernick lent his voice to this amazing cause in Alcatraz, and everyone is paying attention now. So he's become like the counter culture leader."

A lot of people are complaining, but not doing the actual work to make the country better. There's a loft things that I disagree with in the country. There's a lot of things I'm upset with Washington, and a lot of policy changes that I want to see happen. But I rolled my sleeves up and I'm thankful for God that I live in a place where I can have freedom of speech and go out there and do the work as well. It's not just about talking about the issues and the problem. I'm sure we can all identify with a lot of things that we don't like. But put in the work to do it."

And it is an opportunity for us to all remember how good we have it, and how lucky we are, and how thankful we should be. That said, going back to what the president said, about how the players have become the boss. Cathy, what's happened when something just a form of entertainment, and our national anthem is played and something that you should want to respect and honor."

And perhaps they are using it well as far as they're concerned, but I think the reality for those team owners and for the commissioner is that they've got a real problem on their hands and, you know, people aren't going to tune in. We're seeing that with the ratings."

Janel Ross' employers denying previous knowledge of her appearance telling the Washington Free Beacon, quote, the Washington Post policy discourages participation in any activity that could be perceive as partisan, saying she has been reminded of that. Cabot Phillips is the media director for campus reform. I'm sorry, the Washington Post, they pride themselves on being such a great journalist organization without biased reporters and, yet, you've got a reporter, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised, partaking in a very liberal event. What's going on, Cabot?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CABOT PHILIPPS, CAMPUS REFORM MEDIA DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "I think a lot of Americans feel as if it's time for the Washington Post to go ahead and register with the FEC as a Super PAC for the left, because they're doing what the American people have known they've been doing for some time now, which is using their position of power, using their privilege to not report the facts but to use their time and efforts to try to push this liberal leftist agenda throughout society, and people are getting fed up with it. And now, Ross, the reporter in question is coming out saying this isn't a big deal for me to be speaking at this event. Let's remember, the speaker list was kept a secret because she knew it was wrong for her to be at this event. Using her status as a reporter to try to rally leftist activists at a George Soros funded event. And let's remember the Washington Post slogan is democracy dies in darkness. I think the only thing dying in darkness right now is their readership rate because they continue to allow their reporters to do actions like this. This is a big problem for the Washington Post and the mainstream media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REAGAN",
      "utterance": "They did not know that she was doing this. She did not tell her employer that she was doing this. You know, how many -- I mean, when you look at the community of journalists, and I certainly know it well, why is it that they are so typically in the mainstream media beholden to the left? Why is it that their values are so much on the left as opposed to as they try to promise you down the middle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILLIPS",
      "utterance": "Well, we give the Washington Post credit for not knowing about this. Let's be honest. They created a culture where this type of thing is encouraged, where reporters know there will not be any ramifications for them going to events like this. If a reporter had gone to an event like this funded by the Koch brothers instead of George Soros, and they were rallying conservative activists on how to spread the conservative message, and how to get votes moving forward, which is what this event was for the left. They wouldn't have a job for a week. They would be fired. It's hypocrisy to the highest degree where these reporters know there is a double standard because many times the media is, A, funded by the left, and B, it's the media elites, it's the elites of society that are controlling the media and they're pushing an agenda now where they're not concerned with the facts."

But the bargains are still red hot this year. We have a live report for you next. Plus, Bernie Sanders is kind of bitter this Thanksgiving season. Why isn't he and Hillary just cannot let the 2016 and the election go. Brad Blakeman and Chuck Rocha, they're here. They're going to take it on next."

This year it seems like more shoppers are skipping the stores, opting for the ease of an online experience instead. I don't blame them. Matt Finn is live in Chicago tonight with that story. Hi, Matt."

You know, for years now, the trend has been people ditching the chaotic lines in department stores and staying home and shopping from the comfort of their home. But now more than ever, people are doing a large portion of their holiday shopping on cell phones. In fact, last year shoppers generate a whopping $1 billion in sales on their cell phones according to adobe analytics. And now, more than ever, it seems the traditional Black Friday shopping and brick and mortar stores may be a thing of the past. We talked to some shoppers today. Here is what they had to say."

It appears that almost every day there is something coming out of the White House that is embarrassing, that is destructive, that is horrific. Our job now is we enjoy this holiday with our family and our friends. It's not only to take on Trump's divisive actions, his desire to divide us up based on the color of our skin, or our sexual orientation, or where we were born, or our religion or whatever. Not only do we have to take him on, we have to do something else. And that is move this country forward."

Good to see you both. Brad, first over to you. Yeah, he's clearly not over it, but why should he be over it. You know, it's politically expedient for him to use this and try and present this president as divisive because that helps Bernie and that helps the Dems."

For Democrats, look, they can't get over the fact that Trump is the president. They're resistance. That's what they call themselves. And the fact of the matter is, capitalism is alive and well under Donald Trump. Donald Trump leads in the power of the individual. Bernie Sanders believes in the power of the public sector. It's two competing interests that are against at all odds the power of generating jobs and income, and Bernie can't stand it because we're not sending money for him to spend. So sorry, Bernie. And as we like to call him in the political realm here in Washington, especially Republicans, scrooge."

Trust me. Under a -- well, daring to say, a President Sanders. I mean, socialism -- it's been proven again and again, we don't need to get into that conversation, but it doesn't work. Capitalism does. And our economy is improving dramatically. Isn't that something to be thankful for, sir?"

      "utterance": "Well, you know, we created 11 million new jobs under Barack Obama and doubled the stock market, but weren't talking about that, that American wasn't great enough back then. Trish, you probably know I was a senior advisor for Bernie Sanders. Yesterday was thanksgiving. And if you got a new puppy, and you named it Donald J., or MAGA, he wasn't talking to you. He's talking to 68 percent of Americans who give this president an unfavorable rating. He's talking to 75 percent of Americans who are independent, saying here is some -- alternative person for you to think about because guess what? There is going to be another election in a year and a half. This is Bernie's job to be out there talking about holding our government accountable. This is where we're at Thanksgiving."

With that in mind, how serious should people be thinking about Bernie Sanders, and how seriously should they be thinking about him and sort of his shaping of the Democratic Party? Because I think the Democratic Party both with Hillary Clinton and with Bernie Sanders really took a big left turn away from its root."
    },

      "speaker": "ROCHA",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say this, getting to work for Bernie for 13 months and being on the road, I saw him energize a whole new group, a whole new generation of Americans who showed up, who wanted to get involved. In Texas, where we had 160,000 people sign up on our website, we found out that 38 percent of those people had never been involved in politics. That's why I do this job. I want to see more people letting their voice be heard and holding their government accountable."

    {
      "speaker": "REAGAN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLAKEMAN",
      "utterance": "Yeah. At the end of the day, Bernie Sanders is the Democrat. He ran as a Democrat. He used it. He was a wolf in sheep's clothing, and then he loses and what does he do? He turns back to being independent. If anything he's an irritant to Democrats. For Republicans it's the best thing ever that happened to us because right now the DNC is leaderless and their fundraising is in the tank. So more power to Bernie, get out there, the more you downgrade."
