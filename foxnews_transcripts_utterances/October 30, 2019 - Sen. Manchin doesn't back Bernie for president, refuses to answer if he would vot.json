However, if you have got a savings account or a C.D., you're not going to like this news. Your rate of return, no doubt already paltry, just got paltrier. And therein lies the rub of a Federal Reserve cutting interest rates yet again, the third time it has done so this year, and maybe, just maybe, the last time it does so this year and into next year. Hard to say. This much is not. Markets were sprinting ahead on this development, and the S&P 500 hitting an all-time high in the process. We're going to be speaking with Senator John Thune how this should be the story, he says, we're talking about, and not impeachment. First to our market pros, including Scott Martin, Danielle DiMartino Booth, and Jonas Max Ferris. Scott, it's always a split read on a cut in interest rates. If you're in debt, you love it. If you're trying to save, you don't. How's this going to spill out for the economy?"

They want to help this economy, but they also want to watch out for things like inflation, which is what low interest rates should propagate. So they're in a tough spot. And then, of course, they have got the political pressure too on the side of that. So what's interesting to me, you mentioned it in the jump there, three straight rate cuts in a row, after a Fed, mind you, that, last December, made a huge policy mistake and thought they were going to be raising rates most of this year. So it goes to show you, this is anybody's guess, but so far, so good. I think the Fed has made the right decision the last three times they have cut."

      "utterance": "Well, that's a good question, Neil. I mean, right now, the Fed is also conducting, effectively, quantitative easing. It's growing its balance sheet by $60 billion a month in treasury bills. So this is indeed a separate form of easing. But, to your point, the Fed doesn't have a lot in terms of further interest rates cuts that it can make. It has indicated that, if the data were to change, deteriorate, or not, that it would assess the situation and make changes as need be. But I would remind you that we're coming into an election year, Neil, and never in the history of the Fed have we seen, within seven months of an election, the Fed cutting rates because it doesn't want to be viewed as currying political favor."

But, Jonas, I'm wondering if the president will feel that this is enough to secure this economic recovery that has continued almost unabated now for the better part of a decade, and that nothing will endanger it before a year from now, when I think there's an election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONAS MAX FERRIS, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Probably not, because the Fed seemed to say they're not going to lower rates anymore unless things get really bad. So this was the three times and it's done, basically. And I think the president's going to think, you should cut a couple more times. He's going to say that anyway, whether it's true or not. It might be true, by the way. He was actually right about rates needing to go down in the first place when the Fed was back in raising-rates mode, and we had some issues in the market. The other point, the market, everything is pretty good right now. Nothing -- there's nothing spectacular going on in the GDP numbers that just came out. But inflation is muted. Everything the Fed says is great. The problem -- the only real fear is, what are they going to do when the recession comes? And what is the -- what's the government going to do, because we're also running deficits like it's a stimulus program? So there's not going to be another tax cut package and a Fed package. So that's the only -- the real downside. We're going to have to go into like a European zero percent rate thing mode. And that's -- that's where it would if we get a recession."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, that gets a little scary. Scott, I was reviewing a lot of just the economic news just today, the 1.9 percent third-quarter GDP, I mean, that -- we're running at a good clip, stronger than the consensus estimate there. We're also seeing private payrolls rocket up 125,000 latest month. That's 25,000 better than folks thought, strong consumer activity, strong earnings thus far, beating estimates handily, three out of the four that we have seen. That's a nice backdrop. What do you make of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARTIN",
      "utterance": "It's not bad. And I hate to kind of pull out the party punch here, but I will tell you what. If you look at those numbers, Neil, over the course of while the Fed has been cutting those last three times, that data is weakening. We're weak on payrolls. We're weak on wage growth. We're weaker on consumer and business sentiment even. So, if you're an alien, and you come down to Earth, as hopefully they may come for us all at some point here, as the Fed keeps kind of cutting the zero, because they're going to look at this and say, well, if the Fed is cutting rates, that's hurting economic data. And so Danielle's interesting point was about quantitative easing, or maybe even quantitative sneezing, as it is now, is, maybe that's making the economy a little sick and maybe needing more medicine, more medication, which is more rate cuts, which eventually go to zero, and then there's no bullets left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Danielle, what's interesting about this, through it all, the consumer has been remarkably strong, and not at all dissuaded by the reticence of corporate CEOs and CFOs, purchasing managers, who are being very conservative with their cash. When it comes to average shoppers planning for the upcoming holiday season, Katy bar the door. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIMARTINO BOOTH",
      "utterance": "Well, look, Neil, we do still -- somebody was tweeting earlier today -- and I said, look, credit card spending has slowed down appreciably. Wage growth has slowed down appreciably, but it's still growing. So consumers still sense that their paychecks are growing. And I don't think they have clued into what executives right now are pondering. And that is the slowing that they're seeing, the vestiges of the trade war beginning to filter through to the big gigantic services economy that is the U.S. economy. So I'm not so sure that, when you get the unemployment rate down at these low levels and executive confidence is tanking, that we don't necessarily have layoffs right around the corner. And we did indeed see weakening in this morning's ADP report."

And most people make decisions based upon how they're affected in their personal economy, those kitchen table issues that we always talk about. And I think part of it is, we need to talk more about it. This is a remarkable record. And it's built upon good tax policy, good regulatory policy, good energy policy. Those all affect and influence what's happening out there in terms of growth in the economy, job creation and wage levels, all of which are in a very positive place right now, largely as a result of efforts made by this president, working with this Congress."

I mean, I think they have done this in such a politicized way, highly partisan way. And I think most Americans have a basic sense and threshold of fair play, which the Democrats in the House have not met. And so now they're kind of trying after the fact to go back and say, well, gee, let's let the other side have some due process here. But the resolution they're going to vote on tomorrow doesn't do that. And they are a long ways afield of a process that represents anything that I think the American people would consider to be fair. And that's going to splash back on them. I think this is -- when it's been rigged, as this process has from the very beginning, and I think, largely, again, built upon a premise that the Democrats started with when President Trump was elected, and that that is they were on their -- they were already on their mission to impeach him, that that makes where we are today, I think, a very difficult position for them to defend. And, as we go forward, I think the American people are going to increasingly sour on what they see happening."

If it does happen that way, and it goes to the Senate, can you think of any of your Republican colleagues right now who go along?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "I think, because of the way the House has done this, and because, like I said, they sort of tried to orchestrate the outcome of this before they ever gave an opportunity for the president or his team or Republicans to be heard -- this has been a closed-door process, as you know, very much a secretive-type approach. And I think that is going to make it very, very difficult for them going forward. In the Senate, if it gets here -- and I hope that it doesn't -- I hope that the House will decide not to move forward with the articles of impeachment. But let's assume that they do. And if it does get over here, obviously, we have a responsibility, under the Constitution, to hear the argument. But I think the way that this case was constructed, the way that the House has gone about it is going to make it very, very difficult to see this as anything but a partisan play by Democrats in the House, who have always had in their hearts and minds a desire to try and impeach this president from the very first day that he took office."

They will have an opportunity to vote for the defense appropriations bill. But in light of what happened last weekend, a very successful takedown of a major terrorist figure and much of his operation, it would seem that you would want to support what our military is doing. They're keeping Americans safe. Democrats are standing in the way of that. They are obstructing it. They're making it very, very difficult for the American -- the men and women in uniform who defend our country not only to get a pay raise, which would be the biggest pay raise that they have had in a decade, but also to give them the tools, the weaponry, all the equipment and training they need to continue to keep our country safe."

Twitter's gone one step further. We're not going to bother at all, Twitter saying no political advertising on its venue. Now, of course, one of the biggest purveyors of Twitter is no less than president of the United States, no less. Any comments in that regard from Mr. Dorsey? In the meantime, very close call for the Reagan Presidential Library. This is -- I misstated.

And it is safe right now, thanks to an all-out attack by firefighters from the ground and in the air. The fire, as you can see here -- we're going to do a 360 for you -- was literally racing up these hillsides, until it got hammered by helicopters. You can see, as we go along this area here, you see some hand crews there. They basically put dirt around the edges to try to stop in the form of kind of a containment line. We're going to come over to this area. When I arrived, Neil, two hours ago, this hillside was ablaze, literally engulfed in flames, and then suddenly two air cranes came on top of us with these huge water drops and stopped it cold, literally. High winds basically driving these flames from one -- the point of origin about 6:00 a.m. this morning. We have got sustained winds over 40, 60 miles an hour. We have humidity under 10 percent. And last night, well, this could last, they say, until Thursday evening, several thousand under evacuation."

There's been no vote on the House of Representatives floor to authorize a formal inquiry. It's -- what is being done for an impeachment hearing is being done not by the Judiciary Committee, but by the Intelligence Committee. They're going to eventually have to somehow or another deflect it over to the Judiciary Committee, and we don't know how long that's going to take. But, yes, it looks like it's going to be not sooner, it's going to be later, which is not what they set out to do. Originally, they were talking about trying to get this thing done well in advance of Thanksgiving. They will be lucky to get it by Christmastime. And, yes, it's going to kick it over into the first of the year. And it's going to rivet our attention. But it's going to be hard for them to sort of hotdog like they have done in some of these hearings, when they go around and everybody gets five minutes to ask questions. It's going to be a little bit harder to do that when you have 100 members of the Senate and the Supreme Court chief justice presiding over what is constituted as a trial."

Whether the people like the president or not, the bottom line is, the facts have to be there to support whatever the articles are.

The stock advancing right now as well on better earnings, better revenue, and, when it came to just a services business, north of $100 billion. Think of that, a staggering sum for a company that just seems to print money and now even more -- after this."

It's not looking into sort of a formal vote to begin the impeachment process, but a way to at least advance a process. I think that's what they're doing. Maybe Republican Senator John Kennedy can help me out with this. Senator, what do you think? What are they doing? Are you supporting it?"

The new resolution, I interpret it -- well, I'm not sure what to make of it, except that I liken it to putting -- trying to put paint on rotten wood. Now, no fair-minded person with an intellect above a single-cell organism believes that, from the very beginning, these impeachment proceedings have been anything but rigged. I mean, does anybody really believe that Speaker Pelosi is impartial, or Chairman Schiff? Their judicial philosophy is clearly guilty. And there's no rule of law. There's no due process. And now, after a number of people, not just Republicans, American people said, hey, wait a minute. Whether you like President Trump or not, I thought we had due process and the rule of law in this country."

Now, Adam Schiff's not calling the shots. Nancy Pelosi is. If you took Speaker Pelosi and turned her upside-down and shook her, Adam Schiff would fall out of her pocket, bam, hit the floor. OK?

And it does seem like the middle of a political crisis, but there's an interesting book out talking to historians of their view of times where we had bigger crises, much bigger crises, and we got through them, each and every single time.

Sometimes, you need to step back, way, way back, and say, been there, done that, we got through that. David Rubenstein is out right now with a fascinating book. It's sort of a read at our story, \"The American Story: Conversations with Master Historians,\" their reflections on some key figures throughout history. David Rubenstein and I have something in common. We both worked -- I should say, I was an intern for Jimmy Carter. He was a bigwig during the Carter administration. I don't know what became of him since, but he runs this company called the Carlisle Group. He's a multibillionaire, yadda, yadda, yadda, does some stuff on Bloomberg, whatever.

And you spent a good deal of your fortune trying to preserve not only major areas, Monticello, and, of course, anything connected with our great past, but even documents. You have bought copies of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence. What's crazy about you, though, is, you don't keep them. You share them with the world. You have them on display. That's a problem."

If you don't know the past, you're not going to be able to be prepared for the future, in my view and the view of many others. It's sad to say, but, right now, three-quarters of Americans cannot name the three branches of government. And one-third of Americans cannot name even one branch of government."

That same test was given to native-born Americans recently, and only one state, Vermont, could a majority of citizens pass that test. We don't really teach civics anymore. We don't teach history."

So, for the last six years, I have -- once a month, when Congress is in session, I would interview a great historian about American history, Doris Kearns Goodwin, David McCullough, and then, in front of members of Congress, give them a sense of what these books are about. And then they ask questions. And it's a good way for members to bond with each other, because we ask them to sit with people from the opposite party, which they normally don't do."

      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "They're excellent. They're very good. And for any lover of history, I mean, they're very revealing. I had mistakenly said Bernstein when I was talking about Bob Woodward and your conversation with him and Richard Nixon. I only mention the context. His was a long, drawn-out impeachment process. Many say that Woodward and Bernstein made that possible."

And he had some fairly anti-Semitic comments, among other things. I don't think people realized that until those tapes came out. Now, why did he not destroy the tapes? I think many people think he wanted to use the tapes to write his memoirs."

    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Johnson had tapes. And Kennedy had tapes and so forth. So what I have tried to do in this book is simply this. I would like to write an American history book that covers some of the great figures in American history, but it's relatively easy to read. So there's a little summary of each of the interviews, but then a transcript of the interviews distilled a bit to make it easily understood. This is not an epic book on American history. There's a book out now by Jill Lepore called \"These Truths.\" It's a 900- page book on American history, a great textbook and a nonfiction book about American history. This isn't that. If you would like to read a couple hundred pages on American history from George Washington through Ronald Reagan, this is a good book to do that with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What I did notice -- and I'm making this leap, David -- you're probably not -- that the ones you interview, the historians you argue with, Chernow looking at Hamilton, Doris Kearns Goodwin looking at Lincoln, Isaacson, Ben Franklin, they were inspiring and intellectually stimulating individuals. And they grew -- Benjamin Franklin a different sense, not a president."

I think when you were going back to look at what he was when he was up for election in 1944, and he was barely holding onto his health and what have you, that's when you realized, that's dealing with pain and difficulty and hardship."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, he -- probably, he shouldn't have run for reelection, but he never really considered not running for reelection. He only lived a few months after he was sworn in. One of the questions that was very interesting is, the early people we talked about in this book, Washington, Madison, Jefferson, so forth, when our country was started, we only had three million Americans, three million, half-a-million slaves, and they weren't allowed to participate in government. And then you had 1.25 million women who couldn't participate in government. So out of 1.25 white male Christian individuals, you had George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, James Monroe, with only 1.25 million people."

    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",

    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "So I don't think you can tell. For example, if there is an impeachment and a conviction, which doesn't seem to be the case, it'd be -- go one way. If there's no impeachment, it would go another way, or an impeachment and no conviction. So we don't know what all the facts are. And most presidents..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it doesn't depend on whether he gets a second term or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "That's correct. Most presidents are measured by whether they got reelected. Three presidents in recent history didn't get reelected, Gerald Ford, George Herbert Walker Bush, and Jimmy Carter. And so they're considered less successful because they didn't get reelected. If you get reelected, and your second term isn't so great, you're still considered reasonably successful. So, I think, to some extent, his record in history will be whether he gets reelected or not."

You mentioned -- I don't know whether it was the MLK historian or the JFK historian, Reeves, or what have you, but on his famous speech in the Washington Mall, and how John Kennedy -- I didn't realize this -- didn't want to go to it. And -- but he was so impressed by Martin Luther King later that he wanted to have an audience with him. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "I was inspired to go into public service by John Kennedy, his famous inaugural address. But when you go back and look at the facts, the facts were that John Kennedy didn't want the March on Washington. He thought it would lead to violence. And maybe he had a good reason of thinking that. So, also, the Justice Department controlled the microphone, and they were prepared to cut the microphone off if people said something that was too violent."

He had a speechwriter, but when he was giving the speech, Mahalia Jackson was behind him and said, \"Martin, remember the dream, the dream, the dream.\" And then he got rid of the speech, the prepared speech, and he gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech, which had given many times before. Whites had never heard it. Blacks had heard it, and they were mesmerized by it. And then, when he went to the White House afterwards, John Kennedy greeted him by saying, \"I have a dream.\""
