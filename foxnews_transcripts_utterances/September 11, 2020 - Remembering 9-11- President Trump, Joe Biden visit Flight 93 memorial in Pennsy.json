America remembering 19 years since the September 11th attacked and the nearly 3,000 lives lost. Somber memorials held at the Pentagon and in New York City where Joe Biden and Mike Pence cross paths in a rare face-to-face meeting while attending the ceremony there. And President Trump and Joe Biden taking a pause in campaigning to pay tribute to the flight 93 heroes in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Passengers and crew on board try to take back control of the plane from hijackers and save countless lives by giving their own. President Trump remembering them earlier."

Our sacred task, our righteous duty and our solemn pledge is to carry forward the noble legacy of the brave souls who gave their lives for us 19 years ago."

      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, you know, they went, they didn't go down without a fight and you know, I can't really think about that experience without getting emotional about it. All of us, I think, were -- I was in New York when this happened. And it creates a context for your problems whatever problems you had that day or that month. They kind of evaporate. If you had a fight with your spouse or you had disagreements with coworkers, these things just kind of disappear because of this abject horror puts everything in a weird kind of order a priority. The words don't matter. It's the deeds. We've said never forget and we haven't forgotten the dead. But we have forgotten the role of the living, we've forgotten the role of the living first responder, the first responders defined by getting there first. They get their first, so you don't have to. And when they get there, they never know what they are going to get whether it's a terror attack or a bank robbery, or a domestic abuse call. They never what's going to happen. They could end up dead, they can end up heroes, they could end up vilified by mistake. So, in the short time, it saddens me that we've gone it's 19 years from reverence and respect to demonization and maybe that's just what happens with time. But we said we wouldn't forget but we have. We've forgotten something really important and it's tragic."
    },

And they gave everybody a chance to, you know, have their say. And then they called loved ones before they try to rush the cockpit. And you know, their intention was to try to basically get the hostage takers out of the cockpit and try to land the plane. Of course, we know that's not what happened. But their intention was to try to live that day and they voted to try to basically take over the plane that had a very little chance of them succeeding."

Those are beautiful words and I think we'll always remember that. I try not to think a lot about the pain and suffering that people felt on 9/11, the people jumping out of the towers to avoid suffocating or to avoid burning up in the flames. I try to think about some of the positive moments and I really saw a positive moment today when Mike Pence and Joe Biden touch elbows like that when they were there in Shanksville. I think always about George Bush's first pitch at Yankee Stadium. I watch that twice when I woke up this morning. You think about w and the rubble standing there warning everybody we're about to come vengeance and justice. You know, we think about we did in Afghanistan, you know, we missed them in Tora Bora but years later Barack Obama and the SEALS took him out. And that was a great moment of unity for the country. I remember being a producer here during the Iraq war and watching the video of the Iraqis topple the statue of Saddam Hussein. The feeling that we saw when that rope was wrapped around Saddam Hussein's neck before he was hung. Those were very powerful moments. A lot of the times as you guys have already mentioned people try to politicize it. You hear about the comparison between COVID and the 9/11 death count. I dismissed that. I don't even think about that. I try to cherish these fleeting moments that we have as a country. Those weeks or months after 9/11, you know. That month after COVID really hit hard in late March and early April. You know, those moments when there's a natural disaster in the hurricane in Texas when everybody comes together. Those are -- those are few and far between but if you cherish those moments and think about the heroes, I think that's -- that's enough for us to sustain that fire within us. That lights this beacon on a hill."

And in fact, because the -- all the people of the U.S. came together, we came out of a recession in November of that year because we collectively lifted up not just one another and the nation, but the economy as well. I think today, of course, about the families who grieve deeply and daily because they lost loved ones on 9/11, I also think about the survivors. A colleague of ours told me this morning they are a very close friend of his survived the collapse of the towers but lost all of her colleagues.

In fact, I feel very real to me on this 19th year and you can't separate it in my mind from the fact that we are going through very difficult waters right now in America in terms of the pandemic. In terms of the economic upheaval, in terms of, you know, trying to come to terms with some of the race -- racial tensions in the society. So, I think there's -- you know, we are very vulnerable right now and I think the memory of that tragic today is just searing and it just -- it feels reopen to me, very real at this moment, very close. You talk about Washington, I mean, that was so scary. I mean, just, you know, where are your kids in that moment. You know, the cell phones went down. Are the kids OK and you get them from school? All that, your spouse, your friends, you know, it's just like, you feel like what is going on? Are we OK? And there were so many rumors, you know, the State Department is under attack, the capital is next, more planes are coming. And the bravery than that we learned about in terms of Shanksville pretty amazing. And you know, I, too, was touched by the idea of so many politicians today getting out and going to those places.

You know how many manufacturing jobs we've lost since Biden backed NAFTA? Four point eight million manufacturing jobs, Juan, since Biden backed NAFTA. Also, under Obama and Biden, the U.S. offshore to 1.3 million manufacturing jobs. We can go toe-to-toe on manufacturing and factories all day, Williams. I'm not here to talk about that. He was right when he said that the USMCA is better than NAFTA. NAFTA, we get, the textile industry got shredded, all the low and automobile manufacturing jobs totally wiped out. We got the supply chains totally scrambled. Trump came in and re-condensed the supply chain here in America. Has more high-end industrial jobs here now because of the USMCA.

People care about the fact that wages for the lowest skill workers in this country before the pandemic were rising at fastest pace in 20 years, rank- and-file workers were making more money, their wages going up faster than their bosses closing the income and inequality gap. Something that did not happen under Obama and Biden. And I just want to know, the Democrats literally because orange man bad, Trump bad, everything that he would say even one year ago, they would do the exact opposite. Illegal immigration, we need to crack down on it, the Democrats came out and said hey, we need to have health -- government healthcare for all illegals every single one of them on that debate stage raise their hands about that. Now why all of a sudden is Joe Biden saying, yes, USMCA is better than the NAFTA. Why is -- this is the Wall Street Journal's front page. Biden's new China policy looks a lot like Trump's. That's because the swing voters and the people who have jobs in this country were not gobbling up the garbage salad that the Biden campaign has been dishing up for the last several months."

I do -- I do know that a lot of people will say that the middle class actually did benefit from the tax cut. And what's interesting is that, Schumer and Pelosi actually want to alleviate taxes on the rich. That's an interesting conundrum that they have. In addition to USMCA, there's a ticket splitting here between Biden and Kamala Harris because she actually voted against USMCA so they're not on the same page on that which is, which is fine. But it does make people wonder if you have Biden as the president and she's the vice presidents, and her policies -- would they be completely different than his? Would they be much further to the left? That is something to keep in mind.

They need to work on -- I made a list of things. They need to work on him not using catchphrases. Like, come on man. And his latest is I truly don't get it. Also, he needs to avoid eye tics and twitches. I didn't get that from Veep. You need lots of sleep, not too much caffeine. I had one for a while and it was really, really distracting and awful. And then also, I've said this before, Joe Biden, don't lock your knees out because you will go over like a hungover bridesmaid at an Atlanta wedding in the middle of July."

      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "utterance": "A major warning to liberal cities struggling to deal with anarchy and chaos across the country. Business leaders in New York City are saying enough is enough and demanding a crackdown on crime and improving the quality of life so people will return. More than 150 CEOs sent Mayor Bill de Blasio a letter demanding action to clean up the city. So, is this what needs to be done to get the attention of liberal leaders? Greg, I say talk means nothing. It's only when the money walks. Maybe this is a warning."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think -- I think De Blasio has checked out. He doesn't care. I don't know what he's planning on doing. Don't you remember when he ran for president? He's insane. The denialist who say that there's nothing bad happening, don't live where it's happening. Every day I talked to somebody who's packed up and left. It's not safe, especially for women and children. It's almost like a reverse lottery in New York. You never know when you're going to be the person that gets hit by a mentally ill male because that is a big problem right now. We have severely drug abused, mentally ill man on the street roaming around committing just bizarre random crimes. Meanwhile, we have rich trust fund brats who are planning to occupy vacant luxury apartments in which they were planning on dropping bricks on people from above. The DOJ has got to get on top of this, especially as I said yesterday. And November is going to be really ugly because you're going to have a combination of Election Day uncertainty that could go for weeks. You have the negative polarization of an entire voting bloc that's been demonized. And you have the abdication of local leadership. You combine that together; you have the ultimate bonfire of the vanities. And you can laugh and say that I'm being hysterical, but I saw it with my own eyes. It happened in my neighborhood. It's going to happen again. And the businessmen and the people that are live in these neighborhoods, we have to get together because the government is not going to protect us. We have to do it ourselves."

Because as Greg said, it feels like De Blasio is like, I don't care. He's checked out. He's being called the worst mayor in the city. But Governor Cuomo, do you remember during the pandemic when he threatened to take over New York City? And we talked about it just a little bit, but I sort of feel like I think Governor Cuomo does care about the city. I think he will listen to businesses. And I think if there -- if we want to put pressure on anybody to make a difference, that that's where the pressure should be, at the governor's office."

The other day there is an attempted rape in broad daylight on 63rd and Lexington. That's outside Bloomingdale's, everybody. There was an armed robbery on 65th and Lexington the other day. On the upper west side, you have vagrants shooting dope in front of moms pushing strollers. There's windows smashed throughout Midtown at really nice stores. I mean, there's counterfeiters everywhere trying to sell me handbags, and they're very good deals. And I'm being forced to buy really great looking knockoff bags.

It comes from people in the retail business, you know, the smaller retail stores because they want their customers back. They want people used to come into the city for those services. I think Broadway wants its customers back. And I think that's why you're seeing, they're saying, let's make things look better. Let's improve the quality on the streets. That goes for Democratic cities. That goes for republican cities. It's not liberal cities. Go look at Lexington. Go look at Miami. These cities have trouble too.
