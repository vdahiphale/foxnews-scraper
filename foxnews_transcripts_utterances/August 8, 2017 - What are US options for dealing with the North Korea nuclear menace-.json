They aren't just presenters of news but curators manipulating the significance of a story by controlling its exposure. The fact is, everyone played down the tarmac story in order to help Hillary. The good news? It didn't work. Dana, a clear example of media bias. Am I right?",

      "speaker": "GENERAL JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST",

Kim Jong-un has departed from his grandfather and his father, who wanted nuclear weapons as you've suggested to preserve the regime. But Kim Jong-un has come to a different calculation. Therefore, his strategy is different. He believes that the only way to preserve the regime -- there's only one country that would change the regime out. That is the United States. And he believes the only way to stop the United States from doing that and he's paranoid about the United States -- is that you have to hold the American people at risk. And that is why we have this accelerated program of ballistic missile development and intercontinental ballistic missiles that have the capability to deliver a nuclear warhead. And furthermore, he strategizes this way, that once he achieves that capability -- in his mind -- the United States will acquiesce and accept that capability much as the United States accepted the development of nuclear weapons ten years ago and much as the United States 40 years ago except to China developing intercontinental ballistic missiles over our proto-stations. And they developed the atomic bombs. That's where they are coming from. And they believe they need that ability to checkmate the United States in terms of the military adventurism. And number two, they believe eventually we're going to accept the capability."

      "utterance": "You know, clearly what he's talking about is the military option. And the President and his team deserve credit since the inauguration, of putting the military option back on the table in a credible way that the Obama administration never had on the table. Nobody in the regime believed that President Obama had that military option on the table even though he talked about it early on in his administration. I think when the President is going to talk about the potential response to the United States, I believe the words that he used should be measured and very clear about what he's talking about. This leads to misinterpretation, what he said. Because implied in his statement is that based on their threats, and that could be verbal threats, we would go to nuclear war. And we know we are not going to do that. Therefore, the statement is incredible. But what's credible is that military option is back on the table. North Korea's response to that, about hitting Guam with missiles is sabre-rattling. They are not going to do that. Because that would absolutely destroy North Korea as a country, as an entity. And the Chinese would not let that happen either. And it's unfortunate this rhetoric is going back -- I think we should stay out of the rhetoric business with North Korea and stay measured in terms of what our response is."

And I am wondering if this is just another way of President Trump negotiating from a very powerful point of view. One that they understand, using words like -- but are easily translatable -- like fire and fury. But it might, I want to go back to what Dana said in the beginning that if they strike first, it's completely over for them. So, if we do nothing, theoretically, nothing happens. Am I right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "That certainly -- that's the equation that people want to believe. The problem we have is because of the kind of regime that North Korea has, we cannot treat North Korea the way we treat other great power competitions. Namely the Soviet Union in the past and now Russia and also China, who possess significant amount of nuclearize ICBMs. Because of the erratic nature of the North Korean regime, we don't believe and I don't know anybody that does except people on the far left, that you can use mutually assured destruction as the deterrence for North Korea ever using those weapons against the United States. We don't believe that. So, what we want to happen is that they don't get the capability and that's the path we are heading on. And the path to them not having this capability, nuclear rise ICBMs. It has already one path, and that is China. And we are on that path but we are not close to getting where we need to be. We are on a collision course with China. You are going to see us get really tough with China because I don't think China will behave necessarily in a way that Ambassador Haley wants them to behave. I think that they are going to come up short and we are going to have to really go after China and their interest with Korea but also their interest in the region. We will going to have to put significant geopolitical and economic pressure on China."

United States either accepts a nuclearize North Korea and it is almost like the Soviet Union where you just kind of live under that blackmail scenario. Or, our offensive capabilities will just take them out. You have the B52s, you have the ground base. ICBM. You have the ones in the subs too. And that just obliterates them and then you have a huge crisis on your hand. Or third option, a coup or an assassination attempt. What do you think the chances are of a targeted assassination attempt, a decapitation strategy in North Korea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "There is a possibility of that happening. And that would be something that was engineered by the Chinese. And because they want to change out their leadership, in thinking that the leadership is not responding to them. But listen, this is what we've got to recognize. North Korea has nuclear weapons because the Chinese wanted them to have nuclear weapons. They wanted them to be the dominant power on the Peninsula. North Korea has intercontinental ballistic missiles that looked remarkably similar to the Chinese in a continental ballistic missile at a portable missiles. I bet anything, if we went up and pulled off the label, we would see \"Made in China\" during those parades. So, that, you have to understand how close these countries are. The intellectual property they are using is Chinese. Some of the major parts they're using is Chinese. So, China has their hands all over this thing. The path through this has got to be through China. And there is a possibility, because of the pressure that China will start to put on North Korea, and if they get resistance, that would lead them to make the regime change. In other words, assassinate them and put somebody else in his place that is complicit with them and would respond to their guidance. That's still a reasonable option that could be down the road."

What Kim Jong-un is no fool and what he has said to us that anybody conducts an unprovoked attack on any of my military capabilities, that is war on the Peninsula. And I will conduct an immediate invasion of South Korea with every rocket and missile I have and also nuclear weapons. That is the threat that he is holding over us to prevent us from exercising that kind of a military action. That's offensive in nature. The rest of our military action is dealing with a delivered system are defensive. And that is, to shoot the system down at sea or they shoot it when it's up in space using the ground-based midcourse missiles, 44 of them that are in Alaska and also in California. That is not an option that we want have to use because that's a system that's heading towards some population center in the United States and we are totally dependent on a bullet killing a bullet in thin air. We have capability to do it but we also have missed 50 or 60 percent of the time with the system that I am describing to you right now."

That, you know, we were sort of used to this idea that this is new to them and the anxiety level is really high, there was a CBS poll tonight that says that 72 percent of Americans are absolutely concerned about this and actually starting to get scared.

Secondly, he has got one of the best National Security teams wrapped around him that this country has ever had. These are steady, calm, measured people that have been in and out of crisis all their adult lives. This is good news for us. I believe that we will avoid war with North Korea.

But you have to understand especially with like painkillers or prescription medications or other things like that.

I think the first thing you've got to do and I am happy the President is dealing with this. But I think the first thing that has to happen is, some sorts of program were on this legal exchange. Those folks who are already on heroin. Make sure you have a legal exchange program.

Talking about how doctors can be part of the solution by urging patients to bring their prescription drugs back. So, when you have opioids prescribed to you and you have 20 Percocets under your bed, you bring them back to the doctor's office instead of keeping them in your house. Right? That is the second thing. The third thing is, finding alternatives to opioids. So, instead of prescribing opioids, maybe we should talk about how we legalize marijuana as a used to treat pain.

This afternoon on social report, Alicia Cuna and Denver was talking about this program where they are using different types of medicines like Lidocaine patches that would go directly on a broken ribs instead of prescribing opioids.

The tone is of an apologetic teacher who doesn't like giving detention but does because others do. The DOJ flack in an email said an ABC producer told her they aren't interested in this story, even if FOX -- evil FOX -- runs with it. It's like they are saying they are still on your side, unlike FNC who still thinks the story mean something. Now, this isn't mind-blowing at all. They did the story anyway. But it gives you a peek into the mindset of people who don't just write the stories but shape the agenda. Meaning they try to persuade viewers by diminishing some stories you think matter, like Benghazi and the IRS scandal, and playing up others like Russia, or Russia, or Russia. They aren't just presenters of news but curators manipulating the significance of a story by controlling its exposure. The fact is, everyone played down the tarmac story in order to help Hillary.

A federal judge has allowed it to move forward. Mitchell once interrogated the mastermind of 9/11 Khalid Sheik Mohamed and earlier this year, he maintained he and Jetson will be cleared if the case went to trial."

      "utterance": "Those things that were done by the CIA and the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks were Judged not one time but four or five times by the Department of Justice to be legal. I never heard two of these people who are suing me, until the lawsuits showed up in 2015."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Ok, what he just said there, he doesn't know the people that are actually suing him on their behalf? I find the ACLU defending them is shameful. This is definitely a left-wing attack on these two men. They were public servants and they were asked by the government to do something very difficult. None of us would want to do that, but they did. I know and I am confident that their actions saved lives, especially that Khalid Sheik Mohamed interrogation. If this was a criminal case, I would recommend the President to issue a pardon. It's not, it's a civil case. That is probably why they did it this way, because they cannot bring a criminal case against these guys. I do think the President should comment on this. I think it merits his attention. I think you should offer them his support. I think to build goodwill that he needs with the Intel community. And I also think it would show people like the ACLU that we are going to stand behind our men and women in uniform and the intelligence community when they need to do the very necessary things they do to protect us from terrorist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. They didn't do anything illegal. They were following orders, they were doing their jobs. I think it's an excellent point, Dana. The President should stand up on their behalf. Do a tweet, make a public statement. Do something to show his support. In regard to what they did in the service they did for their country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I think one of the problems is that people don't know how to frame the war on terror. They act like when you're fighting the war on terror, you are fighting something like childhood obesity. Fighting terror requires different rules and fighting other things. Terror actually wins if you follow traditional rules. They expect you as a civilization not to do the thing that might actually win. Liberals on the left will tell you that if you torture, you sacrifice the values that your country is based on, to which I would say \"shut up.\" trying to save hundreds of thousands of lives is of value. If that requires doing some things that don't follow the rules -- I mean, there is no normal protocol when you are fighting demons. We have to understand that and deal with it realistically. These guys were charged with doing something that they could go to jail for, maybe. They still go and did it and so would you if you knew that somebody's kid's life was on the line."

      "utterance": "These psychologists are patriots and the ACLU makes me sick. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta, and George, Republican and Democratic both have said that it enhanced interrogation led to intelligence that led to the assault on the Bin Laden compound. It also broke up terror cells and it also preventative mass casualty attacks and also enabled us to gain knowledge of the infrastructure, the network, and financing of the Al Qaeda network. SEALS are waterboarded. This is not like you hammering a nail into someone's hand or breaking bones like they do in many other countries."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Jose Rodriguez, who ran the CIA's counterterrorism center for about three years after 9/11 said it's not torture when you are making someone feel pain so they have to scream out what they know in order to stop the pain. This was in order to change their behavior and make them more compliant. To give them a sense of hopelessness and despair so in order to make it stop, they will then squeal. Obama carved out an exemption when he banned enhanced interrogation. He said we are going to ban it but if there is a ticking time bomb situation, I reserve the right to water board someone. It can't be that bad, given that Obama was going to do it."
