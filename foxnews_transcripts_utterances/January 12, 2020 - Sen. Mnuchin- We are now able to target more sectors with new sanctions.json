Straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as President Trump hits Iran with new sanctions. Plus, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is here on why he is calling on the president to delay the State of the Union. He will join me coming up live. Then, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on the House voting to limit the president's war powers and why he says the measure has no teeth. Also, ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, is here with exclusive news. He will break news on the Ukraine whistle- blower complaint this morning. Plus, Florida Senator Rick Scott joins me to discuss the Senate impeachment trial expected to finally begin this week, as the articles are being sent. All that and a lot more right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we begin in the Middle East this morning. The Trump administration is ratcheting up sanctions against Iran, after Tehran targets American troops with missiles. Protesters are now rising up in the streets of Iran against the ayatollah, after Iran admits mistakenly downing the Ukrainian airliner. Meanwhile, in Asia, voters in Taiwan reelect the incumbent president, supporting her tough stance against mainland China, this as we look ahead to this week's signing ceremony for the phase one of the U.S.-China trade deal, all of this coming amid a record stock market performance and more signs of job growth in America. Joining me right now, exclusively this morning, is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. And, Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.",

They cannot talk to one another. And they stay in their desks. With the Clinton impeachment, it lasted five weeks. And this is the dirty little secret that nobody is talking about, why the speaker held these papers. Remember what happened in the last nomination process, where the DNC chairman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had to resign the night before the nomination convention started, because they had found out they had cheated Senator Bernie Sanders from the opportunity to become the nominee. They are doing the exact same thing right now. The Iowa caucus is on February 3. Bernie Sanders is in first place. And what this does is, this benefits Joe Biden.

And what I said at the time, even though the media largely ignored it, I said that we're not finished with the ICIG. Lo and behold, the Democrats know that the ICIG is a major problem. You know why? Because they haven't released his testimony. So he's the only one. Of all the Star Chamber games that were played in the basement of the Capitol, with these secretive interviews, the only one that's not released is the one with the I.C. inspector general. That is -- that's unacceptable. So what we're asking for here is -- because what he's claiming is essentially that we're just dumb, we made mistakes, it was a -- it was a huge mistake. That's fine, if you want to claim incompetence, but you need to have the documentation, the evidence to prove that you were indeed incompetent, because it just doesn't pass the smell test.

Remember, the judge from last year that now -- there was in charge of all these FISAs, she claimed, at the end of the year, which was great, oh, my God, there was a problem here and we need the FBI to do something.

      "utterance": "And China is subject to sanctions, like everybody else. We actually sanctioned some of their shipping companies that were involved in the oil. And we will continue to pursue sanctions activities against China and anybody else around the world that continues to do business with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So what about France? You know, France is doing business Iran as well. What about the NATO countries, including France, that seem to be continuing their relationship with Iran, even as the U.S. pleads with them not to, promising sanctions? Are we going to see secondary sanctions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "The Europeans are adhering to our primary sanctions. Again, as we roll out additional sectors, they will be cutting back activities in those sectors. But the Europeans are complying with our primary sanctions, because they would be subject to secondary sanctions. And they understand that. And even in the case of INSTEX, we have warned INSTEX that they may be -- depending upon how they set it up, they would most likely be subject to secondary sanctions as well. But, again, let me just emphasize, humanitarian transactions are available. We're setting up a Swiss channel to handle that. So, this is not about attacking the people of Iran. This is about, as the president said, making sure that Iran stops their terrorist activities and making sure that they never have nuclear weapons."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Let me move on to China, because you are planning a big event this Wednesday, the signing ceremony for the phase one deal between the U.S. and China. Is this same deal that you told us about at the end of last year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "It is. And let me just say, Ambassador Lighthizer has led a very, very large team across all the different agencies. Almost every single one of our agencies have been involved in this. And this is really a historic transaction. Now, it's is not everything. And, as we have said, there will be a phase two. But this is the first time we have had a comprehensive agreement with China on technology issues, agricultural issues, financial services, purchases, and has a real enforcement mechanism. So this is a big win for the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "The last time we spoke about this, looking at this deal at the end of last year, we were expecting that there would be a snap-back provision in there where, if China doesn't keep its promises, if they lie, as they have for so many times to so many different parties, that the U.S. would be able to snap back tariffs and -- in place. Is that still in it, or has that been changed through translation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "No, that is still in it, Maria. There is a real enforcement provision. And if they don't comply with the agreement, the president retains the authority to put on tariffs, both existing tariffs and additional tariffs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And what about the agricultural buying, because that is another question? There are concerns this morning, as you know, Secretary, that the language has been changed in translation. Why wasn't the English version released to the public, so that we can understand specifically what is in the deal we're away -- 48 hours from signing? People want to see the English version. Was it changed in translation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Maria, let me first say it wasn't changed in translation. I don't know where that rumor started. We have been going through a translation process that I think we said was really a technical issue. And the language will be released this week. So I think it is -- the day of the signing, we will be releasing the English version. And people can see. This is a very, very extensive agreement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "I do. Let me just say, it is $200 billion of additional products across the board over the next two years, and, Specifically, in agriculture, $40 billion to $50 billion. So, this is a big opportunity for our farmers. And I think some people have questioned whether they can produce it. And the president said they are going to go out and buy more land and produce plenty of agriculture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "On the intellectual property issues, you have been talking a lot about protecting I.P. for American companies and innovators. Is it true the Chinese recently adopted malicious cybersecurity rules that negate any opportunity for the U.S. to protect its intellectual property?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "No, Maria, that is not true. There are very important intellectual property rules in here that we expect them to adhere to. There are cyber concerns that we do have. So let me just be clear. Cyber will be part of phase two. But we have incorporated provisions in phase one that we think are important protections for U.S. companies. So, we have made very clear there can be no forced technology transfer and that China is putting out laws to protect both U.S. technology and other technology."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So all of your plans are coming together? You have got the signing ceremony on Wednesday. You have got USMCA likely going to pass the Senate. When would you expect that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "I know it is going through the Senate committees now. We expect it to pass quickly. We hope that this little sideshow that is going to show up at the Senate doesn't delay it. But we look forward to the Senate acting quickly. And let me just say, the president's economic program is really coming together. As we have talked about Maria, from day one, it's tax cuts, it's regulatory relief, and it is trade. And the president has delivered on all three. You saw the stock market break 29000 for the first time last week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "That was pretty incredible, actually. Looking at the backdrop in the terms of the economic growth story, that is what driving the markets. I know that we got more signs of jobs growth on Friday, with the jobs numbers coming out,although it is slowing down from the numbers we saw about a year ago. What would be your expectation for growth, economic growth, and jobs in 2020?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Maria, I wouldn't focus on any one week. We have created more jobs under President Trump than ever created before. That is something that we continue to focus on. And we look forward to a healthy economy in 2020. Now, let me just say there is no question that the Boeing -- the Boeing situation, it is going to slow down the GDP numbers. Boeing is one of the largest exporters. And with the 737 MAX, I think that could impact GDP as much as 50 basis points this year. But we -- we look forward to very healthy growth in 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And the trade story is one leg of the three legs in terms of deregulation, tax legislation, and the trade changes that you are making and the administration has led here. Would you expect things to pick up in 2021, then? What is your expectation in terms of economic growth?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, for this year, we have been looking at 2.5 to 3 percent, as I said. It may be closer to 2.5 because of the adjustment of the Boeing numbers. But this would have been 3 percent otherwise. And I think there is no question that USMCA and the China deal are going to add significantly to growth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

That seeks to limit the president from taking further military action. Many Republicans say this could actually weaken America's position in the Middle East. Joining me right now is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, it's always a pleasure. Thanks so much for being with me."

      "utterance": "Let's go through these -- War Powers Act. The House, obviously, on Friday voted. Can you tell us a little bit this and where this is going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, this is -- this resolution we passed is going nowhere, because it's way they passed it. They did a concurrent resolution. And you have to understand this, Maria, that a concurrent resolution is only used for like the Soap Box Derby or giving a medal that we did to Jack Nicklaus. This is nonbinding. This will not go to the president. It will not change the War Powers Act. And it's what the Democrats have done. I mean, think about what the -- President Trump has done. It is his natural instinct to always put America first and keep us safe. The Democrats' instinct is to blame America first. Instead of having a resolution on the floor condemning Iran for shooting down a civilian aircraft, or will we have resolution on the floor this week standing with those individuals who seek freedom in Iran? I don't believe we will, because these Democrats will do anything to defame the president over defending this nation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Eight Democrats opposed this resolution. Six are in the swing districts won by Donald Trump. Talk about that, because I know that you have talked before in the past about those swing districts really watching and pressuring Nancy Pelosi to not go forward with the impeachment. But we know that the articles are going to the Senate this upcoming week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, last year, it would take 19 new seats to win the majority. And this year, it only takes 18, because a Democrat, Jeff Van Drew, switched party over impeachment and the way Nancy Pelosi has been treating. He is more -- he is a Republican now on where his positions are. There are 30 Democrats who sit in seats that President Trump carried. We only need 18 to win the majority. They're seeing the tide continuing to shift, as Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, continues to stand with the socialist wing of the Democratic Party, instead of standing where America wants to see us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So what happens this week? You have got vote on the House managers for the impeachment trial. And then this impeachment trial, which I assume will begin this upcoming week, could go for several weeks. Tell us how you see it playing out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, we first have to name the managers and vote on it. Remember where the Democrats said this was so urgent, that they had to move this so quickly, before end of the year. And now Nancy Pelosi has been holding the papers? So, sometimes, we will vote after their caucus, would be Wednesday or Thursday. So, I find it very difficult for the Senate to even start impeachment this week. And what happens with impeachment is, the senators have to be in their desks. They cannot have a phone. They cannot talk to one another. And they stay in their desks. With the Clinton impeachment, it lasted five weeks. And this is the dirty little secret that nobody is talking about, why the speaker held these papers. Remember what happened in the last nomination process, where the DNC chairman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had to resign the night before the nomination convention started, because they had found out they had cheated Senator Bernie Sanders from the opportunity to become the nominee. They are doing the exact same thing right now. The Iowa caucus is on February 3. Bernie Sanders is in first place. And what this does is, this benefits Joe Biden. This harms Senator Sanders, who is in first place and could become their nominee, because he will be stuck in a chair, because Nancy Pelosi held the papers, different than what she said to the American public why she had to move so urgently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, you think that it is by design that Nancy Pelosi is sending the articles now, slow-walking, really, slow-walking the impeachment trial, to have the senators in the room? I mean, that is collusion. That is obstruction, once again keeping Bernie Sanders at bay, and clearing the decks for Joe Biden? Is that what you're saying?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "That is exactly what I'm saying. Remember what the Democratic Party did this time. They removed the superdelegates from the first round of voting because what they had done to Senator Sanders. Now they don't have the power, had he got to the convention fairly. So, what power does the speaker have? Remember, when she first started impeachment, I sent her a letter about process, could we have a fair process, laying out 10 questions, the exact same process for Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon. She ignored that and didn't care about process. Now she tries, in hypocrisy, bring up process in the Senate, where she has no power?"
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Wow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "She told the American public it was urgent. She had to move so fast. The only reason why she should be -- that she is doing this that no one is talking about, it is harming the -- Bernie Sanders, the senator, who has been coming into first place, who could win Iowa and propel himself to be the nominee. It's the exact same thing they did to him four years ago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

Up next, my exclusive interview with the always outspoken former White House strategist Steve Bannon -- his reaction to developments with Iran, China, why he says the president should delay the State of the Union immediately, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Back in a minute with Steve Bannon."

In Taiwan, voters are celebrating this weekend, the island's pro-democracy leader winning reelection, again, people in the streets wanting freedom and democracy. And in Hong Kong, protesters holding up the American flag as they fight for freedom. Joining me right now on what it all means for America is former White House chief strategist, host of the hit podcast, wildly successful, \"War Room.\" Steve Bannon is here.

      "speaker": "BANNON",
      "utterance": "Look, this is the Trump doctrine, whether it's in Hong Kong at ballot box in Taiwan, in the streets of Tehran, freedom and democracy. This is what -- President Trump has stood up to the Chinese Communist Party, the dictators in Beijing. He's stood up to the mullahs in Tehran. And now you're seeing it. You're seeing the people, whether it's at the ballot box in Hong Kong or in the protest. They just had a sweeping victory there a couple of weeks ago, a landslide victory for the -- for the freedom and democracy party in Taiwan, with a record turnout. And this is with the Chinese Communist Party trying to put their thumb on the scale to try to do it, in Tehran, the exact same thing. Remember, in Hong Kong, and in Taipei, you're seeing the American flag. They're waving in these American -- these independence movements, these freedom movements. They have gotten President Trump -- posters of President Trump as Superman or some sort of superhero. This is the Trump policy. It's ironic that, this week, we're going to have the signing of the Chinese trade deal."

      "speaker": "BANNON",
      "utterance": "At the same time, they're moving -- they're going to vote to send the impeachment articles over to the House, because these are inextricably linked. What President Trump did is go against the established order. The established order, the permanent political class' foreign policy was to appease these dictators, to appease piece Beijing. And that's why you saw the rise of China. To appease the mullahs in Iran. And that's why you saw this -- this expansion, this expansion of Iran in -- with Hezbollah throughout the Middle East. Donald Trump said, this is not going to happen on my watch. We're going to stop here and now. He's taken a very Churchillian stand, like Churchill took in the 1930s. It's the permanent political class and the John Kerrys, the Hillary Clintons, the foreign policy establishment, the Neville Chamberlains. They were the appeasers. He stopped the appeasement. He went to economic war. He -- in the trade deals."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, the Democrats don't see it that way, Steve. She is sending the articles for impeachment over to the Senate. We're going to have a Senate trial. And yet I can't figure out if, in fact, the president wants witnesses or doesn't want witnesses. What is this going to look like? Why is it that this freedom, this democracy, this movement in the economic growth story is not resonating on his critics?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BANNON",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, they're not. This is why they oppose him, the established order. First off, they hating personally. But more importantly, they oppose his America first policies, because the America first policies are resonating. Freedom and capitalism are resonating around the world. And that's what they oppose. And this is why he's continuing to push this forward. Remember, when they put these articles of impeachment up, what they want to do is basically bigfoot everything he's doing. They want to have -- and this is, I think, the problem Mitch McConnell has, is that they see this kind of trial as being on C-SPAN, right, with some very tight legal arguments. I think President Trump and the reason on \"Laura Ingraham\" the other night he called for an expanded -- he called for an expanded witness list was, he understands that the jury is not the Senate. The jury is the American people, but the audience is the world. They're watching on the streets of Taipei. They're watching in Hong Kong. They're watching in Tehran. They're watching to see if the established border can back down Donald Trump. And Donald Trump has the ability to win here. And that's why I have been calling it the trial the century. He calls it the crime of the century. It is the crime of the century. It should be treated like that. And that's why, on \"Laura Ingraham,\" he walked through the witnesses he wants. I think those witnesses have to be called."

Bring them. What do they have to show? Donald Trump did nothing wrong. This is why -- it's just like his support of the freedom movements throughout the world. And, yesterday, he tweets out in Farsi to support the people in the streets of Tehran. The established order were appeasers. They appeased the Chinese Communist Party. They appeased the mullahs. He stood up to that. And he showed you, in the crime of the century, we should have the whistle-blower up. We should have Hunter Biden up. And we should have the gentleman Horowitz, who wrote the I.G. report. We should have those people up there. They should testify. If you have to trade off by having John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, who cares? What are they going to say?"

      "utterance": "Right? What President Trump said at the very beginning of this, when we started our podcast, unity and substance. I did nothing wrong. This call was perfect. And I think the facts bear him out. It's one of the reasons -- two reasons Nancy Pelosi slow-walked this. One was to find more evidence, OK, because they didn't have it. And they are afraid the guns are going to be turned back on them for a weak case. The second was to make sure she could bigfoot President Trump's State of the Union message. That's why she slow-walked this entire thing. President Trump understands that the jury is the American people. The audience is the world. The world is watching this. That's why he has to take a hard stand, I believe."

Earlier, I mentioned that comment by Kevin McCarthy, where he said that we just witnessed the attempted coup to take down President Trump. It was the worst coup since Lincoln, is what he said on this program. And this is one of the reasons why you believe they're not going to stop attacking the president. You want the president to fight back."

He has stood tall. That's why this is the trial of the century. It's about the crime of the century. It has to be big. This is not C-SPAN 3. This is going to be on global television.

We can't worry about the decorum of the Senate. This is about the direction of the United States of America. It's about the peace and prosperity of the world. Donald Trump's policy is working. And this is why she slow-walked this. She invited him to do the State of the Union, and then she purposely slow- walked this, because she wants in the middle of the trial -- and I can see"

I'm not -- President Trump's got a great saying, no games, OK? This is all game-playing by the Democrats. It's got to be brought to an end. OK? Now, they forced her this week to deliver them. That's why he's -- and I think this trial, he ought to go big. He ought to demand witnesses. I think President Trump ought to demand. There's no witness on the other side of Bolton or Mulvaney. There's nothing they can say that's going to be that big a deal."

But there's nothing about the details of this thing that will be any big deal, offset by the whistle-blower, by Brennan, by Biden, by Hunter Biden, by the I.G. report. This is the crime of the century. This was an attempted coup on a sitting president, a sitting president who turned out to be right. And you know who says he's right? The kids in Tehran, the kids in Beirut that are in the streets trying to throw off Hezbollah, the kids in Hong Kong that are taking -- being gassed and taking rubber bullets, the voters in Taipei who yesterday threw out the Chinese Communist Party with a landslide, who all wave American flags, and all have signs of Donald Trump being a superhero, on the streets of the world."

He's a clear and present danger. We have to do this before Christmas. It has to happen because all this influence in the following elections, right? He's a clear and present danger. They have waited for weeks for two things. They're trying to get more evidence. They're running around trying to get more evidence, because they have no evidence. They're afraid that guns are going to be turned on them and they're going to be put on trial, because they don't have a case. The other is that she wants him to have a State of the Union where there's some uncertainty. After it's all over, after he's been exonerated, then he goes before the world at the State of the Union and lays out the state of this union and the state of the world.

Michael Bloomberg is committing a billion dollars. This is how maniacally they want to remove Donald Trump from office. And the American people, now we're seeing the golden age. Freeman the other day in The Wall Street Journal said, we're seeing the golden age of the underdog in America, the golden age of the striver in America, 9 percent income growth if you don't have a high school degree, the first time that blue-collar workers over white-collar workers, workers over managers, blue- collar over white-collar.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, the bottom line is that Republicans asked back in the end of September for the ICIG to provide e-mails, documentation about how it's possible that someone that only had secondhand information could possibly be a whistle-blower, when it wasn't on the form. What we got back was essentially a non-answer answer at the early stages of October. At that time, we moved into impeachment in the House. And what I said at the time, even though the media largely ignored it, I said that we're not finished with the ICIG. Lo and behold, the Democrats know that the ICIG is a major problem. You know why? Because they haven't released his testimony. So he's the only one. Of all the Star Chamber games that were played in the basement of the Capitol, with these secretive interviews, the only one that's not released is the one with the I.C. inspector general. That is -- that's unacceptable. So what we're asking for here is -- because what he's claiming is essentially that we're just dumb, we made mistakes, it was a -- it was a huge mistake. That's fine, if you want to claim incompetence, but you need to have the documentation, the evidence to prove that you were indeed incompetent, because it just doesn't pass the smell test. And it looks so much like everything else we have seen, from the Russia hoax to the Ukraine hoax that became the impeachment scam."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "This is unbelievable. So do you think you will get these answers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's pertinent that the ICIG get these answers by Friday, because this is the guy who lit the fuse for this impeachment scam that's now going to be on trial in the Senate. So, if he wants to clear his name and prove that he is, in fact, and his office is, in fact, incompetent, he needs to provide the evidence that he's incompetent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, the whistle-blower apparently also worked for John Brennan, worked with John Brennan for a time. Connect the dots here, because you have been exposing the fraud by a cabal of individuals, whether under the leadership of John Brennan at CIA or Jim Comey and the FBI."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, look, and that's the other problem here with the ICIG, is this ICIG actually has connections, was a lawyer for some of the very people that were involved in the FISA abuse scam. So all of this becomes intertwined and related. And we need to get to the bottom of it. And, look, the ICIG, in theory, works for Congress. So why he wouldn't provide evidence, which is really -- the I.G.s, that's their game, right? That's what Horowitz proved is, they're very good at getting e-mails and evidence that exist within the bureaucracy. So this is not hard for the ICIG to provide us all the documentation on their supposed stupidity."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Let me move on and ask you for some reaction to this David Kris naming. I know you obviously have a lot of experience with this individual. The surveillance court picks ex-DOJ leader David Kris to review FBI reforms. We know that Christopher Wray's coming out with reforms. We're going to show some of the headlines that David Kris wrote about you and about the Nunes memo, which, of course, as we know, was 100 percent true when you first came out with that Nunes memo, which was exposing the wrongdoing and the attempted coup to take down then candidate Trump, and then President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I don't -- I don't know this gentleman. I remember, at the time, there were conspiracy theorists out there who were saying that -- they were accusing me essentially of committing crimes, when, in fact, it was the FBI and the dirty cops and the Clinton people that were engaged in this conspiracy to try to take out the president of the United States. So the fact that, of all the people in the swamp -- I mean, granted, the swamp isn't very big, but there are several million people that live in this area. This is the guy that you come up with, the guy that was accusing me of federal crimes, the guy that was defending the dirty cops at the FBI? I mean, look, that's why -- I said this last night in a tweet. The court must be trying to abolish itself, because there is long-term damage. I mean, this is just another misstep. Remember, the judge from last year that now -- there was in charge of all these FISAs, she claimed, at the end of the year, which was great, oh, my God, there was a problem here and we need the FBI to do something. Well, that, in and of itself, was essentially a lie, or very close to a lie, because she knew from the House Republicans that there was a fraud on the court. They had more information and evidence than we did. And so now you have a new judge who has been put in place, and he picks one of the guys that was essentially covering up for the dirty cops. You can't make it up. I guess we're just going to have to abolish this whole FISA system at this point and try to build something new."

So, I mean, I don't know what we're going to -- I don't know how you're going to vote on something, when we can even find the crime that he supposedly committed.
