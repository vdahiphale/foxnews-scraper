Not only are Democrats still trying to make changes to this bill, as the president, by the way, is touting it almost like it's a done deal while he's meeting with foreign leaders here at COP 26, but it has not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, as Chad mentioned. It also hasn't been ruled on, the immigration portion, by the parliamentarian. There were a lot of things that were going to make this a very difficult thing to accomplish before Biden got here. Obviously, that whole process got derailed. The planned vote last week never happened. And they were hoping to get a vote ahead of the election, the Virginia governor's race, which is seen as a referendum really on Democrats' ability to get things done. And also they want to be able to talk about the achievements here. The president wanted to able to talk about the achievements as he stood shoulder to shoulder with foreign leaders, trying to make overtures that other countries should make bigger commitments on climate change, which is a big portion of this plan, $555 billion dollars in proposed spending. But Manchin and Sinema, they have been unwilling to voice enough support for this for the last two months to get progressives anyway OK with having a vote on the infrastructure bill. And Manchin coming out today really sort of put the kibosh on that, and it followed a lot of momentum last week that we saw from the White House. So Press Secretary Jen Psaki appear to be taking a swipe at Manchin with this statement: \"Senator Manchin says he's prepared to support a Build Back Better plan that combats inflation, is fiscally responsible and will create jobs. The House is finalizing meeting those tests.\" And then it later on continues: \"As a result, we remain confident that the plan will gain Senator Manchin's support.\" Of course, that is not the same message we heard from Senator Manchin himself.

And another quick thing about the comments that were made earlier is like they're talking about this being a job creation bill. We have got 11 million jobs unfilled out there in the economy, and we don't have the labor force to even attack those. Are we so worried about creating new jobs on top of those?

Well, CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says that's ridiculous. They say it's $200 billion. So they're doubling the amount of expected revenue here. They're basically making up numbers.

Now, from a business perspective, In-N-Out is a fast food chain and it's well-equipped to serve patrons via takeout. And a good portion of their sales already come through drive-through. But this raises the broader question of how those that rely more heavily on indoor dining will cope as more of these mandates are issued. Now, In-N-Out has options. The CFO of Florida has welcomed the restaurant with open arms, saying that they won't face restrictions if they expand into the county. But I think it's important to mention that this isn't a question of being anti-vax or not. It's really about enforcement and whether that should fall on restaurants -- Charles.",

Right now, the risk of COVID hospitalization in the population of all kids 5 through 11 is one in 167,000 per week. That's what's on the CDC Web site. And that's probably -- that risk is going to decline. I think the vaccine in kids 5 through 11 is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. If a kid has a comorbidity, then, yes, it makes sense. I would space that more than three weeks. I would do three months. If a kid had the infection in the past, that is, they have natural immunity, no. And for everybody else in the middle, it's a personal decision. Some parents are going to be concerned about the risks of side effects and even the rare risks of myocarditis, which are as high as one in 7,000 boys.",

It also hasn't been ruled on, the immigration portion, by the parliamentarian. There were a lot of things that were going to make this a very difficult thing to accomplish before Biden got here. Obviously, that whole process got derailed. The planned vote last week never happened. And they were hoping to get a vote ahead of the election, the Virginia governor's race, which is seen as a referendum really on Democrats' ability to get things done. And also they want to be able to talk about the achievements here. The president wanted to able to talk about the achievements as he stood shoulder to shoulder with foreign leaders, trying to make overtures that other countries should make bigger commitments on climate change, which is a big portion of this plan, $555 billion dollars in proposed spending. But Manchin and Sinema, they have been unwilling to voice enough support for this for the last two months to get progressives anyway OK with having a vote on the infrastructure bill.

If you draw a correlation graph between inflation rates and the spending in D.C., they're pretty tight, because, obviously, injecting all this money into the system via M2, for example, has really spurred a lot of inflation concerns. And another quick thing about the comments that were made earlier is like they're talking about this being a job creation bill. We have got 11 million jobs unfilled out there in the economy, and we don't have the labor force to even attack those. Are we so worried about creating new jobs on top of those? That doesn't seem like a big concern. That inflation part certainly is."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRANDON ARNOLD, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's absolutely ridiculous. It's fantasyland math to say that this thing costs nothing. When you look at the IRS expenditure, they say, if they put $80 billion into the IRS, they will get $400 billion in additional tax revenue back. Well, CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says that's ridiculous. They say it's $200 billion. So they're doubling the amount of expected revenue here. They're basically making up numbers. And all Manchin is asking for -- I give them a lot of credit -- is to actually see how much these provisions costs. Let's see what this bill cost before they vote on it, instead of Nancy Pelosi's let's pass this thing and then find out what's in it."

Even more telling, with these two spending bills, more than 30 percent said it would hurt people like me. The American public, I guess something happened. There's been a general epiphany from that first tranche of money that the Biden administration put out, the $1.9 trillion and the after-effects of it. It's so interesting to see people saying, no, no more free money in this academy, because it's actually costing me more money."

    {
      "speaker": "MARTIN",

So it makes some sense to me that would be where the administration would go. As far as the market impact, I don't think the market believes it's going to happen. So, right now, the market is whistling by the graveyard as they kind of await what's going to be this new tax plan, as you mentioned earlier, how they're going to pay for some of these spending bills."

And he's going to be on his way back up here to Loudoun County, a much-talked-about area. Over the weekend, his get-out-the-bus tour put in plenty of miles.

And so clearly the trend line is moving in his favor. And I think that's why we have seen Democrats are really scrambling, particularly to get the black vote, which they think might end up saving McAuliffe. The problem for McAuliffe, obviously, is that where he's lost ground, where Youngkin has seen the most momentum is in those northern suburbs. That's a critical part of any Democrats' coalition to win the state of Virginia. And Youngkin has really made up some ground there."

One, Terry McAuliffe put his foot in his mouth during that debate, and instead of backtracking and trying to correct that mistake, he doubled down, tripled down, quadrupled down, and it's become a big drag on his campaign. And Youngkin has exploded that, I think very effectively. And then you mentioned also, I mean, President Biden, his domestic agenda, all of his poll numbers are sagging. He's at 43 percent approval in Virginia, a state he won by 10 points just a year ago. And so all of that combined has become sort of a perfect storm against Democrats and against McAuliffe. And McAuliffe hasn't responded with any vision. He just keeps calling Youngkin Trump, which isn't really selling with voters, and hasn't really presented his vision for where he wants to lead that state."

And Gallup, most important problems in America right now, number one, government poor leadership. Immigration is rocketing higher. The federal budget deficit is rocketing higher, high cost of living and inflation. These are all things that are rocketing to the top. And we're not hearing from these candidates what they're going to do about it. Do you think that President Biden's sort of -- sort of just brushing these issues away, instead of really tackling them, has cost his party dearly?"

They have sort of mocked them, Jen Psaki from the White House press Briefing Room about the tragedy of the treadmill that won't -- won't get here by Christmas or Chief of Staff Ron Klain retweeting something that these are sort of high-class problems to have. That is not how voters are feeling about gas prices, food prices, things that they are seeing in their daily lives. And so I think the administration, not only had they not put forward a plan to address it. It's -- they have even done worse than that by sort of dismissing these concerns of the American people."

Kamala Harris was there, Stacey Abrams. I mean, they have literally brought in everyone they can. And it is going to be critical. I mean, Youngkin -- I'm sorry -- McAuliffe may still be able to pull this off. But if he does, it will be because he generated enough turnout among African-Americans to offset independent voters and those voters in the northern suburbs that he has lost ground with. So it's absolutely critical to the McAuliffe campaign. They have known that for a long time, but I'm not sure if they have been able to activate those voters, certainly in the same way that Biden did one year ago."

We are seeing it in every single sector. And that's what is creating all these disruptions. This could all go away very quickly if the administration removes the vaccine mandate, because, if you are a government supplier or contractor, you don't want to give up that revenue, so you're being forced to do this. Your employees don't care about your government contracts. They care about their personal health. And they don't think you, as the CEO of an airline, should be instructing them what they have to do and what they have to put in their body. And, unfortunately, this has been -- this has been something that's been coming. We have been seeing it over and over again. And now it's creating a head because you're coming up on that December 8 deadline. And people are saying, no, I won't do it.

They're going to continue to walk out. Fliers are going to continue to get disrupted. And what it's going to impact all the way down the line, it's going to impact the hotel and resort industry. It's going to impact the cruise industry, and although they're doing -- they're literally shooting themselves in the foot with their mandates. It's going to impact taxi drivers, Uber drivers, restaurants. It just has such a cascading effect. People don't realize that one in 10 of all employees touch or are actively involved in the travel and hospitality industry globally. It is a massive industry.

And for folks at home that may have heard this word repeated over and over on our air and maybe don't understand it, it basically means that the party in power can move legislation through by a simple majority through the process of reconciliation. Now, it has to have a financial impact, though. And the Senate parliamentarian, who serves as sort of a referee in this game, has basically said no to the Democrats twice already. So it's not likely that she's going to say yes this third time around. The second problem with this is that the Senate has a very slim majority.

Now, from a business perspective, In-N-Out is a fast food chain and it's well-equipped to serve patrons via takeout. And a good portion of their sales already come through drive-through. But this raises the broader question of how those that rely more heavily on indoor dining will cope as more of these mandates are issued. Now, In-N-Out has options. The CFO of Florida has welcomed the restaurant with open arms, saying that they won't face restrictions if they expand into the county. But I think it's important to mention that this isn't a question of being anti-vax or not. It's really about enforcement and whether that should fall on restaurants -- Charles."

      "utterance": "Kelly, thank you very much. Meantime, the White House today saying its vaccination program for children aged 5 to 11 will be fully operational starting next week. So, what should parents do? John Hopkins medical professor and FOX News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary joins me now. Doctor, I'm reading an Ipsos poll where 42 percent of parents say they're unlikely to have their children vaccinated. Your thoughts? I know you have been inundated with this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. MARTY MAKARY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, and other polls, Charles, suggests that only 27 percent of parents are ready to get their kids vaccinated right away in that 5 to 11 age group. We don't know what the risk is going to be in a post-pandemic era, which is really what we're preparing kids for. Right now, the risk of COVID hospitalization in the population of all kids 5 through 11 is one in 167,000 per week. That's what's on the CDC Web site. And that's probably -- that risk is going to decline. I think the vaccine in kids 5 through 11 is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. If a kid has a comorbidity, then, yes, it makes sense. I would space that more than three weeks. I would do three months. If a kid had the infection in the past, that is, they have natural immunity, no. And for everybody else in the middle, it's a personal decision. Some parents are going to be concerned about the risks of side effects and even the rare risks of myocarditis, which are as high as one in 7,000 boys."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "So, we have got two million cases in the 5 to 11 group, 8, 300 hospitalizations and 170 deaths. You never want to minimize any deaths. But you just brought up the statistics. It just sounds like -- you wonder where the urgency is. Why does it have to happen right now? Have there been enough tests on this? Are we going to learn some of these things through trial and error?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "And the CDC has never told us how many of the deaths and MIS-C cases in kids have been in healthy kids. And we think nearly all have been kids with a comorbid condition. So that's the group really where I would pay attention, or if your kid is close to somebody with a comorbid condition or is otherwise vulnerable. But just to give you an sense as to how blanket, blind and indiscriminate the vaccinate all kids 5 through 11 policy is, the Pfizer study itself said that no cases of COVID-19 -- and I will give you the exact words -- were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior COVID infection. So we're seeing a strong recommendation that's disproportionate to the data to support it, especially in kids with natural immunity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "So, Dr. Makary, it's -- we have been here before, obviously, every time there's another round to this, a second shot, the booster shot. A lot of folks are saying just more or less get over it, because kids have to take a lot of vaccines in order to go to school. It's something that we have become used to in this country. So a lot of folks don't understand why there would be resistance. What are parents telling you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, this is not a traditional vaccine technology. So parents are a little concerned, and when you do have some solid evidence that vaccine complications appear to be much higher with this COVID vaccine than with other vaccines. For example, 10 percent of kids in the trial 5 through 11 got a side effect; 6.5 percent got a fever, some as high as 104 degrees, a high-grade fever. And in The New England Journal of Medicine three weeks ago, they looked at 136 kids who had myocarditis from the Pfizer vaccine, and one child died. So extrapolating that to the broader population of boys, that's about one in a million kids who get the vaccine boys will die from the vaccine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Do we know what the side effects are?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "They're the same -- it's the same side effect profile as in adults. Now, if people just space it out by three months, that side effect profile goes way down. That's what we should be recommending. But the regulatory process simply rubber-stamps whatever child comes through, and they don't adapt based on the new guidance that three months is better, safer. It's better immunity and it's lower complications. And that's why it's good for people to go into their pediatrician's office, rather than a mass vaccination center, and talk about these alternative strategies of one dose or spacing them out further."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",

      "utterance": "Major retailers already out with those Black Friday deals usually meant for the day after Thanksgiving. So, is this a sign companies are worrying about supply chain issues? Retail watcher Hitha Herzog joins me now. Hitha, I'm reading from the national retailing group that this is going to be the biggest, best Christmas Ever. So why are they starting the sales now?"

    {
      "speaker": "HITHA HERZOG, RETAIL WATCHER",
      "utterance": "I think they say that every year, but I'm looking at the numbers, Charles, and you're really right. It's around $859 billion they are expecting people to spend on holiday alone in total this holiday season. That's around $997 per person. And that's up 10 percent from last year. But I keep citing this study that I have been reading and kind of my go-to for the supply chain from Oracle. And it said that 28 percent of people had already started their holiday shopping. And to your point, a lot of these retailers have had these sales, some as early as October 15. But one in particular, and that's Best Buy, that started October 31. A lot of those electronics are on sale. And the reason why I'm talking about this is because Best Buy is projecting a 28 percent revenue growth over the next quarter."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Here's the thing, though. I was in best buy on Saturday, and most of the -- a lot of the shelves were empty, the things that I really wanted to get. They had one drone left. But a lot of the other things that the kids that are saying that they want, they didn't have them there. And so I'm not sure. If you want it, you got to go online. Will we be able to get it before Christmas?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERZOG",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that's the best strategy right now. People should head online immediately. Obviously, make your list. Make sure that people aren't giving you the gift list early, because I would say -- I mean, I have been saying really October 31 was the cutoff to really get exactly what you want. But if you're really trying to push it, I would say middle of November. Even now, you're going to start spending more for those gifts that everyone wants. So, online at this point is your best bet. Charles, they are trying to empty out those shelves, mostly to get the new product in. But as we know, there's a supply chain crisis that's happening. And it's -- a lot of that product is stuck off the coast of Los Angeles and Long Beach."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",

    {
      "speaker": "HERZOG",
      "utterance": "That is a really good point. And a lot of these -- a lot of the product that is about to be delivered, with the exception of the decorations and seasonal specific-stuff, is actually more throughout the year. So, again, I was talking to Leslie Ghize over at Tobe Doneger Group, and she was saying that retailers almost plan to be in a gifting all-year-round mode. So, expect these retailers, even if a large shipment comes in, in January or February..."
