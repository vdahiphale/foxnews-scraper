      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We are live tonight until midnight, and this is a Fox News Alert. The former FBI director James Comey's testimony is a huge victory for Donald Trump today, and a massive defeat for the Democrats, and of course, the propaganda media. Now, there are also some legal experts who say tonight James Comey may have broken the law. Jay Sekulow will weigh in later in the show tonight. Also, Donald Trump Jr., Laura Ingraham, Gregg Jarrett, Gerald Rivera, Ari Fleischer, Sara Carter, John Solomon all join us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, the truth and the biggest takeaways from today's congressional hearing. This is information you will not get anywhere else in the media! It's important, and it's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right, here's what we learned today from James Comey's testimony. The president of the United States never obstructed justice, and in fact, the president actually encouraged the FBI Director Comey to go forward with any and all investigations into campaign associates and involvement with Russia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, James Comey confirmed several times that the president and the White House did not -- let me say again, did not -- ask him to stop the Russia investigation. Now, Comey said multiple times that President Trump was not and ever under investigation. Which, by the way, why did he only say this today? Why couldn't the FBI director have come out sooner? We'll answer that question tonight. Now, we also learned that James Comey selectively was leaking information to try and damage the president. What so-called champion of law and justice would ever do that to the president of the United States? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, of course, the destroy Trump media and Democrats, they were all proven to be completely wrong about their Russia collusion theories and they were exposed today to be lying to you, the American people, for almost 10 months. And the biggest news today was the indictment of the Obama administration and former attorney general Loretta Lynch. Comey admitted that Lynch successfully was able to pressure him into toning down his own language when speaking publicly about Hillary Clinton's email investigation. Wow! We're going to do a deep dive into that also tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But I want to go back to several things I said about James Comey right here on this program on May the 9th. That was the night that he got fired. And the reason that it's so necessary to do this -- you cannot look at today's testimony, as some in the media are, in this little, itsy-bitsy bubble. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All of Comey's past actions are relevant -- equal justice under the law. It matters. Now, Comey -- this is the important part -- he failed you, the American people, at every single turn. He disrespected our Constitution. He didn't care about equal application of the rule of law. He created a two-tiered justice system, one for Hillary and Bill Clinton, and one for the rest of America, by ignoring the many, many crimes we know she committed. For example, remember when Comey laid out everything that was found on Hillary Clinton's private email server that she stuffed in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet that had top-secret, classified and even Special Access Program information on it? Take a look at this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Seven email chains concerned matters that were classified at the top-secret Special Access Program at the time they were sent and received. Any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system. But their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full- time security staff, like those found at agencies and departments of the United States government, or even with a commercial email service like Gmail. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Remember the guy behind bars for a year? He took six pictures inside the submarine he was so proud of working in? And then, of course, there's the Clinton Foundation and the pay-to-play scheme and the Uranium One deal. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of America's uranium. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, by the way, there's a real Russia scandal. Why didn't Comey bother to investigate or look into any of these things? Now, the answer is simple and it continues to be exposed. Sadly, James Comey is nothing more than a partisan and a political hack, as I said on the 9th. And by the way, his testimony once again today proved that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's start with Comey's motives. From the very beginning, it was very clear that he was seeking revenge and was only out to create smoke and confuse people and confuse the issues around all of this. And Comey admitted that he was bitter and upset about being fired, disgruntled at being called out by the White House for failing miserably at his job. And then there's this exchange, which shoots down any narrative of obstruction of justice. It's gone. It's finished. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

That is the huge scandal here and the abuse of power by the Obama administration, Lynch trying to influence the investigation, going directly to the FBI director. How is that not obstruction of justice? And why didn't Comey come forward and report that? And again, did he maybe break the law? We'll ask our legal experts throughout the show. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, also, why didn't Comey create a detailed memo about that conversation with Loretta Lynch? Now, this shows you that there is a massive double standard. Now, Comey let something like that happen with Lynch, but is now trying to go after President Trump. And by the way, Comey's biases are so extreme, there are so many other examples. Now, Comey testified that he took, oh, detailed memos of all of his conversations with President Trump. He didn't trust him. He thought he might lie. But he didn't do the same thing to President Obama. Now, Comey also never put Hillary Clinton under oath while she was being interviewed by the FBI, and by the way, never demanded that her conversation be recorded. Why is that? And biggest of all, Comey was desperate to come out and clear Hillary Clinton's name, but he refused to do the same thing for President Trump. By the way, as I mentioned, he told three times -- told the president he wasn't under investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then finally tonight, we have been saving this one for you on purpose. After so many months -- about 10 months -- of endlessly pushing back all of these black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, what did we learn today? That there is no such thing as a Trump-Russia collusion. The media has been endlessly, breathlessly lying to you night after night after night, day after day! And today, they even had to admit it. Now, of course, the big network of black helicopter theories and tinfoil hat conspiracies is NBC. Just listen to even their own Chris Matthews, Mr. thrill up his leg himself.

He was so unnerved by the president exercising his constitutional prerogative under Article 2 to ask about investigations, direct investigations.

And I believe, Sean, by the way, that what we have here is a colossal waste of money of the American people. The president is dealing with North Korea. He is dealing with a troubled Middle East. He is working on health care reform, which you've been so involved in, and tax reform. And we've got this distraction that the network media has broke into it to cover what? Three points. One, the president was never under investigation from the outset. That's number one. Number two, that the president never attempted to or obstructed the Russian probe. And number three, he hoped that General Flynn was a good guy and that things would work out for him? That's called human compassion, and the FBI director did not bother, if he thought it was such an intimidation -- by the way, this is an FBI director who said that he was basically intimidated by the president, he should have been stronger.

I've not thought about that before.\" Pause. \"There is a statute that prohibits misprision of a felony, knowing of a felony and taking steps to conceal it.

That is the question you and everybody else who is a government official has a legal duty to report it to your superiors if you think someone like the president or anybody is obstructing justice. So Comey couldn't possibly have answered the question today by saying yes, I thought it was obstruction, because Comey would have been incriminating himself on misprision of felony and accessory after the fact, aiding and abetting a felon.",

Your take on all that has happened today, and what we just touched on slightly is the deep state, which I want to get to. And the idea, one thing nobody mentioned today was the leaking of intelligence, raw intelligence, the unmasking against General Flynn, which did ruin his career which never should have happened. That's a felony we know was committed. SARA CARTER, \"CIRCA NEWS\": Yes, Sean. One of the things both John and I talked about was that we had reported, and I think we were the only people that did report this, that both national security adviser then Michael Flynn was not under investigation in connection with the Russia collusion or the Russia probe, and that Trump himself was not under investigation. So there was evidence out there if people wanted to look for it. I think Marco Rubio, Senator Rubio, said it best. He said this was the only thing that really didn't leak. And there were so many leaks in the media that were just patently false. And I think that was a big piece of information that came out of the hearing today. And also the fact that Loretta Lynch went as far to approach the FBI director and say we're going to go ahead with its investigation but please don't call it an investigation. Call it a matter.

JOHN SOLOMON, \"CIRCA NEWS\": On May 11th, and I came on your show that day too, and we reported that we had confirmed that James Comey had told both the president and Congress that the president was never under investigation. He was not the target or focus or subject of the Russian investigation. A lot of our media friends ignored that. More called me and actually taunted me a couple times. I'll honestly report that. Some of my colleagues called me and said you're hanging out there and it's way too soon to be reporting that. It turns out that that turned to be true. I think two things happen today. One, there was prima facie proof of collusion. It just wasn't between Russia and the Trump campaign. It was between either misinformed or malicious sources and reporters who recklessly reported a false story. That was the collusion that was proven today. And they even helped James Comey at the end carry out his revenge by leaking that memo. I think the second thing is there's probably more interest that should be focused on what happened between James Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch after what we heard today. And I'm hearing tonight that Comey may have had other meetings with Lynch that are going to come to light in the next few weeks.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We are live tonight until midnight, and this is a Fox News Alert. The former FBI director James Comey's testimony is a huge victory for Donald Trump today, and a massive defeat for the Democrats, and of course, the propaganda media. Now, there are also some legal experts who say tonight James Comey may have broken the law. Jay Sekulow will weigh in later in the show tonight. Also, Donald Trump Jr., Laura Ingraham, Gregg Jarrett, Gerald Rivera, Ari Fleischer, Sara Carter, John Solomon all join us. But first, the truth and the biggest takeaways from today's congressional hearing. This is information you will not get anywhere else in the media! It's important, and it's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, here's what we learned today from James Comey's testimony. The president of the United States never obstructed justice, and in fact, the president actually encouraged the FBI Director Comey to go forward with any and all investigations into campaign associates and involvement with Russia. Now, James Comey confirmed several times that the president and the White House did not -- let me say again, did not -- ask him to stop the Russia investigation. Now, Comey said multiple times that President Trump was not and ever under investigation. Which, by the way, why did he only say this today? Why couldn't the FBI director have come out sooner? We'll answer that question tonight. Now, we also learned that James Comey selectively was leaking information to try and damage the president. What so-called champion of law and justice would ever do that to the president of the United States? Now, of course, the destroy Trump media and Democrats, they were all proven to be completely wrong about their Russia collusion theories and they were exposed today to be lying to you, the American people, for almost 10 months. And the biggest news today was the indictment of the Obama administration and former attorney general Loretta Lynch. Comey admitted that Lynch successfully was able to pressure him into toning down his own language when speaking publicly about Hillary Clinton's email investigation. Wow! We're going to do a deep dive into that also tonight. But I want to go back to several things I said about James Comey right here on this program on May the 9th. That was the night that he got fired. And the reason that it's so necessary to do this -- you cannot look at today's testimony, as some in the media are, in this little, itsy-bitsy bubble. All of Comey's past actions are relevant -- equal justice under the law. It matters. Now, Comey -- this is the important part -- he failed you, the American people, at every single turn. He disrespected our Constitution. He didn't care about equal application of the rule of law. He created a two-tiered justice system, one for Hillary and Bill Clinton, and one for the rest of America, by ignoring the many, many crimes we know she committed. For example, remember when Comey laid out everything that was found on Hillary Clinton's private email server that she stuffed in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet that had top-secret, classified and even Special Access Program information on it? Take a look at this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Seven email chains concerned matters that were classified at the top-secret Special Access Program at the time they were sent and received. Any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system. But their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full- time security staff, like those found at agencies and departments of the United States government, or even with a commercial email service like Gmail."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, Comey literally explained that Hillary Clinton broke several laws, committed several felonies, but then what we saw him do what he's done now multiples times, he started to play politics instead of doing his job. Now, for the record, if you or I did a fraction of what Hillary Clinton did, we would tonight be sitting in a jail cell, like Christian Saucier. Remember the guy behind bars for a year? He took six pictures inside the submarine he was so proud of working in? And then, of course, there's the Clinton Foundation and the pay-to-play scheme and the Uranium One deal. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of America's uranium. Now, by the way, there's a real Russia scandal. Why didn't Comey bother to investigate or look into any of these things? Now, the answer is simple and it continues to be exposed. Sadly, James Comey is nothing more than a partisan and a political hack, as I said on the 9th. And by the way, his testimony once again today proved that. Let's start with Comey's motives. From the very beginning, it was very clear that he was seeking revenge and was only out to create smoke and confuse people and confuse the issues around all of this. And Comey admitted that he was bitter and upset about being fired, disgruntled at being called out by the White House for failing miserably at his job. And then there's this exchange, which shoots down any narrative of obstruction of justice. It's gone. It's finished. Take a look."

Then there's the obvious question everybody is asking. During this conversation with the president that Comey was so apparently troubled by, well, why didn't he just get up and say, \"Mr. President, I think this is inappropriate, I think this is wrong\"?

Now, Senator Marco Rubio point out -- amazing point today -- the only thing that wasn't leaked in all of this is the fact that President Trump was not under investigation! And by the way, he was told three times. Now, of course, this is likely to have been done on purpose. And finally, there's the biggest bombshell revelation from today, and that is the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, was able to actually influence Comey in the Clinton investigation! Watch this."

And I wanted to know, was she going to authorize us to confirm we had an investigation. And she said yes, but don't call it that. Call it a \"matter.\" And I said, \"Why would I do that?\" And she said, \"Just call it a matter.\""

      "utterance": "No, not an investigation. It's a matter. And add one point here. What about the meeting Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch had on the tarmac in a private jet? What'd they talk about before Loretta Lynch made her decision? That is the huge scandal here and the abuse of power by the Obama administration, Lynch trying to influence the investigation, going directly to the FBI director. How is that not obstruction of justice? And why didn't Comey come forward and report that? And again, did he maybe break the law? We'll ask our legal experts throughout the show. Now, also, why didn't Comey create a detailed memo about that conversation with Loretta Lynch? Now, this shows you that there is a massive double standard. Now, Comey let something like that happen with Lynch, but is now trying to go after President Trump. And by the way, Comey's biases are so extreme, there are so many other examples. Now, Comey testified that he took, oh, detailed memos of all of his conversations with President Trump. He didn't trust him. He thought he might lie. But he didn't do the same thing to President Obama. Now, Comey also never put Hillary Clinton under oath while she was being interviewed by the FBI, and by the way, never demanded that her conversation be recorded. Why is that? And biggest of all, Comey was desperate to come out and clear Hillary Clinton's name, but he refused to do the same thing for President Trump. By the way, as I mentioned, he told three times -- told the president he wasn't under investigation. And then finally tonight, we have been saving this one for you on purpose. After so many months -- about 10 months -- of endlessly pushing back all of these black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, what did we learn today? That there is no such thing as a Trump-Russia collusion. The media has been endlessly, breathlessly lying to you night after night after night, day after day! And today, they even had to admit it. Now, of course, the big network of black helicopter theories and tinfoil hat conspiracies is NBC. Just listen to even their own Chris Matthews, Mr. thrill up his leg himself. Listen to this admission."

And yet what came apart this morning was that theory because in two -- in two regards. The president said, according to the written testimony of Mr. Comey, go ahead and get anybody (ph) satellites in my operation and nail them. I'm with you on that. So that would mean Manafort, Carter Page, someone else like that. And then he also came across -- what was fascinating, Comey said that, basically, Flynn wasn't central to the Russian investigation."

We have been right night after night after night. These idiots in the media, almost all of them, have been flat-out wrong, all conspiracy theorists, time in and time out. So guess what? It's time for those so-called journalists with their superior attitude -- maybe they should take off their tinfoil hats and put their black helicopters back in the hangars because it's over.

He said I'm not in a position to do so. But then he made such a big point of saying it was awkward, it was shocking. He felt pressured. He told Sessions don't leave me alone with him. He was so unnerved by the president exercising his constitutional prerogative under Article 2 to ask about investigations, direct investigations. All of that was permissible, and Jim Comey was I guess petrified of it. It was a strange colloquy that I don't think got settled and was odd in my mind that he wasn't ready for that question.

And his scorn was then directed into this memo to the file that he wrote that he then he discussed with his little clique of confidants, that he then ultimately leaked to a professor at Columbia who he knew would leak it to the media. The man is a leaker who was trying to salvage his own reputation. He had his feelings hurt, he had his ego bruised.

Jay, in the lead up to this, 18 U.S. code 4, that was a big issue. Laura and I were just talking about it. I want your legal take. And you mentioned to me in a text today about another legal issue. I would like you to bring it up for our audience."

      "utterance": "First of all, what do we know now? We know that James Comey is the leaker-in-chief. So let's think about this for a moment. The FBI director took contemporaneous notes on the president of the United States, put them in a drawer. If he was not fired, he would have used them at another point to, what, embarrass the president? That doesn't sound like somebody who wants to be your FBI director. It sounds like J. Edgar Hoover. So let's talk about the fact that --"

      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Yes, right. Takes notes. Leaks them to a friend of his at Columbia law school who then calls The New York Times. If you are the president of the United States and that's your FBI director, you know what you do? Fire him. Not because you're obstructing justice. Because the FBI director is incompetent. So now we've got this witch hunt that's going on. You look at what the former FBI director, the leaker in chief said today, and I look at of course Section 18 USC-4, but there are also a whole series of cases under 18 USC Section 641. And I think James Comey needs to be looked at by the FBI and the Department of Justice to see if the leaking of the information may in itself be in violation of the law. And I believe, Sean, by the way, that what we have here is a colossal waste of money of the American people. The president is dealing with North Korea. He is dealing with a troubled Middle East. He is working on health care reform, which you've been so involved in, and tax reform. And we've got this distraction that the network media has broke into it to cover what? Three points. One, the president was never under investigation from the outset. That's number one. Number two, that the president never attempted to or obstructed the Russian probe. And number three, he hoped that General Flynn was a good guy and that things would work out for him? That's called human compassion, and the FBI director did not bother, if he thought it was such an intimidation -- by the way, this is an FBI director who said that he was basically intimidated by the president, he should have been stronger. Is that the guy you want running your FBI and going after the terrorists, the guy that said I couldn't be strong enough? No, that's the guy you fire."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

And interestingly, that same compassion, Monica, that Jay is talking, much to my chagrin to be perfectly blunt, and a lot of people that were chanting \"Lock her up,\" he went on \"60 Minutes\" and said, oh, they are good people. I don't really want to pursue this. This is a distraction. A lot of conservatives like me were like, really? Equal justice under the law, although it wouldn't be the president's decision anyway. So my next point to you is I want your reaction to the media double standard and the media conspiracy theories and black helicopter theories, and also the double standard as it relates to his treatment of Hillary Clinton, the double standard as it relates that he never took notes about Obama, and the big bombshell vis-a-vis Loretta Lynch."

You go back and look when he was deputy attorney general during the Valerie Plame investigation, he allowed that investigation's scope to expand so they could go after Scooter Libby as a way to go after Dick Cheney. Time and again, his handling of the Hillary Clinton case, his handling of this investigation and the fact that he leaked memos, as Jay points out, leaked memos to a Columbia University friend of his to leak to the \"New York Times\" to settle a personal score with the president of the United States? This idea that James Comey somehow was a boy scout was never true. And that became particularly evident today. And as far as the media goes and the left -- look, the left, the establishment in both parties and the media need to take down Donald Trump. So whether it's this Russia investigation which, as we have clearly seen today and over time there is nothing to it, no wrongdoing whatsoever, no evidence of that. If it's not this they will soon find something else because Donald Trump is so alien to the system --"

This is why I wrote a column in the \"New York Post\" a couple of days ago, in fact I think it was about last week, where I said that Nixon's advice to Donald Trump would be do not give your enemies the story. Understand that you pose such an existential threat to the establishment on both sides, the media, the left, the international community. That you cannot so as sneeze in the White House without someone ordering an investigation. So you better have all of your ducks in a row and do not give your enemies any ammunition going forward."

So the FBI director is in collusion, using their word, with the special counsel, running his -- he's a witness running his testimony by, in this particular case, the special counsel, while he has also previously leaked a memo, as Monica just said, to harm the president. That was the intent. By the way, that's his side of the story. And then the whole discussion that James Comey -- remember the whole loyalty thing? The president said \"I want your loyalty\" according to James Comey. And then he responded \"honest loyalty,\" and James Comey responded \"Yes, honest loyalty.\" This is not a case. First of all the president doesn't even say he said it, but if he did say it, so what? But here is the fundamental issue for the American people. This was our director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He is supposed to be catching the bad guys. He's supposed to be leading the charge on counterterrorism, including ISIS and these other jihadist terrorist groups, and he was afraid of the president. \"I was weak. I was stunned.\""

The president, when he fired the FBI director, for cause, in my view, and I think the view of the American people, he knew that that was going to extend this investigation that's actually going nowhere anyways. But he knew it was going to extend it. So he took the higher road and said this will cost me personally because it's going to extend it, but I'm doing this because this guy, James Comey, should not be the director of the FBI.

The whole idea that we have a special counsel on this, to me, frankly, is absurd to me when we think about the fact that Loretta Lynch went on an airplane with president Bill Clinton while his wife was under investigation, and James Comey and his selective disclosure diseases says that he's not going to bring charges against Hillary Clinton but wouldn't leak to anybody or even say that President Trump wasn't under investigation until I think made him put that in that written testimony yesterday."

I think that today clearly laid out for all the world to see that they did not come close to getting an obstruction of justice case against the president of the United States. Obstruction of justice requires corrupt intent. It is clear to any fair observer that there was no corrupt intent when the president spoke with Director Comey, assuming that everything Comey said about their private conversation is true. Still, it does not lay out a case for obstruction of justice. The president in that regard is in the clear. He never asked director Comey to --"

Having spent the time, six weeks with Donald Trump in \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" I saw his compassion, especially as it was directed toward me. He could have said I was fired. Instead he said to Leeza Gibbons she was hired. He's a compassionate guy. He was being nice to General Flynn. He was trying his best to be good to General Flynn. He obviously did not have a guilty conscience, otherwise he would have said I want you to stop this probe into Russian collusion. He never did. He was not under investigation. And I am stunned, utterly stunned that Comey admitted leaking. I wonder what else he leaked aside from his own memo. Was he the leaker in chief, I wonder."

That's the deep state, and I will probably bring that in in the next hour a little more. Gregg, you have been really dead on in terms of your analysis of the legal traps that were facing Comey today. I am shocked how he did not even seem aware of what you had been talking about for some time, 18 USC-4."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Yes. In fact, he was asked about it. He was asked, don't FBI agents have a legal duty to report crimes? Unbelievably Comey said \"I don't know.\" And after attorneys all over the country fell off their chairs and got up, they listened to the senator press him on that. Question, \"You are unsure whether they would have a legal duty?\" Answer, \"That's a good question. I've not thought about that before.\" Pause. \"There is a statute that prohibits misprision of a felony, knowing of a felony and taking steps to conceal it. But that's a different question.\" Well, no, Mr. Comey, that's not a different question. That is the question you and everybody else who is a government official has a legal duty to report it to your superiors if you think someone like the president or anybody is obstructing justice. So Comey couldn't possibly have answered the question today by saying yes, I thought it was obstruction, because Comey would have been incriminating himself on misprision of felony and accessory after the fact, aiding and abetting a felon."

Geraldo, Gregg Jarrett, stay with us because they will be with us in the next hour. But first, we have to check in with CircaNews.com Sara Carter and John Solomon. Sara, we will start with you. Your take on all that has happened today, and what we just touched on slightly is the deep state, which I want to get to. And the idea, one thing nobody mentioned today was the leaking of intelligence, raw intelligence, the unmasking against General Flynn, which did ruin his career which never should have happened. That's a felony we know was committed. SARA CARTER, \"CIRCA NEWS\": Yes, Sean. One of the things both John and I talked about was that we had reported, and I think we were the only people that did report this, that both national security adviser then Michael Flynn was not under investigation in connection with the Russia collusion or the Russia probe, and that Trump himself was not under investigation. So there was evidence out there if people wanted to look for it. I think Marco Rubio, Senator Rubio, said it best. He said this was the only thing that really didn't leak. And there were so many leaks in the media that were just patently false. And I think that was a big piece of information that came out of the hearing today. And also the fact that Loretta Lynch went as far to approach the FBI director and say we're going to go ahead with its investigation but please don't call it an investigation. Call it a matter. And that he listened to her."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Unbelievable. And he did. And he did it. John, I've got to let you take a little victory lap. Sara touched on it just a hair, but I lost audio for a second. But honestly, you guys have been way ahead of the curve, the two of you working together on a lot of this. In fact, well, why don't you tell us. JOHN SOLOMON, \"CIRCA NEWS\": On May 11th, and I came on your show that day too, and we reported that we had confirmed that James Comey had told both the president and Congress that the president was never under investigation. He was not the target or focus or subject of the Russian investigation. A lot of our media friends ignored that. More called me and actually taunted me a couple times. I'll honestly report that. Some of my colleagues called me and said you're hanging out there and it's way too soon to be reporting that. It turns out that that turned to be true. I think two things happen today. One, there was prima facie proof of collusion. It just wasn't between Russia and the Trump campaign. It was between either misinformed or malicious sources and reporters who recklessly reported a false story. That was the collusion that was proven today. And they even helped James Comey at the end carry out his revenge by leaking that memo. I think the second thing is there's probably more interest that should be focused on what happened between James Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch after what we heard today. And I'm hearing tonight that Comey may have had other meetings with Lynch that are going to come to light in the next few weeks."

I think we're going to go back to that. I think there's going to be a lot more revelations. And I have one quick point, Sean.
