      "sentences": "Well good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" For more than a year now, the media storyline in immigration has been as mindless and predictable as a Jim Acosta script. The talking points never change. It doesn't matter what the story is. Could be the Caravan or family separation, sanctuary cities, even MS-13, the details are irrelevant. Immigration is always good whether it's legal or not, because immigrants are always good. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It doesn't matter where they're from or how much English they speak or how they've lived their lives, what they've done before, immigrants are always the heart of America. By definition, they're impressive, much more impressive than actual Americans, most of whom are fat and racist. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's Jim Acosta's position, or it was. You may have noticed that the other channels suddenly seem less eager to talk about immigration. They're de-emphasizing the issue. Why is that? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well part of the problem maybe the Caravan, which actually exists, and is in Tijuana, Mexico right. Now, this should be good news for Mexico, if you believe what they've been telling us on TV. If there's one thing we know for certain about penniless Central American immigrants, it's that they tend to found a huge number of wildly successful tech startups. They're at the heart of your economy. And yet, the citizens of Tijuana don't appear to have gotten this message because they don't seem grateful for the Caravan. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Instead, they look highly annoyed that their city has been invaded by strangers. As the city's Mayor noted, when people enter your country illegally, many of them are criminals. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Now, if you're CNN or MSNBC or NBC News or ABC, what do you do with an interview like that? You can't put it on the air because it doesn't make sense, according to the rules you've established. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You can't really argue that Mexicans are anti-Hispanic racists. That's what you call everyone else, who's opposed to immigration. So, what do you do? Well, you just pretend that none of this is happening. It's not real, and that's what they're doing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But that won't work forever. People tend to notice obvious things. They can't help it. And if they keep noticing obvious things, their views change. And that's why the consensus on immigration is changing fast. Even Hillary Clinton and John Kerry recently warned that mass immigration can destabilize countries as it's done in Europe. They're right, of course. It's happening here too. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A new analysis of census data shows that 63 percent of non-citizens in this country receive some kind of welfare benefits. That's not what they told you, but those are the numbers from the census. Even among legal immigrants, the best kind, the ones who've become naturalized citizens fully half are on government assistance. By the way, that's well above the native average. Now, leaving aside the moral considerations, does it work as a math question? Well, it would work in a country with infinite resources. Is America a country with infinite resources? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, look around. Every night, hundreds of thousands of our citizens, Americans, sleep outdoors on the street. They're homeless. The country's middle class is shrinking and dying younger for the third year in a row. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Again, these are American citizens. Some of them probably think they should have first dibs on help from the government, but they're not getting it. And, by the way, looking forward, here's a question that no one's considering. Will the mass immigration we're now watching make this country richer or poorer? In fact, the majority of our immigrants have only a high school education or less. Many of them know very little English. Some, none at all. Now, that was a difficult problem to solve a 100 years ago, during our first major wave of immigration. But consider what it means now, at a time when automation is killing entire sectors of our economy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How are immigrants with low levels of education and low levels of English supposed to succeed in an increasingly high-tech skills-based economy? And, by the way, how about our own vulnerable workers? Do they benefit from the presence of these immigrants? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These are real questions. They're critical questions that Washington should be thinking about deeply and answering. But Washington isn't thinking about them, and Washington can't answer them.

Now, if only they would update their name a little bit to ZCN, the Zucker Campaign Network, but it really does tell you a lot. Well, outgoing Senator, Claire McCaskill, now admits that her party's last- minute attempt to destroy Brett Kavanaugh's reputation and tar him as a race - rapist backfired. McCaskill says that attempt may be the reason she lost re-election in November. Tammy Bruce is a radio host and President of Independent Women's Voice. She joins us tonight. Tammy, thanks a lot--",

The key document here I have is what's called the addendum, if you can just come back to me one second, because it has some very important details. It outlines here that Mike Flynn participated in 19 interviews. But specifically, sections of the addendum are redacted because of ongoing criminal investigations. And I just want to show you sort of the depth and breadth of the redactions in this document. Here on page - page two, it says, redacted criminal investigation. The defendant has provided substantial assistance in a criminal investigation. And then you can see the rest of that is redacted. I'm still pouring through the records. But what you can see here, as I said is the bottom line of the Special Counsel, that the former National Security Adviser, Mike Flynn, has provided substantial cooperation. He's sat for almost two dozen interviews with the Special Counsel. And he's also provided communications and other records for ongoing criminal matters, which have been redacted in the publicly-released documents this evening, citing a need to protect the ongoing investigation, Tucker.

      "utterance": "Well good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" For more than a year now, the media storyline in immigration has been as mindless and predictable as a Jim Acosta script. The talking points never change. It doesn't matter what the story is. Could be the Caravan or family separation, sanctuary cities, even MS-13, the details are irrelevant. Immigration is always good whether it's legal or not, because immigrants are always good. It doesn't matter where they're from or how much English they speak or how they've lived their lives, what they've done before, immigrants are always the heart of America. By definition, they're impressive, much more impressive than actual Americans, most of whom are fat and racist. That's Jim Acosta's position, or it was. You may have noticed that the other channels suddenly seem less eager to talk about immigration. They're de-emphasizing the issue. Why is that? Well part of the problem maybe the Caravan, which actually exists, and is in Tijuana, Mexico right. Now, this should be good news for Mexico, if you believe what they've been telling us on TV. If there's one thing we know for certain about penniless Central American immigrants, it's that they tend to found a huge number of wildly successful tech startups. They're at the heart of your economy. And yet, the citizens of Tijuana don't appear to have gotten this message because they don't seem grateful for the Caravan. Instead, they look highly annoyed that their city has been invaded by strangers. As the city's Mayor noted, when people enter your country illegally, many of them are criminals."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "A lot of them are not really nice people. They're troublemakers. Imagine an American Mayor saying something like that on television? And it got more intense from there.

We are here because our government has not taken control of these, what we call invasion."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Now, if you're CNN or MSNBC or NBC News or ABC, what do you do with an interview like that? You can't put it on the air because it doesn't make sense, according to the rules you've established. You can't really argue that Mexicans are anti-Hispanic racists. That's what you call everyone else, who's opposed to immigration. So, what do you do? Well, you just pretend that none of this is happening. It's not real, and that's what they're doing. But that won't work forever. People tend to notice obvious things. They can't help it. And if they keep noticing obvious things, their views change. And that's why the consensus on immigration is changing fast. Even Hillary Clinton and John Kerry recently warned that mass immigration can destabilize countries as it's done in Europe. They're right, of course. It's happening here too. A new analysis of census data shows that 63 percent of non-citizens in this country receive some kind of welfare benefits. That's not what they told you, but those are the numbers from the census. Even among legal immigrants, the best kind, the ones who've become naturalized citizens fully half are on government assistance. By the way, that's well above the native average. Now, leaving aside the moral considerations, does it work as a math question? Well, it would work in a country with infinite resources. Is America a country with infinite resources? Well, look around. Every night, hundreds of thousands of our citizens, Americans, sleep outdoors on the street. They're homeless. The country's middle class is shrinking and dying younger for the third year in a row. Again, these are American citizens. Some of them probably think they should have first dibs on help from the government, but they're not getting it. And, by the way, looking forward, here's a question that no one's considering. Will the mass immigration we're now watching make this country richer or poorer? In fact, the majority of our immigrants have only a high school education or less. Many of them know very little English. Some, none at all. Now, that was a difficult problem to solve a 100 years ago, during our first major wave of immigration. But consider what it means now, at a time when automation is killing entire sectors of our economy. How are immigrants with low levels of education and low levels of English supposed to succeed in an increasingly high-tech skills-based economy? And, by the way, how about our own vulnerable workers? Do they benefit from the presence of these immigrants? These are real questions. They're critical questions that Washington should be thinking about deeply and answering. But Washington isn't thinking about them, and Washington can't answer them. So, instead, they're trying to ban the conversation from taking place. We're going to try again anyway to have it. Luis Miranda is a former DNC Communications Director, and he joins us tonight. Luis, thanks a lot for coming on."

If you try to impeach him, without the Republicans coming on board to actually remove him, it is a waste of time, it's a waste of political capital, and it will lead to the Democrats losing their majority, and Donald Trump being re-elected President in 2020.

Now, Zucker thinks it's time to aim even higher than that. In a recent appearance on David Axelrod's podcast, which people, apparently, listen to, Zucker says he's interested in running for Office. How does Senator Zucker sound, President Zucker, Dictator-for-Life Zucker? Whatever it is he decided to run for, his ambitions explain CNN's coverage decisions in the past couple of years. Now, if only they would update their name a little bit to ZCN, the Zucker Campaign Network, but it really does tell you a lot.

But among the headlines that the Special Counsel says former National Security Adviser, Mike Flynn, provided substantial cooperation with Special Counsel investigators. They are recommending the low end of the spectrum, no jail time, possibly probation, in this case. The key document here I have is what's called the addendum, if you can just come back to me one second, because it has some very important details. It outlines here that Mike Flynn participated in 19 interviews. But specifically, sections of the addendum are redacted because of ongoing criminal investigations. And I just want to show you sort of the depth and breadth of the redactions in this document. Here on page - page two, it says, redacted criminal investigation. The defendant has provided substantial assistance in a criminal investigation. And then you can see the rest of that is redacted. I'm still pouring through the records. But what you can see here, as I said is the bottom line of the Special Counsel, that the former National Security Adviser, Mike Flynn, has provided substantial cooperation. He's sat for almost two dozen interviews with the Special Counsel. And he's also provided communications and other records for ongoing criminal matters, which have been redacted in the publicly-released documents this evening, citing a need to protect the ongoing investigation, Tucker.

What the Special Counsel is recommending is no jail time here, based on his level of cooperation. You're right to highlight that. But the other big headline, based on the documents, is that this addendum that outlines how Mike Flynn has cooperated is heavily redacted, as I showed you here.
