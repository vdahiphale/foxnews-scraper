This is the first time, though, with Chris Wallace that he has actually acknowledged as much publicly. Trump has always dangle out the carrot, I want to do it if only they would be fair to me, I may do it, et cetera, et cetera. His legal team has been unanimously of the view it's a terrible idea. It doesn't matter whether you are talking about the early team of Ty Cobb and John Dowd, or the current legal team. Nobody thinks this is a good idea. It now is the first time the president has acknowledged as much publicly. It should be said, though, that his legal team, it's an important -- I wouldn't call it a victory, but at least a small victory, maybe, that they managed to not answer anything, according to them, on obstruction by limiting their answers to what happened before he joined the White House. That's a sort of concession from the Mueller team."

And so, of course, as soon as that didn't pan out, people tried to change it to obstruction or change it to other things. But no lawyer worth his salt would have the president speaking on a limitless probe. But I am concerned that people who seem to care about rule of law don't care that we still don't actually know what the scope of the special counsel is. This is a limitless probe. This is a person who has all the powers of the FBI and the CIA and an endless budget and we don't even know what the scope is. And to act like this is OK or this is proper procedure, I'm hoping we have people who care about rule of law enough to know that special counsels shouldn't be set up as political vindictiveness or revenge because people you don't like win elections."

Sarah Sanders putting out a statement, \"We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms. We believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference. But given the position taken by CNN we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules,\" say they are not going to take away his hard pass, they're not going to suspend it, but they are going to have rules of decorum and list those. And if you don't follow the rules, they have the option to say hit the road."

      "utterance": "That's right. A couple things. When the judge said that they had to temporarily reinstate Acosta's pass, at that time the administration said they were going to yank it again at the end of that interim period. They have changed their mind. They've come up with these pretty limited rules. They only regard press conferences, basically you get one question, no follow-ups, unless the president or the administration official who is giving the preference allows to you give one. And I think that will put a lot of onus on other journalists if somebody doesn't get an answer, then the person's colleagues presumably would ask the same question."

      "utterance": "I was just going to say, I think what's also being missed in this is it wasn't a First Amendment ruling. It was about due process. So this sets a predicate for the future that they've now set up these rules and they have a set of rules that they can then make further. I wouldn't be surprised if we haven't heard the last of this is my way of -- my very clumsy way of saying this. I wouldn't be surprised if they do actually down the pass revoke somebody's hard pass and use this set of rules as at criteria."

I'm actually surprised that the White House Correspondents Association didn't have them in force prior to this. Jim Acosta being the mascot for the White House press corps is not good for the White House press corps. So it seems like a win all around for everybody.
