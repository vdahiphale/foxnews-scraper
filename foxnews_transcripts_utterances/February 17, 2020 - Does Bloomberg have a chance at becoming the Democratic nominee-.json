Welcome to this busy news night, special Presidents Day edition of \"Hannity.\" As we do the job the media mob will never do, we expose the radical left that has taken over this Democratic Party, a lot of news tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Coming up in a few moments, we will have all the highlights from the president's big weekend at the Daytona 500. He became the first president in American history to take a lap in -- well, we call it \"The Beast\" and for good reason. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, let's turn it over to an important \"Hannity\" 2020 investigation tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, with quid pro quo Joe's embarrassing campaign imploding, Democratic Party, they thought they had Plan B. And, by the way, that name was Michael Bloomberg. The former New York City mayor has unlimited resources. He has already spent, according to \"The Washington Examiner\", over $417 million up to this point in what is really been nothing more than a slick marketing ad campaign. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, The New York Post is calling it the \"Wizard of Oz\" campaign where his record is hiding behind the curtain. And tonight, as we are about to reveal, that record is sick, it is beyond disturbing. In fact, a brand new report, \"The Washington Post\" has compiled a series of shocking allegations from various lawsuits, other accounts, including one legal complaint from a woman who said Bloomberg encouraged her to get an abortion so she wouldn't miss work, just kill it, his words, 1995. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } After she informed him he was pregnant, he allegedly responded, quote, \"kill it\". The plaintiff asked Bloomberg to repeat himself and again, he said, \"kill it\". And then muttered, \"Great. Number 16,\" suggesting to the plaintiff that he was unhappy that 16 women in the company had maternity- related status. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Kill it? Response to an employee announcing something as amazing and beautiful and wonderful as pregnancy? There's more. According to the complaint, in 1993, Bloomberg is accused of making some, also, other reprehensible comments to an employee who had just given birth and was having trouble finding child care. In front of her colleagues, Bloomberg allegedly yelled, quote: It's a bleeping baby. All it does is eat and bleep. It doesn't know the difference between you and anyone else. All you need is some black who doesn't even have to speak English to rescue it from a burning building. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Bloomberg denied making these remarks, but it does fit a terrible pattern that is now merging. There is now ample evidence of Bloomberg's vile, arrogant, elitist, and at times downright racist rhetoric, including his disgusting comments from 2015 when he said, oh, the only way to prevent crime is to throw minority kids up against the wall and frisk them. And, by the way, as he put it, all the police, well, were there in minority neighborhoods, were only arresting kids for marijuana smoking, only minority kids, because that's where all the crime is. And criminals, yes, murderers, and murder victims, fit one M.O., take the description, Xerox it, pass it out to all the cops. Wow. Pretty sick stuff.

Former President Barack Obama took to Twitter today to try and take at it for the booming Trump economy, tweeting, quote: Eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in the generation, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history. OK, you're not going to get away with that. Let me just give you the facts after eight years of Biden and Obama, because I have them, and they're right at our fingertips. Eight million more Americans in poverty, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, lowest home ownership rate, President Obama, and 51 years, the worst recovery since the `40s. And you accumulated more debt than any every other president before you combined. The Trump campaign not taking it lightly. We have Kayleigh McEnany firing back, saying, quote: President Trump reversed every single failed Obama era economic policy and with it reversed the floundering Obama-Biden economy. Obama-Biden orchestrated the worst economic recovery in modern history. She's absolutely correct. And unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening. Happy Presidents' Day. We hope you set your DVR so you never miss an episode. We'll never be the rage, hate, psychotic mob. We seek the truth. And let not your hearts be troubled. Laura Ingraham is up next.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to this busy news night, special Presidents Day edition of \"Hannity.\" As we do the job the media mob will never do, we expose the radical left that has taken over this Democratic Party, a lot of news tonight. Coming up in a few moments, we will have all the highlights from the president's big weekend at the Daytona 500. He became the first president in American history to take a lap in -- well, we call it \"The Beast\" and for good reason. But first, let's turn it over to an important \"Hannity\" 2020 investigation tonight. So, with quid pro quo Joe's embarrassing campaign imploding, Democratic Party, they thought they had Plan B. And, by the way, that name was Michael Bloomberg. The former New York City mayor has unlimited resources. He has already spent, according to \"The Washington Examiner\", over $417 million up to this point in what is really been nothing more than a slick marketing ad campaign. And, by the way, The New York Post is calling it the \"Wizard of Oz\" campaign where his record is hiding behind the curtain. And tonight, as we are about to reveal, that record is sick, it is beyond disturbing. In fact, a brand new report, \"The Washington Post\" has compiled a series of shocking allegations from various lawsuits, other accounts, including one legal complaint from a woman who said Bloomberg encouraged her to get an abortion so she wouldn't miss work, just kill it, his words, 1995. After she informed him he was pregnant, he allegedly responded, quote, \"kill it\". The plaintiff asked Bloomberg to repeat himself and again, he said, \"kill it\". And then muttered, \"Great. Number 16,\" suggesting to the plaintiff that he was unhappy that 16 women in the company had maternity- related status. Kill it? Response to an employee announcing something as amazing and beautiful and wonderful as pregnancy? There's more. According to the complaint, in 1993, Bloomberg is accused of making some, also, other reprehensible comments to an employee who had just given birth and was having trouble finding child care."

All you need is some black who doesn't even have to speak English to rescue it from a burning building. Bloomberg denied making these remarks, but it does fit a terrible pattern that is now merging. There is now ample evidence of Bloomberg's vile, arrogant, elitist, and at times downright racist rhetoric, including his disgusting comments from 2015 when he said, oh, the only way to prevent crime is to throw minority kids up against the wall and frisk them. And, by the way, as he put it, all the police, well, were there in minority neighborhoods, were only arresting kids for marijuana smoking, only minority kids, because that's where all the crime is. And criminals, yes, murderers, and murder victims, fit one M.O., take the description, Xerox it, pass it out to all the cops. Wow. Pretty sick stuff. Listen."

He says it. Listen."

You know, you show up with prostate cancer and you're 95 years old, and we should say, go and enjoy, have a nice day, live a long life. There's no cure and you can't do anything. If you're a young person, we should do something about it. Society is not willing to do that yet."

He'd hire every doctor he could find, he utilized every procedure available to extend his life. But, of course, he's not going to be applying the same standard to his fellow elderly Americans who rely on Medicare. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. In addition to making insulting remarks about elderly, minorities, women, Bloomberg -- well, by the way, looks down on American farmers in what is some of the most arrogant language and ignorant language I've ever heard. Forget that we have the most advanced agriculture farmers, workers anywhere in the world. Farming in today's America is beyond a sophisticated science. You study it in college. We're blessed to have the best farmers on earth. Bloomberg thinks, oh, anyone could do it. You just throw a little seed in the ground, you cover it up with some dirt, you give it some water. Really? Think it's that easy, Mike? Why don't you try it? Now, to be in Bloomberg's world, farmers are dumb. He says they need more gray matter, brain matter between their ears. Wow. This is shocking and frankly repulsive. Take a listen."

You -- it's a process. So, you dig a hole, you put up the seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. Then we had -- you could learn that. And the information economy is fundamentally different because it's built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different -- you have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter."

You need more gray matter, that's what you need. Wow, you talk about an ivory tower of elitism, Bloomberg has actually no idea, zero idea obviously what goes on in the highly technical, sophisticated, advanced American agricultural industry that feeds all of us and a big portion of the world as well. This level of ignorance is shocking, it's appalling. His condescension is almost breathtaking and unbelievable. His priorities completely absurd. During (ph) comments about illegal immigration in 2006 -- catch this -- Bloomberg told a friend of mine, John Gumbley (ph), oh, well, you like golf, I like golf, well, who's going to take care of the greens and then cut the fairways in the golf course? You know, however, will his precious fairways and greens get mowed. And, by the way, for the record -- Mike, wake up. You know the level of knowledge that is needed to be a good groundskeeper, greenskeeper. There's sophisticated science behind all that. And by the way, a good greenskeeper gets paid a fortune. Why? Because very few people can do a good job at it. And, by the way, now wants open borders. Went on Spanish-language TV, open borders, pathway to citizenship for those that didn't, you know, respect our laws, sovereignty, borders. Forget the tens of thousands of Americans killed every year, they don't close the borders from let's say -- oh, the 90 percent of heroin that comes in this country crosses the southern border, the fentanyl crisis at our southern border, Americans killed by violent cartels or the extreme financial burden that illegal immigration is costing we, the American people. Why? So he could have cheap labor so his greens get taken care of and his fairways get cut well? Well, they got to remain in peak condition, that's his priority. Bloomberg is so painful -- so painfully out of touch, even when he tries to relate to voters, he comes off as frankly -- I hate to say it -- weird and beyond arrogant. Watch."

So, let's recap the brand new savior of the radical, extreme Democratic socialist party -- look at your screen -- he's accused of making disparaging remarks about women in the workplace, especially women that are expecting -- well, a beautiful child to be born. And, by the way, disparaging women with young children. Far worse, comments about women that I can't say on television. He's trashed minorities and minority neighborhoods continually, basically admits that he only wanted crime look for in minority neighborhoods, insinuating that farmers need more gray matter and are stupid. He's now supporting illegal immigration. Why? To have cheap labor to take care of his greens and mow his fairways. And he has the stage presence and charisma paint drying on the wall. But wait, it's not all. According to an exclusive report from Matt Drudge -- let's go for the trifecta -- Bloomberg seriously considering tapping twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as his running mate. His campaign has already hired a top Clinton ally. It looks like the person in need of more gray matter would be Bloomberg himself. It does appear at least one person is reportedly excited about the prospect of a Bloomberg-Hillary ticket -- that's Hillary Clinton. And make no mistake, the Democratic Party is in that level of complete and utter chaos and desperation. Here with more, our own Trace Gallagher -- Trace."

He's -- they're teasing this out because they need to buttress Bloomberg's identity with the Democrat Party because he can't run on the economy. As you said, the Trump economy is humming. That's his core issue. That's what Bloomberg would run on, but he can't.

They want what everyone else wants which is a great future for their family, which is you know an end to wars, an end to the nature of this division in the country, and this is an invaluable revelation beyond this next election. It's about who are we going to become as a country.

But what people I think are forgetting is, Mike Bloomberg is a really terrible politician. He's not very good at relating to people. He doesn't connect with people. And sure, those commercials, they look great, that's fine, well and dandy. But campaigning is something different and the second he gets on our debate stage or he has to actually talk to regular people, I think that -- I think that that whole facade is going to fall apart.

Donald Trump loves people. Mike Bloomberg doesn't like anybody but Mike Bloomberg, and it just exudes everything he talks about, whether he's talking about farmers or women or young kids in the city who, you know, you know, for how many years did he embrace stop-and-frisk because he said that it saved black lives."

Now, it comes as the attorney general, Bill Barr, continues to deliver on his promise to restore DOJ integrity and it's why you see Russia hoaxsters like Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann all out there playing defense for his friends in the deep state. But, of course, Democrats, they don't seem to care about any of this. You know, what is obvious, one of the biggest corruption and abuse of power scandals in history.

The four front-line Mueller prosecutors were asking for a seven to nine years sentence that was totally unjustified. There was no threat to a witness that would justify increasing the three-and-a-half to four-and-a- half recommendations from the guidelines.

But -- and Michael Avenatti, I mean, just looking at him and listening to him, he was like you're sort of refugee from the set of prison break. I mean, he just screamed sleazeball and every time I saw this guy and he was popping up on cable news, not FOX, I might add, but on CNN and MSNBC, maybe every two three times a day. And they were treating him like he was this extraordinary superman-like savior who had come to rescue the world from devastating Donald Trump. And yet the more he talked, the more it was clear was never about his client Stormy Daniels who he completely, in my view, destroyed, you know, he destroyed her reputation, he destroyed her life. He seems -- took her money. And rather look after his client, what he was doing was really bolstering himself and making himself out to be something which he was eminently unqualified to be. And I think it's a stain on the U.S. media who fell for this. Time and again, Sean, they pumped this guy up on the airways as if he was something special.

But I honestly watch it sometimes and I'm my mouth is on the floor because I -- when I was there, you were not allowed to be this partisan. You weren't allowed to be sneering all the time in an obvious politically skewed way. And I get they don't like President Trump. They don't have to like President Trump, but I also get that there has to be, surely, some semblance of an attempt at impartiality or fairness. And I think it's all gone out of the water. Trump delivers massive ratings for these networks. He delivers massive circulation numbers for papers up in New York Times and others, and they know they're getting all that money and all that attention and all those viewers and so on, they're getting them with a constant diet of Trump-bashing. And to feed that beast, they need people like Michael Avenatti to come on, morning, noon and night, and to say what a monster Donald Trump is. Now, I don't think Donald Trump is perfect. He has his flaws but he's not the person that they keep telling all their viewers all day long that he is.
