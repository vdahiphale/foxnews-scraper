With prices spiking for everything from gasoline and used cars to fruits and vegetables, even Oreo cookies, Democrats are reportedly pushing the message that their more than $4 trillion in proposed spending is a way to help families and that a nearly 5.5. percent spike in inflation is just temporary. But is it? Welcome, everyone. I`m Sandra Smith, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" Coming up, we will speak to Republican Senator Thom Tillis about all of that. But first to David Spunt. He`s reporting live from Washington. He`s got the very latest from there. Hi, David.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Sandra. Big story. Democrats are looking at the temporary spending burden for millions of Americans as, well, temporary. They believe that this is a marathon not a sprint, and, ultimately, the higher spending will help more Americans than hurt them. Citing a private White House presentation obtained by NBC News, Democratic lawmakers are encouraged to focus on how the president`s $3 trillion-plus human infrastructure plan helps out working families by lowering costs, instead of getting people back to work or maybe even helping the economy. The Consumer Price Index, measuring what people pay for goods and services, as you mentioned, increased by 5 percent from about a year ago. The president is counting on a bipartisan infrastructure plan to eventually help the economy. Republicans are continuing to make inflation an issue, arguing that the president and Democrats` spending in Congress is reckless and ultimately that increased spending will hurt where it counts, at the grocery stores and at those gas pumps. Inflation is at its highest in the past 13 years. Economists, though, are concerned it won`t just disappear either in the next few weeks or few months. The ultimate message from Democrats, stay the course, stay calm. The spending more overall will actually cost less for working families. And, of course, Sandra, as you know, the clock is ticking, Democrats and Republicans set to leave for the August recess. So both sides are hoping to get something done as soon as possible -- Sandra.",

And there will be winners and losers. The people who are getting the money are the winners. The people like senior citizens who are living on fixed pension programs, lower-income people may not get -- they may not have children. They may not get the benefits. Those people are really hurt by this. And the problem the Fed has right now is, what options does the Fed have? As we continue to put out this debt spending, the only way that we will be able to pay for it is by getting the printing presses to print more dollars. There`s no other option, because we know we don`t have the growth to cover the spending. And, by the way, only about 20 percent of the money in that infrastructure bill is even roads and highways.

There`s no question in our -- in my mind that COVID has really forced more of a digitization of this economy, how people get educated, how people get their information. We need to help unserved and underserved areas for broadband. That`s about $65 billion. The majority of the resources that I`m most focused on are roads and bridges, which we desperately need to expand, to address congestion, to address safety. It will create good-paying jobs. And we will have an economic return. The infrastructure bill that they`re referring to, they`re being dishonest with the American people. There`s very little in the way of infrastructure in the $3 trillion-plus package that they`re proposing. It would create entitlements. It would create, I think, an upward pressure on inflation.

It is going to affect the long-term costs in products. It is going to affect inflation. And it could ultimately have an upward -- if the Fed does ultimately react, it could have an upward impact on interest rates. And we could be in a situation where we could be spending as much as a trillion dollars a year serving our national debt right now and -- servicing our national debt. That is a financial disaster waiting to happen, which is why we hope that by -- on a bipartisan basis, getting this infrastructure package in, we can set it aside.

Chicago cut 400 police positions last year, while it spent $3.4 million private security for -- quote -- \"unnamed city officials.\" Shootings there are up 10 percent over a year ago. In San Francisco, officials plan to divest $120 million from the police over two years, while they spent $2.6 million last year on the mayor security detail.

It wants to poach high-producing brokers -- those people that handle rich people`s money -- from other places like Morgan Stanley. And one of its recruiting tools, in addition to maybe more money, but another recruiting tool is, guess what, guys? If you come to -- and gals -- if you come to work for us, if you leave Morgan Stanley -- that`s the biggest brokerage firm, considered the sort of gold standard in the brokerage business -- well, we will let you work from home or do whatever you want.

Morgan or Goldman, all of which have really have taken a much harder line on people coming back to the office. They can probably do that and still keep most of their people. But, certainly, the other firms who are allowing a little more flexibility are appealing to the new generation on Wall Street. There is a new generation. And they are talking about lifestyle.

They believe that this is a marathon not a sprint, and, ultimately, the higher spending will help more Americans than hurt them. Citing a private White House presentation obtained by NBC News, Democratic lawmakers are encouraged to focus on how the president`s $3 trillion-plus human infrastructure plan helps out working families by lowering costs, instead of getting people back to work or maybe even helping the economy. The Consumer Price Index, measuring what people pay for goods and services, as you mentioned, increased by 5 percent from about a year ago. The president is counting on a bipartisan infrastructure plan to eventually help the economy. Republicans are continuing to make inflation an issue, arguing that the president and Democrats` spending in Congress is reckless and ultimately that increased spending will hurt where it counts, at the grocery stores and at those gas pumps. Inflation is at its highest in the past 13 years. Economists, though, are concerned it won`t just disappear either in the next few weeks or few months. The ultimate message from Democrats, stay the course, stay calm. The spending more overall will actually cost less for working families. And, of course, Sandra, as you know, the clock is ticking, Democrats and Republicans set to leave for the August recess. So both sides are hoping to get something done as soon as possible -- Sandra."

In fact, I got to tell you, Sandra, when I watched Joe Biden in that town hall meeting, when he said this is going to lower inflation, I almost dropped off my chair. And, look, Americans know this is not complicated.

These -- just because you have -- the price of groceries goes up doesn`t mean that you don`t fix your leaky roof. In America, our house has a leaky roof. We need that infrastructure bill. We need that help with eldercare. Women need that child care help. And we have seen the impact .

So, look, if you print $4 trillion more, and drop it out of helicopter windows, which is essentially what we`re doing, then, obviously, that`s going to lead to higher prices. And there will be winners and losers. The people who are getting the money are the winners. The people like senior citizens who are living on fixed pension programs, lower-income people may not get -- they may not have children. They may not get the benefits. Those people are really hurt by this. And the problem the Fed has right now is, what options does the Fed have? As we continue to put out this debt spending, the only way that we will be able to pay for it is by getting the printing presses to print more dollars. There`s no other option, because we know we don`t have the growth to cover the spending. And, by the way, only about 20 percent of the money in that infrastructure bill is even roads and highways. It`s green energy projects. It`s money for electric vehicles. It`s things that we shouldn`t be spending."

He also has thrown into question his own analysis, saying that there`s still a high degree of uncertainty in terms of his own claims. So I would say this. We have got to make long-term investments in America. The infrastructure bill does. The relief package that`s already been passed does that.

There`s no question in our -- in my mind that COVID has really forced more of a digitization of this economy, how people get educated, how people get their information. We need to help unserved and underserved areas for broadband. That`s about $65 billion. The majority of the resources that I`m most focused on are roads and bridges, which we desperately need to expand, to address congestion, to address safety. It will create good-paying jobs. And we will have an economic return. The infrastructure bill that they`re referring to, they`re being dishonest with the American people. There`s very little in the way of infrastructure in the $3 trillion-plus package that they`re proposing. It would create entitlements. It would create, I think, an upward pressure on inflation.

All of them have said and financial experts far more experienced than me say that, if we flood the zone with this additional $4 trillion to $4 trillion in spending, it`s not going to end well. It is going to affect the long-term costs in products. It is going to affect inflation. And it could ultimately have an upward -- if the Fed does ultimately react, it could have an upward impact on interest rates. And we could be in a situation where we could be spending as much as a trillion dollars a year serving our national debt right now and -- servicing our national debt. That is a financial disaster waiting to happen, which is why we hope that by -- on a bipartisan basis, getting this infrastructure package in, we can set it aside. And then the president and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi can sell this additional spending spree and the reckless taxes that will come with it. That`s something else we haven`t spoken about. We have got to remember it`s corporate taxes, capital gains. Family farmers are going to get hit hard.

Take a look at this example. Chicago cut 400 police positions last year, while it spent $3.4 million private security for -- quote -- \"unnamed city officials.\" Shootings there are up 10 percent over a year ago. In San Francisco, officials plan to divest $120 million from the police over two years, while they spent $2.6 million last year on the mayor security detail. And in Baltimore, the city eliminated about $22 million from its police budget, as the city spent $3.6 million private security.

And they say, man, we`re at the threshold, so we don`t have to worry about this. So we can walk out. And nobody -- they go on out of the store unchallenged. So they go -- everybody blames the police. Well, the police cannot get involved if the store security doesn`t get involved. And increasing store security isn`t going to do anything, right, because they just stand there and they watch them go out. Some of the retails have decided to close some of their stores. Good for them. But who pays the price on this? Think about it. The local consumer is going to pay the price for everything that`s stolen, because the price is going to go higher.

But if you just don`t enforce it, then you have the same -- the same issue here. We`re hoping that at least Governor Abbott has stepped up more than any governor the United States has ever done on trying to put some kind of process and stabilize the border to some degree. So we applaud that. The infancy of the program right now, so we`re -- the numbers are still low. And there`s -- there will be some migrant movement, I`m sure, to try and thwart those measures that the governor has put in place. But at least it`s the effort that counts here. And that`s what we`re most proud of here, as Texas law enforcement, where we have our governor fighting for us and fighting for our citizens here, with the federal administration that could care less."

Those were not just single males in that particular group. Those were Haitians and Venezuelans. You`re looking at 4,000 people in the Donna facility right now that`s supposed to hold 800. None of these numbers are going down. They`re simply going up. They`re more and more people coming. This administration has created the largest catastrophic issues on our southern border that`s ever happened before in the United States.

Morgan Stanley calling for most of its workers to return to the office full time. FOX Business` Charlie Gasparino has the scoop. He is joined by FOX News contributor Liz Peek. So, Charlie, I feel like it`s something everyone`s talking about. Are you going back to work? How long have you been back to work? But this is becoming a major recruiting tool.

But it`s interesting. And it`s becoming much more typical. UBS is a brokerage firm. It`s seeking to grow. It wants to poach high-producing brokers -- those people that handle rich people`s money -- from other places like Morgan Stanley. And one of its recruiting tools, in addition to maybe more money, but another recruiting tool is, guess what, guys? If you come to -- and gals -- if you come to work for us, if you leave Morgan Stanley -- that`s the biggest brokerage firm, considered the sort of gold standard in the brokerage business -- well, we will let you work from home or do whatever you want. Or, if you want to come in, you could come in as well. It`s up to you. It`s very flexible if you`re a broker dealing with clients."

And so this is one thing that UBS can do. But I would note, Sandra, UBS is not as highly regarded a platform as Morgan Stanley or J.P. Morgan or Goldman, all of which have really have taken a much harder line on people coming back to the office. They can probably do that and still keep most of their people. But, certainly, the other firms who are allowing a little more flexibility are appealing to the new generation on Wall Street. There is a new generation. And they are talking about lifestyle. And part of that has to do with flexibility and being able to work from home. The thing is, we have seen over the past year that people can be very productive doing that. So, they have a pretty good case to make."

Biden wants to spend another $4 trillion, and he`s arguing that that will bring prices down. Sandra, I don`t know anybody who thinks that`s actually realistic. And so, yes, I think people are beginning to worry about the cost of everyday goods going up. And, by the way, the White House has changed its messaging.

And while these type of job openings are usually a big draw for teenagers looking for summer work, a new report by global outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas shows that number -- the number of teen jobs added in June was at its lowest since 2015. So what`s keeping teens from more of these jobs? Internet radio host Mike Gunzelman and FOX News contributor Kat Timpf joins us now. OK, for now, I will go first to Gunz. Gunz, you`re joining us. Why are teenagers not applying for these jobs? Why are they not filling these positions?"

And a lot of the locals were saying that it`s been hard to try and find lifeguards or people to work the boardwalks or board games this summer. But I kind of had a different opinion maybe they Kat and others, because I don`t think that this is because teenagers are lazy. It`s not like they`re getting stimulus checks like adults are that just don`t want to go to work because, hey, they`re making money at home. I think that this is more so the local governments and board of eds have scared and frightened kids. You think all year long they could go -- they couldn`t play sports. Many of them couldn`t go to outside graduations. They couldn`t have their prom in May."

    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Kat, is Gunz letting them off too easy? And why aren`t these teenagers applying for jobs? Apparently, the outplacement firm that did this survey says that the Delta variant is to blame. It`s making it hard for some people in some areas of the country where there`s a spike in cases. That is keeping teens out of these mostly in person positions. Is that what you see from your view?"

    {
      "speaker": "KATHERINE TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Look, I don`t think teens are all lazy. I think, if anything, I would never say that because I`m pretty scared of teens. I don`t know. I see teens out. And I`m like -- I just feel like they`re going to make fun of me. They`re always on skateboards. They always look cool. Very scared of teens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "But I really think, honestly, that is probably part of it. Really, if you -- people are really still concerned about this and the Delta variant., And, also, maybe some of these teens aren`t vaccinated. I know 16 and up, that is available to you. But if you`re still a teenager living at home, that`s going to be a decision that you`re going to make with your parents. Maybe you`re still concerned about that. And it does seem like a little bit of mixed messaging. As Gunz put it, OK, no proms, no school. You haven`t been in school for over a year, but go out and work. I`m really not sure, because it`s not like there`s really much to do. There`s -- I mean, there`s restaurants are open. Some areas are more open than others. But travel is still a little questionable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Gunz, we`re -- we are -- we depend on that group of teenagers in the work force, because many of them do fill some of those minimum wage- paying jobs, whether it`s at restaurants or small businesses. And they make up a good chunk of our economy. So, if they`re not working, can this economy fully recover, especially when we see signs like this all over the country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUNZELMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, this is what we are going to have to deal with, that many restaurants are dealing with this. The fact is that, listen, teenagers want money. Like teenagers, I really don`t think have a problem working. It`s not like they`re working 40 hours a week, 20, 25 hours. They want all the money they can get. But this is the situation that we`re in, because this is what the government -- or this is just what`s happened to us, that we`re kind of hesitant to fully go back to working at 100 percent, especially the younger you go, with no vaccine for 15-year-olds."
