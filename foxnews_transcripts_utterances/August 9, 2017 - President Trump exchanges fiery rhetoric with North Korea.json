Whenever there's a nut case looking at me on the subway at the R Line, I talk to myself loudly. I appear nuttier than a nut. He usually moves because I'm not worth the risk and frankly, I smell. Now, we know North Korea does crazy better than anybody but so does Donald Trump, which is good. Let's look at North Korea, now let's zoom out. That's 25 million people living in a dark hole. Existing like a raccoon under your house for decades. That raccoon isn't nuts but acts that way to keep you from trying to kill it. So it lives in the dark as the rest of the world rolls merrily on. The question is, has this raccoon gone batty or is it simply displaying a strategic irrationality? Snarling to keep everyone at bay? My sense is if we do nothing, they do nothing but if they do something, it's over for them. So maybe they won't. I mean, do you think they're going to risk it all on Guam? Nope. The raccoon stays in its whole while Trump speaks to them in raccoon. So I say instead, worry about the truly apocalyptic, those who believe martyrdom Trumps life. All they need is a dirty bomb and a chance. North Korea is truly a risk but radical Islam, that's the ruin. Dana, you almost took a job in Guam. What a Guam do to deserve this? I feel bad for Guam. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, \"THE FIVE\": I do too. Yes, when I first let them college, a graduate school, I was looking for a in local television and there was a job going as a news reader in Guam at the base.

MARIE HARF, GUEST CO-HOST, \"THE FIVE\": Well, I'm not sure the Trump has a plan for having to meet in the middle here and that's a really complicated thing that all administrations for decades have tried. The problem for me with his rhetoric is that he sort of backed himself into a corner here because he's almost promising very escalatory what would be very dangerous military action and there are no good military options. They're all very ugly. Or if he doesn't do anything it's almost like it's shown to be an empty threat. And I don't know if he doesn't..."

I think he meant to say it. That's exactly how he feels and I'm sure that if they try to persuade him, it appears that they were largely unsuccessful.

They fired up more missiles under it and more than any other president in the U.S. history. They accelerated their nuclear program while Obama was speaking deliberately with very diplomatic tones. I think what happened also under Barack Obama, he crippled our missile defense system, went from 9 billion to 7 billion, could use some of that though. Bill Clinton also shares some responsibility here too. He gave the North Koreans $5 billion and said that they were going to freeze and dismantle their nuclear program and the U.N. was going to inspect it. Well, how did that work out? Not so well. Trump, being unpredictable I think is a big asset, I think before the North Koreans knew what President Obama was going to do, which was going to be nothing. Now there's a new sheriff in town and I think the language is directed not only at Korea but also China. And for the democrats who have been itching for a fight with Russia over the last six months or so, so now say Trump's rhetoric or North Korea's over the line please. They have called Vladimir Putin a murderous thug butcher who declared an act of war on the United States and we needed to bomb the KGB as a result. And some of these same senators putting out all these statements about Trump's rhetoric never put out any statement when the North Korea's fired a missile that could've hit Los Angeles. And remember, these muscles are aimed at L.A., in San Francisco, OK? Trump is trying to protect all Americans, not republicans, not democrats. I think the country needs to come together now and face the real threat, not Donald Trump, North Korea."

He says that unless we decide what we want then we're just negotiating for more negotiating and that gives time for your adversary to achieve their ends. So the question you have to ask is before you negotiate is what do you want? And actually, you know, what do we want? You know what, America doesn't want a war."

No president would want to have that and nobody wants -- he's not going to be able to pass this problem on in its current form to another president. That happened actually under Clinton, Bush, and Obama and in fact, on the first day that they met President Obama told President Trump -- President-elect Trump, \"The toughest problem I am leaving for you is North Korea and I am sorry about it but here we have it.\" The concern I think is on the intel side of things, at that meeting, President Trump said something -- I'm sorry, President Obama said, \"In your term, it is likely that this will come up and become to bear.\" OK, that would be four years. This happened in five months. So our intel is difficult to get because we don't have any assets on the ground and the intel that we had was wrong. If indeed they are now to map it. Smaller missiles on ICBMs."

      "utterance": "Well, I think going for to the intel for a second there is disagreement in the intelligence committee about whether they can actually do it. So one thing we need to do is to really focus on getting intel that speaks to that crucial issue, I think, but we have to do all of the above. We have to keep putting economic pressure especially on China. I think China holds the key here unfortunately, to whether we can actually get some progress in North Korea because even you have the head of special operations command yesterday I think saying every military option is incredibly ugly. And, you know, the Obama administration did deploy missile defense to Korea. We deployed it to Guam, our favorite topic tonight. We did deploy it to deal with North Korea. We have to do more of that but it's not perfect. It's not a failsafe end all be all."

This is horrific conditions there. So yes, they're hoping that we are going to say wait, the cost is too high and of course when you look at it from any military calculation, it is extreme and it is ominous and that's why, you know, great care must be taken and I think that's why there is the criticism of the rhetoric that was used, has been called bombastic, et cetera, but again, I think if the president had to do it over, he'd do it again."

All these documents related to the investigation into the Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. This suggest Special Counsel Robert Mueller has turned up the heat on Manafort directly. The federal agents were armed with a search warrant and they went to Alexander at home during the predawn hours of July 26. The timing is significant, it was one day after Manafort met voluntarily with members of the senate intelligence committee. People familiar with the investigation told the Washington Post, the search warrant was an indication and that investigators may have had reason to believe Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all of the records that had been requested in response to a grand jury subpoena. Now, the spokesman from Manafort pushed back. Jason Maloney told Fox, \"FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Manafort's residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well.\" But, our own Fox chief judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said, the move suggest to him that investigators may believe there is a crime there, they may have persuaded a federal judge, there was good reason for this search."

Manafort resigned last summer, mid questions about his business dealings in Ukraine. And Dana, you and I were talking about this on the story earlier. Why is it leaking now since this raid happened in late July? The raid could've been a signal to Paul Manafort that they have something and they're trying to zero in on him but leaking it now could also be a signal maybe to other people involved in the case, other people, Manafort met with other people, you might have had dealings with that they mean business here, Dana."

He's represented rebel groups in Africa and now lately, he's been dealing with a lot of Ukrainian politicians and that's why the democrats are trying to expose him to the Russian angle. So Trump brings him in for just a few months to wind up the delegates for the conventions, that's what he specialized in and he did it for Bush 41, he did it for Dole. And so, now apparently who was also at that meeting with Trump Jr. with the Russian woman. So, they raid his house. Who knows what they're going to find, you know?

Cheerleading, comes with a risk, drinking with Uncle Greg is a risk but cheerleading has a lot of injuries.

Who is this, Book of Tailor -- exclusively tailored for Watters world? My man Jackamo, who we worked with here at Fox News, so he hooked me up with this jacket, if you want to look like this, Book at Tailor. I'm going to go with the Cheeto's look, so Jackamo if you are listening, I want like an orange Cheetos flavor, all right."

She is a former Fox colleague. There she is. That is from her briefing today, much of it was on North Korea. My one more thing is it's a really tough job. It's a very demanding one and she is by far the best spokesperson the administration has and they are not using her enough."

A goat, the greatest of all time, look at him. He is fantastic. He jumped onto the cruiser because they were looking for a lost pony. It happens all the time. You are looking for a lost pony and a goat climbs on the car and they got him off but he comes back. That is what goats do. They get your goats."
