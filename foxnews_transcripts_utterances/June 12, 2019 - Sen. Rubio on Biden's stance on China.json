They are by definition above the law. We can't punish them, Democrats tell us -- that would be racist. Drug dealers, too, they are suddenly above the law as well according to the left, so are people who defecate on sidewalks and people who spray paint overpasses, people who shoot up in subway stations and leave dirty needles in parks. All crimes are no longer allowed to acknowledge as crimes. Huge new classes of people who are literally above the law. And this category is growing, thanks to the activists left. Just last night in the State of Virginia, prosecutors backed by George Soros unseated incumbents in two large counties outside Washington, D.C. Both candidates have pledged to roll back criminal enforcement in a massive way. They will, among other things, abolish cash bail, stop enforcing drug laws, put more criminals back on the street. This kind of thing is happening all over the country getting very little coverage. In Philadelphia, the murder rate is the highest it has been in a decade. Why is that? Well, a Soros-backed prosecutor called Larry Krasner stopped enforcing the law. Meanwhile, a left-wing DA in Dallas announced he will stop prosecuting people for most kinds of theft. In Dallas, thieves are now above the law. Beto O'Rourke approves of this trend, not only should we legalize marijuana, Beto says, we ought to retroactively expunge the criminal records of everyone who broke the law while it existed."

What you're watching from the left is really an attack on society itself. The basic bargain in any society is straightforward. People who follow the rules get rewarded, people who don't get punished. If you get rid of that standard, then everything inverts. Suddenly, power flows to the worst people in your society, the most ruthless and aggressive. Decent law-abiding people, meanwhile, are mocked. They're just suckers who can be exploited by everyone else. That's where you get, that's where we're heading, by the way and fast. It's pretty obvious when you look around. The threads are framed. It's coming apart. Hundreds of years of hard work and self-discipline designed to create what we used to call civilization before the term civilization was deemed racist. The people doing this to us won't have to live with the consequences of it. That's their guess. They are decadent morons who've never lived in a tough neighborhood.

Some of them actually are reasonable though, criminal justice reform is actually something that has support in both parties. Of course, President Trump signed a law that just reformed the criminal justice system, so there is some support for that. But some of the more unreasonable things are like trying to grant voting rights to felons. I think there's some arguments that if a felon demonstrates that he has changed, that he is reformed, and he replies for voting rights some number of years after he serves his sentence, there might be an argument there, but to immediately give felons the right to vote, I don't agree with that. And to allow felons who are in jail, which some people propose to vote, that is something I certainly don't agree with."

There are good reasons for it to be a crime. We need to protect our property, we need to protect lawfulness. That's certainly an aspect of rule of law. You can't decriminalize theft.

Nothing moves through our legislators, they don't vote on anything. If you elect prosecutors who are committed to not enforcing the law, then you've changed the law. The law is inoperative if you see what I'm saying."

      "speaker": "TAFURI",
      "utterance": "But prosecutors always have some prosecutorial discretion whether to charge a crime or not charge a crime, and then the people can vote that prosecutor out in the next election cycle if they don't like it.

I can't remember the last time I heard a Democratic politician stand up for like a normal person with a job, who is married and has kids. And it's just like, the people who built the country, actually, of all races and ethnic groups. It's not a racial question. It's a question behavior, people who kind of buy into the system and try their hardest. Those people don't seem to have any representation at all in the Democratic Party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFURI",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't understand the point of some of these proposals. They don't make any sense. Certainly, some of it is pandering to voters trying to create new areas of voters, new people who might vote for you. You know, I hate to be cynical like that. But I think that's definitely part of it. And then part of it like decriminalizing marijuana, there is a trend towards decriminalizing marijuana. Many states across the country have already decriminalized marijuana. So there's also an effort to then say that people who were prosecuted in the past and convicted of marijuana charges should have those cleared from their record. There's some policy argument for that. I personally don't support that. It was illegal then, if you got convicted, it should stay on your record. But I see some reasonableness to that argument. Some of the things that are less reasonable, like getting rid of theft, that doesn't make any sense at all, letting many people who are not citizens to vote. That doesn't make any sense at all to me, either."

Joe Biden has all but promised that he will pick her for Vice President if he wins the Democratic nomination. Instead of being grateful for that, because it's kind of quite a promotion, Abrams says that she's insulted. Abrams told \"The Guardian,\" quote, \"I think it is deeply problematic ...\" We should note parenthetically, she went to Yale Law School, that's how they talked -- deeply problematic -- \" ... that there will be discussion of relegating any woman to the role of second when the primary has yet to fully take shape. I think it's a reflection again of this notion of what leadership looks like.\" In other words, it's racist.

He loved and frequently visited the Dominican Republic.\" The hotel where he was staying is unknown at this point. The State Department also confirming it. We, Tucker, are in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic here at the U.S. Embassy. We came to talk to them about this string of deaths. They're unable to get on camera because of the ongoing investigation by Dominican officials that the U.S. is assisting including the FBI. But they wanted to stress that their highest priority is the safety and security of Americans. But really since we've been here, we've got a look at what we've seen and it's much to give pause to Americans considering visiting here. The dangers include first the robbery that happened just minutes after we landed here on Sunday of slugger David Ortiz, a legend and hero not only in Boston, but here in the Dominican Republic. He was shot at the El Dial Bar and Lounge just 15 kilometers from where I stand. Right now up to six people have been taken into custody in this investigation. There have been robberies here, including one member of our team fortunately not hurt, just some valuables. But we're told that is far too common on the streets of the Dominican Republic. And of course these mysterious deaths and the coincidences that we found. Three of the now seven deaths reportedly directly linked to the minibar. We took you inside that Hard Rock Cafe in Punta Cana, where Robert Bell Wallace in April, reportedly took a drink of scotch from the minibar just similar to the one you're looking at here on the screen. His niece, Chloe saying that he died shortly thereafter. And then another across about an hour away in La Romana. But here's the bottom line. Where does things stand? And we were told that the Dominican officials' investigation could take up to 30 days and they're asking for patience. They are pleading for patience as they worry about their tourism taking a hard hit. But the Dominican officials, as you saw wouldn't talk to us. We'll have to wait and see what those results are. We will stay on top of it. We're told one key thing to pay attention to, Tucker, is the toxicology results - - Tucker."

Well, yesterday alleged presidential contender Beto O'Rourke promise that if the apocalypse comes and he is somehow elected President of the United States, one of the first things he will do will be to reverse the ban on transgender soldiers serving in the military. O'Rourke's plan to do this is close to a thousand words long. But here's one thing that it lacks. Beto never explains how transgender soldiers will make America's military stronger. And we mean that word literally not the way your children's public school is stronger when half the kids don't speak English, but actually stronger. It's not an idle question. Americans days as the world's only superpower are waning fast. China is rising, it will soon be a direct rival to this country. Our forces have been battered and stretched by costly commitments in a number of countries -- Afghanistan, Syria, Korea and others. Our military is not a toy. It's not a social experiment. The military exists for only one reason -- protecting the United States and its people. That's it. Every decision the military makes must be framed in those terms. Does it protect the United States and its people from foreign threats? That's it. But for Beto O'Rourke and the rest of his party, the military is an abstraction. It's not meant to win wars, only meant to win votes and to confer virtue on people who tamper with it. Planned Parenthood claims to support, quote, \"choice,\" but their latest lawsuit seeks to force pro-life doctors to perform abortions, amazingly. That's true. Details after the break."

But a conscience clause like that, this kind of nuance is no longer acceptable on the activists left. Abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide cannot be questioned by anybody under any circumstances. Example, A, this week Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued the administration over conscience protections that protect healthcare workers from having to provide abortions. The lawsuit argues that these protections are sexist and somehow racist. Dr. Marc Siegel is a Fox medical contributor and he joins us tonight. Doctor, thanks for coming on."

So if I'm in an emergency room and somebody is dying, and I have to do whatever I can to save their life, I should do whatever I can and that that isn't compromised, that should not be compromised. But when it comes to elective procedures, morality is involved and my personal morality, having witnessed and participated and assisted in abortions early in my training, I am morally opposed to them. The idea of a clause that that prevents anyone from coercing me or penalizing me, or forcing me to perform an abortion, sterilization, or assisted suicide, forcing me to is against everything that this country stands for, and everything that being a physician stands for, this cannot stand. It's absolutely abhorrent."

I'm not doing that, and it should not be forced on to me. Now, obviously, this is a big political battle, but it's violating a basic principle. Tucker, this is not something new to the Trump administration. This goes all the way back to the Church Amendments of the 1970s when you couldn't penalize a hospital or clinic for refusing to perform abortions. This is becoming absolutely something that is not going to work because it's ultimately an attempt to participate in this war for Roe v. Wade versus people that want to repeal Roe v. Wade, and it's not medical, it's not a medical situation. Doctors get right now choose based on our ethics, what we're comfortable doing. I am not comfortable performing abortions. Nobody can tell me to do them. I'm not comfortable performing sterilizations. If I had that training by the way, I wouldn't do them and I don't present -- I don't participate in euthanasia either or assisted suicide which is illegal in most rates."

They need to make these tech companies like I have explicitly say that, \"We are on the side of the abortion lobby,\" because then at least we know where we stand, we at least know what's going to happen. And what we're seeing right now with Live Action is that this isn't just Pinterest because now that Pinterest does this, now Facebook -- there's a hive mind. Now Facebook, now Google, they're all going to win this hive mind, cite this is an example of Live Action spreading dangerous misinformation.

So you also see that in some of the coverage, by the way, it's almost like coverage that you read in some of these newspapers that is rooting for the U.S. to lose, or blames the U.S. for a lot of what China's doing and so forth. So that's what was embedded there at the front end of the first time he spoke about it. The rest of that clip, it goes on to say, but we're doing all the wrong things and Trump is doing this wrong and that wrong.

And they used to march down here, -- I'm telling you, they used to march down here, right to the White House to Treasury to Congress, and they would say, \"Don't do this to China, we can work this out, there's a different way, let's go to the WTO. Let's send them a really strongly worded letter telling them not to do this anymore.\" Because they were making money over there. And they wanted market access. They didn't care about what happened to America 10 years from now, they don't even care what happened to their company 10 years from now. They wouldn't be there.

And so obviously this -- now look, I do think that taking on China, we have a lot of allies in the Senate that are Democrats that are for it. But I'm talking about the political class, the activist class, whatever Trump is for, they are against, and that includes taking on China. You read it in the commentary. I read a commentary last week, not just on China, on Mexico. There was a commentary that came out on Friday night in The \"Washington Post\" saying that Trump was about to mess up the 25 or 33 decades of hard work with Mexico. And then about an hour later, the news comes out that Mexico has agreed to do all sorts of important things.

There's a reason for that, Bernie, it's because it doesn't work. It never works. It never will work because socialism is completely antithetical to human nature. People do not respond to anything other than incentives or fear.

How do you expect to stop all the guns from flooding into the United States? If you really want gun control, you have to have closed borders. And so many Bernie Sanders policies don't make any sense. But I think what I believe Bernie Sanders is after truly is just to take away as much power and as much money as he possibly can from the private sector, from people who own businesses, and give it to people who are going to vote for him and people like him.
