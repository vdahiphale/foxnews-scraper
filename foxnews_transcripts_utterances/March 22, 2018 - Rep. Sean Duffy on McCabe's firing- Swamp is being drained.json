His body language, his hands are in his pocket, his legs are crossed which means he's trying to block out any type of nervousness. He has got one hand up right now. He's in -- it just looks like he's generally uncomfortable. He's fidgeting with his face, he's touching his face.

Did they not catch the hundreds of times he mentioned it and during the rallies? He asked Congress for 1.6 billion to build 74 miles of concrete wall. Well this Omnibus orgy of spending dedicates a puny $641 million to something called border reinforcements. But Speaker Paul Ryan says, 'Ah, don't worry about it'."

You need fences, you need cameras, you need electronic devices, you need the aerial devices to be able to place it, in the mountainous areas, you can't build a wall over a mountain. So you need cameras and you need drones up there. So, it's border wall system. It's different kinds of wall based on different kinds of conditions of the ground. That's what we fund."

It is not complicated. Now we have the biggest spending bill in history, and it sets aside $640 million to supposedly fund wall construction for one year? My friends, I hate to say this, but as I see it, right now, tonight, the wall is never going to happen. Because as we've dug into this and really looked into this, this bill doesn't fund the wall at all, in fact, the bill only pays for a construction, I can't believe I'm saying this, of see-through fencing. The Congress actually authorized, I remember this, back in 2006. The omnibus bill that we're talking about tonight, funds 33 miles of new barriers, and replacement fencing for 59 miles. But understand this, there is no wall construction. All told, you the tax payer, will re-fence part of the border for a grand total of, wait for it, 92 miles. You know what that looks like? It looks like this, 92 miles. You know that little white spot? We should have made it pink. That little white spot, look how big the border is. Why bother at all? Put the big ' bienvenidos', welcome mat, at the border, because it doesn't matter. If the Republicans lose the mid-terms, the Democrats will never fund this thing and will be reliant on Paul Ryan's sensors and a few drones and replacement fencing to protect America. I will repeat, this is not what the American people voted for. And you know what really gets me? It's an embarrassment to the President. He knew how to win this election. And the Republicans, the swamp want to take it away from him. Last week he was at the border inspecting wall prototypes when he said this."

We can do better, we must do better, or Republicans do not deserve to be in the majority. And that's the angle. Joining us now for reaction, is South Carolina Republican Congressman Ralph Norman, who joins us from Charlotte and here in Washington, is Richard Goodstein, he's smiling like the cat who ate the Canary, an attorney, Democratic Strategist, a friend. Great to see you both of you, all right, Congressman, I'm going to start with you. You guys have the House, you have the Senate, and you've got the White House, and now we have spend-o-rama, which I imagine Barack Obama must be watching this somewhere comfortably and thinking, 'Man, I've got to hand it to you guys, you guys really -- yes, you can better than I can.

And now, we are on a two-week vacation, really? The system is broken. We have gotten the 12 appropriations over, back in September and you know, we have to make a change. I'm tired of it and I, along with a lot of other members, I'm a member of freedom caucus, we voted against the rule today. We simply were not elected to bankrupt this country.

And to run trillion dollar deficits in the face of that, really is not right. And you talked with Sean earlier about sticking to promises.

But in Washington, Richard, it's both Republicans and Democrats, I not believe, I'm not letting Democrats off the hook, as they're big spenders too. They just want to keep it all going because the lobbyists get paid; the lawyers get all the money. I'm a former lawyer, believe me, it's nice to charge $700 an hour. The American people demand real accountability. What bang are we getting for the buck here? Is it really going to make all the millennials safer and prosperous and happier? Congressman you can chime in here but look, the Democrats didn't get everything they want, obviously, Republicans, no one is gets everything they want. I'm not going to come here tonight saying the President was going to get everything. But it seems to me he has an opportunity, or had an opportunity, to go to the American people and say, 'I campaigned on this, I think this is critical for the future of the country, if the government has to shut down because both parties don't want to protect our country that's sad'.

Bob Bennett was the lawyer who told bill Clinton, 'It's okay, you can testify at a deposition about your sex life'. That's what got him impeached. He could have easily settled the case for $750,000. I called it the greatest legal blunder of the 20th Century and Bob Bennett was offered a job to come and become Trump's lawyer? I don't know what's going on in the White House. He of course should not testify unless he absolutely has to. And if he has to, it should be under the most rigorous restrictions of time, and type of questions, and he should be prepared to answer yes, no, I don't recall, instead of giving long, long answers.

Absent that, this is a perjury trap and it does trouble me as a supporter of the President that he wants to talk to special counsel under these circumstances. It is absolutely a perjury trap. And I think that one of the frustrations here of his lawyers and other lawyers is that maybe the President isn't following the sound advice of some of his lawyers, which is a serious problem.

None of these -- no, criminals generally don't believe in the rule of law. If that was the basis for not representing somebody, all of us criminal lawyers would be out of business. That's a phony argument. I think the better argument is that it's hard to represent a client who doesn't listen to you, who doesn't take your advice. I think the President is doing something very strategic by the way. I think he has good cop-bad cop. He has the good cops who are trying to make a deal with the special counsel to limit his exposure, to limit the kinds of questions. But then he's also preparing bad cops. Joe diGenova, who can get on television, who can go to court, who can help litigate. I don't think that's such a bad strategy.

And he's checking in at the VIP desk, which is affording him -- he doesn't have to stand in line like other people, so it's a very expedited process. And since they know him very well, he's just putting his name in there, getting all of the credit card stuff situated, and he's on his way."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all he takes the back entrance which the hotel claims is not uncommon. Taking a service elevator. I've never brought bags into a hotel in Vegas and gone through the service elevator. So obviously that's an advantage. And pardon me while I look at the footage as I'm explaining what's going on here. There's a second-long delay. His body language, his hands are in his pocket, his legs are crossed which means he's trying to block out any type of nervousness. He has got one hand up right now. He's in -- it just looks like he's generally uncomfortable. He's fidgeting with his face, he's touching his face. That's not uncommon with the behavioral red flag with somebody who is trying to cover something. And again, he's scratching his head right now, as I'm looking at the footage. So all of these, this is nonverbal communicating, Laura, which is what I'm trained in, specifically in Israel for boarding flights in Israel, to go to Israel. And this type of behavior, you can't lie with nonverbal communicating. And so what I'm seeing right now is somebody who is covering intensely -- and he's fidgeting, he's shuffling, he's turning, let's go, let's get the cart moving. He's just generally uncomfortable. His shirt is untucked also. It could be a weapon in his pants. Who knows?"

This there's a lot of swirling conspiracy they about what happened in Vegas. It still seems really weird to me. You know how you have a gut instinct about something. The guy was not really -- he was known by authorities, we thought he had a criminal history but then there wasn't a criminal history. It seems bizarre."

This is the first time that we have been given the access to actually see him engaged in his daily activities while he was staying at the hotel. You have to ask yourself, what is the timing? Why is this happening now? And I think it's very interesting that the hotel finally decided to give up this footage to a major news source. And what's the reason for that? Is it because there is so much in play here with people espousing conspiracy theories and finally if you look at this, there's finally something that we can actually, being interested in the subject, we're finally getting to see something here?"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Are we seeing something, Aaron, that informs us of the kind of guy he is? Or motivation? We're not getting to any of that. He's a guy who sat in front of a slot machine for hours and hours and hours. He brought these heavy bags in the service elevator, VIP check-in, swaying back and forth. We have the extra video here where we see him swaying back and forth with the bellboy as well, which we're going to see him there. Yes, there it is. But, still, we know nothing about this guy. The biggest mass shooting in U.S. history and we know still very, very little about him. Aaron?"

      "speaker": "COHEN",
      "utterance": "That's right. And that's why I'm jumping all over. You look at him right now, he has the hands in his pockets. It's a very awkward shuffle he's doing. He's nervous, he's projecting nervousness. He's flagging like crazy, Laura. And these are the red flags that we look for. Again, in Israel, the difference between how we do security and how the rest of the world does security is that we know that you can spot the behavior of a murderer before he commits the act of murder. It's just his red flag as it is afterwards. So he's flagging like crazy. And it's not Mandalay Bay's fault. They're not trained in this. No one here in this country is really trained to do this except for certain aspects of the FBI for their profiling and certain portions of border patrol which is getting better. But we don't know anything about this guy. It's a complete mystery. I understand all the conspiracy. To go to Randy's piece, I have known Randy for a while. Randy is very, very smart and knows Vegas better than anybody, he knows how hotels are. I think obviously the hotel put out the video to cover their butts. They want to get it out there and say, look, we can't -- the hotel is basically, to me, what it's saying is, guys, you look at the evidence here, you look at this guy, and you can see just as we can that he's just a normal guy, he's gambling, he's checking in. But once you start cracking this thing open, it's, Laura, it's how do we use this video and this body language --"

      "utterance": "YouTube has announced it is increasing its crackdown on firearms videos just ahead of Saturday's massive pro gun control march in Washington. The site, which is owned by Google, recently banned videos showing how to make firearms fire more rapidly. Starting in April YouTube will ban videos selling guns and certain accessories as well as those that illustrate how to make or modify guns. So is this limiting free speech given the sheer size of YouTube? Let's discuss that with Independent Women's Voice President and FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce who is in New York. And here with me in Washington, Hamza Khan who is a Democratic strategist. It's great to see both of you. Tammy, I'm worried that these tech companies become so big and so powerful they're like mini governments. And then you start seeing the censorship kick in. Your reaction tonight, now gun instructional videos, not bomb making videos, but gun instructional videos banned."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "And that's the worry is that if they're concerned about the nature of teaching someone how to make a gun, it's different than having an impact on instructional videos, even safety videos, how to clean your firearm, things like that, because we know this will abused, right. But this is the other dynamic. Of course it's not technically censorship in that the First Amendment is about the government and forestalling the government from doing this. But we're living in an age now that even the founders couldn't really imagine where entities like Google and Facebook as we know now have such a large control of content of information, information about our own lives, and that we rely on them, we've built lives around and business around these entities that now the issue becomes about squelching commercial speech. And this is what the government, it's ironic because as conservatives we don't want more government regulation. But this is now a world that has been created where it's not just about convenience or fun of communication, but it is about our lives and our businesses and how we raise our children, et cetera. So we do have to begin to deal with it."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And you have to be careful. And let's move on and talk about, Hamza, what this means for viewpoint discrimination. Could this be the beginning of viewpoint discrimination by some of these tech companies? It's now making a gun, what about making something that could be turned into a knife?"

      "speaker": "KHAN",
      "utterance": "Exactly, exactly. And that limits freedom of expression in a lot of different ways. But if you want to move on to the other point you have here, which it comes down to whether or not YouTube should have this content on their site or not, we have to remember freedom of enterprise, freedom of speech goes both ways. A large company has decided that, in their right, which is their right to do, that they do not want to have this content on their website. And that's something we have to respect."

We have to respect freedom of speech being a two-way street. This is what America is all about, protecting freedom of enterprise, protecting the right of YouTube and Google, and Alphabet, their parent company, not to have the content on there. That's what America is based on. That is what the First Amendment is about."

If it's suddenly a discussion about getting rid of the nature of arguments from pro-choicers, you would be hearing the same kind of outrage. But we've got to make sure, as your point goes to, that this is about viewpoints and the nature of what's being squelched. It's like shadow banning conservatives on Twitter and the other problems we've had with conservative news sites on Facebook. We have already seen the trend. And ironically and strangely enough it doesn't impact people on the left, does it?"

Ellison didn't really spell that out but he did suggest that $300 on hour might be enough for, say, the CEO of McDonald's. The idea of a maximum wage, while, it doesn't have wide appeal and that's safe to say. But one of Ellison's high profile friends might support it as way to get back at the people really running American business. Let the conspiracy theories begin."
