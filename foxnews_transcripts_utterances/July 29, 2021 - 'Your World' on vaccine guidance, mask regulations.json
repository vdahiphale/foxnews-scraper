Now, a number of Fed district presidents have told me and I have talked with and have said that they have warned inflation will last well into next year. Now, we know the Fed chairman is pushing this transitory inflation. So I asked him about jobs and why we have 9.5 million unemployed, with 9.2 million job opens. Now, that Powell says that the number is -- a number of factors played into this. First, not only is it about going back to old jobs, but it's also being selective about finding new jobs.

The amazing part about all this so far, and -- in my eyes, the bond market is saying otherwise, even though everywhere I go I am seeing prices up. So something's going to give eventually.

In 2004, the French government of Jacques Chirac signed an agreement to help the Chinese build its first biosafety level four lab in Wuhan to study infectious diseases in the wake of the SARS outbreak, despite the protests of French defense officials. The State Department's former lead investigator into the COVID origin, David Asher, tells me French intelligence warned the U.S. government that it had concerns about Chinese actions at the lab two years before the Institute of Virology was inaugurated Quote: \"DGSE, France's CIA, were pretty public and sounding their alarm bells. Not typical. I can't understand how NIH, DOD and AID would continue to plow dollars and transfer tech to WIV in the wake of the French being evacuated.\" In an e-mail from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, it says: \"The new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate the high containment laboratory.\" Thomas DiNanno was part of the State Department team investigating the COVID origin.",

The Fed is still buying the same amount of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, pushing money into the economy. The Federal Reserve chairman confirmed they have started to talk about removing that help. Now, Powell acknowledge that inflation has come in hotter than expected, but he sees it spiking in specific categories, like used cars, hotels, and airfare, which is all due to reopening. He says it will come back down in the medium term, but did not define medium term. Now, a number of Fed district presidents have told me and I have talked with and have said that they have warned inflation will last well into next year. Now, we know the Fed chairman is pushing this transitory inflation. So I asked him about jobs and why we have 9.5 million unemployed, with 9.2 million job opens. Now, that Powell says that the number is -- a number of factors played into this. First, not only is it about going back to old jobs, but it's also being selective about finding new jobs.

But when it comes to transitory, and why he uses that term transitory, it doesn't mean that prices will be high just for a few months. It means it won't have a lasting economic impact on the U.S. And does this mean it's going to be here for -- maybe for the rest of this year? Possibly. But he says that we're not going to have a 1970s-style upward inflationary spiral that we saw in the early 1980s. But it also doesn't mean that your coffee is going to go down tomorrow in terms of pricing."

Markets heard that, started to pull back, because, this whole time, we have heard transitory, transitory, temporary. It always felt like, OK, we will go from zero to 100 and then back to zero. Sounds like the Fed chair is saying, no, get used to it. It may go from zero to 100, back to 90, but it ain't coming down month from there."

And, look, the longer it lasts, the worse it gets, because if people start believing that they had better buy today or they're going to pay higher prices tomorrow, people then start hoarding. That's for businesses also. If that happens, then prices will feed on itself to the upside. And then we will get into big trouble. The amazing part about all this so far, and -- in my eyes, the bond market is saying otherwise, even though everywhere I go I am seeing prices up. So something's going to give eventually. I hope the man is right. I hope this is something that passes and comes back down again. But I am not so sure. And all this talk about all this spending, money going where, the printing of money, money going where, you know, the old economics 101, buying too few goods with too much money, I'm going to be watching the bond market very closely. If we start to see rates on the 10- year spike 2, 2.5 percent for starters, there's going to be some trouble."

He even talked about strains around the world being out there. Like, in other words, there's always the possibility of a new strain coming up. Sounds to me that that means the Fed is going to keep pumping, and pumping and pumping. And we just have to endure the painful effects of inflation."

And he says the Delta variant isn't going to have that big of an economic impact. And you heard that also from Jay Powell today from the Federal Reserve. Tim Cook says the U.S. economy can remain strong. And he's seeing geographic strength around the rest of the world as well. So, in terms of corporate America and companies, they're still making a ton of money. And that's thanks to the money printing that's coming from D.C."

Will that do the trick?"

When I was traveling this weekend, there was some restaurants that were closed early because they said they don't have enough employees. So September can't come soon enough. Look, they overreached. There was a decent period of time where we needed to do things, we needed the help, we needed to have a bridge for people, but they overreached. I'm not going to yell and scream and blame. Hopefully, they're just trying to do the right thing. But we got to get people to be incentivized to get back to work and not sit on the couch. It is simple as that. And the sooner, rather than later, is a good thing."

That helped inflation go up and made life tougher for people who decided to work throughout all of this or who could work throughout all of this. Gary, Susan, thank you both very much. So again, free money or free markets? Key Democrats want more cash for a student loan bailout. But one major American company might have a better fix without putting taxpayers in a fix. And we're going to debate that. Also, from masks -- from reversing the mask mandate policy to vaccine mandates perhaps for all federal workers approaching very fast, how the Biden administration has been handling this crisis. We have got the former assistant HHS secretary with us next on that and more. We will be right back."

In 2004, the French government of Jacques Chirac signed an agreement to help the Chinese build its first biosafety level four lab in Wuhan to study infectious diseases in the wake of the SARS outbreak, despite the protests of French defense officials.

If you wanted to have transparency and if you want to have openness of research, you don't kick out the people who helped you build the lab and train your people.

When this lab was built, was it always built with the intention of focusing on gain of function, which seems to be extraordinarily controversial, particularly since America seemed to also have made investments in China's ability to manipulate viruses in the first place?"

But we had clear evidence that gain of function research, or if not technically gain of function research, dangerous research, bringing highly pathogenic bat viruses back to a city of 11 million, was going on. So, yes, we had concerns. We do have concerns. And it's why that most of us call for a true bipartisan committee to investigate specifically, what did the NIH know, what accountability did they have, what review processes, and how do we make sure that dangerous research is regulated, particularly overseas, as we move to the future?"

      "speaker": "GIROIR",

One very important piece of evidence is, this virus was perfectly evolved to transmit human to human from moment one. That does not happen with a virus that starts to gradually emerge from a species in nature and infect humans, like SARS or MERS. So that's very strong evidence, in and of itself, that this was not a typical virus from nature, that it was likely evolved in a laboratory. No, I think we will never get access to the laboratory personnel, their hospital records, if they got sick in October and November, what happened to them. We're just not going to see that."

I want it to be clear to the viewers that, no matter what is being said or the misinformation or the confusing information, is, the current vaccines that are approved, are authorized in the United States are extremely effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalizations and death, even among the Delta variant. What has been really confusing is what the CDC said yesterday. They made recommendations, but didn't give the data. And let me be specific. They claimed -- and I'm sure there's reason to believe this -- that even vaccinated people can spread the virus because of the high levels in their nose and mouth. Well, what percent is that? Yesterday, they said it's a rare occasion. If it's rare, 1 percent. 0.1 percent, then you don't need to mask and you shouldn't recommend that. If it's 20 or 30 percent, then what they said makes sense. But they made the recommendation without being transparent about the data. If you told the American people the data, which they obviously have, then we could have an intelligent discussion, but they haven't done that."

If you're not vaccinated, you can easily get tested once a week or twice a week to make sure that you're not going to pass it to someone else. And having reasonable ventilation, I would feel very safe going back to work under those parameters. Get vaccinated or get tested and have reasonable workspace accommodations.

You don't want to create a situation where they license it too soon, so then the people who think licensure is important say, oh, it's just another trick by the federal government. But I do think we have had hundreds of millions of shots. The vaccine side effects are really minimal, particularly compared to the disease. So, I'm hopeful and would encourage the FDA to look at the data, because I think it's overwhelmingly there that they can license at least one, if not all three vaccines, in a very short period of time upcoming.

Refuse and, in a worst-case scenario, they could lose their job. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced today that by Labor Day all state workers must be vaccinated or undergo regular testing for the virus. The mandate is even stricter for state health care workers who come into contact with patients. They will not have the option of testing as an alternative to vaccinations. A number of private companies have also made vaccines a requirement for employment. Others say getting the shot is a condition to return to the office. Today, Google told its 135,000 employees to continue working from home unless they are fully vaccinated. Legal experts say exceptions to employer mandates can be made for religious or medical reasons and that lawsuits are all but inevitable."

Although the president of the AFL-CIO said he supports an anticipated mandate for all federal workers, many individual unions disagree.

The union says any mandate must be part of a collective bargaining agreement. One union leader put it this way.

If somebody has preexisting medical conditions or religious objections, they have valid cases to bring to court. For the most part, private employers will likely prevail in requiring vaccinations for people to return to the office. For those companies that are allowing for virtual work to continue, remote work to continue, they will be particularly in a good position in terms of litigation. But the courts are highly deferential when it comes to private businesses. And also they have the support of the CDC recommendations."

      "utterance": "Well, it comes down to the basis for the challenge here. If -- it's odd for a union to require vaccinations, since that doesn't directly apply to people conducting themselves as union members. I mean, the employer has a claim to say, we're trying to protect the workplace, we're very concerned about these variants, we're following the CDC recommendation. For the unions to require members, because they're unionized, to get vaccines is not quite as strong as all of that. What's fascinating is that we're moving to different stages. We started out, if you recall, after the vaccines were approved, we started out with this type of reason consent model, that they would try to convince people to take it. That failed with over half the population, at least in that first stage. Then they went to a type of almost purchase consent. There were lotteries in Ohio and various gimmicks to get people to take it. That also failed. I mean, we're still about 50 percent or so of the population. Now we see a move to a different model. The Biden administration is all in on a type of coerced consent approach. And what that involves is getting private companies to make life as difficult as possible for people who are not convinced."

We're also in the town of La Joya, Texas. And just a couple of miles from here, police say that there's a charity that's rented an entire hotel to house COVID-positive migrants. Police say they only found out when a customer at a burger restaurant next door flagged down a patrolling officer and then told them a family member inside was sneezing, coughing and unmasked. Police say the family members told them Customs and Border Protection processed them a few days earlier and that they tested positive for COVID and were then released to the charity."

Abbott has issued an order -- this just came out a bit ago -- authorizing Texas law enforcement to stop vehicles they suspect are carrying migrants and then reroute them to the port of entry. We're trying to get more details on what exactly that means or where specifically that would happen. The Texas governor has also ordered the state's National Guard to assist with arrests. So, instead of the mask mandate that some here are calling for, that's what we have heard from the governors office over the last couple of days -- Charles."

And what happened is, is the story -- La Joya is in my district. And I talked to the officials this afternoon. And we're going to talk again on Friday, but what's happening is, when Border Patrol drops folks off at a charity, the charity gets overloaded. And then they drop them off at a hotel without even telling the local officials. And that's not right. The charity needs to tell the local officials, especially if they are COVID-positive. It's not fair to -- by local communities. There are people being released there that might have COVID-19. And we need to just make sure that we communicate with each other. And what I'm asking on the Biden administration is to do a pause, do a pause. They need to -- they need to prioritize border communities. They need to prioritize the men and women of DHS. They need to prioritize our border communities at DHS."

Look, last week, they had 70 positive cases of agents that were sick. Now it's 80. And they have a little bit over 102, 103 that are self-isolating. So those cases are going up. And, remember, those men and women have families. And if they get sick and go home to the families, it's not fair to their families, and it certainly is not fair to the border communities to leave people that are sick and not even tell the local communities like La Joya."

I see people coming in, but we're not showing people being deported. And you have to do that. If you don't have any consequences, then there's a green light. And I emphasize there's a green light for people who come in. Traditionally, March, April, May and June are the peak months almost every year. We're now in July. And just this morning, they stopped a group of 509 people, one single group, I emphasize, 509 people coming in, in one -- just one group. So these numbers are not stopping.

You forget about politics, and you put the health of human beings first. Is there anyone there? I mean, Vice President Harrison didn't meet with you.

It's massive. We have never seen numbers like this. This will be the largest tax increase and the largest spending bill ever passed in the history of the United States government, and just at a time when inflation pressures are everywhere. The American people see it. We just saw the report where housing prices are up 23 percent year over year, gas prices up 45 percent since the 1st of the year, used car prices up 45 percent year over year. The American people see it. And perhaps the worst tax of all, Charles, is inflation, because that shrinks everybody's paycheck."

We call it the pay-fors. And then we also talk -- we call it the CBO score, in terms of making sure these numbers are accurate after they're analyzed. But at least we're having a debate tonight about real infrastructure. It's about bridges, it's about roads, it's about ports, it's about airports, it's about waterways, it's about broadband. And so this is real infrastructure. That's why there is some interest on both sides to try to get something done. But this is a far cry from this different bill that $3.5 trillion bill.

But you have to remember that these employees can only choose from a few specific degrees that directly benefit Walmart, such as supply chains management. It's good for Walmart, and it's good for the employees if they actually have the time to use these programs. But it's not going to create our next generation of engineers, nurses or teachers.
