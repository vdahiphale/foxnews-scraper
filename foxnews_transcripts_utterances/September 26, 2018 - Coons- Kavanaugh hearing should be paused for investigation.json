And you have people dismissing the whole notion of due process. And you have somebody like Senator Gillibrand going on the Senate floor today and start banging her desk talking about how, you know, we don't -- we're not looking to put him in jail to sit in a courtroom. We just want to get to the truth as if our entire court system isn't set up to do just that. And it really does sort of begin to make a lot of people think that this is just turned into a partisan football like these people here in Washington do with everything. And this is far -- this is far too serious to be your typical partisan political football. And I think Republicans have bent over backwards to make sure that they treat Dr. Ford with respect. Treat her allegations with respect. They do want to hear her story and that is ultimately what the president said today during the press conference was that, you know, he's open to listening.

They know that they don't have transport helicopters that work. They have a military that is completely not ready and they've been reliant on the United States. So when Donald Trump says you probably should have a military that's ready, they know that that's true. But no one has ever really said that that directly. The interesting part is just NATO spending, for instance. That was the policy of President Bush who I work for. It was the policy of President Obama. Nothing changed. But, when there is a forceful hey, this isn't a fair relationship. By the way, what I have been saying in Germany is we're not asking Russia and China to increase their military. We are asking our friends. We are asking the people that we want to serve side by side with which when there is a crisis.

Remember, it was the Obama administration that ratified the Paris climate accord back in 2016, and President Trump who backed out of the agreement in 2017. So when Mr. Obama addressed business leaders in Oslo, Norway, he drew a bright line between what he believes is happening now versus when he was in the Oval Office. Quoting now, \"The single highest priority that I see globally at this point is the issue of environmental sustainability.\" Obama then went on to say \"The only way to achieve that sustainability is if leaders adopt newer technology,\" saying quote, \"but that takes political and social commitment that right now is not forthcoming.\" He ended by saying he now fears, quote, \"rising protectionism and authoritarianism in the U.S.\" since he left office. The former president's comments in Norway come just days after the former first lady tried to fire up a crowd in Las Vegas by berating the current state of U.S. politics. Mrs. Obama is involved in an organization that promotes voter registration. And in a spirited call for people to get out and vote in the midterms, Michelle Obama took a swing at the administration saying, quote, \"Believe me, I'm frustrated, too.

We have read through it.

When I was in high school and I went to an all-boys Catholic High School, a Jesuit High School where I was focused on academics and athletics. Going to church every Sunday at Little Flower. Working on my service projects and friendship. Friendship with my fellow classmates and friendship with girls from the local, all-girls Catholic schools. And yes, there were parties. And the drinking age was 18 and yes, the seniors were legal and had beer there. And yes, people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school. I think all of us have probably done things. We look back on in high school and regret our cringe a bit. But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about an allegation of sexual assault. I've never sexually assaulted anyone."

They call these ideas, these allegations, nonsense and reprehensible. We're going to speak with one of them. A longtime classmate of his in just a few moments. So, from sworn testimonies to secondhand accounts and polygraph tests, to handwritten calendars from 30 years ago, there's now a lot of evidence that is coming in to go through. Judge Jeanine Pirro has dealt with many similar cases of sexual assault in her many years as a prosecutor and as a judge. And she joins us now with her analysis. So, judge, we are starting to get a more of a look at this. And just to keep all of these things separated, this is the most recent accusation that has come through, Michael Avenatti is representing this woman and she paints a really gruesome picture of what she says was going on at these highs school parties. And here's a little bit of what she says, we're going to put it up on the wall. But I want to get your thoughts on how damning this is potentially."

So, ley -- let's put up Beach Week because we now have the calendar page from Judge Kavanagh, as well. This is from his own -- put up the calendar page from Judge Kavanaugh that shows his own markings of where he was and when. There it is. All right, and you can see quite clearly in the second week thereof June. He says, he was at Beach Week. There's a lot more here, but as you look through this, how damning is it?"

I started a sex crime, June. This is horrible stuff, its ugly stuff. But the question is, whether or not this stuff where -- look, he corroborates that -- you know, there was a Beach Week, maybe it was the same week, maybe it was the same year, I don't know. What I do know that it's highly unusual to have one guy involved with three women all of whom have had repressed memories. And look, reporting rape and sexual assault is not at all unusual. But repressed memory is highly unusual, it's rare. What are the coincidence of one guy picking three women all of whom have repressed memories? So, you have a context here of horrible sounding facts. But the question is, are they supported by corroborating witnesses? He says, for example, or she says, you know, they were spiking the alcohol, they were spiking the punch bowl, they were taking women or women who were in the room, they were gang raping them. Well, who are these women? Did you report to your friends that they were spiking the alcohol? If they were standing outside that room, what did you do about it, did you just sit and wait? I mean, there is so much that a prosecutor is going to do with this. And as a prosecutor, my job was to represent the victims."

We know that there was a polygraph that was -- she wrote a handwritten statement on the polygraph. In that polygraph statement, she did not say that she thought that he inadvertently might kill her or that she thought that there was an attempted rape going on. She will say that tomorrow. We have her statement here. She says that he -- I believed he was going to rape me and I tried to yell for help, and I thought that he was accidentally going to kill me.

There is a reason we don't use them in criminal courtrooms, they are unreliable. You can trick a lie detector, you can fake a result of a lie detector. If you're a sociopath, you're not going to have an emotional response to a question that might incriminate you. Well, all of this stuff doesn't help her.

But then, an interesting thing happens, and it lands in a Congresswoman's office, and the next thing you know it's passed along to Dianne Feinstein.

Now, she is a powerhouse sex crimes prosecutor in Phoenix with a 26-year history of convicting police officers, doctors, teachers, and priests. She's been named Arizona's outstanding sexual assault prosecutor, as well as the Maricopa County Attorney's Office Prosecutor of the Year. She's currently the head of the County Special Victims Division, a job she's held for the last 13 years. Senator Chuck Grassley the Chair of the Judiciary Committee says Mitchell has been recognized in the legal community for her experience and objectivity. And her boss, her current boss, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery says the American people can be confident that Rachel Mitchell's experience as a conscientious prosecutor trained to seek justice, protect victims and pursue truth, will assist the Senate Judiciary Committee in performing its task. Now, Christine Blasey Ford's legal team and Senate Democrats have opposed the hiring of an outside counsel from the very beginning. They want the Committee's Republicans to have to question Kavanaugh and Ford and they also don't like the fact that Mitchell is a registered Republican.

He was a great guy in high school and I even catch up with him kind of through college and post-college until I moved to Chicago. It was always wonderful seeing him. He was always so nice and respectful, and I can imagine that he was the same guy in the 90s when I was here in Chicago and he was still back in D.C. This is beyond belief."

The most troubling part of it is the fact that you have these very serious allegations that they're leveled, you know, and it's not the typical sort of high school stupidity that you would expect from under aged drinking kids. It's predatory behavior. It's disqualifying. And you have a United States Senate where you have you -- you know, members out and out saying that the burden is on accused t prove that he's not guilty. And you have people dismissing the whole notion of due process. And you have somebody like Senator Gillibrand going on the Senate floor today and start banging her desk talking about how, you know, we don't -- we're not looking to put him in jail to sit in a courtroom. We just want to get to the truth as if our entire court system isn't set up to do just that. And it really does sort of begin to make a lot of people think that this is just turned into a partisan football like these people here in Washington do with everything. And this is far -- this is far too serious to be your typical partisan political football. And I think Republicans have bent over backwards to make sure that they treat Dr. Ford with respect. Treat her allegations with respect. They do want to hear her story and that is ultimately what the president said today during the press conference was that, you know, he's open to listening. He wants to hear what she has to say. But you know, Brett, none of this is in a vacuum. Brett Kavanaugh has built a sterling reputation for himself over a long period of time."

So they're seeing the action of defense spending. They can deal with some harsh words because they know that they don't have submarines that work. They know that they don't have transport helicopters that work. They have a military that is completely not ready and they've been reliant on the United States. So when Donald Trump says you probably should have a military that's ready, they know that that's true. But no one has ever really said that that directly. The interesting part is just NATO spending, for instance. That was the policy of President Bush who I work for. It was the policy of President Obama. Nothing changed. But, when there is a forceful hey, this isn't a fair relationship. By the way, what I have been saying in Germany is we're not asking Russia and China to increase their military. We are asking our friends. We are asking the people that we want to serve side by side with which when there is a crisis. So I'm trying to remind people, too, in Germany that when it comes to defense spending the American people are spending a lot of money on the 33,000 American men and women. But the American people don't have free healthcare. They don't have free college tuition like what the Germans and the Europeans have."

Now one of the big focuses that you had is with Iran and was encouraging companies to stop doing business with them.

I've seen the evidence. Iran is very deceitful. They push gays off buildings. They are a regime that funds terrorism. I would argue that Syria and Yemen are in chaos largely because of Iran funding. Largely because of Iran's chaos. What I have been making the case to the Germans is to say all of your migration problem, at least a large portion of it, you can blame on Iran and the chaos in Syria. So, you must stop funding the regime. And when we talk to the CEOs and we say it very clearly, they choose, the United States, and by the way, we don't sell that."

Remember, it was the Obama administration that ratified the Paris climate accord back in 2016, and President Trump who backed out of the agreement in 2017. So when Mr. Obama addressed business leaders in Oslo, Norway, he drew a bright line between what he believes is happening now versus when he was in the Oval Office. Quoting now, \"The single highest priority that I see globally at this point is the issue of environmental sustainability.\" Obama then went on to say \"The only way to achieve that sustainability is if leaders adopt newer technology,\" saying quote, \"but that takes political and social commitment that right now is not forthcoming.\" He ended by saying he now fears, quote, \"rising protectionism and authoritarianism in the U.S.\" since he left office. The former president's comments in Norway come just days after the former first lady tried to fire up a crowd in Las Vegas by berating the current state of U.S. politics. Mrs. Obama is involved in an organization that promotes voter registration. And in a spirited call for people to get out and vote in the midterms, Michelle Obama took a swing at the administration saying, quote, \"Believe me, I'm frustrated, too. I am sick of all the chaos and the nastiness of our politics. It's exhausting and, frankly, it's depressing.

What we're learning is that basically the Senate judiciary committee is doing an investigation. Which is exactly what they said they were going to do. So the one story that I mentioned the other moment that came through from NBC about the woman who said she was having dinner with her daughter is one of the things that's been called in. So a number of these are anonymous. They are coming in. Is this ever going to end, do you think?"

      "utterance": "I don't know. I think you will probably see them still come in after tomorrow's hearing by the rate they are coming in now. And they're all unsubstantiated with no witnesses. So I was willing to give Ford the kind of the benefit of the doubt. I wanted to, you know, hear what she had to say and maybe she did believe something happened to her and I wanted to trust that. But if you keep getting more allegations after allegations after allegations it looks likes, as the president said, a con job. Because the suspicious timing is a little too much for me."
