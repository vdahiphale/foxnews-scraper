Robert Bowers is a long-haul trucker with a significant history of making anti-Semitic and other bigoted statements on social media. The day of the shooting Bower's reportedly went onto Gab.com, a site favored by right-wing extremist and wrote about his opposition to the migrant caravan. Blaming a Jewish aid group for bringing, \"Invaders that kill our people.\" Though it's unclear who exactly his people are. Police said before, during, and after the rampage, Robert Bowers made numerous statements about killing Jews. Saying, \"Jews need to die.\" Even repeating those statements to the doctors and nurses trying to save his life, all of whom are Jewish. And as the White House said that President Trump and the First Lady will visit Pittsburgh tomorrow, a liberal Jewish group sent an open letter to the president saying, \"He is not welcome until he denounces white nationalism. But Rabbi Myers who may have saved numerous lives said, he welcomes the president's visit.

In essence, blaming the president and his staff actually for these horrific acts. I mean, that's just simply outrageous. It's -- they spent hours and hours.  Some in the media, and as well as the Democrats just focusing on putting this blame on the president. I mean, we saw the president of one media organization basically going after Sarah Sanders and the -- and President Trump. So, what, I spoke with a -- with a friend of mine, he's Jewish American.  And she told me something so interesting, and she's not political, and she said to me she goes, \"When I heard this, it literally took away from this solemn moment. It took away from honoring the victims and honoring these families who are going through this horrific time. This is a moment of prayer in this country. This is a moment of unity for this country.

We pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries,\" and it goes on in that vein. But then, Mercedes, this is the next one. \"There is great anger in our country crossed in part by an inaccurate, even fraudulent reporting of the news. The fake news media, the true enemy of the people. Must stop the open and obvious hostility, and report the news accurately and fairly.\" Does that help to unite the country calling the press the enemy of the people?"

But then, you can also see the president's reaction to what comes at him, and I think, you know in many ways, obviously, you can't blame him, but there are those who are sort of calling for him to take a higher road because as you know, Anthony Scaramucci, who you know, who worked in the White House for a short time. He said, \"The president is the only person we all vote for. So for me, I would love to see the stuff dial back on both sides. But good leadership requires that somebody go first, and I'd like it to be him."

And it is a moment of time where he will be mourning with those families who have lost loved ones. He will honor these brave men and women who lost their lives. And this is a moment in time in our country where that has to stand, that's the -- that's the moment. This is a moment where we do have to come in prayer, where we do have to think about this horrible tragedy that happened because of a deranged individual who took these innocent lives. And so, the president has talked about this message. Whether the media and the Democrats want to stop, trying to score political points, we'll wait and see what happens. Let's see how they cover it tomorrow. So far, I have found that it has been just saddening to watch how the direct blame in less than 24 hours after these tragedies have happened has been squarely on the President and on his staff, which is very irresponsible and unfair. And so, I think the president responded to this -- the media, and how some of those in the media portrayed the president, how they're allowing these continual discussions to happen about just clearly criticizing the president at all costs, and not looking at the core of the problem here, which are dealing with deranged individuals who have taken innocent lives."

So, Washington Post front- page headline, yesterday day after the synagogue Massacre. Critics say Trump has fostered the toxic environment. For the political violence, he denounces the critics being liberals in the story. You show GQ reporter Julia Ioffe, earlier. She tweeted, \"A word to my fellow American Jews, this president makes this possible.\" Today on CNN, Ioffe said, Donald Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS. But at the same time, I fault the president who by the way was very eloquent the night after the Pittsburgh shootings and talking about the poison of anti-Semitism and the history of persecution of Jews. And then, when he goes back to the true enemy of the people, for fake news, which is mostly most of the media as he defines it, it's essentially calling journalists' traitors. It's wrong. Journalists love this country whatever mistakes they may make.  And it undermines the president's own call over the weekend to lower the voices and the temperature."

But you know, you can watch the president, we've all watched him long enough to know that his -- you know, his initial instinct was to sort of be with the moment to express obvious sorrow. And then, you know, he flips on the T.V. He starts hearing people saying, it's his fault, blaming him for -- you know, inciting an insane deranged individual to walk into a synagogue and kill people. You know, I mean, my guess is that this person was insane and deranged before President Trump was in office, Jonathan. And I think -- you know, we have to be very, very careful. We -- I think in some ways -- you know, President Trump's rhetoric is obviously very out there. And it's very obvious. But it doesn't necessarily mean that there hasn't been -- you know, presidents in the past who have also had very strong feelings about things. Do you think that the -- Jonathan, you know, back to you, and I -- and I understanding that -- you know, you obviously a reporter who covers the White House. But as a reporter who covers President Trump, you know, what do you make of that watching how he reacts to things. You know, is it politically advantageous for him? Does it work for him in any way? Is he appealing to someone on purpose?"

They're already angry at the press, and it makes them angrier, and they cheer him on. And you see that the rallies. I mean, I covered Trump -- about President Trump during the campaign. All he would need to say by the end, it was like a call-and-response. He would just say Hillary Clinton, and the crowd would start chanting, \"Lock her up.\" There's another half of the country there that he's not talking to when he says this. So, it's -- look, it's hard to -- it's hard to kind of give credence to the first statement. Too much credence to the first statement when you know that -- you know, the real Donald -- unfiltered Donald Trump is the enemy of the people comment. He is pugnacious, he wants to fight, and he sees the press is a useful foil. He uses the media.

And if every one of my fellow citizens would look in the mirror and say what can I do to improve our country, how can I be less divisive, how can I be more intentional in my efforts to unify this country. I can't change President Trump's behavior, I can't change the headlines at Politico and Washington Post. What I would love to see the President do when he goes to Pittsburgh is to -- is to eulogize the lives of those lost. That's what's unifying.

She happens to be a progressive from Hawaii. We are -- you wouldn't put a progressive Hindu from Hawaii with a three-part Calvinist Republican from South Carolina. But we have been intentional in our desire to have a friendship and I think part of what plagues our country now is we have a tendency to surround ourselves with people who just ratify what we already believe. I mean, if you want to understand how President Obama was elected twice, you got to ask somebody who voted for him and the same with Donald Trump.  The media cannot fathom how he is presidents. Ask someone who voted for him. They will tell you why he is the President of the United States. But if all you do is surround yourself with the philosophy department at Princeton, then no, there are no Trump supporters there. So go ask some people in real America who felt an angst and an uncertainty that led to his election.

There's a problem with you know, individuals who live in isolation who are not part of a community, who perhaps aren't part of their own faith who commit these kinds of acts over and over. They obviously are very deeply unstable, very deeply disturbed. And instead of talking about what's going wrong with the fabric of our of our community, perhaps that this kind of person you know, gets left out in the cold and allowed to do something like this.

But when we lose that sense of unity that there is a moral code that is not relativistic. It exists every day. Then it leads to this kind of malaise that that, unfortunately, we find ourselves and tragedy used to be unifying but now Martha it lasts for about 30 minutes. I want to focus on the victims. If the President Trump will focus on the victims and their lives, I think that's what my fellow Americans would love. Not focus on the shooter and not focus on the politics of it, focus on the lives that were lost and how that impacts dozens and hundreds of people that were involved in their lives.

I don't think that's possible today. I don't think I or anyone else could do that today because the country is so deeply polarized. And yet, the thing that remains the same, and your reporter might put his finger right on it, and that the ad that you showed, puts its finger right on it. People want the election to be about them and their concerns. Middle class concerns.

And when you compare them, you can see from, you know, 20 years ago and from today they are basically pretty much evenly divided, 41 to 40 and 42 to 40. When you sort of put all that in the mix and you look at what's going on out there, do you think that Democrats are focusing on the right thing if they want to retake the House?"

I think the rhetoric out there on the far left about impeaching the president and all that, that's just a replay of what the mistake that Newt Gingrich made 20 years ago, so that hurts the Democrats. So, I think in this particular election, though, again, unfortunately the country as Congressman Gowdy has pointed out is so deeply divided, that's going to help the Democrats in the House because many of those districts were carried by Hillary Clinton. But in my own body of the United States Senate, most of those races are in deep red states. That's going to help the Republicans. We almost have, Martha, a parliamentary system today where your viewers and the American people think there is a party on the left and party on the right. They are not really judging the candidates on their individual merits and instead they think, just go out there to Washington and they are going to vote the party line. I kind of hope we get back to the day where individual character, individual ideas and individual dependents matter but right now it doesn't seem to matter that much."

Joining me exclusively, the man who would be on the other side of the campaign fight if Hillary decided to run again, Brad Parscale is the manager of President Trump's 202 campaign. Brad, great to have you back on the show. BRAD PARSCALE, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP 2020 REELECTION: Thanks for having me back, Martha."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "It's almost, I'm caught off guard that she's talking about running again. If she ends up being the candidate then I'm happy to have the Trump 2.0 version against Hillary I guess. It's shocking though, I would think it's time for the Clintons to go out to pasture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. She is very interesting to me because she clearly wants to leave the door open here and I would imagine that there are a lot of them, so many Democrats who want to run. I mean, I'm picturing that it's probably going to be like when President Trump ran the first time with like 17 people up there, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "I think it's going to be brutal, you know, I think -- I think they can't all run saying they don't like the president, you know. They all going to have to choose and they are going to tear each other apart. And I think it's going to be an interesting primary for Democrats. We'll see who comes out the other end. You know, we are going to be open to multiple people, you know. We are going to watch and start to get our op-ed research and do everything we can to, you know, be ready."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I want to ask you quickly about what you thought about some people blaming the president for what happened in Pittsburgh and also for the would-be pipe bomber?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Look, I just think that's just clearly wrong. I mean, look, the president, you know, in the campaign, this is a fight, and we have been in a fight. But it's a fight with our hearts and our minds, not with our fists. And like, clearly, we don't condone violence. I don't anyone to get hurt. But the fake news media, I must be clear, it's the fake news media and not the media has been an attack and they've done everything they can to try to destroy the president, destroy this movement and try to wipe off tens of millions of Americas on what they think and what they believe in for the future. I've been a victim of that and multiple people in the administration have been a victim of that and we are going to continue to fight. It's a fight with our hearts and our minds. Unfortunately, evil exists and we don't want to awaken it. And I just don't think, the blame sits on those evildoers but we have to continue to fight for tens of millions of people, where I came from. In a hometown in Kansas where I came from, the people that have been forgotten."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, look, there's multiple audiences you have to win for an election. Look, with this president is doing everything he can to hold the House for the midterms, doing everything he can to flip seats in the Senate, and there's multiple audiences. We have lots of added ads running that are 100 percent Trump right to voters, low percentage turnout trump voters, but we also have an audience of independent voters. Mothers in this country who really need to make that choice, what's best for their children's future for a economy."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Yes. A lot of moms see that, you know. And 40 percent or so say the economy is a big choice for them. They pay bills. They live paycheck to paycheck sometimes. And this president is making it easier from the wages they're increasing. It's not just about unemployment going down, wages are increasing, real life is getting easier and easier. And we need to remind we could go right back to what things were, when things were tough."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Al right. So, when we come back I want to ask you about what the president's first campaign move is going to be after the midterms. Quick break and more with Brad, when we come back."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "When you look at that thousands of people -- somebody said, you know, on that one they built a dam. I'm pretty good at figuring out how many people. Thousands and thousands of people on the bridge. When you looked at that bridge loaded up with people. That's called an invasion of our country."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Back with Brad Parscale with, the president's 2020 campaign manager. That was from Laura Ingraham's interview the rest of the play tonight. \"Invasion\" that's the word he is using."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Well, this president made a promise to protect our borders to make us a sovereign nation. And without a nation of laws, we're not a nation. We need to protect ourselves from illegal aliens and we need to make sure that we have immigration laws that are compiled by. Otherwise, we are not a country. And I think the president made the promise and he's going to keep it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. I want to talk to you, do you think the Republicans can keep the House and the Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I think we're in a tough road."
    },

      "utterance": "Both?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "I think we can flip seats in the Senate which is only 17 times since 1934 has that ever happened. Only eight seats since 1934 itself. And he could possibly do of those, 50 percent of that since the Great Depression in one election. That just shows right now how the president is. The House is tough. I think cards are stacked against him. I mean, you had retirements, you had fund-raising problems. You had all kinds of issues. And I think the president rewritten the map to make it easier and I think he's out fighting. And the fact that I am even sitting here tonight saying we have a chance to hold the House and win seats in the Senate shows clearly this president is doing more than any president has in history doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Put the map up you can see where the president is going. Because, you know, we all remember that you, were the person who was saying we need to go to western Pennsylvania, we need to go to Michigan, we need to go to Ohio. So people look at this map and they say those are all Senate seats. That tells us that they have given up on the House?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "There is a couple of House seats in there and there's also governorship in there. But look, the president also needs to make the biggest impact he can. It's a different race. It's where he can go. And sometimes he's been in one House seat in a place that it's hard to get to might be more difficult. It's also about the president traveling as the president versus a campaign is night and day. It's like moving an armada versus moving a road runner."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's a pretty active schedule, Any way he'd been giving that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "What we have done even with the Secret Service, now I have to give the Secret Service high, you know, marks for when we get this done. It's difficult to move a president and I think on route. Former presidents will tell you it's not that easy to make that many stops and this president is doing it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So, there were three campaign managers the last time around. How many are there going to be this time around?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Well, officially there were two. There was a campaign chairman. And Kellyanne is still around and I'm friends with Corey so we are all surviving just fine. I'm hoping I'll be the only one. I hope the president trusts in me and help to get it done. I'll have the great support of Jared Kushner and the family like Eric trump. I'll have the president and this family is the most amazing family this country has after seen. And I think they are going to continue to do things that are going to be great for us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Last question. Roseanne on stage with Trump. Good idea? Do you still think that's a good idea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's now about, look, I think that when you are in the room, you throw out ideas. I still think that, you know, once it came out that she, you know, didn't even know what was happening, I thought, you know, maybe this is an idea, it was kind of in a joking manner. But unfortunately, everything leaks out. She was never on stage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And she will not be, I assume?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Is that true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Yes. No. There has been no request for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Unfortunately, we got to leave it there. But I hope you'll come back. It's been very interesting to talk to you as obviously a lot going on. You're going to be the man at the center of all of this very soon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Thanks for that reminder."
    },
