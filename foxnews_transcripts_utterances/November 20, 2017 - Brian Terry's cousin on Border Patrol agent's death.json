He's been suspended by CBS News, PBS and Bloomberg after \"The Washington Post\" reported that eight women claimed Rose sexually harassed them.

And another absolutely crazy story coming out of a university or college, and this one out of Dartmouth College, and I graduated Dartmouth just a few years ago. On February 2nd the college is Christian to hold a forum called \"What's up with white people?\" The event will feature Temple University sociologist Matt Ray. And he plans to provide a, quote, \"field guide\" for, quote, \"the different types of white people and how you can learn to spot them in their natural habitats.\" It sounds like the Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Dartmouth released a statement saying it's committed to robust debate and told FOX News that Professor Ray does not represent the views of the college. Joining us now for reaction from L.A. is Tariq Nasheed, a film producer who also bills himself as an anti-racism strategist. All right, take it away, Tariq.

But what you wouldn't hear much about is what is perhaps the most important story of the year -- America is back. Yes, though the media has been loathed to report this fact, 2017 has been a banner year for the U.S. economy, an incredible comeback from President Obama's anemic non-recovery recovery. The Economist this week notes that blue collar wages are rising. As unemployment tumbles, wage growth among factory workers, drivers, and builders now exceeds four percent. Theirs is growing faster than the wages of professionals and managers. And when you dig deeper, there's even better news. The trades are rising. Some building contractors are seeing wages grow by double digits year over year. That is great news. So why are things working so well? First of all, he has a great team in place, President Trump, guys like Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, and what Axios is calling a rising star in the administration in Bob Lighthizer, the president's U.S. trade representative. What he does and does it really well is he advances President Trump's America first vision in global trade dealing. So you know what I say? With Lighthizer in charge, look out Beijing, lookout South Korea, watch it, Mexico, and any other country that is gaming the deals that we negotiated in good faith.

Some of them want work or want to see their family. I understand that, but it's not compassionate. Now we have another border agent dead. Your reaction. ENRIQUE MORONES, FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR, \"BORDER ANGELS\": Well, I want to give my condolences to the Martinez family. It's terrible what happened to him and his partner. I have attended the funerals of border patrol agents. It's horrible when these types of situations take place. Eleven thousand migrants have died since 1994 when the wall was built that covers a third of the border. And Laura, as you know that in the last five years, there's been 40 percent drop of people crossing without papers. So, less people are crossing going North, actually more people are going south, returning to Mexico or other parts. Mexico is no longer the largest group of people coming without papers. It's actually people from Central America. We should have humane borders. We Border Angels --"

These agents that have died have died protecting our country and enforcing the laws. It's very, very unfortunate what happened to our fellow agent. We're heartbroken over this whole situation. We don't want to make it political. It's hard not to. It just breaks all of our hearts. I've been talking to a lot of the people out there in that area of Texas. They are heartbroken. We'll hear a lot of stories, I know, coming forward. We're going to wait to see what the investigation brings. However, what we have heard from the agents that were there, you have two agents that are familiar with the area that are looking in different areas there, in an area that is well-known for drug trafficking. Now we have one dead agent. We have another agent that had severe head trauma. There's no other explanation. Is there a lot of possibilities what could have happened?

Broadcaster Charlie Rose and \"New York Times\" White House correspondent, Glenn Thrush. Mr. Rose, he's a legendary interviewer. He interviewed me a couple of weeks ago. He's been suspended by CBS News, PBS and Bloomberg after \"The Washington Post\" reported that eight women claimed Rose sexually harassed them. And as for Mr. Thrush, \"The Times\" suspended him today after the website, \"Vax\" published a story in which four women say he made unwanted advances. Both Mr. Rose and Mr. Thrush released statements offering apologies, but both also disputed the details of the allegation. So, is this just the beginning of justice for the harassers or has this whole thing already gone too far? Joining us from Chicago is my friend, Jim Warren, chief media writer for the \"Poynter\" Institute and in New York, my other friend, conservative commentator, Monica Crowley. I'll start with you, Monica. I have two minds of this. Number one, it's great that people are aware of bad behavior and stopping bad behavior in the workplace or anywhere else. That's a good thing. On the other hand, it seems like it's almost like the pile-on. Like one person is trying to one-up the other saying he put his hand near my thigh. I'm not trying to minimize it. Does it ever end?

So, the moment you got the Harvey Weinstein story, this story of this incredibly famous and powerful Hollywood heavyweight reported in \"The New York Times,\" that story -- he was a particularly egregious example of this behavior. That story then opened up the flood gates and because this kind of behavior has been excused for so long, now we have a tsunami of these stories and women that feel empowered to step up and tell their stories, whether it's recent or say 40, 50 years ago. They feel now emboldened and empowered to come forward. When you ask if it's going to end, I don't think so.

There's different levels of inappropriate behavior as folks at your network know very well over what has happened the last couple years. None of it is inexcusable. There's a difference between what we're reading about Glenn Thrush and Charlie Rose and Harvey Weinstein, but I think it's the tip of the iceberg. I think it has to do with people feeling empowered to come forward and as much as power as it is about gender. It's also interestingly about marketplace ruling for the moment and saying have to throw these bums out."

Over one-third of American young adults thinks it's always or usually sexual harassment if a man that is not a woman's romantic partner compliments her looks. One in four young women say it's usually sexual harassment if he asks her out for a drink. Do you see my point here? My point is, how do you have a normal office relationship if now complimenting someone on -- you look great today, like young people that that is a form of sexual harassment. It's one in four women. There has to be a middle ground here. You can't have any conversation other than numbers or whatever your business is. That's also crazy.

We don't know how far it's going to go. I think we have to start the conversation now that to Jim's point. There's different classes of predators and victims, and we need to have an honest conversation about that. On college campuses for a long time, they've been talking about what you're laying out. For every move, somebody might want to make on somebody else, they have to ask for permission at every stage because the sense of appropriateness has been lost and moreover the sense of common sense, Laura. So, I think there's a danger of the pendulum swinging in the opposite direction. Again, this is not to excuse bad behavior in any form.

Well, it seems Mr. Franken's problems are just getting started after a second woman has come forward with a claim of her own. Thirty-three-year- old Lindsay Menz tweeted out, quote, \"In August 2010 Al Franken grabbed me while taking a photo together at the Minnesota State Fair. I felt violated and embarrassed.\" The year 2010 is important because it means Mr. Franken was serving in the Senate at the time of the alleged incident, which begs the question, should he resign? Joining us now for a debate are two Democrats. From Washington, former Hillary Clinton Richard Goodstein, and from Atlanta, Robin Biro, a Democratic strategist who worked on President Obama 2008 campaign. All right, Richard, let's start with you. Second woman, I guess squeezed her tush or something. We were just joking we've gone from Minnesota state far corndogs to horn dogs, such an easy joke. But what do you think at this point?"

When it was Roy Moore he said he's going to sue these people. Donald Trump is accused of putting his hands and fingers in places we can't talk about, he said he's going to sue them. So I don't think until we come up with some sense of proportion, the notion of Al Franken resigning over this frankly seems silly."

To me that sounds like the language of somebody who may have actually done this so many times that it's normalized, like he almost can't remember doing it or not. And I think that he himself knows. And if he did to this in fact, he really does need to resign because we should have a zero tolerance policy for this just like we do in the military for sexual assault.

I think the voters are the ones who should decide this in the next election cycle. They elected him. He came from the entertainment world, he came from \"Saturday Night Live.\" I've known and had good friends who worked on \"Saturday Night Live.\" That's a wild deal over there. That's a wild arena. There's a lot of stuff that happened backstage, offstage, people hooking up. That's just the way it is. It's the entertainment world. But they kind of knew what they were getting with Al Franken. Not saying they knew he was doing the groping pictures. But they elected him. Let them un-elect him. And he apologized, I don't personally like Al Franken. He's never been particularly nice to me. We don't agree. But I find him personally when I've debated him in past, very, very nasty. At the same token, I actually don't think he should resign. And I think the voters should decide Alabama.

I think everybody is guilty of that. Whether you're in Times Square, you look up at the billboards. You see models who are maybe 15, 14-years-old, they're dressed in a very provocative way. I'm not saying that that brings on sexual harassment, but objectification is everywhere, everywhere. It's in film, it's in music. The lyrics that are the most disgusting, profane that we can't show on screen. So if objectifying and stopping the objectification or the pornification, as I call it, is our goal, then we have a long way to go across every medium, not just regarding sexual harassment but regarding the content we're actually producing in the entertainment industry especially.

These stories are actually coming out during the show they're coming out so fast and furious, so I had to update you on that. And another absolutely crazy story coming out of a university or college, and this one out of Dartmouth College, and I graduated Dartmouth just a few years ago. On February 2nd the college is Christian to hold a forum called \"What's up with white people?\" The event will feature Temple University sociologist Matt Ray. And he plans to provide a, quote, \"field guide\" for, quote, \"the different types of white people and how you can learn to spot them in their natural habitats.\" It sounds like the Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Dartmouth released a statement saying it's committed to robust debate and told FOX News that Professor Ray does not represent the views of the college. Joining us now for reaction from L.A. is Tariq Nasheed, a film producer who also bills himself as an anti-racism strategist. All right, take it away, Tariq.

Systematic white supremacy, it works back on deception, it works through propaganda, and that's something we have to talk about and we have to flesh. I want to replace the system of white supremacy with justice because not only do we get when it comes to resources in the criminal justice system, it's a racially biased system.

      "utterance": "The good news they're not telling you. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. If you just landed here from another planet, you would think that the only news stories that matter are the alleged Trump-Russian collusion, Robert Mueller's flying subpoenas, and the growing gaggle of A-list gropers. But what you wouldn't hear much about is what is perhaps the most important story of the year -- America is back. Yes, though the media has been loathed to report this fact, 2017 has been a banner year for the U.S. economy, an incredible comeback from President Obama's anemic non-recovery recovery. The Economist this week notes that blue collar wages are rising. As unemployment tumbles, wage growth among factory workers, drivers, and builders now exceeds four percent. Theirs is growing faster than the wages of professionals and managers. And when you dig deeper, there's even better news. The trades are rising. Some building contractors are seeing wages grow by double digits year over year. That is great news. So why are things working so well? First of all, he has a great team in place, President Trump, guys like Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, and what Axios is calling a rising star in the administration in Bob Lighthizer, the president's U.S. trade representative. What he does and does it really well is he advances President Trump's America first vision in global trade dealing. So you know what I say? With Lighthizer in charge, look out Beijing, lookout South Korea, watch it, Mexico, and any other country that is gaming the deals that we negotiated in good faith. Lighthizer, remember this exclusive interview he gave us, said this about finally establishing an equal playing field."

      "utterance": "Now, his policies and this pro-American posture is already benefitting American manufacturing and the American worker. You already know that the stock market is experiencing record growth, but did you know that U.S. housing and industrial production are also up? Things are rebounding so robustly that the Federal Reserve Bank in New York is projecting a 3.8 percent rise in the gross domestic product. That's up a week ago, just from a week ago. And if that projection holds, this will be the best quarter for the U.S. economy in three years. Now, do you remember when people were laughing when Trump said this?"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now who is laughing at him now? I don't get tired of winning, by the way. Winning is fun. And just to show that this is a president who knows how to keep his own house in order, on Friday the Trump administration released their annual report on White House personnel. There are 110 fewer employees working for President Trump than worked for Obama. You know what that saves taxpayers? That might be a drop in a bucket in the overall budget, but it saves taxpayers $5.1 million annually. I'll take that savings. And an Ingraham Angle fun fact -- Melania Trump has four staffers compared to Michelle Obama's meager 24. And did you know that the president has donated his entire $400,000 salary to the Department of the Interior? And that money is going to be used to pay for construction and repairs to our military cemeteries. I love that. So while others continue to parrot these conspiracy theories and cover issues that mean not that much to the daily lives of most Americans, you should know that things are getting demonstrably better in big ways and in small. And it is shameful and it is biased that these presidential accomplishments get so little coverage. I'll tell you something, here in the Ingraham Angle, we're going to fix that. We all have a little more to be thankful for this year, which should be reported honestly and celebrated. And that's the Angle. Do not go anywhere. We're back in just a moment."

Check out my new book. \"Billionaire at the Barricades,\" there it is, \"The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump.\" We had a great book signing at the Reagan Library Friday night. The major focus of my book is how the U.S. has gotten absolutely hammered in recent decades on trade. And we are going to look at how President Trump is brushing off the Chinese charm offensive -- President Xi's pageantry didn't get him very far -- and how we are going to take a harder line against Beijing. A lot of big issues in play. Be sure to DVR us, stay tuned, tomorrow night at 10:00 p.m. eastern. Up next, Ms. Shannon Bream. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.
