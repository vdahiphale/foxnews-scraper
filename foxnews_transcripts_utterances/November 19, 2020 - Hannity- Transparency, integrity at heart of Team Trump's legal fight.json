Tonight, the Trump campaign vowing to investigate -- by the way, wouldn't every American want to have faith and confidence in your elections? Every election irregularity, legitimate claim of fraud and abuse, these are American people, sworn affidavits, so that every legal vote can be counted in a fair, verifiable way, and we need a system we can all have confidence in, don't we? So, yeah, it's worth it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Coming up, we are going to have more on the recount developments in Wisconsin. Reince Priebus has an update. Ronna McDaniel is here. Kayleigh McEnany is here from around the country, as these allegations of election regularities continue to pile up. Rudy Giuliani will be here for an exclusive interview tonight. And here, I want everyone to hear where I'm coming from. Here is the state of your country that every American needs to understand, and getting to the bottom of finding thousands of votes -- this week alone, two weeks after an election, does that not rub you the wrong way, or laws, we're going to unilaterally extend the deadline two days, just two days before the election, like they tried to do in Pennsylvania. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Laws that clearly state partisan poll watchers can observe the entire process, the counting of all the ballots, and every one of the states that we're talking about, but person after person saying no, they weren't allowed to see anything. Now, they all point to an election system that is broken. You would think every American care. One that better be fixed, or it's going to keep happening, and I could predict tonight, likely get worse, using voting machines. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, imagine this.

Well, in the lead-up to this election, Democrats, conservatives, the liberal media, even a liberal professor all agreed on Dominion software. We deserve answers. Why did the American people have the best? And now we know this, know this about the media mob, oh, we've got to move on, oh, this is terrible. I don't want to hear their lectures. Democrats, they don't care about any of this. Why? Because there chosen candidate is in the lead. Journalism, I said in 2007, is dead. The president labeled it right, it's fake news. Ninety-nine percent of the media now is nothing more than the press arm of all things Biden, Democratic socialist. We know that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And one of the things about this program, for three years on this program, we chart an independent course on this show. Nobody tells me what to say, what to do. I chart my own course. Three years, the media, the mob, we're independent, they're not, because for three years, we follow the truth, and they didn't. That is why we have been right on story after story. They've been proven dead wrong but never admit it. Let me give you some perspective. Every American, you need to stand back, look at the past four years of Donald Trump's presidency. Did the mob and the media ever once apply the same standard to President Trump that they applied to their friends in the Democratic Party? No. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's start with the Russia hoax. The media spread never ending, reckless lies and conspiracy theories on behalf of the Democratic allies. President Trump colluded with Russia and impacted the 2016 election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK. Three years later, four separate investigations, they cleared the president, we were right. We literally were unappealing the layer of every onion night after night, and they were wrong for over three years. They lied to America for three years. Did they ever correct the record? No. That's how corrupt they are. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And it was actually, we now know, the Clinton campaign, the DNC, they are the ones that paid for the dirty Russian misinformation dossier. Yep, with spectacular lies. They paid for the dossier, which was Russian, state-run disinformation, the exact opposite of what Democrats and the media told you the whole time. Did the media demand years of investigations? Did they obsess about Hillary's collusion? Did they demand she be held accountable? No. They completely ignored it, and they were enablers, and all of that for three long years. You want to get lectured from them? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Next, remember when the media falsely accused President Trump, improper Ukrainian quid pro quo based on a phone call we all had a transcript of with only a hearsay witness, opinion witnesses, the one fact witness backed up the president's story. A Ukrainian hoax that led to an impeachment show trial in the House, that's another year of the presidency of Donald Trump, and it went nowhere, as we predicted. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We were right, they were wrong again. Once again, the same standard was not applied to Joe Biden, on tape, bragging about leveraging 1 billion of your tax dollars to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, who then gave interviews and said, yeah, he was fired because he was investigating Joe Biden's son, zero experience Hunter. You may remember this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

No. Once again, they ignored it, they excused it, they basically acted like it didn't happen, providing Biden cover. That was the case even as the more recent September, Grassley- Johnson Senate report revealed zero experience Hunter, he raked in millions from all over the world, despite, again, no relevant experience. Millions from Burisma, the Ukrainian oil and gas giant, $3.5 million wire transfer from the first lady of Moscow, a Russian oligarch, $5 million from a state backed Chinese company -- don't forget the $1.5 million deal with the Bank of China, $100,000 shopping spree complements of a prominent Chinese national, 100 grand plus from a Kazakhstan oligarch earmarked for a new car. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Did the media ever conduct any serious investigation into what is obvious pay for play? Imagine if this was one of Donald Trump's kids. No, they did not. Four years, Biden was placed in the candidate put protection program, shielded from any real questions the entire campaign, big tech censored any negative coverage on behalf of Biden, and Joe was allowed to spend about half the time hiding in his basement bunker while the media, well, they did the job for him to come upon a pummeling Donald Trump every signal minute hour of every day. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, it's no surprise that so-called journalists have no interest looking to cases or American citizens saying that these are serious abuses of power here. They don't care about the hundreds of sworn affidavits. They got the outcome they wanted, so they don't really care what happened, and what could be done better? They don't care about getting the system right, either. And on November 3rd, over 73 million Americans voted for President Trump, almost 11 million more votes than he got in 2016. Every American should be tired and fed up at the double standard. It's gone on for four years, the lies, the conspiracy theories, breathless hysteria reporting and corruption. They don't trust America's powerful institutions, and you should end. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, that trust extends to this year's election chaos. What do we know? Oh, we know laws were broken come all the observers that are signing legal affidavits, people blocks from viewing the process the law says they can view, dead people voting in some places, batches of uncontested ballots turning up here and there two weeks later, everywhere voting system issues. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And without a doubt, if we don't get to the bottom of what happened, we don't get there, and President Trump's legal team is bowing to do that, why would you expect it to ever stop?

In 2019, look at this, three Democratic senators, Warren, Klobuchar, and Wyden, one Democratic congressman, Mark Pocan, they were sounding the alarm about, quiet now, but they said, quote, Dominion's very limited information available in the public domain about their operations and financial performance.

Keep in mind, similar concerns because the state of Texas to reject Dominion voting systems on three separate occasions, once in 2013, and after testing it out, according to the AG and secretary of state, they looked into the system twice in 2019, didn't meet their standards in Texas. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, 2018, prominent tenured professor at Princeton specializing, believe it or not, I didn't know such a thing existed, election machinery, policy, and conspiracy, the guy's name is Andrew Appel, he had an op-ed blasting dominion over security concerns. 2018, the \"A.P.\" reported Dominion, quote, long skimped on security in favor of convenience, making it more difficult to detect intrusions. \"The New York Times\" even criticized them. This year, during Georgia's primary in June, they said Dominion's new machines required to much extra power for aging polling locations, blowing fuses, never powering on, and others, workers still being trained days before the election, they struggled with set up, and they go on to say the electronic poll books also were flagged by freezing software and user error. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you're keeping track, Senators Warren, Klobuchar, Biden -- Wyden, tenured professor, state of Texas, the \"A.P.\", \"The New York Times,\" people from all political persuasions surrounding dominion voting systems, hardly part of the vast right-wing conspiracy. Now, if in a divided country like this one, you got Democrats, Republicans, and the media, before the election, agreeing that this is not the best system, why was it used in the first place in 28 states? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here is another question: don't you think we, the people, deserve better? Don't we deserve better? And now, if you bring up Dominion, you are conspiracy theorists from the biggest conspiracy theorist in Washington, the media. So, how is that fair and right? Whether the machines worked well in this election is yet to be determined, but why were they used in the first place is my question. What about the hundreds of sworn affidavits signed under penalty of perjury?

Do you think they would care at all? They don't seem to care at all. Ultimately, the only thing I know for certain is going forward, is that America's powerful institutions, including the mob and the media, big tech, that mob, the Democratic Party socialist mob, the deep state mob, they don't really care about the truth, they don't care about justice, they don't care about equal application of our laws, equal justice under the law, and that's what I was telling you for three years when we told the story that nobody else would tell about the real Russia collusion, that would be Hillary's dirty dossier, and then, of course, lying to FISA courts and spying on 2016 candidate Trump, and President Trump later. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The only thing they seem to care about is power, they will do and say anything to get it, and that is why we will always come up on this show, at least my hour, we are going to go in our direction, independently, because they're not going to do their job.

Okay, then bring your dog. I am indefinitely confined, you don't need an ID, here's a ballot. That's what's been going on. So this complaint from the Trump campaign in Wisconsin, it's a very legal action. This is a purely legal complaint, on very serious matters that we really need to deal with in the state of Wisconsin.",

Joining us now with reaction, author of the new book \"Slanted,\" host of \"Full Measure\", journalist Sharyl Attkisson, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and justthenews -- founder -- dotcom, founder John Solomon. All right. Let's go to the legal side, Gregg, and talk specifically about what the mayor was saying, and three states would have to flip for the president. That's a very big effort. And, you know, what are the best arguments and where do you see this going within the court system?",

Evidence is presented in a court of law, eyewitnesses, affidavits sworn under penalty of perjury, that's how the legal process goes. So, as Giuliani pointed out, he has to go state by state. It takes time. It takes two weeks to gather that evidence. And now, he is going about the arduous tasks of presenting a judge by judge, jurisdiction by jurisdiction. But, look, where you have blank ballots that are assigned names, thousands of them, and then filled in with the votes, when you have thousands of backdated ballots, when you have ballots that don't match valid voters, when you have ballots that don't match signatures, and importantly, where you have the integrity of voting machines and the critical software called into serious question because there is a backdoor that allows tens of thousands of votes to be transferred from one candidate to another instantaneously, with the click of a mouse, at the stroke of a keyboard, these need to be look to in a court of law. That's how the process works. Of course, the media could be searching for this evidence on their own, but they wouldn't do that because that would jeopardize their coronation of their chosen candidate, Joe Biden, and it would be the responsible, journalistic thing to do, and they've proven they won't do it.",

He participated in a project where we reviewed high risk ballots in Pennsylvania, and he says under the penalty of perjury, using his statistical expertise, that there were between 80,000 and 100,000 ballots that either didn't get counted in Pennsylvania that came from Republicans, or that were requested in the name of another person, meaning the person who voted or got the ballot wasn't the person who requested it. He's putting his name to this, 100,000 votes. Why is that important? The spread in Pennsylvania between Trump and Biden is below that number, about 80,000 at last count. This is the sort of gumshoe work that can help Americans understand, is this issue real or not?

Tonight, the Trump campaign vowing to investigate -- by the way, wouldn't every American want to have faith and confidence in your elections? Every election irregularity, legitimate claim of fraud and abuse, these are American people, sworn affidavits, so that every legal vote can be counted in a fair, verifiable way, and we need a system we can all have confidence in, don't we? So, yeah, it's worth it. Coming up, we are going to have more on the recount developments in Wisconsin. Reince Priebus has an update. Ronna McDaniel is here. Kayleigh McEnany is here from around the country, as these allegations of election regularities continue to pile up. Rudy Giuliani will be here for an exclusive interview tonight. And here, I want everyone to hear where I'm coming from. Here is the state of your country that every American needs to understand, and getting to the bottom of finding thousands of votes -- this week alone, two weeks after an election, does that not rub you the wrong way, or laws, we're going to unilaterally extend the deadline two days, just two days before the election, like they tried to do in Pennsylvania. Laws that clearly state partisan poll watchers can observe the entire process, the counting of all the ballots, and every one of the states that we're talking about, but person after person saying no, they weren't allowed to see anything. Now, they all point to an election system that is broken. You would think every American care. One that better be fixed, or it's going to keep happening, and I could predict tonight, likely get worse, using voting machines. Now, imagine this. This is what we know -- and we'll get into more details -- Republicans, Democrats, the liberal media, when do they ever agree on anything? Well, in the lead-up to this election, Democrats, conservatives, the liberal media, even a liberal professor all agreed on Dominion software. We deserve answers. Why did the American people have the best? And now we know this, know this about the media mob, oh, we've got to move on, oh, this is terrible. I don't want to hear their lectures. Democrats, they don't care about any of this. Why? Because there chosen candidate is in the lead. Journalism, I said in 2007, is dead. The president labeled it right, it's fake news. Ninety-nine percent of the media now is nothing more than the press arm of all things Biden, Democratic socialist. We know that. And one of the things about this program, for three years on this program, we chart an independent course on this show. Nobody tells me what to say, what to do. I chart my own course. Three years, the media, the mob, we're independent, they're not, because for three years, we follow the truth, and they didn't. That is why we have been right on story after story. They've been proven dead wrong but never admit it. Let me give you some perspective. Every American, you need to stand back, look at the past four years of Donald Trump's presidency. Did the mob and the media ever once apply the same standard to President Trump that they applied to their friends in the Democratic Party? No. Let's start with the Russia hoax. The media spread never ending, reckless lies and conspiracy theories on behalf of the Democratic allies. President Trump colluded with Russia and impacted the 2016 election. OK. Three years later, four separate investigations, they cleared the president, we were right. We literally were unappealing the layer of every onion night after night, and they were wrong for over three years. They lied to America for three years. Did they ever correct the record? No. That's how corrupt they are. And it was actually, we now know, the Clinton campaign, the DNC, they are the ones that paid for the dirty Russian misinformation dossier. Yep, with spectacular lies. They paid for the dossier, which was Russian, state-run disinformation, the exact opposite of what Democrats and the media told you the whole time. Did the media demand years of investigations? Did they obsess about Hillary's collusion? Did they demand she be held accountable? No. They completely ignored it, and they were enablers, and all of that for three long years. You want to get lectured from them? Next, remember when the media falsely accused President Trump, improper Ukrainian quid pro quo based on a phone call we all had a transcript of with only a hearsay witness, opinion witnesses, the one fact witness backed up the president's story. A Ukrainian hoax that led to an impeachment show trial in the House, that's another year of the presidency of Donald Trump, and it went nowhere, as we predicted. We were right, they were wrong again. Once again, the same standard was not applied to Joe Biden, on tape, bragging about leveraging 1 billion of your tax dollars to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, who then gave interviews and said, yeah, he was fired because he was investigating Joe Biden's son, zero experience Hunter. You may remember this."

I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here and I think it was about six hours, I look at and said, we're leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a (EXPLETIVE DELETED). He got fired."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "He used a billion dollars. He got the prosecutor fired, his son had no experience, was made paid millions. Did the media demand answer after hearing a real Ukrainian quid pro quo, straight from the lips of Joe Biden? No. Once again, they ignored it, they excused it, they basically acted like it didn't happen, providing Biden cover. That was the case even as the more recent September, Grassley- Johnson Senate report revealed zero experience Hunter, he raked in millions from all over the world, despite, again, no relevant experience. Millions from Burisma, the Ukrainian oil and gas giant, $3.5 million wire transfer from the first lady of Moscow, a Russian oligarch, $5 million from a state backed Chinese company -- don't forget the $1.5 million deal with the Bank of China, $100,000 shopping spree complements of a prominent Chinese national, 100 grand plus from a Kazakhstan oligarch earmarked for a new car. Did the media ever conduct any serious investigation into what is obvious pay for play? Imagine if this was one of Donald Trump's kids. No, they did not. Four years, Biden was placed in the candidate put protection program, shielded from any real questions the entire campaign, big tech censored any negative coverage on behalf of Biden, and Joe was allowed to spend about half the time hiding in his basement bunker while the media, well, they did the job for him to come upon a pummeling Donald Trump every signal minute hour of every day. So, it's no surprise that so-called journalists have no interest looking to cases or American citizens saying that these are serious abuses of power here. They don't care about the hundreds of sworn affidavits. They got the outcome they wanted, so they don't really care what happened, and what could be done better? They don't care about getting the system right, either. And on November 3rd, over 73 million Americans voted for President Trump, almost 11 million more votes than he got in 2016. Every American should be tired and fed up at the double standard. It's gone on for four years, the lies, the conspiracy theories, breathless hysteria reporting and corruption. They don't trust America's powerful institutions, and you should end. And by the way, that trust extends to this year's election chaos. What do we know? Oh, we know laws were broken come all the observers that are signing legal affidavits, people blocks from viewing the process the law says they can view, dead people voting in some places, batches of uncontested ballots turning up here and there two weeks later, everywhere voting system issues. And without a doubt, if we don't get to the bottom of what happened, we don't get there, and President Trump's legal team is bowing to do that, why would you expect it to ever stop? Take a look."

In 2019, look at this, three Democratic senators, Warren, Klobuchar, and Wyden, one Democratic congressman, Mark Pocan, they were sounding the alarm about, quiet now, but they said, quote, Dominion's very limited information available in the public domain about their operations and financial performance. The four Democrats, last year, went on to highlight serious voter issues in multiple states using several different machines."

      "utterance": "In 2018 alone, voters in South Carolina were reporting machines that switched their votes. Meanwhile, scanners rejecting paper ballots in Missouri, and busted machines were causing long lines in Indiana. Democrats said this. According to the lawmakers, researchers recently uncovered previously undisclosed vulnerabilities and nearly three dozen back end election systems in ten states. Keep in mind, similar concerns because the state of Texas to reject Dominion voting systems on three separate occasions, once in 2013, and after testing it out, according to the AG and secretary of state, they looked into the system twice in 2019, didn't meet their standards in Texas. Meanwhile, 2018, prominent tenured professor at Princeton specializing, believe it or not, I didn't know such a thing existed, election machinery, policy, and conspiracy, the guy's name is Andrew Appel, he had an op-ed blasting dominion over security concerns. 2018, the \"A.P.\" reported Dominion, quote, long skimped on security in favor of convenience, making it more difficult to detect intrusions. \"The New York Times\" even criticized them. This year, during Georgia's primary in June, they said Dominion's new machines required to much extra power for aging polling locations, blowing fuses, never powering on, and others, workers still being trained days before the election, they struggled with set up, and they go on to say the electronic poll books also were flagged by freezing software and user error. If you're keeping track, Senators Warren, Klobuchar, Biden -- Wyden, tenured professor, state of Texas, the \"A.P.\", \"The New York Times,\" people from all political persuasions surrounding dominion voting systems, hardly part of the vast right-wing conspiracy. Now, if in a divided country like this one, you got Democrats, Republicans, and the media, before the election, agreeing that this is not the best system, why was it used in the first place in 28 states?"

And now, if you bring up Dominion, you are conspiracy theorists from the biggest conspiracy theorist in Washington, the media. So, how is that fair and right? Whether the machines worked well in this election is yet to be determined, but why were they used in the first place is my question. What about the hundreds of sworn affidavits signed under penalty of perjury? Are their stories not worthy of being heard? Where are you, Senator Warren? Senator Klobuchar? No longer care about election irregularities, as long as you get the result you want? You think the media mob would be doing it right now if thousands of uncounted ballots this week turned up in a close date for Joe Biden? Do you think the media would be silent? Do you think they would care at all? They don't seem to care at all. Ultimately, the only thing I know for certain is going forward, is that America's powerful institutions, including the mob and the media, big tech, that mob, the Democratic Party socialist mob, the deep state mob, they don't really care about the truth, they don't care about justice, they don't care about equal application of our laws, equal justice under the law, and that's what I was telling you for three years when we told the story that nobody else would tell about the real Russia collusion, that would be Hillary's dirty dossier, and then, of course, lying to FISA courts and spying on 2016 candidate Trump, and President Trump later. The only thing they seem to care about is power, they will do and say anything to get it, and that is why we will always come up on this show, at least my hour, we are going to go in our direction, independently, because they're not going to do their job. I have no faith of any of them to put in the work in, to tell you the truth. That's sad. More on this coming up. Kayleigh McEnany. But first, we turn to the state of Wisconsin, Democrats are now attempting there to change the rules in order to restrict an upcoming recount. OK, when you get to change the rules after the game is played? Here with more is RNC chair Ronna McDaniel and former White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus. Reince, you're from Wisconsin.

So, what happened was the Wisconsin Election Commission, the clerks, created a different system, and they said, you can vote in-person absentee, but that requires an absentee ballot application, which many of these counties didn't adhere to. So, the Trump campaign looks at their case. This is a major part of it. And they say, you know what, we have a case here in Wisconsin. These applications were never filed. They transfer their $3 million to the state of Wisconsin. They filed their petition, and then the Wisconsin Election Commission says, well, let's have an emergency meeting, and they put forward a new recount manual -- now this is last night, until about midnight -- to change the rules so that the Trump campaign can't actually see the absentee ballot applications.

It's usually a pretty small number. Well, the Dane County clerk, back in March, declared that all voters could actually declare themselves indefinitely confined, and then not have to show an identification of the polls. It was a way to get around showing voter ID. It's like everyone bring their dog on the plane and saying it is an emotional support animal. Okay, then bring your dog. I am indefinitely confined, you don't need an ID, here's a ballot. That's what's been going on. So this complaint from the Trump campaign in Wisconsin, it's a very legal action.

The poll book said this many absentee ballots went out in Detroit, 100, but 200 came back. How does that happen, in 71 percent of the precincts? So, the two Republicans on the board said, we're not going to certify the election, and then, Sean, the doxing, the bullying, the harassment, the horrific accusations toward these two board members, calling them racist, happened. The Democrats came in and said, you know what, we will do an audit. We promise, if you certify it. They were lying, now Republicans have rescinded their agreement to certify, and this is just going on and on and on. And what Reince is saying is true. They attacked our president for three years on a Russia hoax based on a fake dossier. We are pursuing real claims based on authentic, under oath affidavits and evidence.

There are a lot of folks who texted me, and I do have declarations to this end -- that said, I showed up and was told someone cast a mail-in ballot on my behalf when I never cast, so I cast this provisional ballot because someone unbeknownst to me voted by mail. Well, I found out tonight that 100,000 of these provisional ballots were cast. That is roughly four times the amount in 2016, and even the liberal \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" has said this. This meant that people showed up, were told they were ineligible to vote, casted these ballots, and it's all because of mail-in voting.

This is a poll worker, a lawyer, who has come -- a poll worker came up to him and said, hi, I am being told to predate ballots, so I ballot comes in late, but I was told to predate it early so that it counts, and the poll watcher, nonpartisan poll watcher, actually handed him a sticky note where he wrote down, cast -- change the date of ballot from 11/2 -- from 11/4 to 11/2.

It takes time. It takes two weeks to gather that evidence. And now, he is going about the arduous tasks of presenting a judge by judge, jurisdiction by jurisdiction. But, look, where you have blank ballots that are assigned names, thousands of them, and then filled in with the votes, when you have thousands of backdated ballots, when you have ballots that don't match valid voters, when you have ballots that don't match signatures, and importantly, where you have the integrity of voting machines and the critical software called into serious question because there is a backdoor that allows tens of thousands of votes to be transferred from one candidate to another instantaneously, with the click of a mouse, at the stroke of a keyboard, these need to be look to in a court of law. That's how the process works.

He participated in a project where we reviewed high risk ballots in Pennsylvania, and he says under the penalty of perjury, using his statistical expertise, that there were between 80,000 and 100,000 ballots that either didn't get counted in Pennsylvania that came from Republicans, or that were requested in the name of another person, meaning the person who voted or got the ballot wasn't the person who requested it.

They ignore the corruption there. Now you see that the media has no interest whatsoever because isn't it, for them come about the result? I say media is dead, journalism is dead. I think they are part of a mob that is all things to protect Joe Biden. They didn't ask Joe Biden tough questions. Let him hide in his basement bunker. I think we got a real big information problem in this country that is getting worse by the day. Thoughts?"

      "utterance": "We do, and I think you touched on this when we talked about the comparative behavior and coverage that has come from the news media gave to the disproven in the end theory that President Trump somehow colluded with Russian President Putin to take the 2016 election. Think of all the bandwidth that was given to this theory, this conspiracy theory, that proved not to be true. But almost no journalistic or rational skepticism or curiosity applied to the 2020 election, knowing in advance, as we were told, that Russia and China would try to interfere, perhaps other foreign countries, that we had bad domestic actors that have done improper and illegal things in the recent past, some of them inside our own very government, a neutral, unconflicted press would have been on the ground, those covering politics, looking for improprieties from every side, particularly in the swing states. Rather than sitting back and declaring that the evidence comes knocking on the door and presents itself to them and guilty parties come and admit what they've done, and then declare if that doesn't happen, that there simply is no reason to have any skepticism about this process."

You might have partisans, maybe a dozen, two dozen, three dozen, that would come forward and sign a legal affidavit under the threat of perjury, and maybe lie because their candidate, they want their candidate to win. I don't think hundreds of Americans would put themselves in legal jeopardy -- I know I wouldn't because I'd be put in jail for spitting on the sidewalk -- but a separate issue. You, you know, they just dismiss it out of hand, and meanwhile they took on all of the lies of Russia and ignored all of the massive double standard with Hunter and Joe. Thoughts?"

There's plenty of smoke. Not only are there lawyers in some cases were filed sworn affidavits with very specific details, but there's at least one case, a Democrat observer in a city, who recognized and saw improprieties that he has signed a sworn affidavit attesting to that. So, it's not just a bunch of, as you said, Republican partisans, and a critical press, a neutral press, would look at this and at least say there is something here that deserves a lot of investigation, rather than just dismissing it out of hand on the front end."

As you know, the CDC is recommending that all Americans not gather or travel in groups unless they can properly social distance, but the question is, do these rules apply to those who make the rules?

Congresswoman, you know, why do I -- I look at Kristi Noem in South Dakota, she said, I put faith in my own citizens, give them the truth, tell them about social distancing, masks, protecting granny, grandma, grandpa, mom and dad, kids coming home from school should wear masks, social distance. I don't how government is going to enforce this."

      "utterance": "Absolutely, Sean. So, I come from a state, we currently have the worst governor in America. Governor Cuomo, unfortunately, made fatal decisions early on, causing the loss of tens of thousands of lives of seniors in our nursing homes, and he is taking absolutely the wrong approach. He also is not applying the rules to himself. So, Governor Cuomo has attended private events without wearing masks, without requiring socially distancing. I'm looking forward to wishing my constituents a \"Happy Thanksgiving\". People should have the freedoms to make the right decisions based upon their personal health, their family situation. And it's not just Governor Cuomo. Take a look at Governor Gavin Newsom in California, who was caught on camera having a dinner without masks, with public health officials, as he is advocating for a mask mandate and not getting together people in those small groups. So, again, this is why the American people are so frustrated with failed leadership among Democratic governors. It's big governments, it's rules for thee but not for me, and it is shameful. And I'm proud of my local law enforcement officials who have said that they will not be enforcing this governor's edicts."

I think -- and I even said, the reason I said early on -- now we have not one but two American companies that are giving us a vaccine, pretty amazing. I put my faith in those scientists and researchers. The thing is, you tell people, I would advise kids, for example, coming home from school, be careful with mom and dad, grandma and grandpa. Follow the rules. I think most people would do it because they love grandma and grandpa. Am I wrong?"

The proper role of government is to inform the government, tell them of the dangers, but leave them the freedom and liberty to make their own decisions, and live with the consequences of those decisions. Most people are going to do what's right for their neighbors. They're going to do what's right for their families. They're going to do what is right for themselves. But these lockdowns, as Elise Stefanik is talking about, are just absolutely absurd, and the hypocrisy drives everybody nuts. I love Gavin Newsom, when the governor of California, when he told people, you should put your masks on in between bites. I mean, it's just absurd. We did see Nancy Pelosi going out to the hair salon in the middle of a lockdown. I mean, the list is endless. But have some faith in the American people. We can beat this. And God bless Donald Trump for starting Operation Warp Speed, because it is not going to be government that solves these problems. It's going to be companies like Pfizer and Moderna and these other private entities, using the best scientists in the world to solve the problems that we face with COVID."
