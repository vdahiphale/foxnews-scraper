And we have the strongest military in the world, Russia knows that. China knows that. Hugh, you and I rarely agree. We debated here in 2013 here in California in person and had a lot of fun. But I will agree with you on this. We need to be the one that puts down that red line. I agree when President Biden says that he will not accept others' red lines. And I do think this is the time for the president to shine, his bipartisan support to be tough and to support Ukraine. And in addition to that, he has a lot of experience with foreign policy and with foreign leaders and with people very much like Vladimir Putin.",

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": If you look at Afghanistan, that would seem to be a position that the Biden administration particularly does not want to be given the haste with which it went to withdraw from that commitment, which, by the way, is probably behind this poking of the bear that Leslie is alluding to. But there are other things that can be done, by the way, without fully sending troops, and things that Biden ought to be doing at the moment, including of the selling of military supplies to Ukraine, including lethal aid, and some very, very clear lines on very stiff international sanctions and particularly when it comes to banking if Russia were to make this move. There's plenty of things that could be done instead of just signing off on the Nord Stream pipeline.",

It means a half million children separated from their families, forced sterilization of women, arbitrary and mandatory marriages of Han with Uyghur women. It is a genocide. Then Secretary of State Pompeo declared it, now Secretary of State Blinken has affirmed it. So it shouldn't just be our diplomats. Our corporations should shot be going. We should not allow the profiting by that regime, the Chinese Communist Party and Xi Jinping, the new documents released by \"The Wall Street Journal\" over the last week prove that he authorized this genocide. I can't imagine that we want our companies involved with which that is the moral equivalent of what the Nazis did in the 40s, what happened in Rwanda, what happened in Syria, and what happened in Cambodia.
