We've seen this movie before, because the president last year after the Parkland high school shootings in Florida said he brought together members of Congress for televised sessions, he's going to take on the NRA, and then he let it drop. But he's kind of like, it could be a Nixon to China moment.

He didn't sound to me like a man who was going to invest a lot of his capital in this. It sounded like he was waiting for things to brew in a way. And I think one of the things that's so discouraging for Americans is that a sweeping majority of Americans already support these things, support tightened background checks, support a ban on assault weapons, support red flag laws. There is not a debate in the country about this. There is a consensus. And yet for the past several years these gun measures have been nothing except stalled in Congress. I guess I'm just skeptical that this is going to prove to be different."

      "utterance": "President Trump didn't do nothing. In fact, I think if President Obama had done what President Trump did on guns there would have been much more outcry. He, of course, did the executive action that a lot people think is unconstitutional to ban bump stocks. But in general, I think there is this bipartisan consensus of people rush to do something that might not actually have any effect, unfortunately, on mass shootings. Background checks would not have stopped these things. There is room for discussion about what to do, but I think the larger issue is we have completely destroyed the institutions that served as guardrails where communities and families and churches could see problems that were developing and have ways of fixing it. And we don't have the ways of fixing it. Those are such difficult problems to fix that instead we think that government action is going to solve what is actually a much deeper problem, much more serious problem."

Joaquin, Congressman from San Antonio, posted a tweet saying \"It's sad to see so many San Antonians 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump.\" And then he goes on to list them and list the names. \"The contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as invaders,\" lists all of these names, including at least one who donated to his campaign as well. In the past, and there are some who are currently doing it. Wayne Harwell told Fox News \"I was also on a list of people that gave to Castro. And if he dislikes me enough that he puts my name out there against Trump, I'm not going to give money to him. Obviously, Castro feels pretty strongly against me. I'm pretty independent, but I support Trump. A lot of in San Antonio are independents. I think the San Antonio community needs to take a real deep look at what Castro is doing.\" What about this? Back with the panel. Mollie?"

This type of action used to be reserved for the dark corners of the Internet where you target someone and release information about them in order to harass them because you don't like something that they said. To have it now being done by an actual representative of the U.S. government is deeply alarming, and it's something that people really need to condemn."

And the way that words matter, we say that about President Trump, that matters for Congressman Castro as well. And I worry just as Willie Geist did about whether this could create actually a dangerous situation for people who were indulging, doing their political right of making a contribution to a candidate they supported. And he also -- this graphic also listed the companies they worked at. So that suggests and effort to try to have some kind of boycott, perhaps."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Then it becomes an ugly arms race. Look, I don't buy the dodge this is public information. It takes a long time to look up how many donors live in San Antonio, nor do I accept the fact that he just deleted the tweet. This was not only dangerous for Joaquin Castro to do, but then he committed the really dumb move of doubled down on his mistake, as we saw in that show, and the whole thing was designed to get his face on television, I think. And the idea that he would play dumb, that he's putting a target on these people's backs, and essentially accusing them of being complicit in racism and white supremacy simply for the utterly legal act of donating to a presidential candidate they support I think nobody is going to buy. And I think it really is shameful what he did."

If he stops to talk to the cameras, I will listen in there with the first lady, and shaking hands with some of the emergency responders to this horrible shooting in El Paso. Is there a time, is there a moment where the president can be seen as trying to heal things by these visits, by his words, post these horrible events, Mollie?"

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "The story of the last several years has been of a resistance that is unwilling to see the president as president. So after these horrible mass shootings took place, he publicly spoke against hatred, violence, political violence. And many people either downplayed that or rejected it or ignored it in the face of a false narrative that they are constructing."

      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "But I'll tell you, he looks exactly appropriate in these pictures. And apparently the event in Dayton also he was well received by the first responders and the victims of the shooting there. On the other hand, he undercuts his own message by in the middle of this day sending out very disruptive, negative tweets with a very political tone at a time when the country is really reeling from these two things."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "That's fine. When he's criticizing the people who are criticizing him, I don't think he's blaming them for the violence that took place. And I think that is an important distinction. There are these ways of people having this particular standard for Donald Trump that is not shared for other people, or people who claimed that they don't like the way he is talking. They talk worse than he does."

I wish you could have been there. And it was no different here. We went to the hospital, just came from the hospital. We were there a lot longer than we were anticipated to be. It was supposed to be just a fairly quick. We met with numerous people. We met with also the doctors and the nurses and the medical staff. They have done an incredible job, both places just incredible. And the enthusiasm, the love, the respect, and also telling me, let's see if we can get something done. And Republicans want to do it, and Democrats want to do it. And by the way, here is a great hero. This man, the job he did it, you all know who it is. The whole world knows who you are now, right.

I had it with Sherrod Brown, he and the mayor, Nan Whaley, they asked could possibly go in and make a tour with you. I said, yes, let's do it. They couldn't believe what they say. And they said it to people, they've never seen anything like it. The entire hospital is no different than what we had in El Paso. The entire hospital, everybody was so proud of the job they did, because they did a great job. They did a great job here. And then I say goodbye? I took them in at their request, we made the tour. They couldn't believe it. She said it to people. He said it to people. I get on Air Force One where they do have a lot of televisions. I turn on the television, and there they are saying I don't know if it was appropriate for the president to be here, et cetera, et cetera, the same old line. They're very dishonest people, and that's probably why he got I think about zero percent and he failed as a presidential candidate. We're going to go in and see some, very quick, people, and I wanted to meet this hero before I did anything. And we appreciate it."

There really might be something to do about if carefully crafted legislation, red flag laws, which would help deal with some of these shootings that we have seen, people have been giving indications that they may be violent prior to committing them. It's very important that you craft those in such a way as to respect due process, and not take away constitutional rights from law- abiding citizens."
