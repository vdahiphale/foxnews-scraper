The message instead of getting vax, these white mouth breathing cretins are speaking in tongues, handling snakes and watching Fox News. And therefore they're killing the rest of us. But then that narrative change, something happened after people like me pointed out that actually it's not white folks running from the vaccine. We all know why people can't run. It's black folks and brown folks too, who are pretty shy about getting the vax. In fact, the rates of unvaccinated is way higher among minorities in cities like Manhattan, according to New York City's own data. About two-thirds of adults are vaccinated but black New Yorkers are at 31 percent and Hispanics, 42 percent. So now the obnoxious finger pointing mysteriously disappeared. Much like when of Governor Cuomo his hands during a selfie. You clap at that. I'll take it. And once again the press hope no one would notice how wrong they were on this. Go ahead, ask them. Are non-white vaccine residents just as stupid, arrogant and murderous as the whites? We're waiting, Morning Joe, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon. How about you, President Joe? Shouldn't you be as upset at those folks in the city as you are in the sticks? Or does that require consistency. Things the Democrats lack. So why did the media focus only on white right-wingers? Well, it creates endless opportunities for self-righteous drivel from T.V. hosts, I should know. It could be anything. Climate, taxes, law enforcement, gender, race, they turn everything into a far less entertaining version of pro wrestling. They always need a villain. So much like Amtrak. The truth doesn't turn a profit for cable news. Which may be why the media only likes to do the fun racist stuff. Yes, it must be the fans of Larry the Cable Guy who are killing us. These nonvaxxed are the same idiots who voted for Trump speeding around and pickup trucks listening to country music while brushing their remaining teeth with grits and gravy. They probably even like America, God forbid. But now the data says otherwise. So where's the media on this? They're not even bothering to address the black communities. But I guess if he can't divide us, then why bother doing anything helpful? I mean, you could help get the pro vax message to black communities. But I guess it's more fun to cleave a country in too. I wonder what the angry black male has to say.",

So, instead of talking about blame or educating the right group, you just keep pretending it's the wrong group? It doesn't make me angry, it makes me sad. You're so ignorant and racist that you lie to everybody. So, I guess that means you're consistent. So that means you're consistently for (BLEEP)",

      "sentences": "Speaking of, in New York City Bill de Blasio just introduced a vaccine passport to the city, where Trump got 23 percent of the vote in 2020. So it's not the righties that de Blasio is after. The new passport system calls for showing proof of vax to enter gyms, restaurants and entertainment venues, which judging by the stats I just mentioned, effectively bans most blacks. Just like the damage done to them during the classic Jim Crow days. So who is the Hitler now? If 70 percent of black New Yorkers are unvaccinated, they're the ones getting banned. Talk about white privilege. Imagine if Trump had done this, CNN would be handing out the pitchforks. By the way, it's odd that the left says you can't be expected to present an I.D. to vote, but you must show vaccine proof everywhere else. Why not allow absentee vaccine proof with no signature verification dropped off by people who hate vaccines? I mean, there's a hole in their plan you could drive a bus full of illegal immigrants through. So you can't demand proof of vaccine at the border. But you can do it at a Time Square's Applebee's. Makes sense there, jalapeno poppers are more dangerous than any virus from a Chinese lab. Be close to a bathroom. So, if Chris Cuomo called the 70 percent of black New Yorkers ignorant, what do you think? He's probably too busy creating strategies to defend his brother from grabbing women's breasts. I suppose the vaccinated white liberals must be secretly pleased, more open seats at the bar, more empty tables at their favorite trendy restaurant. And it's nice to have a break from all the murders their policies have led to. But if you judge the Dems the way they judge everyone else, then this would be racist. But we aren't Democrats. Thank God we just want people to do the right thing. Black, white, you name it. I think it's a good thing to get the vaccine if your doctor says you can. I know people who are gung ho about it, and people who are hell know about it. Some of these people I love, but none of them fit into the neat little categories. The media loves to bash. The Press just feels good about making other people feel bad. Conflict is their vaccine against loneliness. Thank god we're blessed with a natural immunity against this (BLEEP) it's called seeing everyone as Americans.",

With friends like that, who needs thinking for yourself? She forgot to mention her weekly routine includes drunk dialing Brad Pitt at 3:00 am.

But it's like my Uncle Steve used to say: Two persons cannot long be friends if they cannot forgive each other's little failings.

The message instead of getting vax, these white mouth breathing cretins are speaking in tongues, handling snakes and watching Fox News. And therefore they're killing the rest of us. But then that narrative change, something happened after people like me pointed out that actually it's not white folks running from the vaccine. We all know why people can't run. It's black folks and brown folks too, who are pretty shy about getting the vax. In fact, the rates of unvaccinated is way higher among minorities in cities like Manhattan, according to New York City's own data. About two-thirds of adults are vaccinated but black New Yorkers are at 31 percent and Hispanics, 42 percent. So now the obnoxious finger pointing mysteriously disappeared. Much like when of Governor Cuomo his hands during a selfie. You clap at that. I'll take it. And once again the press hope no one would notice how wrong they were on this. Go ahead, ask them. Are non-white vaccine residents just as stupid, arrogant and murderous as the whites? We're waiting, Morning Joe, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon. How about you, President Joe? Shouldn't you be as upset at those folks in the city as you are in the sticks? Or does that require consistency. Things the Democrats lack. So why did the media focus only on white right-wingers? Well, it creates endless opportunities for self-righteous drivel from T.V. hosts, I should know. It could be anything. Climate, taxes, law enforcement, gender, race, they turn everything into a far less entertaining version of pro wrestling. They always need a villain. So much like Amtrak. The truth doesn't turn a profit for cable news. Which may be why the media only likes to do the fun racist stuff. Yes, it must be the fans of Larry the Cable Guy who are killing us. These nonvaxxed are the same idiots who voted for Trump speeding around and pickup trucks listening to country music while brushing their remaining teeth with grits and gravy. They probably even like America, God forbid. But now the data says otherwise. So where's the media on this? They're not even bothering to address the black communities. But I guess if he can't divide us, then why bother doing anything helpful? I mean, you could help get the pro vax message to black communities. But I guess it's more fun to cleave a country in too. I wonder what the angry black male has to say."

So, instead of talking about blame or educating the right group, you just keep pretending it's the wrong group? It doesn't make me angry, it makes me sad.

      "utterance": "Speaking of, in New York City Bill de Blasio just introduced a vaccine passport to the city, where Trump got 23 percent of the vote in 2020. So it's not the righties that de Blasio is after. The new passport system calls for showing proof of vax to enter gyms, restaurants and entertainment venues, which judging by the stats I just mentioned, effectively bans most blacks. Just like the damage done to them during the classic Jim Crow days. So who is the Hitler now? If 70 percent of black New Yorkers are unvaccinated, they're the ones getting banned. Talk about white privilege. Imagine if Trump had done this, CNN would be handing out the pitchforks. By the way, it's odd that the left says you can't be expected to present an I.D. to vote, but you must show vaccine proof everywhere else. Why not allow absentee vaccine proof with no signature verification dropped off by people who hate vaccines? I mean, there's a hole in their plan you could drive a bus full of illegal immigrants through. So you can't demand proof of vaccine at the border. But you can do it at a Time Square's Applebee's. Makes sense there, jalapeno poppers are more dangerous than any virus from a Chinese lab. Be close to a bathroom. So, if Chris Cuomo called the 70 percent of black New Yorkers ignorant, what do you think? He's probably too busy creating strategies to defend his brother from grabbing women's breasts. I suppose the vaccinated white liberals must be secretly pleased, more open seats at the bar, more empty tables at their favorite trendy restaurant. And it's nice to have a break from all the murders their policies have led to. But if you judge the Dems the way they judge everyone else, then this would be racist. But we aren't Democrats. Thank God we just want people to do the right thing. Black, white, you name it. I think it's a good thing to get the vaccine if your doctor says you can. I know people who are gung ho about it, and people who are hell know about it. Some of these people I love, but none of them fit into the neat little categories. The media loves to bash. The Press just feels good about making other people feel bad. Conflict is their vaccine against loneliness.

So, instead of Obama's party favors including ventilators, he's changing plans. According to the New York Post the Obamas were planning on having 700 people in attendance but many thought he was setting a bad example, meaning someone leaked it to the press. So, they're shrinking the shindig. So, how will celebrity guests handle missing Obama blow out the candle? The scale back party means the planners will have to make some hard choices."

Alec Baldwin showed up and just immediately just started eating the corn and he wasn't wearing a shirt. So, you know, as you know, he's incredibly hairy. And he just sat there and just chat away it was down in the West Village. As you know, the corn goes in the same way it goes out. He made quite a mess. But you know what, seems to be enjoying himself. There you go. Alec Baldwin at my BBQ picnic. Whatever. Who cares at this point? It is midnight, right? What are you doing up? You're staring at me. All right, set your DVRs every night so you never miss an episode.
