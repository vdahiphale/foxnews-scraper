One thing I've learned watching the media, it's like drinking tequila. You do it on an empty stomach. I watched two minutes of Don Lemon after dinner last night and my wife is still trying to get the smell of vomit out of two throw pillows. But also, it's amazing how fast they bury their own mistakes, which maybe they learned from watching Goodfellas. They report something that's false but before anyone has a chance to expose the lie they've already moved on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And like that hitchhiker I picked up last August, the story is gone without a trace. So thank God, there are people out there who go back and show us the most egregious media mistakes during this particular pandemic. These hacks won't get away with it just because they were wearing masks. I got to credit human events Christina Pushaw, Charles Cook from National Review and the great Ann Coulter for exposing this following media malpractice. So do you remember the story of Rebecca Jones? Like Bernie Sanders', it was everywhere. A rogue whistleblower accusing governor Ron DeSantis of demand -- of demanding that she falsified data.

Now as this is happening, the media of course is embracing Andrew Cuomo, who shoved COVID patients into rest homes that killed thousands. Might as well have been gas chambers. Even as per capita, New York has nearly doubled Florida's COVID-19 fatalities. The only thing higher than New York's COVID death rate are its taxes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But what about this perfect hero? Turns out the lady NPR called the top scientists was about as much of a scientist as Bill Nye. In fact, she had held three non-scientists' jobs all of them had her fired and criminally charged, she'd been busted for trespassing, resisting arrest attempting to steal computer equipment. And in 2018, she was accused of sexual cyber harassment, facing stalking charges stemming from an extramarital affair with her former student. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Her resume is more of a rap sheet. Although it sounds like someone Hunter Biden might be into. So she was no doctor, she never even played one on TV, you get better health advice from the muscle head working at the Vitamin Shoppe? According to human events -- according to human events, \"case files allege Jones stocked and robbed her former student sent explicit photos to his family and employer and trespassed on his property. Sounds exactly like what happened to me when I switched long distance carriers. So maybe that might have tipped the media off. No such luck. Even though all of this seems like an easy fact check. But the media didn't bother because they needed a hero. And when the media seeks a hero, they'll overlook the very worst, like this lewd lollipop. Remember how CNN embraced Michael Avenatti?

That's why he previously banned having enough food, and he fears they'll influence young people which could lead to his overthrow. Although no one with a mullet has overthrown anything aside from a course like display at a 7-Eleven.

It's a good point, one thing I've learned living in Manhattan stay away from damp walls. Others included in the band, dyed hair and piercings. And as for a Kim's family, they actually support the move, saying if we don't, he'll kill us. All right, just off topic, Kash, isn't it weird that we don't even think about North Korea anymore?

But also, it's amazing how fast they bury their own mistakes, which maybe they learned from watching Goodfellas. They report something that's false but before anyone has a chance to expose the lie they've already moved on. And like that hitchhiker I picked up last August, the story is gone without a trace. So thank God, there are people out there who go back and show us the most egregious media mistakes during this particular pandemic. These hacks won't get away with it just because they were wearing masks. I got to credit human events Christina Pushaw, Charles Cook from National Review and the great Ann Coulter for exposing this following media malpractice. So do you remember the story of Rebecca Jones? Like Bernie Sanders', it was everywhere. A rogue whistleblower accusing governor Ron DeSantis of demand -- of demanding that she falsified data.

And when it fell apart, the press ignored it like a burning police station in Minneapolis. To remind you after the Florida Department of Health fire Jones last May, she claimed it was for not helping to falsify or to boost DeSanti's stats falsely. Overnight, she became a star. Forbes awarded her technology Person of the Year. Proof that Forbes has sunk lower than George Stephanopoulos in bare feet. He is shorter than me. She raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, her Twitter followers exploded. It was all about as real as Kat's glasses, but that didn't matter. The media loved her because she fit a role they needed to bash an evil pro Trump Republican who was beating the pandemic despite rejecting full lockdowns in a state teeming with rabid Spring Breakers and people in their late hundreds. Those bath salt huffing, alligator writing hillbillies just couldn't be right. Now as this is happening, the media of course is embracing Andrew Cuomo, who shoved COVID patients into rest homes that killed thousands. Might as well have been gas chambers. Even as per capita, New York has nearly doubled Florida's COVID-19 fatalities. The only thing higher than New York's COVID death rate are its taxes. But what about this perfect hero? Turns out the lady NPR called the top scientists was about as much of a scientist as Bill Nye. In fact, she had held three non-scientists' jobs all of them had her fired and criminally charged, she'd been busted for trespassing, resisting arrest attempting to steal computer equipment. And in 2018, she was accused of sexual cyber harassment, facing stalking charges stemming from an extramarital affair with her former student. Her resume is more of a rap sheet. Although it sounds like someone Hunter Biden might be into. So she was no doctor, she never even played one on TV, you get better health advice from the muscle head working at the Vitamin Shoppe? According to human events -- according to human events, \"case files allege Jones stocked and robbed her former student sent explicit photos to his family and employer and trespassed on his property. Sounds exactly like what happened to me when I switched long distance carriers. So maybe that might have tipped the media off. No such luck. Even though all of this seems like an easy fact check. But the media didn't bother because they needed a hero. And when the media seeks a hero, they'll overlook the very worst, like this lewd lollipop. Remember how CNN embraced Michael Avenatti? Yet his story had more flaws than the diamond cat wears on her ring? Just let that wind simmer. But that didn't stop Bri."

I want you to leave that in. It's led by a group called citizens of greater Idaho who believed the rural counties would be better served in a more conservative state.

They say, Oh, the reason the crime against Asians is up is because Donald Trump said China virus right. So I mean, it is it I mean, that's the -- it's the classic story.

Because I, you know, I've been through a lot of stuff in my life, that's not been fun. Like when my mom died, when, when I was in my mid-20s, super suddenly and young. The only thing that got me through is being able to find humor and laugh about different things. And nothing has a huge healing power like humor does. And nobody needs healing power more than someone who's dealing with something very difficult. So, by having this attitude of you can't joke about that, you're taking away healing power from people who need it most. And comedy as an art, you really don't know if something's funny until you try it. So, like he said, you can't be afraid to swing and miss. This is something that is not just annoying, or oh, people don't go after me on Twitter or this or that. It's really awful.

That's why he previously banned having enough food, and he fears they'll influence young people which could lead to his overthrow. Although no one with a mullet has overthrown anything aside from a course like display at a 7-Eleven. Says the North Korean state newspaper, history teaches us a crucial lesson that a country can collapse like a damp wall regardless of its economic fence powers if we do not hold on to our own lifestyle. It's a good point, one thing I've learned living in Manhattan stay away from damp walls. Others included in the band, dyed hair and piercings. And as for a Kim's family, they actually support the move, saying if we don't, he'll kill us. All right, just off topic, Kash, isn't it weird that we don't even think about North Korea anymore?
