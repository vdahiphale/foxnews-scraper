Thanks for being with me everybody, this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" President Trump has been in office now for just over nine months. And while much of that time has been focused on repeal and replacing ObamaCare, the attention now is on the other big campaign promise, tax reform. With budget plans passed in both the House and Senate, now the path is clear to get a deal done. Earlier I sat down with the President at the White House for an exclusive one-on-one interview. I asked him where tax reform stands today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It is tax reform also but I call it tax cuts. It will be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country. And I think that there's tremendous appetite, there's tremendous spirit for it.

It will be in the form of block grants to the different states, and it will be a wonderful healthcare. It will be a tremendous healthcare, managed properly in smaller doses where you can really do it much more individually. So I think we're going to get that also in a little bit later probably in three or four months from now. But I do believe we will have that long before the election in '18.

And while much of that time has been focused on repeal and replacing ObamaCare, the attention now is on the other big campaign promise, tax reform. With budget plans passed in both the House and Senate, now the path is clear to get a deal done. Earlier I sat down with the President at the White House for an exclusive one-on-one interview.

I think it is going to be -- well, hopefully before the end of the year but maybe much sooner than that. You know, there's great spirit for it, people want to see it and I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also but I call it tax cuts. It will be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country. And I think that there's tremendous appetite, there's tremendous spirit for it. Not only by the people we're dealing with in Congress, but for the people out there that want to see something, $5,000 -- almost, it can be $5,000 average per individual per group.

It will be in the form of block grants to the different states, and it will be a wonderful healthcare. It will be a tremendous healthcare, managed properly in smaller doses where you can really do it much more individually. So I think we're going to get that also in a little bit later probably in three or four months from now. But I do believe we will have that long before the election in '18.

I hear very, very good things, but I know that Lamar Alexander is a fine man, and he is really going to do good for the people. We can do pretty much what we have to do with that. You know, the Secretary has tremendous leeway in the -- under the Obama plans. One of the things that they did because it was so messed up, they had no choice, but to give the Secretary leeway because they knew he would have -- he or she would have to be changing all the time. And we can pretty much do whatever we have to do just the way it is. So this was going to be temporary, prior to repeal and replace. We're going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. And I think we actually have the votes. People are criticizing me for saying that. I think we actually have the votes for that. You know, we were basically one short and I think we're going to have the votes for that also, Maria."

So we'll see what happens. But I do believe we have the votes for healthcare at the appropriate time and I think that we're going to have the votes for taxes. And I will say the fact that healthcare is so difficult, I think makes the taxes easier. The Republicans want to get it done. And it's a tremendous tax cut. I mean, especially for the middle class, and especially for business. We have, you know, we're losing our companies. We have companies leaving. And I have to say since I've been elected, that's really stopped. It's really slowed down. There's a tremendous enthusiasm for business in this country so a lot of things have changed."

It could be substantially less than that depending on what happens when we send the bill back to the House. You know, they'll send it back and people are going to go and you know, make 200 suggestions as opposed to maybe no suggestions, because it's a great bill. It's going to be a great bill. And we're adjusting. We're adjusting so that there's no way that the middle class doesn't greatly benefit. Every once in a while there's a method under which, you know, it could be that some people in the middle class won't benefit as much as we want them to benefit, and we're making certain adjustments, but I think we're going to have it sooner rather than later."

So that would make it a fifth bracket as opposed to an eighth bracket on the other -- on the other side, on the other way. I call it our competition, which is the competition of the past.

If we pick up one point on GDP that's 2.5 trillion dollars, if you think of it, 2.5. It more than pays for everything. And I think we pick up much more than one point.

That position is actually more -- a lot of people say get rid of the Fed, take the Fed out. The Fed is a very important position. It's also important psychologically, if the right person is in there, a lot of good things can happen. I think I'm doing a good job for business in that way. People are coming into country. You saw what's happened with Foxconn going to Wisconsin. You see what's happening with Apple where they are going to --I said to Tim -- I said to Tim Cook. I said Tim, I want some of these big beautiful plants that I see in China, they have to open in this country. You've got to give me some big beautiful plants. It's happening. It's all happening. The auto companies are coming back into our country, coming up to Michigan again. They're going back. We're not going to be taken advantage of. We were taken advantage of by -- I wouldn't say the company so much but by other countries. We were so badly taken advantage of. As you know we're negotiating with NAFTA and they have an election right now and lots of things, but at some point, either NAFTA will be renegotiated so that it's fair to the United States or it will be terminated.

I believe he's got -- he's got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We'll see what happens. Now, with that being said, we're prepared for anything.

And I think that's what you and he were talking about in this interview, that when you look at the tax cuts, which I think are going to happen. You look at the deregulatory policy which has been amazingly effective. You look at the conservative judges he's getting. I mean, he and McConnell have collaborated. They have had twice as many judges approved so far as Obama got in the same length of time and they are conservative and they are on average eight or nine years younger than the Obama judges. So he's shaping the next generation of the judiciary. All these things are happening in a methodical way. Meanwhile, (INAUDIBLE) Sunni country come to Riyadh. He's about to go on a trip to Asia.

What about the staff, Newt? I mean a lot of people say, yes, there's some obstructionism going on, on the left. But he's not sending enough names up to be nominated.

I mean, you know, we still don't have our Ambassador to Spain in the middle of a period where Spain is in a real crisis. We have lots of positions at the Defense Department that still haven't been filled. A lot of stuff going on that just the Senate deserves a lot of people being mad at them. Second, I think the administration found that a lot of the people -- unlike Obama who intended to appoint people who had been college professors or had been activists, they are appointing people who are really wealthy. And if you are really wealthy, the length of time it takes you to go through the ethics stuff, the changes, putting, you know, getting rid of your interest -- this has been much longer than it would have been for an Obama team. And then the last was this guy, you know, he wasn't sure he was going to win on election night, so he didn't come into Washington with a whole team, you know, and he's -- I think by next January, he'll basically caught up with himself."

      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, yes. My guess is in 90, 95 percent in the future they get a tax bill. My worry is they need to get it this year. I tried to get them to get it by Thanksgiving. I'm a little concerned it slid you know, a little bit but they are going to get a tax cut. I love the other day when the President said at the Heritage Foundation, he'd like it to come by a Christmas present. I can live with that. I think the country should be very upset if they try to leave town without having passed it in December."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

And then you add to that, you get us down to a 20 percent rate at a time when if you're a potential entrepreneur, you suddenly have a President who loves entrepreneurs. So the psychology, the excitement, the interest in business, I think is going to keep going up. As you yourself pointed out, and I watched you every morning as you described the markets and what's going on, we already have a lot of good stuff happening, and we have a surprising consumer confidence, surprising investments underway. Give us the tax cuts, and the economy will boom next year. If Republicans become the party of prosperity, jobs, and growth as they did with Reagan, with higher take-home pay, I think they will win the election next Fall and we will have stabilized the system for a long time."

As you know, she had a book too, remember the ladies about presidential wives (INAUDIBLE) teaches 48-year-old American history, and she can't do anything about it. She's very frustrated as an author, but she's very honored to have been chosen by the president. She's a very devout Catholic. So the idea she's going to be with -- trying to interpret Pope Francis to President Trump and President Trump to Pope Francis, I'm going to watch this with enormous interest."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Me too. All right, let me ask you about foreign policy and the rest of the agenda. We know what he's tried to do so far. The healthcare, he's so adamant that he's going to get something done. But then there's Iran. Then there's North Korea. There are serious dangerous issues out there. What does the next year look like for this President?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Look, I think this is the most dangerous period since the Cuban missile crisis because of North Korea. I think the President will continue to increase the pressure on North Korea. And you can see the North Koreans, just sent a letter this week to the Australians complaining because the sanctions are toughening, getting tougher and tougher. I think with Iran, I thought the President was very courageous and did exactly the right thing. He decertified but did not break the arrangement. And he said basically look, the Congress now needs to look at it. The Corker-Cardin bill allows the Congress to have 60 days to look at it. I hope that they're going to do two big things. I hope that they are going to say the Iranians have to allow inspection of military facilities and there's no deadline. They can't haven't a drop-dead moment when they get to have nuclear weapons. I think it was the right direction. We're going to have to do a lot more with Iran. I was delighted when the Treasury Department announced that the Iranian revolutionary guard would now be listed as a terrorist organization. Again, it is a step -- you are watching President Trump gradually adopt a methodical sophisticated tough-minded American policy with people, you know, like Tillerson and Mattis and McMaster and Kelly helping him. And this is a very sophisticated effort to protect America."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "I love in between assassinating people having Putin talk to us about boorishness. I mean, this is a regime which has routinely assassinated people. But, look if Putin could find some magic way to get Kim Jong-un to give up his weapons in return for a nonaggression pact or something, more power to him. I'm not opposed to anybody who tries to help solve that. It's the hardest problem on the planet. We don't know exactly what's going to work. And I think it is very dangerous."

I only will use a fifth bracket if for any reason I feel the middle class is not get as much as I thought they would or as much as they are entitled to. They're entitled to a lot. This is really about the middle class, truly about the middle class and about jobs. And if I feel the middle class is not getting what I want them to get, and that's going to be a lot because I want them to get really a lot, then I'm going to do a fifth bracket which will give them more."

Brad Blakeman, former Deputy Assistant to President George W. Bush, John Hilsenrath is the chief economics correspondent with the Wall Street Journal and it's good to see you both. Your thoughts on this tax plan John Hilsenrath?"

He suggested that they're going to go - - he expects this to happen very fast. A lot of people are saying year end, maybe into next year. He said no, I want -- he wants to move even faster than that and he will be disappointed if it doesn't happen sooner than that. He sounds like a person who is pretty optimistic about the chances of getting this done."

But the president knew exactly what was going on in the vote. We didn't get Rand Paul but the President said we're going to get him for tax cuts. We don't have time. Newt Gingrich has said time and time again, even on your show, we better get it by Thanksgiving. Now I'm willing to slide to the 15th of December. It's got to be this year. And then the question is, is it going to be retroactive to the -- to the beginning of January of 2017? That would really be a jolt to the economy. But we're talking about major 31 years in the making for corporate, personal, repatriation of money from overseas. So this is -- this is bold. But I think the President is going to get the votes."

I think there was a lot of skepticism in the markets, building over the last few months about whether after everything that happened on healthcare about whether they would be able to get something finished on taxes. The market, the way it is behaving is saying yes, they think they're going to."

      "speaker": "HILSENRATH",

We -- he didn't mention Gary Cohn his own economic adviser and he didn't mention Kevin Warsh who was a fed governor who was in for an interview. The three people he did mention were Jay Powell who is a fed governor right now, John Taylor, a Stanford University Professor and Janet Yellen herself to the surprise of many I think a Democrat, he said he liked her very much. It sounds like those are three people that he's narrowed his list down to. That's big news for the market. That decision is going to matter a heck of a lot."

Jay Powell has been on board with Janet Yellen with very low-interest rates but he -- but he has a more deregulatory mindset.

He's the most transactional President we have had in modern history. He wants a deal. And if a deal is to be had, people are acting in good faith, he will make the deal. And then he'll rationalize it out later in his public speaking and the using of public pulpit. The bottom line is we need generational tax reform. Democrats want it, Republicans want it. It's how we get there."
