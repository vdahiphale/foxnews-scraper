But only because of what I've done with the FDA and other things can we come up with numbers like that. We're lucky that we don't have to, because that was considered fast. If this were an administration from the past, and I think I can say far beyond Obama, it was other administrations also. You wouldn't have a vaccine for 2-1/2, three years, and we're going to have a vaccine within, at most, a couple of months. OK?",

I want to see people get money, I want to see -- it wasn't their fault that this happened, it was China's fault. You know? People say, well, maybe you shouldn't say that, that's not nice. It was China's fault. So, I'd like to see the larger number, yes. I would like to see it. There's some things that I disagree with, but I'm sure they can be negotiating. Now, I heard Nancy Pelosi said she doesn't want to leave until we have an agreement. She's come a long way, that's great. If she said that, she's come a long way. I agree with her, we should have an agreement, people should be helped, and they should be helped as rapidly as possible. And I think it's going to happen; I think it's very important. So, the Problem Solvers came up with, it's a group of people in Congress as you know, you know them all, I know them all, they're very good people, I guess you'd consider them dead center. But in many cases, they're not, they're left, they're right, but they came up with this idea and I think they're well on their way to suggesting some pretty good things.

And I believe that if you ask him, he would probably say that he didn't understand the question because I said to him, I asked him those two questions, the one question which we covered, and the mask question. And I was inaccurately covered because I was on with George last night, George Stephanopoulos, and I enjoyed it, I think people enjoyed it, I got -- you know, a lot of people said very good things about the show. I hope they did well, but they said a lot of good things about the show. But they always cut my sentences off, you know they cut it off on masks and masks have problems too. When I talked about the masks have to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that in restaurants that people with masks and they're playing around with their mask and they haven't -- their fingers are in their mask and then they're serving with plates. I mean, I think there's a lot of problems with masks. Now, vaccine is much more effective than the masks. And if we get the vaccine, we have added to the fact that our numbers are going way down. You know, you see the numbers, I'm just reading your statistics that are from wherever they get them, but they're very highly qualified statistics. But no, the mask is not as important as the vaccine. The mask perhaps helps. Don't forget, a lot of people didn't like the concept of masks, initially. Dr. Fauci didn't like them and a lot of people didn't. And I'm not knocking anybody because I understand both sides of the argument, but when I called up Robert today, I said to him, what's with the mask? He said, I think I answered that question incorrectly. I think maybe he had misunderstood it. I mean, you know, he had two questions. Maybe he misunderstood both of them. But the answer to the one, is it's going to be a much faster distribution than he said. Maybe he's not aware of the distribution process. It's not really his thing as much as it would be, let's say, mine. But the distribution is going to be much faster. As far as the mask is concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks. Because people have used the masks, but when I looked at that chart that we put up, if you look, you know, we were right, if you do the good job, they had I guess 240,000. But if you do the good -- if it worked out well. Now, look, one death is too much. One death is too much, should have never happened. But the lower level was at that 240,000, between a hundred and something and 240,000. As far as the mask is concerned, he made a mistake.",

And that statistic came in, and it's because the African-American community, the Black community, has had the lowest, the best employment numbers that we've ever had, both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it. But we've had the best employment numbers we've ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We've never been close to that number, but we were just six months ago. And yes, the -- I'm very proud of the numbers.

But just to reiterate what I said, there are 51,000 outlets for distribution, for vaccination. And there's over 14,000 federally qualified health centers that are particularly targeted to minority and low-income areas. So, that's a focus. I want to point out two other things. We're also prioritizing testing historically black colleges and universities. And we're in the process of getting that finalized because we know that there's high -- you know, higher morbidity within certain ethnic groups. And the last thing I would say is, it's particularly heinous and egregious abuse of the media to instill fear into people about taking a vaccine because there was no shortcut here. Everything is safe, everything is effective. And for people who have particularly an influence on minority communities to instill fear and doubt, is a particularly -- you know, outrageous abuse of public policy and of leadership. These are people that have higher risks. And so, I implore everyone who's in a high-risk category that when we get a safe, effective vaccine, they should take the vaccine.",

Once they heard that, the Democrats started, just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with the vaccine. It was totally made up. It's all disinformation, just like they put an ad in about football, just like they put with respect to me. I'm the one that got football back, and I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous, that Big Ten. And now, hopefully, PAC-10 goes back. And I say that just like even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made up stories. It was a made-up story by a third rate magazine, where the head guy I guess, the head person, I have no idea who he is, I don't know him, but he's friends with Obama and Clinton, so they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too. This story is very simple. They started knocking the vaccine, as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now it may or may not, but it'll be within a matter of weeks. It'll be within a matter of weeks from November. It's ready to go, and it's ready to for massive distribution to everybody, with a focus again on seniors. And I will say also, the historically black colleges and universities we are doing at my suggestion, because they have had a difficult problem there. We are doing more testing there and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there. But when you look at what we've done on testing in terms of the technology and the amount, it's been really amazing. In fact, I think we're going to crack a hundred million tests very soon in the very near future. We're going to be cracking a hundred million tests. Now, what that does do is it shows up more cases. So if we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don't test, they don't have cases. And then they say, oh, the United States. Well, but we're proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people. But we're doing tremendous testing at the historically black colleges and universities.

I say, how many do you need? 1,000 ventilators. I said we'll be able to take care of it. We're making thousands of ventilators, very complex, very expensive, very difficult thing to make.

In that statement he put out there, he didn't say he didn't hear the question correctly nor did he renounce his answer. He just reiterated the points he made during the panel there. I think the more the president sows confusion around what we should be doing, it makes it harder for me like me who in many ways are rooting for him, his administration, his team, and our amazing health private sector to find a vaccine. Those who have doubts about whether there's efficacy challenges or safety challenges or concerns only have those doubts raised when they hear this kind of back and forth between the CDC chief and the president. Perhaps the most encouraging thing I've heard today is what just happened on your show. It's not your question, but to watch the Problem Solvers Caucus, you would wish that every member of Congress is a member of that caucus. But to say that they might be close to finding a bipartisan proposal that might be acceptable to both parties and both sides of the legislative branch, that may be the most encouraging thing I've heard today.",

I want to see people get money, I want to see -- it wasn't their fault that this happened, it was China's fault. You know? People say, well, maybe you shouldn't say that, that's not nice. It was China's fault. So, I'd like to see the larger number, yes. I would like to see it. There's some things that I disagree with, but I'm sure they can be negotiating. Now, I heard Nancy Pelosi said she doesn't want to leave until we have an agreement. She's come a long way, that's great. If she said that, she's come a long way. I agree with her, we should have an agreement, people should be helped, and they should be helped as rapidly as possible. And I think it's going to happen; I think it's very important. So, the Problem Solvers came up with, it's a group of people in Congress as you know, you know them all, I know them all, they're very good people, I guess you'd consider them dead center. But in many cases, they're not, they're left, they're right, but they came up with this idea and I think they're well on their way to suggesting some pretty good things.

      "utterance": "OK. Number one, it's not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine. And I called him about that, those were the two things that I discussed with him. And I believe that if you ask him, he would probably say that he didn't understand the question because I said to him, I asked him those two questions, the one question which we covered, and the mask question. And I was inaccurately covered because I was on with George last night, George Stephanopoulos, and I enjoyed it, I think people enjoyed it, I got -- you know, a lot of people said very good things about the show. I hope they did well, but they said a lot of good things about the show. But they always cut my sentences off, you know they cut it off on masks and masks have problems too. When I talked about the masks have to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that in restaurants that people with masks and they're playing around with their mask and they haven't -- their fingers are in their mask and then they're serving with plates. I mean, I think there's a lot of problems with masks. Now, vaccine is much more effective than the masks. And if we get the vaccine, we have added to the fact that our numbers are going way down. You know, you see the numbers, I'm just reading your statistics that are from wherever they get them, but they're very highly qualified statistics. But no, the mask is not as important as the vaccine. The mask perhaps helps. Don't forget, a lot of people didn't like the concept of masks, initially. Dr. Fauci didn't like them and a lot of people didn't. And I'm not knocking anybody because I understand both sides of the argument, but when I called up Robert today, I said to him, what's with the mask? He said, I think I answered that question incorrectly. I think maybe he had misunderstood it. I mean, you know, he had two questions. Maybe he misunderstood both of them. But the answer to the one, is it's going to be a much faster distribution than he said. Maybe he's not aware of the distribution process. It's not really his thing as much as it would be, let's say, mine. But the distribution is going to be much faster. As far as the mask is concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks. Because people have used the masks, but when I looked at that chart that we put up, if you look, you know, we were right, if you do the good job, they had I guess 240,000. But if you do the good -- if it worked out well. Now, look, one death is too much. One death is too much, should have never happened. But the lower level was at that 240,000, between a hundred and something and 240,000. As far as the mask is concerned, he made a mistake."

      "utterance": "Well, I'm tested, and I'm sometimes surprised when I see somebody sitting and like with Joe, Joe feels very safe in a mask. I don't know, maybe he doesn't want to expose his face. I don't know what's going on. He'll be way away from people, nowhere near people. There'll be nobody with him. He doesn't draw any crowds. So have circles, his big circles, they'll be way far away. There's no reason for him to have masks on. We get tested. I'm tested. I have people tested. When people come into the Oval Office, it's like a big deal. No matter who they are, the heads of countries, they all get tested. So, I'm in sort of a different position. And maybe if I wasn't in that position, I'd be wearing it more. But I've worn masks.

Specifically, we noticed at just the news that the poverty rate for African-Americans hit historic lows, that the household wealth increased historically for African-Americans. What was driving that increase in wealth for African-Americans? And now at 2020 with the coronavirus and unemployment spiking, what would be your plan for the second term to improve lives for African-Americans?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",

And yes, we've had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our nation, but in particular for African-Americans. And that statistic came in, and it's because the African-American community, the Black community, has had the lowest, the best employment numbers that we've ever had, both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it. But we've had the best employment numbers we've ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We've never been close to that number, but we were just six months ago. And yes, the -- I'm very proud of the numbers. African-Americans, Hispanic- Americans, they had the best numbers they've ever had by far, both employment and unemployment, depending on definition. Thank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that?"

      "speaker": "SCOTT ATLAS, ADVISOR ON THE WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, what I -- to clarify, said that the first prioritization is the high-risk people and frontline healthcare workers. But just to reiterate what I said, there are 51,000 outlets for distribution, for vaccination. And there's over 14,000 federally qualified health centers that are particularly targeted to minority and low-income areas. So, that's a focus. I want to point out two other things. We're also prioritizing testing historically black colleges and universities. And we're in the process of getting that finalized because we know that there's high -- you know, higher morbidity within certain ethnic groups. And the last thing I would say is, it's particularly heinous and egregious abuse of the media to instill fear into people about taking a vaccine because there was no shortcut here. Everything is safe, everything is effective. And for people who have particularly an influence on minority communities to instill fear and doubt, is a particularly -- you know, outrageous abuse of public policy and of leadership. These are people that have higher risks. And so, I implore everyone who's in a high-risk category that when we get a safe, effective vaccine, they should take the vaccine."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely, November 3rd. Once they heard that, the Democrats started, just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with the vaccine. It was totally made up. It's all disinformation, just like they put an ad in about football, just like they put with respect to me. I'm the one that got football back, and I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous, that Big Ten. And now, hopefully, PAC-10 goes back. And I say that just like even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made up stories. It was a made-up story by a third rate magazine, where the head guy I guess, the head person, I have no idea who he is, I don't know him, but he's friends with Obama and Clinton, so they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too. This story is very simple. They started knocking the vaccine, as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now it may or may not, but it'll be within a matter of weeks. It'll be within a matter of weeks from November. It's ready to go, and it's ready to for massive distribution to everybody, with a focus again on seniors. And I will say also, the historically black colleges and universities we are doing at my suggestion, because they have had a difficult problem there. We are doing more testing there and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there. But when you look at what we've done on testing in terms of the technology and the amount, it's been really amazing. In fact, I think we're going to crack a hundred million tests very soon in the very near future. We're going to be cracking a hundred million tests. Now, what that does do is it shows up more cases. So if we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don't test, they don't have cases. And then they say, oh, the United States. Well, but we're proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people. But we're doing tremendous testing at the historically black colleges and universities. And that was a suggestion I made, and I think it's a good -- I think it's a good suggestion. Yes, please, go ahead."

Because of all of the incredible work we've done for governors who are on every call saying, this is incredible. This is great. This is great. Sometimes they're not quite as friendly at a news conference when you have people covering it. But we have done a phenomenal job on COVID-19, as they like to call it, I call it other things. But we have done a phenomenal job. I get calls from other people in other countries, they can't believe the job we've done. And then they'll say, is there any way that you could get us ventilators? I say, how many do you need? 1,000 ventilators. I said we'll be able to take care of it. We're making thousands of ventilators, very complex, very expensive, very difficult thing to make. We're making thousands a month. The cupboard was bare when I got here, and I will tell you, our distribution is going to be very rapid, and very -- it's going to be all- encompassing. We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems, senior citizens, etcetera, but it's a very powerful -- it's going to be a very powerful distribution. It's going to cover everybody, and it's going to cover them rapidly. I don't know whether or not the doctor knows that, how much he covers, but I called him. Because I said, why did you say that long? He wasn't that aware of it. And the other one was the mask. The vaccine is going to have tremendous power. It's going to be extremely strong. It's going to be extremely successful. We're not going to have a problem. And the mask may help, and I hope it helps, and I think it probably does. But again, the mask is a mixed bag. There are some people, professionals, Scott, you would know a lot of them, but there are some people that don't like the mask because of the touchiness and the touching, and then you're touching everything else.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. TOM REED, (R-NY) PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. That's what brought people together on this issue, Republicans and Democrats. And this has been a sticking point, state and local. But it is clear that state and local governments have been impacted by the COVID-19 situation. And if you have the revenue loss Based on documented actual revenue loss, not projected, not multiyear projections, but actual revenue loss, you can find bipartisan agreement. And then the other component of state and local expenses that brought people together in our conversations, Democrat and Republicans, was actual expenses. It was more like a FEMA situation, more like a natural disaster where you had past and future COVID-19 related actual expenses, where you had receipts and you turned those into the federal government. Then we stand with our local community, we stand with our states communities to say we can reimburse those expenses. That type of good governance, these are American taxpayer dollars that we need to be accountable to. That type of common sense type of approach brought people together on this issue."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Common sense usually goes out the window weeks before an election. It just happens, because both sides want to stay ground and make the other side look bad. Congressman Gottheimer, can you assure the American public that something is going to get done before November 3rd?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTHEIMER",
      "utterance": "I feel that we are now, we're really following now, and the negotiation are going to, I'm really confident, get going again. I think what everyone is hearing back home, which I think is affecting what's happening here, is that folks need help. And our small businesses need help, our schools need help, we need more testing. So all these pieces are coming together. It's, again, not going to be everything everybody wants, but the bottom line is it's going to really help. We have got to get through the inauguration here, and that's the key where you saw Democrats and Republicans came together. And I'm optimistic, because we have to get something done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Congressman Reed, there was some suggestion on the Democratic side that they might get a better deal after the election. President Trump is saying he would call people to the Oval Office if a deal is imminent. Do you think one can get done before Election Day?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REED",
      "utterance": "It needs to get done. Why would you put the people through that, because you want to wait for an election result? This has been four months of gridlock. You should not put the American people in the middle of this political race. That is why the Problem Solvers Caucus is filled with members that want to put country first, the American people first. And I tell you, the silent majority of America believes the way we do. Stop playing politics with American lives. We're in a crisis, we're in a pandemic, we're in an emergency. It's time to lead. Kudos to the Problem Solvers Caucus members like Dean Phillips, like Abigail Spanberger, like Dusty Johnson and Anthony Gonzalez that led this charge out of the Problem Solvers Caucus with Josh and I to say enough is enough. It's time to put the American people first."

If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public, I think we are probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter 2021."

      "utterance": "Joe Biden today, the CDC director up on Capitol Hill, and the president, you heard him here at that White House press briefing just a short time ago, obviously a disparity there. Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner, former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., who is currently the chairman of RX Saver, and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co- founder and president. Tom, I think it might have been an interesting phone call from the president to the CDC director about his testimony up on Capitol Hill. What do you make of that and where the political fallout is on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's never good to not be on the same page as the boss. And so I think he probably got a talking to. Trump tried to clean that up and straighten it out. I don't think it's a big deal overall. But I think Trump definitely wants everybody in the administration to be singing from the same sheet of music, especially on the distribution plan, that when this vaccine comes, and whether it comes before the election or after the election, that it is going to be distributed rapidly across the country, prioritized, but also out to the general public as fast as humanly possible. And so I am not sure there is going to be much political fallout from this. But, again, we are talking can the coronavirus. That's an issue that has been a bit of a sticking point for Donald Trump vis-a-vis the way the public feels he's been handling this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "OK, and just 10 minutes ago we heard from the CDC director on Twitter. And he says \"The best defense we currently have against the virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing, and being careful about crowds. I 100 percent believe in the importance of vaccines and the importance of in particularly of a COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life.\" Thoughts, Harold?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "So thanks for having me. I think a couple things. When it comes to medicine and science, I'm probably like most Americans going to listen to the CDC chief. In that statement he put out there, he didn't say he didn't hear the question correctly nor did he renounce his answer. He just reiterated the points he made during the panel there. I think the more the president sows confusion around what we should be doing, it makes it harder for me like me who in many ways are rooting for him, his administration, his team, and our amazing health private sector to find a vaccine. Those who have doubts about whether there's efficacy challenges or safety challenges or concerns only have those doubts raised when they hear this kind of back and forth between the CDC chief and the president. Perhaps the most encouraging thing I've heard today is what just happened on your show. It's not your question, but to watch the Problem Solvers Caucus, you would wish that every member of Congress is a member of that caucus. But to say that they might be close to finding a bipartisan proposal that might be acceptable to both parties and both sides of the legislative branch, that may be the most encouraging thing I've heard today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right, Byron? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  Well, look, the president and his top officials should be on the same page about this. And the first thing they should saying is this is really fast. Go back to April and people were talking about a year-and-a-half for a vaccine. We are talking late 2021. Now they are talking about having it in a month or two, only in very limited supplies, and only for frontline medical workers. That is still particularly good. It doesn't do the president any good to be overpromising in this case. It's much better to be realistic about it, and if it comes faster thought, it's must faster than was predicted earlier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Tom, to Harold's point, we just had that interview, the Problem Solvers Caucus. That bill was literally poo-pooed by Nancy Pelosi, said that's not going to work for her. But the White House and Mark Meadows saying maybe there is a chance we can get something around here. Do you think this is going to get across the finish line?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Before the election, I'm a cynic when it comes to this stuff. I doubt it because I don't know the Democrats -- they are very reticent to give the president a win on this. But I think it's a good proposal. And by the way, you can trace it all the way back to the Democrats here in the state of Illinois who initially back in April asked for $41 billion including $10 billion to bail out our unfunded pension liabilities, which sent Republicans into a panic about the government bailing out all these cities and states around the country that have been horribly mismanaged above and beyond the pandemic."

One week ago, Gavin ran to the scene of an accident, pulled four people from that blaze, and authorities decided to recognize him for it today. Good job. And wearing his Marine hat with the American flag, Sam Jones waved to family and friends celebrating his 100th birthday. First responders, fellow Marines, and others honored the World War II veteran with a touching tribute in Carmel, Indiana. Mr. Jones, thank you for your service to the country. And thank you for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. \"The Story\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.
