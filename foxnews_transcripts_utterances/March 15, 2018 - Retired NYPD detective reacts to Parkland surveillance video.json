Police and fire officials about to step in front of the microphone to give us an update at hospital. And then, in Washington, we expect, perhaps, dueling news conferences on this this evening in response to the tragedy where a brand-new pedestrian walkway at Florida International University of Miami came crashing down onto a busy street below earlier today. This is a look at the frantic search for survivors trapped still underneath the bridge this evening. Rescuers using everything from dogs to heavy equipment and cranes to try to make contact with people who may be trapped underneath. 950 tons of bridge that literally, they cut the ribbon on days ago. We are hearing that there are several people who have perished in this tragedy this afternoon. We're about to get more information as I said, at least two others in critical condition. We're going to get details from the hospital as I said, but let's go live on the ground there to Phil Keating who has been watching this all afternoon.

This pedestrian bridge repeated to be a state-of-the-art design that was actually just rotated 90 degrees on Saturday from a set of the road where it was constructed behind me, and then it was placed on the north and southbound support towers spanning eight lanes of traffic on a very busy main artery here and southwest Miami-Dade. It was still a construction project, still not open to the public, it was supposed to open this upcoming December, but today an absolute catastrophe.

But a total of ten people are being treated at the nearby Kendall Regional Hospital, two of them in critical condition, no word yet officially on the number of fatalities. There was actually even one pedestrian who was crossing this busy street when the bridge came suddenly crashing down onto him and he is injured very seriously speaking, but it does appear that he is going to survive.

So, it was an active construction site, this bridge, even though it had been assembled and built over the past several months alongside this busy roadway. And then on Saturday, in a -- really, a feat of engineering, it was hoisted up, twisted around, rotated 90 degrees and then placed onto the south and north support towers. According to one engineering professor at the University of California reacting to this, he described this move as somewhat risky, having this bridge span eight lanes of very busy roadway before the center support tower was even built. So, all of these questions will be certainly coming out here in the next days, but the search and rescue operation, looking for survivors, as you can tell, it's sunset happening behind me, it is going to go all through the night, and definitely into the early morning hours, if not longer on Friday.

I listened to the recordings from the police transmissions. The first transmission -- from the first transmission didn't come on until about nine minutes, it took nine minutes for the Broward County sheriff's officers to enter that building. That's a problem. I'm saying to myself, 'I can't see that many coward police officers showing up at the same time.' I've been in cap for 25 years, I might have seen two cowards my entire life. All right. For officers not directly going that building and wait a whole nine minutes, there's something wrong, there's something the sheriff is not telling.",

Two of them are in critical condition. According to police officers from Sweetwater who were within two or three blocks when suddenly the loud explosion of a million pounds of concrete crashed down on the southwest 8th street. They rushed over to the scene, they found, at least, four, maybe six, construction workers who were lying on the rubble dazed, cut, bleeding. One wasn't breathing. They had to use chest compressions for him. There was also another guy we talked to who said his childhood friend was simply crossing the street as a pedestrian when this happened. And, of course, all lanes of traffic have been open since they installed this bridge on Saturday. It was still under construction, not yet complete, not open to pedestrians. That was supposed to happen later this year in December, but it was built by FIGG Engineering, which has a 40-year history, according to the company of something like this never ever happened before. They say they are stunned that this bridge-span collapse. It spans from the south, FIU campus, to the north, the town of Sweetwater. And by all the reports, the center support tower was still to be constructed. So, exactly, what was the integral design of this bridge, whether there were very long, 170-foot very strong steel beams that were providing support from south tower to north tower or whether it was a hundred percent pure concrete, which is more unlikely, but it was supposed to be a state-of-the-art design as a pedestrian bridge. It was supposed to be iconic as is the Skyway Bridge south of Tampa Saint Pete. And then, today, absolute catastrophe, and you have a serious design, integrity, and engineering feat being now investigated as to what exactly caused this bridge to collapse. Fortunately, Florida International University on spring break this week, there could have been and there would have been many, many more people, students walking to and fro to campus and off campus at the time of day when this happened, which is right before 2:00 PM Eastern Time, Martha.",

Police and fire officials about to step in front of the microphone to give us an update at hospital. And then, in Washington, we expect, perhaps, dueling news conferences on this this evening in response to the tragedy where a brand-new pedestrian walkway at Florida International University of Miami came crashing down onto a busy street below earlier today. This is a look at the frantic search for survivors trapped still underneath the bridge this evening. Rescuers using everything from dogs to heavy equipment and cranes to try to make contact with people who may be trapped underneath. 950 tons of bridge that literally, they cut the ribbon on days ago. We are hearing that there are several people who have perished in this tragedy this afternoon. We're about to get more information as I said, at least two others in critical condition. We're going to get details from the hospital as I said, but let's go live on the ground there to Phil Keating who has been watching this all afternoon. Good evening, Phil."

This pedestrian bridge repeated to be a state-of-the-art design that was actually just rotated 90 degrees on Saturday from a set of the road where it was constructed behind me, and then it was placed on the north and southbound support towers spanning eight lanes of traffic on a very busy main artery here and southwest Miami-Dade. It was still a construction project, still not open to the public, it was supposed to open this upcoming December, but today an absolute catastrophe. Clearly some sort of engineering or structural design problem. Everything is still under investigation -- no cause or suspected cause yet being revealed by investigators. Everyone, really, still scrambling here now five hours since this all happened. It happened just before 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time. When the bridge came down suddenly, it came down on eight cars crushing them either fully or partially. It's unclear how many total people would've been in those cars -- drivers and passengers. But a total of ten people are being treated at the nearby Kendall Regional Hospital, two of them in critical condition, no word yet officially on the number of fatalities. There was actually even one pedestrian who was crossing this busy street when the bridge came suddenly crashing down onto him and he is injured very seriously speaking, but it does appear that he is going to survive. Joining me now is the Sweetwater Police Sergeant, Jenna Mendez, one of the first people on the scene. Did you actually see the bridge fall down and the smoke cloud rise or did you pull up right after that and what did you see?"

So, I jumped out of my vehicle and I ran, and actually jumped on top of the bridge where we had four workers who were severely injured and one not breathing; we started CPR on him. We had another one who has a major laceration to his head who was completely unconscious as well, and I just actually started yelling for people to go find me doctors, so I can have some assistance. I actually got a doctor who started assisting with the pulse and CPR as well, and we got backwards, we got the two most injured on the backwards and got them down as quickly as possible to get them to rescue so they could assist."

The other part of the bridge, as you can see off in the distance behind us, is angled straddling the roadway 3-45-degree angle -- that's still a precarious piece of bridge.

Phil Keating, let's go back to you on the ground. A lot of information from that sheriff who you just spoke to who happened to be on the scene there. Do we know -- were there any construction workers, there was absolutely no one on the top of the bridge, Phil?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEATING",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right, Martha. There were at least four, maybe six construction workers on the bridge itself when it suddenly collapsed. Still unclear as to whether they're on top of the roof or whether they're on the walkway portion and somehow ended up on top of all of the rubble in a state of daze and severely wounded and believing state when the first responders did arrive. So, it was an active construction site, this bridge, even though it had been assembled and built over the past several months alongside this busy roadway. And then on Saturday, in a -- really, a feat of engineering, it was hoisted up, twisted around, rotated 90 degrees and then placed onto the south and north support towers. According to one engineering professor at the University of California reacting to this, he described this move as somewhat risky, having this bridge span eight lanes of very busy roadway before the center support tower was even built. So, all of these questions will be certainly coming out here in the next days, but the search and rescue operation, looking for survivors, as you can tell, it's sunset happening behind me, it is going to go all through the night, and definitely into the early morning hours, if not longer on Friday. Martha."

By all of the video we have of its installation on Saturday, there is not a support tower in the middle, so the entire span of the bridge, 174 feet long, made out of concrete and steel and rhubarb basically spanned all the way across the road, supported on the south side by a support tower, and the north side by a support tower, but not supported right in the middle. Back to you, Martha."

The NTSB is an independent federal agency, we're charged by congress to investigate transportation accidents to determine the probable cause and issue safety recommendations to prevent those actions from occurring again. In addition to our headquarters support staff, we're launching a multi-disciplinary investigative team of 15 specialists in a number of areas, including civil engineering, materials science, and survival factors. In addition, we are sending our specialists from the NTSB's Office of Transportation Disaster Assistance and they will be on hand to assist the families of those who've been affected by this tragedy. We should be arriving in Miami around 10:30 this evening and then we will proceed straight to the site to begin meeting with the first responders and getting a basic lay of the land. We will begin in earnest our investigation first thing tomorrow morning. For the factual information that we will release, you can follow us at Twitter, our Twitter handle is @NTSB_Newsroom or you can follow us at NTSB -- www.NTSB.gov. Since we've not even gotten on scene yet, we don't really have any factual information to report at this time, but I can speak about our processes. So, if you have questions about our processes, I'd be glad to try and answer those.

It is -- obviously, there are fatalities involved in this. We're going to at 7:30, we'll get an update breaking from the hospital there and we're going to take you there to that live when that gets underway. So, we're monitoring that breaking news throughout the evening. But also breaking this evening, newly released video from the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School sheds new light, but it also raises a lot of new questions about the armed guard who was supposed to run into the building at the sound of gunfire, but clearly in this video is standing outside for painful minutes while children are inside being killed. And what about sheriff Israel who declined to answer our invitation to speak tonight about what this video tells him, about when he first knew about this video, all of those things need to be answered. We want to know how all of that lines up with Sheriff Israel's public statements about what he knew at the time. In moments we will hear from Andrew Pollack, who tragically lost his daughter, Meadow, on that day. He has seen the video, he'll will speak with us in just a moment.

Well, now we have both dispatch audio and surveillance video and it's easy to connect the dots because the audio and video are both time stamped. So, at 2:22 on February 14th, less than a minute after police say Nikolas Cruz entered the school and began shooting, video shows a golf cart carrying Deputy Scott Peterson and Security Specialist Calvin Greenleaf. You see the golf cart drive by the 700 building which is right next to the 1200 building where the shooting happened. And that's when Deputy Peterson makes this a radio call. Listen."

At that time, the video shows a golf cart stopping and you see the security specialist appeared to run into the hallway between buildings 700 and 1200. But Scott Peterson doesn't go toward the 1200 building where he said that shots were fired, instead he stands against a wall outside of building 700 with a direct view of building 1200.

By that time, Nikolas Cruz was down at a Walmart. The Broward County Sheriff's office says, the video which was released by a Broward circuit judge speaks for itself. Scott Peterson, if you don't know, is a 54-year-old twice divorced father of four who's been in law enforcement for 33 years. In 2014, he was named 'School Resource Officer the Year.'

      "utterance": "I must've watched that video about 15 times today. And you know, initially when you see him coming up in the club car, children are running out of the building. Now, he probably didn't know where the shots were being fired exactly at that, but I would go to those children and find out where the shots are being fired and where the shooter was. I didn't see him do that. Second of all, the man didn't even have his gun in his hand. I did not see a weapon in his hand at all. So, he goes and he takes the position and (INAUDIBLE) that shots going inside that building. Now, let me tell you something, no matter what protocols may have or may have been -- we had protocols all the time, we never follow them. When shots are being fired, especially at a school, and especially after what happened at Columbine, then the active shooter protocol are changed for every single police department is that you are to engage that shooter instantly the minute you hear those shots being fired. Now, I can see him getting on the radio and saying, listen, there are shots fired inside the building, we have a shooter there, I'm going in. I listened to the recordings from the police transmissions. The first transmission -- from the first transmission didn't come on until about nine minutes, it took nine minutes for the Broward County sheriff's officers to enter that building. That's a problem. I'm saying to myself, 'I can't see that many coward police officers showing up at the same time.' I've been in cap for 25 years, I might have seen two cowards my entire life. All right. For officers not directly going that building and wait a whole nine minutes, there's something wrong, there's something the sheriff is not telling."

So, you see somebody -- you see the guy that was with runs into the building, but I believe if he was standing here, this is where the building was where the shooting was occurring, right? So, he could take a position over there and ran into the building and just go over the radio: I'm going in, send everybody. At the same time, when he's in that corner, you see other police officers come and take a position and not go into the building. They probably didn't even know exactly where the hell the shooting was going on. Now, I know --"

I just heard what was going on, and not only is he an embarrassment to every police officer that puts a uniform on, he's a coward and he's also a liar -- he lied in the investigation. So, not only is he a coward, he's also a liar. He knew when that guy brought him in the golf cart, he brought him right to the building. And then, he said, he didn't know where the shots are coming from there, so he lied right there. The guy drove him to the building in a cart. And then he lied in the investigation also said he never heard shots. So, he's also a liar. And to go past that, he was there at the third minute, OK. My daughter was killed on the third floor, so he had ample enough time to save everybody on the third floor -- this guy -- and he didn't do it because the shooting took -- it was like seven minutes. So, he stayed there, so my daughters on the third floor, she got shot four times, she struggles to a door. This guy is downstairs, the guy 18, 19, 58 goes down the hallway shooting injured kids on the floor. He shoots my daughter another five times, Martha, while that coward is waiting, that embarrassment of an officer. So, this just shows you, Martha, that we can't rely, we have to take more measures, we can't just rely on one SRO officer to protect our kids."

And you know, you think about Aaron Feiss who was a coach at the school, who ran right towards all of this, and was so such a hero in that situation. You know, I know you're working on legislation in Florida which is moving in a fairly strong direction.

One of the things that I'm going to tell everybody in Broward that the code red as a failed system and every school in Broward. Anyone that knows anything about firearms knows that when you shoot a firearm, the smoke is going to come out of the firearm. It expels a -- it exhausts smoke, so when that happens, it sets the smoke detectors off. So, think about that. The guy shoots a few shots, shoots -- it sets the fire alarm off and then you got someone in the office calling a code red. So, it's just -- that's even, that's a failed system, Martha, because none of the teachers could hear over the Intercom when the fire alarms going off and if someone knew that about anything about security, they would know that that would never work, so that's another thing of incompetence that I figured out the last few days."

But first, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe who leaked classified intelligence to the media, according to the inspector general's report, or at least at what we've learned from it so far, is trying to save face before he retires.

This is a very unusual stuff to take to try to preserve his government pension. We're told the most likely scenario is that the pension will be reduced, but it will not be taken away entirely because that's a very high legal threshold to cross. Based on our reporting, what the inspector general found is that McCabe either misled or lied to inspector general investigators about his role in October 2016 media report about the FBI's investigation at the time, into the Clinton Foundation. We also understand the inspector general has looked at other issues associated with McCabe, including obstruction in the Clinton e-mail case.

The key thing here is that you're really in essence talking about the same actors that the inspector general was investigating under the Clinton email probe.

The appointment of special counsel or they wanted to have a U.S. attorney partner with the current inspector general at the Justice Department to look at the Russia-related issue. The other thing you probably caught in Bret's interview was a big headline because in the documents released by the senators today, there's the actual language from the FISA application warrant by the FBI. And for the first time, you can see what is the central issue in a criminal referral for that British spy, that he told the FBI he had not been talking to anyone else beyond Fusion GPS and the FBI, when, in fact, he had been talking to the media? So, the bottom line is you have a special player and all of this that sort of kick started it in many respects, lying or apparently lying to the FBI or the FBI misleading the FISA court about that information.

This is a very serious allegation. But the real strange thing about all of this is that McCabe, so far, has been worried more about pension than prison. That's not the choice that was given to Michael Flynn. Michael Flynn, if you recall, was charged with false statements, even though Comey's investigators reportedly believe that Flynn didn't intend to mislead them. That's not apparently the conclusion of the inspector general with regard to McCabe."

And I think that the, sort of final chapter of the Michael Flynn story, perhaps, is not written yet. And when you go back and you take a look at what Andrew McCabe did, misleading the investigators according to these reports about leaking to the media, and also about this laptop that his office had uncovered, which belonged to Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's very close associate, and her then husband, Anthony Weiner, and that he waited three weeks during the heat of the election to sort of pass that information up the chain of command, right?"

They get this laptop, which is really a seismic event, and it just seems to get lost for three weeks. I mean, it's like the entire bureau was contemplating its collective navel for three weeks. And it's very, very odd. And part of the interesting contrast as well is that Michael Flynn was accused of misleading investigators, something that wasn't illegal, not even unprecedented. The meeting with Russian didn't violate a law, not unconstitutionally enforced law. What McCabe did was a violation."

McCabe is one of those people that maybe more equal than others."

You know, Comey, in the past, denied that he has made leaks. It's not clear if he could be accused of a false statement there. But the removal of these memos was portrayed by other networks as akin to a diary, which is perfectly ridiculous. Those memos were clearly FBI material. The FBI has indicated that.

So, they -- it's possible that there're more political than jihadists. It remains to be seen. But from our own understanding, while we have done a very good job at taking ISIS territory away from them in Syria and in Iraq, as General Kelly was pointing out, this organization is still very much alive. It is not defeated. Even in Iraq alone, there're several thousand ISIS fighters still there. They're mostly Iraqis.

But the reality is simply this -- and here's where the Trump team deserves credit -- in their national security strategy, they have identified this era of big power competition and we're returning to it as we were in the cold war. Suddenly, Russia is not on the scale of the Soviet Union. But here's what they are, they're very ambitious. They want to be a world power. They're increasing in their capability. And they are aggressive and dangerous, and we have got to have the stomach and spine to confront them. I believe this administration does have that. It's going to increase our military budget as something. I know for a fact that it's got the Russian's attention because they see that similar to the Reagan buildup and what happened as a result of the Reagan buildup, the Soviet Union collapsed. That was one of the -- one of the factors in it, not certainly the only factor. But yes, our determination here -- particularly, our will, Martha, is how you need to deal with the Russians, with the Chinese, and with the Iranians. It takes political and moral will to stand up and confront powers and not -- don't fear the alternative. Don't fear escalation that could lead to something terrible. If that's -- if that's what drives you, then you're like the Obama administration, you've got your hands tied all the time, and your adversary are taking advantage of you and your allies.

Because when they analyzed it, the location is in a mountainous area, which would be ideal to build an underground facility. What the Assad regime was so concerned about is U.S. airpower, and particularly, Israeli airpower, because when the Israeli see something forming like a chemical site or a missile base, the Israelis attack it. They just took one down in September of 2017. And so, an underground facility makes sense. North Koreans are absolute bonafide expert on that. They've done most of their artillery built into mountains. All their nuclear sites are underground, so they clearly know how to do that.

This is Southwest 8th street, eight lanes of traffic. It's on the border between the town of Sweetwater as well as the campus of Florida International University, and this was to allow students and others to freely access going back and forth without having to dodge eight lanes of traffic. Over there, about 50 yards away, Governor Rick Scott just now seen approaching the media there. He flew down from Tallahassee to see the wreckage and the rubble in person. He's been over there. You can see his cars. And he's about to speak shortly here, just let me know when he appears to get in front of the microphones. But 10 people have been treated and are being treated at the nearby Kendall Regional Hospital. Two of them are in critical condition. According to police officers from Sweetwater who were within two or three blocks when suddenly the loud explosion of a million pounds of concrete crashed down on the southwest 8th street. They rushed over to the scene, they found, at least, four, maybe six, construction workers who were lying on the rubble dazed, cut, bleeding. One wasn't breathing. They had to use chest compressions for him. There was also another guy we talked to who said his childhood friend was simply crossing the street as a pedestrian when this happened. And, of course, all lanes of traffic have been open since they installed this bridge on Saturday. It was still under construction, not yet complete, not open to pedestrians. That was supposed to happen later this year in December, but it was built by FIGG Engineering, which has a 40-year history, according to the company of something like this never ever happened before. They say they are stunned that this bridge-span collapse. It spans from the south, FIU campus, to the north, the town of Sweetwater. And by all the reports, the center support tower was still to be constructed. So, exactly, what was the integral design of this bridge, whether there were very long, 170-foot very strong steel beams that were providing support from south tower to north tower or whether it was a hundred percent pure concrete, which is more unlikely, but it was supposed to be a state-of-the-art design as a pedestrian bridge. It was supposed to be iconic as is the Skyway Bridge south of Tampa Saint Pete. And then, today, absolute catastrophe, and you have a serious design, integrity, and engineering feat being now investigated as to what exactly caused this bridge to collapse. Fortunately, Florida International University on spring break this week, there could have been and there would have been many, many more people, students walking to and fro to campus and off campus at the time of day when this happened, which is right before 2:00 PM Eastern Time, Martha."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

So it is part of the plan to have a central structure but it's not there or this was a bridge that was supposed to be sort of a suspension?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEATING",
      "utterance": "Yeah, still waiting to get back, officially, from FIGG Engineering on that particular question. But several observers, engineering professors, one out of California, saying this is a bit risky to have this span over active eight lanes of traffic while they still build that center support tower. But, you know, you see all the skywalks in Seattle, and Minnesota, Minneapolis, and Spokane, Washington, there are no support beams in the center -- support towers in the center of those skywalks. So they are anchored quite well on the two ends of those structures, and the bridges, and the walkways, whether this was going to be exactly like that or it was actually to long for that kind of design, they were going to build the center tower later, again, one of the many unanswered questions at this hour."

The north half of the bridge spanning the westbound lane, that's all on the street, pancakes, crushed, just destroyed. The other remaining half of the bridge you can see in the sunlight backlighting this, you can see the big beams going down about 30 or 45 degrees at an angle above the street. That's the southern half of this pedestrian walkway bridge and that's precarious. They're still trying to assess how close they can get to that, if it's safe to even get underneath that as they continue to use dogs and dozens and dozens of firefighters searching for any survivors that may still be in those cars or under the rubble."

Nearly 20-years ago, a figure skater by the name of Craig Maurizi accused one of the sport's most well-known coaches, Richard Callahan, of sexual abuse. Callahan a world-class coach trained the likes of Todd Eldridge, Terry Lipinski, denied the charges. And Maurizi said U.S. Figure Skating never investigated his claims, in what he calls a deliberate cover-up. Now, in the wake of all of these stories and the Me Too Movement, Craig is fighting to have Coach Callahan removed from the sport once and for all. He is still coaching. Filing a complaint with the U.S. Center for SafeSport and the U.S. Olympic Committee misconduct watchdog, and now Callahan is indefinitely suspended. Here now the alleged victim, former figure skater, Craig Maurizi. Craig, good to see you tonight. Obviously, we'll have to get back to Florida when that gets underway. But I do want to speak with you about this, because this is something that you have been harboring your whole life, and now you watch what's going on, and you want this man stopped."

      "speaker": "CRAIG MAURIZI, FORMER FIGURE SKATER",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Circumstance actually helped get me to file again. When the Larry Nasser situation was unfolding, an investigative reporter called me and asked if I will tell my story. After I thought for a while about the correct path, and I spoke with both organizations -- spoke with U.S. Figure Skating, they urged me to file what's called a SafeSport report, and that's what got the ball starting again."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What's the nature of the kind of thing that this man was doing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "Without getting too graphic, it was different forms of sex acts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. So you believe -- do you believe you were his only victim?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "No, I wasn't, for sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "He was approached by a reporter recently, and he said it was 20 years ago. Get out of my face, essentially, that was a long time ago. What do you say to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "Well, I have a life sentence. And for me, I'm still dealing with it today and I'm going to deal with for the rest of my life. I've come to terms with the fact that I am who I am as a result of this. So, for me, it's still very new."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "In terms of what happened back then, did you try to reach out, did you try to cry out to anybody at that point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "I definitely did. I filed a grievance with the U.S. Figure Skating and with the second organization called the Professional Skaters Association."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What was their response?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "The U.S. Figure Skating would not see -- had in their by laws that if a crime or an allege crime occurred more than 60 days past when I filed a grievance that they wouldn't even see it. So they never even took my grievance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Incredible. So you've got 60 days to talk about this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I was about 14-years --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "How long was the span of time that this was going on for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "Started when I was 13 into my early 20s."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And in terms of -- so this is -- I would imagine a sort of manipulative power kind of set up where he felt you really couldn't do anything about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "That's correct. It was -- he made himself indispensable to me, is the best way to put it. He monitored and guided me in all aspects of my life, what to think, what to say, how to act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So it was brainwashing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "Brainwashing for sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And did you feel that if you pushed too hard against him or if you called him out on it that your career as a skater would be done?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "I did feel that at the time. Not just with him, but with the organization as a whole. This is how I make my living. I didn't want to disrupt that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Craig, thank you. We're following a lot of these stories, especially in athletics. And we thank you for sharing your story tonight. Good luck to you."

      "speaker": "MAURIZI",
      "utterance": "Thank you."

      "utterance": "Back to Miami now where we see that they are assembling to get started with this news conference. Let's listen in."

      "speaker": "MAURICE KEMP, MIAMI-DADE DEPUTY MAYOR",
      "utterance": "Good evening. My name is Maurice Kemp, deputy mayor of Miami-Dade County. And on behalf of the mayor, Carlos Gimenez, and myself, I'd like to offer our sincere condolences to the victims of this tragedy and their families. Miami-Dade County and our partner agencies for the last six hours have been working feverishly in the search and rescue mode to ascertain how many victims there are and rescue as many as we can. We will continue in this mode until we are certain that there are no more viable victims. And at some point, we will transition into an investigation and recovery mode, but we're not there yet."
