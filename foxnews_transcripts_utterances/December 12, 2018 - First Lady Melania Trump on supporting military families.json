      "sentences": "We're going to have that full interview in just a few minutes, along with our highlights of an incredible trip. Wait until you see these planes landing and taking off, it's unbelievable. First, we do have updates on the Mueller partisan witch hunt. Today, Michael Cohen, he was sentenced to three years in prison after he pled guilty to tax evasion, making false statements on a bank loan application, lying to Congress about building -- a building project that never even got off the ground and a questionable campaign finance violation. Notice something missing? No Trump-Russia collusion, none, again. It's also important to note: Michael Cohen does not have a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And meanwhile tonight, another top target of this Mueller witch-hunt, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, is asking a federal judge for leniency and no jail time, he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators but only after legal bills wrecked his family finances, forced this man 33-year veteran, five years of combat to have to sell his home and probably was most likely threatening punitive action against his son and his business partner. He fell on the sword like probably 99 percent of fathers would do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, we are learning some disgusting new details surrounding how Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was treated by top federal officials. Now, according to Flynn sentencing requests, then deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe pressured then national security advisor Flynn not to have a lawyer present during a seemingly relaxed, oh casual meeting with the FBI, the one that they said he lied at except nobody believed he lied. Flynn agreed to sit down without attorneys present, and was then subsequently charged with lying during that very meeting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now keep in mind, Andrew McCabe was ultimately fired from the FBI for him lying to the bureau, and he is currently facing no charges. According to FoxNews.com, Flynn's filing also seemingly demonstrates that the FBI took a significantly more aggressive tack in handling the Flynn interview than it did during other similar matters. For example, quote, no one interviewed during the FBI's Clinton email investigation was hit with false statement charges, though investigators believed those witnesses were untruthful, big difference. And so, as we now know, that is called a two-tiered justice system. And by the way, this might be part of the worst part of Flynn's political persecution, the agents interviewing Flynn -- they never thought he lied. That is a such a miscarriage of justice and an abuse of power corruption scandal, one of the biggest in American history as we've been telling you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, of course, you're not likely to hear about any of this on any other media, especially over a conspiracy TV MSNBC, especially not on the Liberal \"Morning Joe\" show, where the host literally spent hours every single day trying to outdo themselves, you know, trading insults about Donald Trump and the Trump family and anybody associated with Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, it's a pretty sad and scary way to start your morning, but today, co- host Mika Brzezinski went too far, use this pretty disgusting slur just before 9:00 a.m. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

There's no way to act, to demonstrate merit to come into this country. It's also a massive security risk as the \"San Diego Tribune\" is reporting. Thousands of migrants are now unaccounted for, writing, quote: In the group of unaccounted migrants about 3,500 are presumed to have either crossed illegally into the U.S., moved to other Mexican border cities or simply fallen through the cracks.

And the author of another bestseller, \"The Deep State\", FOX News contributor, Jason Chaffetz. I read this about General Flynn. OK, Michael Cohen admitted to these things, I feel sorry for him and his family tonight but he admitted to these acts that he was responsible for. He's changed his position on a lot of issues.

In just moments, we're going to show you the highlights of that interview and an exclusive one-on-one interview with the first lady herself. Please stay tuned. Also, tonight, we're going to bring you the latest on the sentencing of Michael Cohen and we will reveal disturbing details surrounding what is really absolutely shameful treatment of a 33-year veteran of this country, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Also, over at conspiracy TV MSNBC Liberal Morning Joe -- well, part of that team is in very hot water tonight. We'll tell you why. And also later, a dangerous terrorist on the loose in France.

      "utterance": "We're going to have that full interview in just a few minutes, along with our highlights of an incredible trip. Wait until you see these planes landing and taking off, it's unbelievable. First, we do have updates on the Mueller partisan witch hunt. Today, Michael Cohen, he was sentenced to three years in prison after he pled guilty to tax evasion, making false statements on a bank loan application, lying to Congress about building -- a building project that never even got off the ground and a questionable campaign finance violation. Notice something missing? No Trump-Russia collusion, none, again. It's also important to note: Michael Cohen does not have a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors. And meanwhile tonight, another top target of this Mueller witch-hunt, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, is asking a federal judge for leniency and no jail time, he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators but only after legal bills wrecked his family finances, forced this man 33-year veteran, five years of combat to have to sell his home and probably was most likely threatening punitive action against his son and his business partner. He fell on the sword like probably 99 percent of fathers would do. And tonight, we are learning some disgusting new details surrounding how Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was treated by top federal officials. Now, according to Flynn sentencing requests, then deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe pressured then national security advisor Flynn not to have a lawyer present during a seemingly relaxed, oh casual meeting with the FBI, the one that they said he lied at except nobody believed he lied. Flynn agreed to sit down without attorneys present, and was then subsequently charged with lying during that very meeting. Now keep in mind, Andrew McCabe was ultimately fired from the FBI for him lying to the bureau, and he is currently facing no charges. According to FoxNews.com, Flynn's filing also seemingly demonstrates that the FBI took a significantly more aggressive tack in handling the Flynn interview than it did during other similar matters. For example, quote, no one interviewed during the FBI's Clinton email investigation was hit with false statement charges, though investigators believed those witnesses were untruthful, big difference. And so, as we now know, that is called a two-tiered justice system. And by the way, this might be part of the worst part of Flynn's political persecution, the agents interviewing Flynn -- they never thought he lied. That is a such a miscarriage of justice and an abuse of power corruption scandal, one of the biggest in American history as we've been telling you. And, of course, you're not likely to hear about any of this on any other media, especially over a conspiracy TV MSNBC, especially not on the Liberal \"Morning Joe\" show, where the host literally spent hours every single day trying to outdo themselves, you know, trading insults about Donald Trump and the Trump family and anybody associated with Trump. Now, it's a pretty sad and scary way to start your morning, but today, co- host Mika Brzezinski went too far, use this pretty disgusting slur just before 9:00 a.m. Take a look."

Are the pathetic deflections that we just heard when he appeared on \"Fox and Friends\", is that a patriot speaking or a wannabe dictator's butt boy? I'm dead serious. I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot?"

Some bad choice of words. I should have said water boy like for football teams or something like that. Yes, Mika, pretty bad choice of words. But we're consistent on this program. We don't call for boycotts. We don't call for firings of any kind. In fact, when Mika's colleague, MSNBC host Joy Reid, when she was in hot water over homophobic and conspiracy filled blog that she had, we never called for her to be fired or for her show to be boycotted. People do make mistakes. People are not perfect and I think we're all human and I don't believe anybody's career and my honest opinion should be ruined over a stupid mistake. By the way, she's no fan of mine and neither is Liberal Joe and I doubt they would do this for any opinion host here of Fox News. But it's sad to see Trump derangement syndrome claim yet another victim and, of course, there were many warning signs as the anti-Trump vitriol got worse and worse and worse. Let's take a look."

He's ignorant, he's warped, he's obsessed with money and sex, and he finds his power through those two things. He will be forever remembered as the president who traumatized little children. That's his brand now. He's the president who purposefully traumatized babies and children. Very, almost cavemen like. It's like Fred Flintstone running the country. I don't think he has the moral compass to make a decision based on our own national security. To anybody who works inside the White House, works on the national security team, works in the State Department, at some point, you are working for a president who is not fit to lead, who's going to do something crazy in five minutes one hour, tonight or tomorrow, like what more do you need to hear from him to start thinking 25th Amendment or something else."

Widespread manhunt underway for the gunman in Tuesday's terror attack had a French Christmas market that left at least two dead. Now, the 29-year-old suspect identified right there as Cherif Chekatt allegedly shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" as he opened fire before escaping from the scene in a taxi. We're also learning tonight he had a long criminal record and he was already on the authorities radar for connections to radical Islam. So far, five other people with alleged ties to the suspect have now been detained and even more frightening is that French authorities admit that he may have already slipped across the border into Germany. We'll keep you updated. We'll pray for the victims, scary times."

      "utterance": "attack like this, all these attacks underscore the need for safety and security like places, oh, at our southern border, where we have caught people with terrorist ties trying to get into this country, where tonight migrant groups are literally, you know, the ones women and children that the media kept telling us about, remember they were trying to march to the U.S. consulate over Tijuana demanding President Trump, either let them into the country or now they want us to pay them fifty thousand dollars in reparations to go home -- pay you to go home so you don't break our laws and don't disrespect our sovereignty. One group organizers are arguing that it may seem like a lot of money to you, but it's a small sum compared to everything the United States has stolen from Honduras. Now, look we all know probably the vast majority of people who come from poor countries with no opportunity no hope for their children and grandchildren are good people, searching for a better life but demanding entry or pay you, or we'll overwhelm your immigration system? There's no way to act, to demonstrate merit to come into this country. It's also a massive security risk as the \"San Diego Tribune\" is reporting. Thousands of migrants are now unaccounted for, writing, quote: In the group of unaccounted migrants about 3,500 are presumed to have either crossed illegally into the U.S., moved to other Mexican border cities or simply fallen through the cracks. That is why the president is standing firm rightly so on the border wall, forging ahead on keeping his promise to the forgotten men and women of this country to preserve our nation's safety and security first. Remember, a wall will literally help people on both sides be safer. And then, of course, the wall will have a big door and you can come in legally as the president has said. But we do have the right to vet anyone that wants to come into this country because keeping out potential terrorists, human traffickers, drug traffickers, violent cartel members is a huge number-one priority for our national security. All right. We have a lot to get to tonight, including our interview with the first lady. Joining us now, the author of the bestseller \"Why We Fight\", FOX News national security strategist, Sebastian Gorka. And the author of another bestseller, \"The Deep State\", FOX News contributor, Jason Chaffetz. I read this about General Flynn. OK, Michael Cohen admitted to these things, I feel sorry for him and his family tonight but he admitted to these acts that he was responsible for. He's changed his position on a lot of issues. Now, the media, they only want to believe the version that helps their narrative."

The FBI doesn't believe he lied and then he's charged with lying anyway because he's bankrupt, can't fight it, in a threatening probably his kid."

      "speaker": "GORKA",
      "utterance": "This is classic entrapment, Sean. If you listen to the testimony of the two FBI agents who don't think he was lying, if you look at what we now know about McCabe, who said, you don't need a lawyer, General Flynn, this is just an innocuous discussion. And then what do they do? They trap him in a process crime. Sean, everybody watching this show right now could be trapped in a process crime. I don't care how much of a boy scout you've been, everybody has a faulty memory and you say one thing on Monday when you think you're in a friendly discussion with some fellow patriots, you think FBI agents, and then a week later, two weeks later, you remember it differently, that's it, you've committed a felony because you have quote unquote lied to a federal agents. That's entrapment of General Flynn. And then we compare this to a man who secretly taped his conversations with his client. Think about that. Michael Cohen admitted he's a liar and he's a kind of guy who has no qualms The most sensitive thing a lawyer has is his relationship with his client. That exclusivity, that confidentiality, this man taped conversations with who knows how many clients? One of them is now the president of the United States. I know which man I believe and it's General Flynn. I worked for him in transition. I worked with him in the White House. He is a patriot, Sean."

So, two guys made it to the FBI, deity in my family. They were the highest of the high. Naturally, we are inclined -- we want to help our FBI. But if you're in a situation now and you want to help them and you're risking if you don't remember something properly, remember, he was illegally surveilled, illegally unmasked, they didn't use minimization and they leaked raw intelligence on this man -- nobody cares about the crimes that were committed where they literally had the transcript. So anything that's not perfectly matched up in an interview to the transcript means that's a lie, that's how they're going to view it, 33 years. This is how we're going to treat this man and tell them advise him, don't have a lawyer, what does that tell people that instinctively like us want to help our FBI? Not these corrupt officials at the top, rank and file, good field office FBI agents that are protecting this country."

But the upper echelon, it is now well-documented the bias and the animus that they had, and we have a great deal of thanks for General Flynn. You're right, 33 years of service. What's also very striking to me, though, Sean, is the difference in the way justice was played out because I was a very key player in what was going on in trying to get to the truth with Hillary Clinton in her email and the transfer of classified information to a non-classified setting, putting people's lives in danger. I mean, real lives in danger. And yet the five people around Hillary Clinton, they all got immunity agreements with no requirement to cooperate with the government, no ability for us, say in Congress or the inspector general's office to make sure that we can go back and get the truth about them. And then you contrast how the FBI was acting with Flynn and Cohen and others and it just doesn't feel like justice is balanced."

That has expanded and I don't think we're going to hear about it until the spring or so because there's something like a million documents that they're probably having to sift through to get there.

That's what we're talking about, the politicized use, the weaponization of the intelligence community and potentially hundreds of Americans are affected, Sean."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "You know, let's stay on that, because if we really cared about Russian influence in the election, which is now evolved into -- well, Donald Trump may have committed a felony campaign finance violation with no lawyer is ever going to buy into, intelligent lawyer that is, except for these crazy dumb TV pundits that are way overpaid and just incendiary and their hatred for two years of Donald Trump. So, the question is what we really going to allow somebody who paid for Russian influence with funneled money, interestingly, campaign finance violations, perhaps, to a law firm, laws, legal expense, not true, foreign national, Russian lies fed to the American people, influenced the election and money kickback in a uranium deal that was signed off on -- you can't tell me that that this is about Russia, because if it was about Russia we would be after these issues. They're not after them. It's just like they only cared about Kavanaugh if he did something inappropriate, wrong. But they didn't care about Keith Ellison or Michael Avenatti, they didn't they didn't jump the gun in those cases, which means they really just care about the politicizing of these issues. Isn't that what it's about?"

He was involved with Hillary Clinton. He was involved with the campaign. He was involved a Perkins Coie, and he was also involved with the Panetta Group. And so, all of those ties, millions of dollars going overseas to attract this money but you don't even get the sense that anybody is even sniffing into this and it's just that's where people I just think are losing trust, have lost trust in the justice system because that was fundamentally wrong. It's millions of dollars spent to affect an election by engaging foreign entity and foreigners to be involved in that campaign, and there's so much material.

Mika Brzezinski is a middle-aged woman. She knows what she's doing. She's done television for a very long time. She's a sophisticated woman. That is a very specific phrase to use, not even just saying about it whether it's about lifestyle or you use a word when you're a kid, she chose a phrase that was meant to dehumanize. And so, that is going to speak about who she is as an individual, but at the same time, she apologized. Ultimately, she will be given a pass because she's a liberal and as we're as Mr. Murray and Mr. Hart will probably continue to be hounded. That's the difference, is that they will move along and they will be left alone, but others, there will still be an attempt to ruin their careers, to make their lives difficult. That is the problem here. And we've seen it all along. Usually, if you're on the left, you do get a pass, and this is why we can -- we can see this as being a not just hypocritical but a determination to ruin people's lives by the left.

But that being said, those on the left have a long history of stating anti- gay slurs and anti-gay jokes, and then when they're called on it, they usually try to minimize it, usually with a cutesy kind of tweet as Ms. Brzezinski did today and pray that it goes away. And it usually does go away, because as Tammy points out, they have something not available to you me and Tammy, which is the protection of the mainstream media. So they don't get the pile-on that we do when we misspeak or when we make a mistake, then our lives are ruined and our reputations are tarnished but they get a pass and they are allowed to go forward. That double standard continues to be in place and it needs to be exposed--"

It's their desire to destroy other people under the guise of being a racist, or a sexist or homophobic. My first book lays out how all of that leads on the left."

For trying to maintain the alliance with Saudi Arabia as they are trying to develop an anti-Iran coalition which is a very serious and meaningful, substantial foreign policy exercise, OK? But I didn't hear in the eight long years of President Obama, I didn't hear Ms. Brzezinski or Mr. Scarborough talk about President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Secretary John Kerry bending over backwards to align themselves with the Iranian regime of Hashemi and Rouhani and Zarif. That regime is at least as bad as Saudi Arabia on human rights, if not worse. That regime has killed Americans in Iraq and elsewhere around the world and they still target Israel. And so, I didn't hear a peep out of them on that. But here they are attacking Secretary Pompeo and the president for being \"traitors,\" and all manner of, you know--"

Then you talked about, you are confident, you're very focused and you used the term, stay true to myself. You use that term a lot.
