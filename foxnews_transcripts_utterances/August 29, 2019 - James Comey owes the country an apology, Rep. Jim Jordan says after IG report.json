      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from another busy Washington tonight. Congressman Jim Jordan, Jason Chaffetz, and Mollie Hemingway are going to take you inside the DOJ Inspector General's damning report on Jim Comey and revealing important new details. A lot of people are missing it. Also, the man who first hired Comey in government, Rudy Giuliani - yes, he is responsible - is here with a fiery response and perhaps a tinge of regret. Plus, a man who served at the highest levels of the FBI with Comey is now calling for the former Director to apologize to the men and women of the bureau. His emotional plea later. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in the latest installment of our \"Raymond on the Road\" series, it will shock you. We're going to take you to Venice Beach, California, where residents are being overrun by not just homeless people and what that entails, but aggressive homeless people. And he's going to show you how the people and the business owners are fighting back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, the liar, the wimp, and the wardrobe. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, you get the sense that when Director Comey entered the FBI building, it became like the wardrobe in that famous C.S. Lewis book. His own fantasy land with rules that didn't apply to mere mortals. Well, today, the supercilious, pious, sanctimonious former FBI Director Jim Comey was roasted. The Inspector General found that he was in clear violation of Department of Justice guidelines and his sworn duty in handling information related to the dealings - his dealings with the President and the dossier. Now, Comey's conduct was an affront to the standards expected of all DOJ employees and it's a stain on the long, proud history of the FBI. But tonight here's what you need to understand. Comey along with Clapper, Brennan, Strzok, and McCabe, and perhaps others, fancied themselves as Trump-resisting superheroes, self-appointed saviors of truth, justice, and the American way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, deep state actors, they looked the other way as Comey abused his position. All the privileges and power of the FBI in a planned effort to destroy the man he had utter disdain for, Donald Trump. Now, Comey comes from the rarified upper crust of elite Washington lawyers. To them, Trump from the outset was an uncouth real estate mogul turned reality star, the antithesis of what many of these self-anointed elites wanted in their President. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now folks like Comey, themselves, have coasted for years on their pedigree and puffery. They don't like disrupters, because people like Trump, they're going to pull back the curtain on the status quo, the old guard, the establishment. They don't like that one bit. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The IG report tells us that Comey meticulously planned exactly how he would inform President-elect Trump of the salacious details contained in that Steele dossier. He colluded with McCabe, the FBI General Counsel, and others in advance to plan their strategy to set up the President-elect. So after briefing Trump about the dossier at Trump Tower, Comey started drafting a memo to memorialize the encounter during a car ride back to the office. This was all planned out. Then a day later, on January 11th, CNN reported this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Several memos were sent to his personal lawyer, Daniel Richman, who then, at Comey's behest, shared the contents of at least two of them with the news media. Why? To spark the appointment of a Special Counsel to investigate possible Trump-Russia collusion. But the President smelled a rat.

Neither of those is good either. Still, after all of this, Comey had the gall this morning to tweet, \"DOJ IG ‘found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.' I don't need a public apology from those who defame me, but a quick message with a ‘sorry we lied about you' would be nice.\" Sorry, Jimmy, don't hold your breath. The IG report established beyond a shadow of a doubt that Comey engaged in a grand personal vendetta against this President. And in doing so, he abused his authority. And while Comey must be breathing easier tonight given the AG's decision not to prosecute him for this leaking, he's not out of the woods yet. The IG report on the FBI-Russian probe and the use of those FISA warrants is forthcoming. And it was Comey who signed the first FISA warrant to spy on American citizens. Now, based on the dossier, he knew or should have known, was not credible. That was filed with the FISA court. Big no, no. But if Comey manages to escape prosecution for conduct that his underlings would be charged for, then the damage he did to the FBI will extend to our belief in the treasured words carved into the Supreme Court building, \"Equal justice under the law.\" And that's THE ANGLE. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining me with reaction is Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee; Jason Chaffetz, former Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Fox News contributor, and author of the new book \"Power Grab,\" which comes out Tuesday.

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from another busy Washington tonight. Congressman Jim Jordan, Jason Chaffetz, and Mollie Hemingway are going to take you inside the DOJ Inspector General's damning report on Jim Comey and revealing important new details. A lot of people are missing it. Also, the man who first hired Comey in government, Rudy Giuliani - yes, he is responsible - is here with a fiery response and perhaps a tinge of regret. Plus, a man who served at the highest levels of the FBI with Comey is now calling for the former Director to apologize to the men and women of the bureau. His emotional plea later. And in the latest installment of our \"Raymond on the Road\" series, it will shock you. We're going to take you to Venice Beach, California, where residents are being overrun by not just homeless people and what that entails, but aggressive homeless people. And he's going to show you how the people and the business owners are fighting back. But first, the liar, the wimp, and the wardrobe. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Now, you get the sense that when Director Comey entered the FBI building, it became like the wardrobe in that famous C.S. Lewis book. His own fantasy land with rules that didn't apply to mere mortals. Well, today, the supercilious, pious, sanctimonious former FBI Director Jim Comey was roasted. The Inspector General found that he was in clear violation of Department of Justice guidelines and his sworn duty in handling information related to the dealings - his dealings with the President and the dossier. Now, Comey's conduct was an affront to the standards expected of all DOJ employees and it's a stain on the long, proud history of the FBI. But tonight here's what you need to understand. Comey along with Clapper, Brennan, Strzok, and McCabe, and perhaps others, fancied themselves as Trump-resisting superheroes, self-appointed saviors of truth, justice, and the American way. Well, deep state actors, they looked the other way as Comey abused his position. All the privileges and power of the FBI in a planned effort to destroy the man he had utter disdain for, Donald Trump. Now, Comey comes from the rarified upper crust of elite Washington lawyers. To them, Trump from the outset was an uncouth real estate mogul turned reality star, the antithesis of what many of these self-anointed elites wanted in their President. Now folks like Comey, themselves, have coasted for years on their pedigree and puffery. They don't like disrupters, because people like Trump, they're going to pull back the curtain on the status quo, the old guard, the establishment. They don't like that one bit. The IG report tells us that Comey meticulously planned exactly how he would inform President-elect Trump of the salacious details contained in that Steele dossier. He colluded with McCabe, the FBI General Counsel, and others in advance to plan their strategy to set up the President-elect. So after briefing Trump about the dossier at Trump Tower, Comey started drafting a memo to memorialize the encounter during a car ride back to the office. This was all planned out. Then a day later, on January 11th, CNN reported this."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Well, that opened, of course, the media flood gates and a wave of damaging and totally fraudulent fake news stories followed about the phony Clinton financed Steele dossier. Now, in the months that followed, Comey memorialized his other meetings with the President. Several memos were sent to his personal lawyer, Daniel Richman, who then, at Comey's behest, shared the contents of at least two of them with the news media. Why? To spark the appointment of a Special Counsel to investigate possible Trump-Russia collusion. But the President smelled a rat. He confronted and ultimately fired Comey over the leaks to the media, which, of course, Comey vociferously denied."

Regarding the leaking. Maybe Comey never considered releasing his own memos leaking because his ultimate goal, bringing down the President, was noble. He saw it as he was carrying out his civic duty."

      "speaker": "COMEY",

This is from Page 61 of the IG report. \"Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure. What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, investigative information obtained during the course of FBI employment in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\" So, he leaked and lied to the public about it. Then there is the question of how many memos Comey shared with his pal, Richman, for media distribution and whether they contained classified material. Now, in repeated interviews, Comey said versions of this."

Could be classified information. So, repeated leaker, repeated liar. And in his interview with Bret Baier last year, he made this ludicrous claim."

      "utterance": "The FBI protocol says your own employment agreement with the FBI prohibits \"the unauthorized disclosure of any information or material from or related to FBI files or any information acquired by virtue of my official employment without prior written permission from the FBI.\" Did you have written permission?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "First of all, any man who says aide-memoire is someone you should never trust. OK? That is just - the IG, on Page 52, says \"Comey's characterization of the memos as personal record finds no support in the law and is wholly incompatible with the plain language of the statutes, regulations, and policies defining federal records, and the terms of Comey's FBI employment agreement.\" So he's not just a leaker and a liar, he's incompetent or, perhaps, willfully ignorant. Neither of those is good either. Still, after all of this, Comey had the gall this morning to tweet, \"DOJ IG ‘found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.' I don't need a public apology from those who defame me, but a quick message with a ‘sorry we lied about you' would be nice.\" Sorry, Jimmy, don't hold your breath. The IG report established beyond a shadow of a doubt that Comey engaged in a grand personal vendetta against this President. And in doing so, he abused his authority. And while Comey must be breathing easier tonight given the AG's decision not to prosecute him for this leaking, he's not out of the woods yet. The IG report on the FBI-Russian probe and the use of those FISA warrants is forthcoming. And it was Comey who signed the first FISA warrant to spy on American citizens. Now, based on the dossier, he knew or should have known, was not credible. That was filed with the FISA court. Big no, no. But if Comey manages to escape prosecution for conduct that his underlings would be charged for, then the damage he did to the FBI will extend to our belief in the treasured words carved into the Supreme Court building, \"Equal justice under the law.\" And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me with reaction is Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee; Jason Chaffetz, former Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Fox News contributor, and author of the new book \"Power Grab,\" which comes out Tuesday. Also with me, Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at \"The Federalist\" who's been covering this extensively, and a Fox News contributor. Congressman Jordan, let's start with you.

      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "No, Laura, and your opening remarks were right on target. Look, our country had to live to this two-and-a-half saga because of one guy, Jim Comey. Jim Comey is a guy who opens the investigation in July 2016. Jim Comey is a guy who puts Peter Strzok in charge of it, the same guy who ran the Clinton investigation, the same guy who said Trump should lose 100 million to zero. That's the guy he puts in charge. Jim Comey is a guy who allows the dossier to be used to get a warrant to spy on a fellow American citizen. And Jim Comey is the guy who leaks sensitive information, broke the rules of the FBI, leaks sensitive information to \"The New York Times\" through his friend Daniel Richman, for what reason? To get a Special Counsel who put the country through this entire saga that was based on a false accusation. So I'm not going to apologize. Jim Comey owes the country an apology because he put us through this for two-and-a-half years, and we know he did it. We know he did it because he was out to get the President based on what happened in that January 6 meeting that you talked about at the Trump Tower, where he used the news hook about the dossier, talking to the President about the dossier. And it says on Page 17 of the report, they did it to try to get information, trap the President, all the while, he was telling the President, you're not under investigation."

And I think a lot of people thought that was the purpose of the briefing, was so that it could be immediately leaked to CNN, creating this Russia hoax hysteria. But we also learn in the IG report today is that they were using that information as - they were using that meeting as a way to get information about a Russia hoax that they apparently really believed, which is deeply alarming that they fell for something that preposterous.

And to listen to James Comey go out there and sanctimoniously say the self- righteous way that he's not a leaker, that he doesn't do all this stuff, they knew full well that he was the source of much of this information. And remember, it was the Deputy Assistant Director for the FBI that was highlighted by the Inspector General in a previous notation and recommended for prosecutorial - to be prosecuted because they took sealed court documents and released them to the media. This was a culture that the Inspector General has highlighted time and time and time again. And I want the Department of Justice to do what they should do and actually charge one of their own because you've got an Inspector General who's doing everything they could possibly do to highlight the problems, but DOJ can't seem to take it upon themselves to actually charge somebody."

And the response is, get the f back in your house or I'm going to fire bomb your house. We raised, we, the group of over 50 residents, raised $35,000.

But we frequently will find they'll go right back here in the alley and will use that as a toilet. There will be toilet paper and feces and human waste. And occasionally, I've had people leave glass jars of urine on my curb. It's not like the city takes any responsibility for that. But that's the nature of this whole environment, it's very dysfunctional."

Each of these units, permanent facilities, here on the beach cost the taxpayers of California $174,000 per toilet per year to operate. And the port-a-potties, the port-a-lets that are around town, $320,000 a year to erect and maintain, all for the homeless. Along Venice Beach, homeless, some posing as artists, have overtaken the boardwalk. Scattered encampments line the beach, and the side streets running off of it."

We first brought you the appalling video of these miscreants dousing officers with buckets of water, and that eventually escalated to throwing glass bottles and concrete. And now arrests are plummeting after the NYPD fired Daniel Pantaleo last week. He was the officer who was involved in the death of Eric Garner in 2014. Here with me now is Bernie Kerik, former NYPD commissioner who has been watching this unfolding in his city. Bernie, what is happening to the great city of New York and the relationship with the police? People focus on the video, Eric Garner, and it is really awful. And I'm sad for his family. It is horrific. But the police now feel like they're damned if they do, they're damned if they don't."

And over the eight years Rudy was in place, that dropped -- murder dropped by 70 percent, violent crime by 65. The cops were given the tools and the backing and the support they needed to go out and do the job that had to be done to change --"

What you just saw in Venice, California, is coming to New York City in a bigger way than ever. And you have cops that know, 100 percent, that the administration is not going to support them and not going to give them the benefit of the doubt should they have a problem as we saw in the Garner case. So the cops are out there. They're not proactive. They're not preemptive. They want to -- all the mayor wants to do is focus on community issues. Well, guess what, bad guys, they know exactly what the cops are doing, where they're doing it, why they're doing it, how they're doing it. And they're going to circumvent it all. And you see in the city, Times Square today is turning into a cesspool like it was back in the 90s."

They got rid of Seventh Avenue going all the way down, it's completely changed, all the bike lanes and all that. But it's not like it was when Giuliani, even Bloomberg.

They're emboldened by the Democratic leadership in cities all around the country, not just New York. You see this behavior all over the U.S., especially in areas where you have Democratic leadership and they allow this kind of conduct. There are prosecutors today around the country that aren't prosecuting people like this, which is completely insane."
