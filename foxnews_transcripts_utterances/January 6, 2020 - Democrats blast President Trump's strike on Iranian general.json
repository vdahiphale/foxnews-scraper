There has never been any proof of success from any of the analysts that you see on television telling you that they know what's going to happen next or what happened in the past. They know nothing. So take everything with a grain of salt. Every apocalyptic prediction has been wrong, including -- hey, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Remember that was supposed to be the end of the world.

Case in point, I was watching our great leader Neil Cavuto, right? He was doing a segment on trying to predict what the Iranians might do to us in terms of cyber attacks, on like banking institutions, and stuff like that. And so he cited what they have done in the past, meaning they already attacked us many, many times. Interesting, don't you think? Don't you think that would play into the decision-making to take out this guy? They already attacked us? We took out their Charles Manson and it's on us? Sorry, we didn't escalate anything.

And I think that's an important point to be made here. While he is a Republican senator, Juan, the questions over the intelligence behind the president's decision were questioned before we even knew what was behind it, or the details behind it. That has changed. Today, we just learned that there is going to be a Senate briefing on Wednesday, where the Department of Defense, Mark Esper, the Secretary. He is going to brief -- it's going to be -- I believe a house-wide briefing on the intelligence behind this. So why condemn this before we even know why the president made the decision to do it?"

So this is why people are saying what do you do next? Because what was now was correct. No one can question the actual actions of Trump. So instead, you have to shift into what ifs. I will admit right now that absolutely no expert on Iran or the Middle East. But I will happily tell you neither is anybody else. There has never been any proof of success from any of the analysts that you see on television telling you that they know what's going to happen next or what happened in the past. They know nothing. So take everything with a grain of salt. Every apocalyptic prediction has been wrong, including -- hey, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Remember that was supposed to be the end of the world. And also, I love it. I love it. I love it how people are saying, oh, now those Iranians are really pissed. They're really going to come after us. Like when they were killing our troops, they were deeply admiring us. I mean -- and it's going to restart their nukes like they had actually had stopped them? They are like your dirt bag cousin's drug habit. He's telling you he's stopped. No, he just moved it to another house. So the idea that we somehow kicked the hornet's nest is an absolute lie. The hornets are already out of the nest and they've been stinging us forever. Case in point, I was watching our great leader Neil Cavuto, right? He was doing a segment on trying to predict what the Iranians might do to us in terms of cyber attacks, on like banking institutions, and stuff like that. And so he cited what they have done in the past, meaning they already attacked us many, many times. Interesting, don't you think? Don't you think that would play into the decision-making to take out this guy? They already attacked us? We took out their Charles Manson and it's on us? Sorry, we didn't escalate anything. Lastly, we keep seeing all these shots of these large crowds of mourners. Mass protests in Iran is what you call Thursday, OK? Death to -- saying death to America, that is their palates, all right? So, you know, when somebody said wow, check out their mass protests in Iran. That's like saying the line at Chick-fil-A. It's always there, OK? So we are used to this. It's been going on since the revolution. They treated us like crap. You were right. We took out a bad guy. And what's interesting about this is what's seen as heinous under Trump would've been seen as bold under Obama."

When the option was presented to them, they said they weren't interested in the consequences, the idea of going to war potentially with Iran. Now, today, as people are asking these questions about the intelligence. You see that the American public, specifically the Democrats are, like, we aren't sure what President Trump's bases was for this. And, of course, Americans have a lot of questions after 9/11, after weapons of mass destruction in Iraq proved not to be there. So what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAGEN MCDOWELL, GUEST CO-HOST",

They killed an American contractor and stormed a U.S. embassy, an act of war. That's your why now. There was restraint after the attack on an American drone that downed it. There was restraint after an Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, but not now. Here's your redline for the terrorists who killed Americans with impunity. Your redline is death. Your punishment is death. And President Trump did not forecast what that redline was. But here it is. I want to point out just a couple more quick things. President Obama's policy with Iran was to funnel money into the hands of this terrorist. The Quds forces, a terrorist organization, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, a terrorist organization. At least initially $1.7 billion in pallets of cash sent in the dark of night that we wouldn't even know about without the Wall Street Journal reporting, that went straight into Soleimani's hands and straightened to killing Americans and straightened to fomenting terrorism around the region. That's the why now. That's why he's dead."

But once you start seeing him in person, on the campaign trail, he only pretty much likes hanging around super rich people, and I don't mean even Judge Judy rich. I mean multibillionaires.

Now viewer warning, the image we are about to show you is graphic. It shows a bloody line around the middle of Epstein's neck.

So he's been hired by the family, the brother of Jeffrey Epstein to further investigate this. He talks about the ligature. He says -- and you saw a picture of it there, the one that was supposedly used to hang himself. And he said it doesn't match the wound on his neck. That's more indicative of a rope or a cord. It's more of a narrow indentation on his neck. Also said there was no blood found on the noose, and he was back to his original theory at how the fractures in his neck did not match of a suicidal attempt with the noose.

Generally, a person who commits suicide would have multiple nooses in case one breaks, right? I don't know if you would stage something you would stage it with multiple nooses. I do love Dr. Baden. He was Dr. Death on Red Eye. There was 100 appearances. But he does have kind of a dog in his hunt because it represents the brother. And there must be some insurance claim that's involved in that.

I don't know why they put their money and credibility on the line with this, but they clearly did yesterday. They're new -- there's new evidence so it's interesting.

But it's just like this little bunch of critters. They want to go out they want to get some exercise. Everything's great. Then it's like you know what, forget it. I'm going to go back in.
