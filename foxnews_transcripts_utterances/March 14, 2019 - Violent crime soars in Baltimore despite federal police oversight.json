Quoting here, when one of our own fails to meet those standards no matter his or her role in the organization, we take it seriously and must take the appropriate action. The group also plans to bring in an outside organization to assess its workplace practices and climate. For his part Morris Dees told The Associated Press the matter involved a personnel issue and that he wishes the group luck in the future. SPLC gained notice in the early 80s after suing the KKK on behalf of one of its murder victims leading to three Klansmen firebombing the group's building in 1983. But the organization that claims to target hate has also been accused of engendering hate after adding people like Maajid Nawaz and Ayaan Hirsi Ali to its list of 15 anti-Muslim extremists who critics say are the very people doing the work the SPLC is supposed to be doing. In 2014, SPLC also added Dr. Ben Carson's name to the list for allegedly being anti-gay. The group later removed his name and apologized. In 2012 when the conservative Christian Family Research Council was added to the hate list, a gunman walked into the FRC headquarters in D.C. and shot a guard. The gunman who was targeting Family Research Council officials said he wanted to intimidate opponents of gay rights. It's notable the Southern Poverty Law Center has now been deleted from the FBI's list of legitimate sources on hate crimes.

The \"New York Times\" did a deep dive on this subject in a 25-page report that offers context and perspective on the past 40 years of Baltimore's crime problem beginning with the 1980s when crack cocaine came on the drug market and lead to an epidemic of violence. In the late '90s,m that epidemic prompted a zero-tolerance policy on drugs implemented by then Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley. The mayor's policy didn't result in a decrease in the murder rate, but also a dramatic increase in the arrest rate especially of young minority men which led to its own social economic problems. By the mid-2000s, Baltimore appear to find balance by focusing on mostly violent crime which led to a drop in the number of arrest and murders. Then in 2015, state's attorney Marilyn Mosby asked a police commander to target a downtown Baltimore intersection for \"enhanced drug enforcement.\" That led to the arrest of Freddie Gray who was put into a police van where he suffered catastrophic spinal injury. The cause of which is still unknown. Gray's death sparked accusations of racism and police brutality which in turn led to days of violence. Five police officers were charged in connection to Gray's death and the Baltimore police department responded by doing nothing. Here is a resident back in 2015.",

And the complexity of that relationship, we need to have a fundamental conversation about the role we want law enforcement to play in the first place. There is a balance between police officers going in and doing enforcement where enforcement needs to be done and building relationships. You cannot reach out to the community with one hand while you are choking it with the other. That doesn't work and that's where we lose trust. What we see right now is that law enforcement in cities like Baltimore and New York, Chicago are at the forefront of some of society's most challenging issues from alcohol abuse, drug addiction to homelessness and poverty.

I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story.” This information breaking tonight is contained in a fresh -- freshly released transcript of private testimony from Strzok that comes on the heels of admissions from his former lover, FBI attorney Lisa Page. In a closed-door interview with lawmakers, Page revealed the Obama Justice Department ordered her not to prosecute Hillary Clinton over her e-mail scandal. Even though, then-President Barack Obama promised our own Chris Wallace there was quote no political influence in FBI investigations, period. The president said, full stop. Remember that? Well, tonight, we're learning even more new details of just how far the bureau may have gone to try and take his successor, President Trump out. Big lineup of guests to break all this down, including an exclusive interview with Congressman Doug Collins, the lawmaker behind the release of those transcripts. Why he says they reveal a \"two-tiered justice system\". One for Hillary Clinton, one for Donald Trump. Plus former House Oversight Committee chair Trey Gowdy. He says these new revelations are just proof the FBI was \"engaging in election forecasting instead of doing their jobs.\" But, we begin tonight with Congressman Collins.

This is something that these -- releasing these transcripts have provided an insight into what many of us have feared and also talked about for, for going on 40 years now. And when we understand that Hillary Clinton was treated differently, it started with frankly with the President Obama's Department of Justice. We're now seeing insight through Lisa Page's testimony through Peter Strzok's discussion of this that it was the Department of Justice basically saying there is no way Hillary Clinton is going to be charged here because we're not going to use the standard of intent. And the intent is not a part of gross negligence here. So, well, that's what we're seeing. And then, FBI just completely went against protocol when they would interview her with fact witnesses in the room and not give her any other thing. This just shows you there's a sure tier system here."

We've heard so much about that of them essentially a going rogue, as you say, and trying to prevent Donald Trump from being president. And Strzok admitted that he at one point said, \"No, no, no, we'll stop it. We'll basically stop him from being president.\" But then, next part struck me most that he was asked directly under oath. Has Robert Mueller and his team ever come to you to ask you about this insurance policy, and he says, \"No\"? Why hasn't the independent counsel -- the special counsel gotten to the bottom of that?"

That's where the real information came. Listen to that, oh, the insurance policy. I mean, being pressed on that, the most charitable view of what they meant by the insurance policy is they had a source. They had a confidential informant that they didn't want to burn.

      "utterance": "Good to see you, Ed. The SPLC has certainly had a rough few years but the group won't say exactly what led to the firing of co-founder Morris Dees. Instead, the Alabama nonprofit issued a statement saying the conduct of their staff should reflect the group's mission. Quoting here, when one of our own fails to meet those standards no matter his or her role in the organization, we take it seriously and must take the appropriate action. The group also plans to bring in an outside organization to assess its workplace practices and climate. For his part Morris Dees told The Associated Press the matter involved a personnel issue and that he wishes the group luck in the future. SPLC gained notice in the early 80s after suing the KKK on behalf of one of its murder victims leading to three Klansmen firebombing the group's building in 1983. But the organization that claims to target hate has also been accused of engendering hate after adding people like Maajid Nawaz and Ayaan Hirsi Ali to its list of 15 anti-Muslim extremists who critics say are the very people doing the work the SPLC is supposed to be doing. In 2014, SPLC also added Dr. Ben Carson's name to the list for allegedly being anti-gay. The group later removed his name and apologized. In 2012 when the conservative Christian Family Research Council was added to the hate list, a gunman walked into the FRC headquarters in D.C. and shot a guard. The gunman who was targeting Family Research Council officials said he wanted to intimidate opponents of gay rights. It's notable the Southern Poverty Law Center has now been deleted from the FBI's list of legitimate sources on hate crimes. Others call it a big-money smear machine that uses its nonprofit status to mask highly political fundraising. Ed?"

He should be fired for destroying that once credible organization and turning it into a half billion dollar smear factory that will go after anyone to the right of Hillary Clinton. To call -- I mean, forget me. I take it as a badge of honor that they call my anti-racist video hateful. But to call Ben Carson an extremist possibly the most soft-spoken and moderate man in all of America shows you that they have no credibility whatsoever and they may have to pay up because they have a lot of lawsuits that they're facing."

So not only are they arguing their degrees are devalued but they're also arguing that the universities were negligent in failing to uphold what they deemed or what they understood to be this kind of infallible process. I frankly find it at best weak because there's no way that a court is going to see this as some type of compensable damage, right. Short of the university's agreeing to refund application fees, it's simply too competitive even aside from the bribery scheme. Stanford for example, this freshman class accepted four percent, a record- low. 8,000 of the rejected students had perfect GPAs and perfect ACTs. So it's impossible I think for the students to argue that they really had a chance."

There is one representing the rejected students essentially, and there is one representing students that didn't get into Yale but got into Stanford and they argued that their degree was subsequently under valued or devalued. I think that if there is any liability on the part of the universities, it would come and that you should have known argument that you should have known you had this rogue coach letting people in the side door. I think that is a bit attenuated. It's better for the universities to deploy a P.R. campaign rather than negotiate in these lawsuits frankly."

It is a country that provides opportunity to every human being that lives in this country whether you are a U.S. citizen or not.

They bring I think an understanding of what is important for working families all across America. The need for health care for all Americans, and the need to ensure that all Americans earn a livable wage, and the need to ensure that all Americans receive the quality public education. These are what they bring to the table and I think this is what America wants and needs and I think that is why one of these two gentlemen will be on the ticket or both of them in 2020."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good to see you again, Ed. The \"New York Times\" did a deep dive on this subject in a 25-page report that offers context and perspective on the past 40 years of Baltimore's crime problem beginning with the 1980s when crack cocaine came on the drug market and lead to an epidemic of violence. In the late '90s,m that epidemic prompted a zero-tolerance policy on drugs implemented by then Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley. The mayor's policy didn't result in a decrease in the murder rate, but also a dramatic increase in the arrest rate especially of young minority men which led to its own social economic problems. By the mid-2000s, Baltimore appear to find balance by focusing on mostly violent crime which led to a drop in the number of arrest and murders. Then in 2015, state's attorney Marilyn Mosby asked a police commander to target a downtown Baltimore intersection for \"enhanced drug enforcement.\" That led to the arrest of Freddie Gray who was put into a police van where he suffered catastrophic spinal injury. The cause of which is still unknown. Gray's death sparked accusations of racism and police brutality which in turn led to days of violence. Five police officers were charged in connection to Gray's death and the Baltimore police department responded by doing nothing. Here is a resident back in 2015."

      "utterance": "They don't come around. These guys are turning on the corner. They are not being arrested by the police no more. You know, they stand and talk. The police used to running. They are not running them no more. They just drive by."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Because the officers feared that making arrest could lead to their own prosecution. They conducted what was known as the pullback, a month-long retreat from policing even though it was never a declared protest, it was deliberate and extraordinarily impactful. In April 2015, the month after Freddie Gray died, there were 42 homicides, Baltimore's deadliest month in decades -- 2015 ended up being the city's deadliest year on record, 2016 was the second deadliest year until 2017 topped 2016. Last year's murder dropped slightly to 309 but so far this year, homicides are up 13 percent. Alex McGillis, a Baltimore resident who wrote the \"New York Times\" story says for each murder victim, the church he attended started hanging purple ribbons on a long cord. By years end, \"the ribbons crowded for space like shirts on a tenement clothesline.\""

I live in the city still and to see the violence and understand the impact that it has on families and the communities and on all of us who want to see the city move forward in a positive way, it is heartbreaking. What I talk about in my book is the need for communities to feel like they have the opportunity to engage with their police officers and police officers that want to feel supported by their communities. And we are not there yet, and as I travel the country, what we see in Baltimore like the culture of the city is unique. The same issues manifest themselves in cities across the country. We just saw that in Sacramento the other day."

      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And eric obviously no matter what race someone is in your police custody, white, black, any race, any religion, any creed, they should be treated fairly, humanely and we've got to make sure police are doing that. On the other hand, when you don't let police officers do their jobs, there area people warning way back a few years ago right here on Fox about what might happen in Baltimore, listen to this."

    {
      "speaker": "KOWALCZYK",
      "utterance": "What all of that misses is the complexity of the relationship of trust that exists between law enforcement and communities that they serve. If we want to get to a place where the police can go and do what they want to do, look, I know hundreds of police officers that are still serving in Baltimore. I know thousands of police officers across the country. These are good people who want to be able to go and then help communities, but there has to be a relationship of trust. And the complexity of that relationship, we need to have a fundamental conversation about the role we want law enforcement to play in the first place. There is a balance between police officers going in and doing enforcement where enforcement needs to be done and building relationships. You cannot reach out to the community with one hand while you are choking it with the other. That doesn't work and that's where we lose trust. What we see right now is that law enforcement in cities like Baltimore and New York, Chicago are at the forefront of some of society's most challenging issues from alcohol abuse, drug addiction to homelessness and poverty. But they are not given the tools, the time, the resources, the partnerships necessary to address those issues in a fundamental way. This is about trust."

We don't know for sure if this is going to be sustained. We will obviously find that out in the days ahead. And, obviously, the Israelis will respond to this. They don't take any of this lightly. But, it does accentuate the real challenges that exist here. Hamas is a terrorist organization that runs Gaza. It does not recognize the state of Israel.

To do that, drive the United States out and destroy the state of Israel, and they have done fairly well. And they own Lebanon, lock, stock and barrel. They own most of Syria. Clearly the eastern part, where we are, they do not control.
