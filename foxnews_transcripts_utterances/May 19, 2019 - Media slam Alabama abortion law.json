Morley Safer step down until he was 84, Mike Wallace until he was almost 90. The Guardian, the left-leaning British newspaper, is changing its language on environmental issues under the new style guide, global warming is out. Global heating is in. And climate change is being tossed aside as way too mild, it's now climate emergency, climate crisis or climate breakdown. Editor-in-chief Catherine Viner says terms like climate change sound rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is the catastrophe for humanity. I happen to think this is an important issue, but make no mistake, words matter, and the Guardian is mandating loaded language that tilts its coverage in one direction.

I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" It wasn't hard to figure out where MSNBC stands on Alabama's new abortion ban which was has almost no exceptions and was signed into law by Republican Governor Kay Ivey. Nine of its guests in the first 24 hours were current and former officials of such groups as Planned Parenthood and NARAL, and Democratic presidential candidates denouncing the law. Media reports warned of a growing effort in other states to chip away at or overturn Roe v. Wade as even some pro-life advocates expressed concern about the sweeping nature of the Alabama measure."

Are much of the media giving a fair shake to the pro-life side as they feature -- as I mentioned, liberal hosts, Democratic candidates, pro- choice officials, denouncing this Alabama law as barbaric?"

      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "The whole reason I became interested in media criticism was watching how the media covered this topic. As you say, people can have different ideas about whether it's OK to take a human life after it has begun or not OK to do that, but the issue is coverage and there is no question that the media are horrifically biased in favor of the pro-choice side. They don't cover the arguments made by pro-lifers. They react with extreme -- they freak out over a bill like this. You didn't see this freak out when there was a similarly extreme measure from New York that allows children to be left to die if they survive abortion or other extreme measures that are way outside of the mainstream of American thought. And you just point out that all the people that they host from the pro- choice side of things without ever giving a voice to the pro-life side, even though this is a very contentious topic on which the country is fairly evenly divided."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

In fact, here's Pat Robertson on \"The 700 Club.\" PAT ROBERTSON, HOST, \"THE 700 CLUB\": I think Alabama has gone too far. They've passed a law that would give a 99-year prison sentence to people who commit abortion. My humble view is that this is not the case we want to bring to the Supreme Court because I think this one will lose."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, if you're in the media, it is possible to be pro-life and also not like features of this law."

    {
      "speaker": "BEVERLY HALLBERG, PRESIDENT, DISTRICT MEDIA GROUP",
      "utterance": "Even when I talk to elected officials who do identify as pro-life but don't support this actual bill, the reason they tell is because they want to save as many babies as possible, and they worry that the liberals are going to use this as a political tool in upcoming elections to potentially block even certain pieces of legislation that don't go as far as this Alabama bill. So I do think Republicans are in this hard position where personally they're pro-life, but they know some of their constituents -- while may not be as pro-life as they are -- they know that the issue is starting to turn towards a pro-life position. So I understand why some conservatives are a bit fearful of going this far."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

And when we hear about things like the president tweeting about infanticide and the like, I think, my gosh, because they say, oh, in New York you can have a late abortion or remember, the governor of Virginia was accused of talking about what you do post-birth to kill a child was murder but it wasn't --"

But I do agree that we need to be very careful with our language. We need to be careful with just the science -- again, you can think it's OK to end a human life after it's begun or you can oppose it, but just having that scientific understanding that this is what is happening when you have an abortion, you end a human life after it has begun, there's seriousness to that that we are not seeing reflected in media coverage."

      "speaker": "HALLBERG",

When it comes to the media coverage, if you're pro-abortion, you were thought of, well, if you said something about infanticide, you must have misspoke or you're just for a woman and her doctor making a decision. But when you're pro-life, you're automatically assumed that you're anti- woman, and we have seen that rhetoric ratcheted up quite a bit especially in reference to Alabama."

Those bills in Virginia and New York do allow children to be left to die if they survive abortion. That is a real issue and the media have not done a good job covering --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I tell you what I think is the real issue, Mollie. I think that since Kavanaugh and Gorsuch are on the Supreme Court, you see a tremendous political effort by people who are in the anti-abortion movement to say this is our moment and we're going to push this on the media and we're going to force this down the eyes of the Republican Party. And you see Kevin McCarthy and you see other Republicans saying this goes too far."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Some of the Alabama sponsors say, yes, this is the idea, getting this before the Supreme Court to try to overturn or modify Roe, but there's been a lot of speculation about would the court do that, John Roberts wouldn't go for such a sweeping overturning of precedent. But let me turn this to you, Beverly, which is just about every Democrat presidential candidate -- I don't think there is any exception -- have absolutely denounced the Alabama law, similar laws in Missouri and elsewhere. The president of the United States had been pretty silent on it and then tweeted yesterday -- not mentioning Alabama by name -- saying that I am -- I am strongly pro-life except I support exceptions for rape and incest, which Alabama doesn't have, and the life of the mother, same as Ronald Reagan. So even the president is kind of indirectly saying he has a problem with certain provisions here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "He's lining up with the RNC on this who also made those statements. Again, it's figuring out when it's going to be used as a political tool by Democrats in upcoming elections. But we have to keep in mind, one of the reasons why we're seeing so many laws passed is because Republicans won in past elections. So people are more pro-life, they want these pro-life bills so that's something that can't be ignored."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. To be continued. Let me get to the question of the investigations and investigators. So another presidential tweet that made a lot of news, we can just put it up on the screen, talking about the origins of the Russia investigation. \"My campaign for president,\" says Donald Trump, \"was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American politics. A really bad situation. Treason means long jail sentences, and this was treason.\" Mollie, leaving aside the treason, it can also mean the death penalty. Many in the media are saying this is way out of balance for a president to be accusing law enforcement not just of an attempted coup but of the crime of treason."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, President Trump was falsely accused of treason for years because he was accused of being a traitor who had colluded with the Russians to overthrow our system of government and to steal an election. I don't think the media have handled or responded properly enough to the realization that that was a false accusation. Treason is a very serious allegation. It was levied against the president for years falsely. He did not collude with Russia. And now we really do need to understand, how was it that this crazy idea didn't just get into the government but got believed by so many people in the media?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right, but the point here, Beverly, is that if it is true -- actually let me throw this for you, Juan. So people like Jeff Toobin are going on the air and saying this is a grotesque abuse of power but then saying, well, a lot of people are just saying it's just another Trump tweet. Nobody has been charged with this crime of treason, so you can say it, I can say it, politicians can say it, but the president of the United States to be accusing his political opponents of treason is a pretty amazing thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

I don't think Barr cares about the attacks on him. He is not doing this as Representative Adam Schiff said the Trumpification of the DOJ.

Part of it is because I haven't done it and, secondly, you know, there is the X factor. I mean, the main thing here is people asking questions, not me asking questions, and that can take on a life of its own.

And both have tried to raise money off of it, which I find interesting. They're going to run their campaign the way they want. Obviously, we would like all of them to show up here. And, again, this isn't so much me, although I will ask some questions. This is to face the voters of New Hampshire or Iowa or Pennsylvania or wherever the town hall happens to be.

There is just a real, you know, there's an old joke, and the punchline is they end up, a dog food that doesn't work, they say dogs don't like it. Dogs like Pete Buttigieg. They just -- voters are interested in this guy. They think he's interesting, he is smart as the Dickens, he's got a fascinating background, Rhodes scholar, veteran of the Afghanistan war, and he has a lot of interesting things to say. And I, you know, you could argue -- I'm not saying he's going to end up where they did, but it's a little bit like Donald Trump, it's a little bit like Barack Obama. He's different. He breaks the mold. And voters seem to be really intrigued by that at this point."

But what I find is the way in which he speaks very candidly, particularly about personal things, being gay as well as small town mayor and all that just seems to attract so much media attention with 23 Democratic candidates. But on the other hand, isn't he to some degree the beneficiary of a media swoon?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yes. But, you know, again, I would say Obama and Trump were. Trump's was a little more complicated because some of it was the negative, not a supportive swoon, but it was attention. And he played to that. And the fact that in 2016 I think we will all agree that we probably put his rallies on too much when he was one of 17 candidates. But, you know, the problem we were all faced within the media was that viewers wanted to watch him, and if we didn't have him on for a rally and CNN did -- and they did it more than anybody -- guess what? People would tune in, you know, turn us off and tune them on, and it's the news business. So, both of those play in it. I, there's no question that Mayor Pete is interesting, he's different than a lot of the other candidate, he doesn't seem like another politician, and that's to his credit."

    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "I think that's the big difference. Not the Vanity Fair cover. He could have used that to launch a very successful campaign, he just didn't have a lot to follow along with it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, he's got an interesting personal story, but once you've told that a few times he hasn't seen so far have much to say beyond platitudes. We'll see if that changes. Susan Ferrechio, great to see you."
    },

      "utterance": "Thanks so much. Still to come, the king of all media now does lengthy, intimate interviews with celebrities. What happened to Howard Stern?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Howard Stern is out with a bestselling book that chronicles his transformation from raunchy shock jock to a Sirius XM host was long, thoughtful, provocative interviews, the likes of Anderson Cooper, Katie Couric, Conan O'Brien, Paul McCartney, and he's on the circuit promoting Howard Stern comes again which includes his old interviews with Donald Trump, celebrity businessman."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOWARD STERN, RADIO HOST",
      "utterance": "I was quite surprised when they dragged out every single Donald Trump the interview I had done. And in some ways, I felt it was unfair to Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEPHANOPOULOS",
      "utterance": "Do you feel that in some way you helped make him president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STERN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Because Donald would come on my show -- I mean, look --"
    },

      "speaker": "STEPHANOPOULOS",
      "utterance": "Does it make you feel bad or good?"
    },

      "utterance": "Well, look, I did not vote for Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joining us now, Emily Jashinsky, culture editor of The Federalist. And Stern makes no bones about the fact while he loved all the locker room talk and all those interviews with Donald Trump who rated women and did a lot of other things, he was a big Hillary Clinton supporter and wanted to get her on in, and of course, she wouldn't do the show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY JASHINSKY, CULTURE EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "There's an entire chapter in his book called \"Hillary Clinton, The Interview That Never Happened,\" where he makes the case that had Hillary Clinton done his show there could have been, you know, contractors, store owners, truck drivers that heard her in swing states, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania and were really impressed and it might have changed the election. He literally says that. He makes the case in this whole chapter. It's very interesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. He's still stunned, I think, that he became a kind of a factor in the campaign because everybody was going to the archives we're playing. Now here he is with Stephanopoulos on GMA having a little fun at George's expense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STERN",
      "utterance": "Inevitably, Ali will go, George and I have sex every night. I'm like -- and George sits there, George doesn't laugh. I never think of you as a sex thing, but I'm like -- I said did you -- I said can you picture George and Ali every night?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEPHANOPOULOS",
      "utterance": "Completely hijacked, right here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Ali Wentworth is George's wife. Any sympathy for George there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Well, look how uncomfortable he made Stephanopoulos, and that's where like, this book does chronicle a gradual transformation and significant transformation, but that's not to say that the old Howard Stern is totally gone forever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes, sex comes up now and then."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But you know, people who knew only the old Howard Stern from trustable radio would be stunned because, you know, he will spend an hour, an hour and a half with these celebrities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And they have this sort of dinner party conversations and he has of drawing that. For example, I remember listening to Anderson Cooper with Howard, very revealing talk about when he was closeted for all those the years as a television anchor, coming out, how he got out of the teenage modeling business at the age of 13 because a man had propositioned him and stuff, you wouldn't get in a traditional interview."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "No, absolutely not. And partially, the long form helps that, but this book really is a vindication in some ways, in a weird way of all the people for years spent said Howard Stern is needlessly crass, because he kind of agrees with them and said he learned to be, you know, after a health scare, after settling into the Sirius format to be more purposeful, and to spend these long form interviews drawing information out of people like Anderson Cooper. One of the best celebrity interviewers in the business. Hands down. And that's very apparent in this book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm glad you mentioned that. Because he also talks about therapy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And going to therapy like four times a week and how that made him less angry since he was always angry, made everything about himself. And now he has more empathy for other people now. But he also says he's embarrassed by some of his earlier antics when he's constantly fighting with the FCC and you mentioned the (Inaudible). So, was this like a political relaunch, that he wants to think Howard Stern wants people to think of him differently?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "It's a relaunch in a way but it's also just very honest, and people can make up their own minds as to whether he's still needlessly crass, because he's definitely still crass."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "It's just that he sort of, tries to do it with purpose now. And, again, you can make up your own mind as to whether he's accomplishing that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "But it's definitely his goal, and the book is very self- reflective. I mean, pointedly self-reflective. He actually tongue-in-cheek encourages people to burn his first two books in this book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That's right. He's not proud of them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "No."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, for those who haven't heard of these interviews, reading the excerpts might be interesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, if it is a political relaunch or branding, I think it's working."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "At least with you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "It's a great book. I mean, really. His interviews, Conan, great stuff. Its transcript so it's an easy read, I highly recommend it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Put that on the back of the book. Right here. Emily Jashinsky, thanks so much. Great to see you. Coming up, a major retirement on 60 Minutes. And a newspaper using loaded language to dramatize climate change. Stay with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Steve Kroft is retiring tonight as the 60 Minutes correspondent after nearly four decades at CBS, and high stakes interviews like this one back in 1992."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEVE KROFT, CORRESPONDENT, CBS",
      "utterance": "You've said that your marriage has had problems, that you've had difficulties. What do you mean by that? Are you prepared tonight to say that you've never had an extra marital affair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "I'm not prepared tonight to say that any married couple should ever discuss that with anyone but themselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Kroft who I interviewed many times is a workhorse who's done some terrific investigative reporting over the years winning five Peabody Awards, but why is he stepping down when he's just a spry 73? Morley Safer step down until he was 84, Mike Wallace until he was almost 90. The Guardian, the left-leaning British newspaper, is changing its language on environmental issues under the new style guide, global warming is out. Global heating is in. And climate change is being tossed aside as way too mild, it's now climate emergency, climate crisis or climate breakdown. Editor-in-chief Catherine Viner says terms like climate change sound rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is the catastrophe for humanity. I happen to think this is an important issue, but make no mistake, words matter, and the Guardian is mandating loaded language that tilts its coverage in one direction.
