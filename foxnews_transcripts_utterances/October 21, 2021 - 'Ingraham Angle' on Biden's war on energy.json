Victor, documenting these issues really reveals the breadth of the administration's failure in just nine months. The list could have been 20 ways that they're failing.

When Americans pay $100, and they cannot fill up their car; or they look at 2 million people who think they have a birthright to invade their country; or they look at ships all the way to the horizon and their shelves are empty, they're thinking the civilizations collapsing. How could it happen? These are not political issues. And each one of those collapses that you so articulately delineate, there was a political agenda behind it that never - it never pulled 50 percent. Nobody wanted an open border. Nobody wanted critical race theory. Nobody wanted the new Green Deal. But Joe Biden, good old Joe Biden, the virtual president, everybody was of the turmoil of 2020, they thought he was Mr. Nice Guy, and he was the veneer, he was the vessel that carried those unpopular agendas. At least until two or three months ago. But now he's been so incoherent and mean spirited and untruthful that he's actually his person is a force multiplier of the unpopularity of the issues that brought this collapse. And so they're working hand in glove and we're seeing a complete - I've never seen anything like it, a loss of confidence in the system.

And congrats on the success of your book, 'the Dying Citizen'. Joining me now is Larry Kudlow, host of 'Kudlow' on Fox Business, former Trump economic adviser. Larry, wonderful to see you as always tonight. The one outstanding issue that could further hasten America's decline is this so-called reconciliation bill. Apparently, they've whittled it down to $2 trillion. And we're all supposed to be thrilled about that, like $2 trillion is just you know this popcorn they can pop on the stove. No big deal. Does this bill need to die, Larry? Are we in big trouble? LARRY KUDLOW, HOST OF THE \"KUDLOW\": Well, listen, save America killed the bill. I mean, that's still my motto. $2 trillion is unimpressive, because there are all these accounting gimmicks in there. So they're scoring. Child allowances will be for one year, but in fact, it's a trillion dollars over 10 years, and they will do everything they can to continue it for 10 years. There's only two obstacles to this crazy $5 trillion-plus taxing and regulating and spending bill. One is Joe Manchin, who is against this spending, and the other is Kyrsten Sinema, who is against the taxing. The two of them make a lovely couple. They are Washington's most important power couple of the moment. They can stop this bill, the bill needs to be stopped. And I just want to add to that quickly. These attacks on fossil fuels, oil and gas and coal have decimated our energy base. And this is a government- driven policy, where 2 million barrels of oil per day lower than we should be, that would cut the gasoline price in half. And the other thing is, the Bidens were asleep at the switch on this supply side shortages, the containership backup in the LA and Long Beach ports. I mean, they didn't take any action to have it go 24/7. That was a governmental decision. The longshoreman, the unions, the Bidens want to unionize everything. The longshoremen did not want to go 24/7. And with all this talk about infrastructure, there's nothing in there that would get updates on machinery and automation in these ports. And that's also because the longshoremen oppose it. And Americans, consumers do not want to wait. They hate shortages, they hate austerity. They want prosperity. And government central planning is not the answer.",

When Americans pay $100, and they cannot fill up their car; or they look at 2 million people who think they have a birthright to invade their country; or they look at ships all the way to the horizon and their shelves are empty, they're thinking the civilizations collapsing. How could it happen? These are not political issues. And each one of those collapses that you so articulately delineate, there was a political agenda behind it that never - it never pulled 50 percent. Nobody wanted an open border. Nobody wanted critical race theory. Nobody wanted the new Green Deal. But Joe Biden, good old Joe Biden, the virtual president, everybody was of the turmoil of 2020, they thought he was Mr. Nice Guy, and he was the veneer, he was the vessel that carried those unpopular agendas. At least until two or three months ago. But now he's been so incoherent and mean spirited and untruthful that he's actually his person is a force multiplier of the unpopularity of the issues that brought this collapse. And so they're working hand in glove and we're seeing a complete - I've never seen anything like it, a loss of confidence in the system. People are saying every day, I don't know if I'm going to be able to buy gas. I don't know, whether I'm safe to walk out on the street at night. I don't know whether who this person is, he just walked across the border as if he has a right to come into my country. And when you lose the middle class and you turn over your society to the very connected, wealthy and the subsidized poor, and you have no sacred space for the middle class to inculcate traditions and values, and we're starting to look at ourselves and identified by our superficial appearance rather than our common humanity, then this is what you get."

And congrats on the success of your book, 'the Dying Citizen'. Joining me now is Larry Kudlow, host of 'Kudlow' on Fox Business, former Trump economic adviser. Larry, wonderful to see you as always tonight. The one outstanding issue that could further hasten America's decline is this so-called reconciliation bill. Apparently, they've whittled it down to $2 trillion. And we're all supposed to be thrilled about that, like $2 trillion is just you know this popcorn they can pop on the stove. No big deal. Does this bill need to die, Larry? Are we in big trouble? LARRY KUDLOW, HOST OF THE \"KUDLOW\": Well, listen, save America killed the bill. I mean, that's still my motto. $2 trillion is unimpressive, because there are all these accounting gimmicks in there. So they're scoring. Child allowances will be for one year, but in fact, it's a trillion dollars over 10 years, and they will do everything they can to continue it for 10 years. There's only two obstacles to this crazy $5 trillion-plus taxing and regulating and spending bill. One is Joe Manchin, who is against this spending, and the other is Kyrsten Sinema, who is against the taxing. The two of them make a lovely couple. They are Washington's most important power couple of the moment. They can stop this bill, the bill needs to be stopped. And I just want to add to that quickly. These attacks on fossil fuels, oil and gas and coal have decimated our energy base. And this is a government- driven policy, where 2 million barrels of oil per day lower than we should be, that would cut the gasoline price in half. And the other thing is, the Bidens were asleep at the switch on this supply side shortages, the containership backup in the LA and Long Beach ports. I mean, they didn't take any action to have it go 24/7. That was a governmental decision. The longshoreman, the unions, the Bidens want to unionize everything. The longshoremen did not want to go 24/7. And with all this talk about infrastructure, there's nothing in there that would get updates on machinery and automation in these ports. And that's also because the longshoremen oppose it. And Americans, consumers do not want to wait. They hate shortages, they hate austerity. They want prosperity. And government central planning is not the answer."

The second point is the inflation bulge. Whether it's temporary or permanent, it doesn't matter. It is, it exists today. And we're only making it worse by creating this economic scarcity, this environment of scarcity. Those people in the Washington Post who are writing this stuff, hey, listen, only wealthy people have patience. You don't really need all these consumer goods. That is vintage Jimmy Carter. I got to tell you. That is Malays talk. What's really at the root of this is very bad government decisions. And that's why I'm touting Manchin and Sinema, both of them, by the way, should call up Donald Trump and ask to become Republicans, because there's no place in the Democratic Party for sensible moderates anymore, which is a shame.

His partner Michael Sussman was just indicted by John Durham as part of the probe into the Democrats' - Hillary Clinton's false smear about Russia collusion. But this is a guy you need to know, because he's more competent than Michael Avenatti. And his operation has caused - it's just wreaked havoc across the country, and really weakened the credibility and integrity of election laws.

It's not going anywhere. So I know - and I don't like it, and a lot of other people don't like it, but until you take over the state legislatures, you're not changing it. OK? So don't Republicans need to learn how to win under the rules that exist until they get in the state chambers and can change the rules? So we can tell people not to vote?

When there were crimes committed, as there obviously were on January 6th, the executive branch investigates with the DOJ and FBI, as they're doing, and then judiciary determines guilt with all these safeguards. It's not the job of Congress to investigate private citizens to determine whether or not crimes are being committed. But what happened here Laura is that they know the Justice Department is not going to deliver on this narrative that they pedaled for eight months which was that this was an insurrection, these people are traitors, that they engaged in sedition. No one is charged with any of those times, or attempted murder or kidnapping of AOC. So the Congress wants to put on this political show trial, this theater, and in the process they are hauling before Congress private citizens to interrogate them on their political associations and issuing subpoenas that are very invasive to investigate private citizens in their political act. It's a huge transgression of the congressional. That's what we had with the McCarthy hearings when the Supreme Court stepped in and said the Congress can't do that.

It's already a serious crime to incite an insurrection. It's already a serious felony to threaten elected officials or to engage in sedition. They are not trying to consider lawmaking or amending any laws. They just want to drag people into this the spotlight to satiate the sadistic liberal thirst for retribution and punishment and vengeance. It's just a political show trial.

OK, so what is this subjective measure here? It's certainly not objective even if it were permissible."

So we really do have to stand up hard and fight for free speech. And I'm also hoping that we get different social media platforms emerge over the coming months and years, otherwise free speech is literally dead."
