They're going to engage about 2,000 of their alums.

It's why those that are clamoring for a national strategy do not realize what those of us as governors that are in the trenches, that are working every single day. What's best for Kansas today is not necessarily what's best for Mississippi. And in fact, I have got 82 counties in my great state, and what's best in the northeast part of our state where numbers are in a certain spot versus what's best for the Mississippi gulf coast are different. And that's why we are taking a county by county approach. We began this dating all the way back to late June, early July. And we have an objective criteria in place in which if any county has more than 200 cases over a two-week period, or more than 500 cases per 100,000 residents, then we put additional measures in place, more strict measures in place, which may or may not include a mask mandate. It certainly includes having smaller-sized gatherings and other things such as that. And so, again, it's very important that governors have autonomy to do what's best for their constituents. And when you talk about the notion of lockdowns, one of the reasons people are so concerned about that right now is because some of the leading experts that are advising the Biden administration are certainly suggesting that. And so we're going to push back against that as well. I'm glad to hear that there are Republican and Democrat governors across the country that agree that that's not the right approach to take.",

If you'll recall, many of the southeastern conference states, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia had a very, very challenging summer. At that time, we actually had 1,250 hospitalizations at our peak, and that was on July 26th. Today we have approximately 850. So we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 65 to 70 percent of total hospitalizations at our peak. We're very pleased that there are a number of good things that are coming out that are going to help us deal with this virus. The antibody opportunities that exist in terms of the therapeutics is a huge move in the right direction for us. I was talking with a state health officers about that earlier today. It's going to allow us to treat as many as 700 patients in the near term. In addition to that, the vaccine is just around the corner. And so what we all need to be talking about is how do we bridge the gap from where we find ourselves today where we are seeing rises cases in our state and every other state around the nation, how do we bridge that gap from today to when we have more and more distribution of the two vaccines that have literally in the last couple weeks been discussed?",

So my plea to everyone in the southeastern conference and everyone who cares about college football around the country or cares about sports in general is the best way we can ensure that they go forward is by doing our part.

So the thing is ludicrous. Everyone has to lead by example, and they have to take responsibility for the fact that our healthcare system is at the breaking point. And we know from the models and the experts, because they have studied what has happened Memorial Day, July Fourth, Sturgis rally, on and on, what happens when a Trump rally comes to a county -- all these things create more infection.

We are going to talk tonight about regulations, restrictions, other possible ways to deal with the situation we are seeing in the country. Joining us, governors from both parties. Republican Tate Reeves of Mississippi will be with us shortly. First up, we'll talk to Kansas Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. Governor Kelly, thanks for being here.

This time around, we've set the protocols, we've set the standard for across Kansas. But we are giving those counties that previously opted out of the mandate and there were about 70 of 105 counties here in Kansas that did opt-out. We're going to give them a one week to put together their own ordinance, instead of opting into our ordinance. So that they can have a little control, have a little ownership, and make it flexible enough to allow them to do what they think will work in their county. Then, in addition to that --"

I've had conversations with -- my offices had conversations with the Kansas Chamber of Commerce and other business entities. And I think we actually have a lot of support for taking this approach because we are giving some flexibility and autonomy to our local elected officials to put in place what worked for them. Do they need to have a face-covering protocol in place? Absolutely. But we think, and we've seen what we've learned over the last nine months is that one size does not fit all. And so, we want them to develop something that will work for them. But in addition to that, we're going to support them through a very robust public service announcement program that's being put together by our Kansas Hospital Association, the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, the Kansas Farm Bureau, and other groups. That will begin airing next week, just before Thanksgiving. That will encourage people, give them the education they need to understand the importance of the face coverings. So, we're going to do that. And then, we've formed a partnership with our Kansas leadership center, which trains local leaders all across the state on routine basis. They're going to engage about 2,000 of their alums. And we're going to create a virus busting task force that will work all across the state in our local communities, with folks, their neighbors, their friends, to encourage them to follow the face mask protocols, but also to do all of the other things that will mitigate the spread of this virus."

They saw what happened March to May, Kansas dropped, like the nation, some 37 percent as far as businesses and tax revenues coming into your state. You've had in Wichita, I guess, suicides up more than 70 percent, and we're seeing some of that from some of this lockdown fear. But I'm not hearing that in what you're saying as far as how you're going to address it, and you're also waiting, obviously, for a vaccine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KELLY",
      "utterance": "Yes, we are not going that route. We have learned a lot over the nine months of this pandemic, and we took some pretty drastic action at the beginning because we didn't know anything else to do. But now we do know that there are other ways to mitigate the spread of this virus, and we've worked very closely with our business communities from way back at the beginning of this time, we've worked with our school districts, and we're working with just the general public and our healthcare professionals and all of those to put in place things that we know will mitigate the spread of the virus and buy us the time until a vaccine is developed and distributed widely."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. TATE REEVES, (R-MS)",
      "utterance": "Bret, thanks for having me on today. And one of the things that I was glad to hear my colleague say is that one size does not fit all. It's why those that are clamoring for a national strategy do not realize what those of us as governors that are in the trenches, that are working every single day. What's best for Kansas today is not necessarily what's best for Mississippi. And in fact, I have got 82 counties in my great state, and what's best in the northeast part of our state where numbers are in a certain spot versus what's best for the Mississippi gulf coast are different. And that's why we are taking a county by county approach. We began this dating all the way back to late June, early July. And we have an objective criteria in place in which if any county has more than 200 cases over a two-week period, or more than 500 cases per 100,000 residents, then we put additional measures in place, more strict measures in place, which may or may not include a mask mandate. It certainly includes having smaller-sized gatherings and other things such as that. And so, again, it's very important that governors have autonomy to do what's best for their constituents. And when you talk about the notion of lockdowns, one of the reasons people are so concerned about that right now is because some of the leading experts that are advising the Biden administration are certainly suggesting that. And so we're going to push back against that as well. I'm glad to hear that there are Republican and Democrat governors across the country that agree that that's not the right approach to take."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Governor, you're seeing your hospitalization rates go up. You have a test positive rate in Mississippi, according to Johns Hopkins, at 18.8 percent. That's a concerning number, but you're saying you are handling it different in different parts of the state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REEVES",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, the reality is that we have seen a slight uptick in cases. We are nowhere near where we were back during the summer months. If you'll recall, many of the southeastern conference states, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia had a very, very challenging summer. At that time, we actually had 1,250 hospitalizations at our peak, and that was on July 26th. Today we have approximately 850. So we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 65 to 70 percent of total hospitalizations at our peak. We're very pleased that there are a number of good things that are coming out that are going to help us deal with this virus. The antibody opportunities that exist in terms of the therapeutics is a huge move in the right direction for us. I was talking with a state health officers about that earlier today. It's going to allow us to treat as many as 700 patients in the near term. In addition to that, the vaccine is just around the corner. And so what we all need to be talking about is how do we bridge the gap from where we find ourselves today where we are seeing rises cases in our state and every other state around the nation, how do we bridge that gap from today to when we have more and more distribution of the two vaccines that have literally in the last couple weeks been discussed?"

      "speaker": "REEVES",
      "utterance": "We'll, there's not doubt that we've had some challenges over the last several weeks. There's been a large number of games that have been canceled. And the reason for that is because we're seeing significant numbers increase in community transmission. As total numbers increase across our states, then obviously a larger number of those associated with the program, football players, et cetera, are testing positive as well, which is making challenges. So my plea to everyone in the southeastern conference and everyone who cares about college football around the country or cares about sports in general is the best way we can ensure that they go forward is by doing our part. Let's do the little things that make a difference. Let's wear a mask. Let's stay in small groups even over Thanksgiving. Let's be personally responsible. We don't need the government to tell us what to do. We as individuals just need to recognize that we can do some little things to make a big difference."

That is eighth in the world per capita when it comes to deaths of the major countries in the world. That's where we are at this moment a week before Thanksgiving. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Charlie, you heard Governors Kelly and Reeves from Kansas and Mississippi trying to thread the needle here to not hurt small businesses, but also deal with this surge. And it's a real challenge. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  It sure is a real challenge, and I think that in a lot of ways we may be understating just how much this crisis will define politics probably for the next 15 years in this country. And I think that -- quite frankly I think it stands to hurt politicians who are trying to do these lockdowns and do these mandates, because I think that a lot of people feel like we've tried those things and, obviously, the pandemic continues. It continues to spread. And at the end of the day, it's going to be things like the therapeutics, the vaccines, and of course personal responsibility across the board that is going to be what -- Americans are funny. They can have a lot of funny opinions about a lot of different things. But one thing that they really do care about, they like their freedom. And I think that these kinds of mandates, especially when the people that are pushing them are violating their own mandates, I think that sort of thing tends to turn a political environment toxic."

      "utterance": "A.B., the poster boy for that, it appears, this week is the California Governor Gavin Newsom, who was shot, photographed at this dinner at the French Laundry in Napa with a group of people, without a mask, in an area closed down just after giving this big speech about how Thanksgiving had to be locked down and people need to be wearing masks at all times, even with family members, under 10 people. Here is his apology. Take a listen."

      "utterance": "As soon as I sat down at the larger table, I realized it was a little larger group than I had anticipated. And I made a bad mistake. You can quibble about the guidelines, et cetera, et cetera, but the spirit of what I'm preaching all the time was contradicted, and I got to own that. And so I want to apologize to you, because I need to preach and practice, not just preach and not practice."

      "utterance": "Yes, I wonder what the nurses and doctors who have been through this all year in California and have had just been in a state of complete anguish and trauma, if they're still alive and uninfected, think of the governor doing that and then trying to backtrack in that kind of a speech. The problem is there was never going to be a safe scenario in an indoor party at the French Laundry, and even if it wasn't on video, certainly his fancy friends were going to brag that they were at dinner with him at the French Laundry. So the thing is ludicrous. Everyone has to lead by example, and they have to take responsibility for the fact that our healthcare system is at the breaking point. And we know from the models and the experts, because they have studied what has happened Memorial Day, July Fourth, Sturgis rally, on and on, what happens when a Trump rally comes to a county -- all these things create more infection. And we know what will happen to our hospitals at Christmastime if everyone plans to gather, at Thanksgiving. And what the governor of California did is completely hypocritical, and he is not living up to the sacrifice he is asking people to make so that we can have space in the ICU wards of these hospitals for people who are not taking responsibility and are spreading the disease."

      "utterance": "Byron, obviously Operation Warp Speed has been very successful to get us as a country to this point with not only the vaccines and the logistics that is yet to come, but also the therapeutics that are coming today, fast test at home approved by Pfizer. Those are all positive things, but they don't come right away. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  No, it's going to take a while. And there will be a big political fight over the distribution of those that will straddle the end of the Trump administration and the beginning of the Biden administration. I think the real main fact to remember about vaccines is that President Trump promised a vaccine in record time, and there will be vaccines, plural, in record time. But I thought it was really interesting what Governor Kelly and Governor Reeves were telling you. Clearly, they don't believe in any sort of national one size fits all policy. They don't believe even in statewide one size fits all policies. They are making policies county by county in their states, depending on conditions, and there was absolutely zero taste among either one, Republican and Democrat, for lockdowns. They felt like they learned a lot during the lockdown period months ago, and they don't want to do that again even when the virus is a big threat."

They're going to wash their hands. They're going to keep their distance. But I don't think that people are going to be cutting off people from Thanksgiving. I know my family certainly won't be cutting off people from the Thanksgiving table because of this."

The pair eventually lost contact with Winnie left that factory. And after 73 years the two were reunited after bumping into each other at the Manchester, England, care home where they both live. How about that? Elsewhere in England, Harry Wilsden and his wife Doreen were reunited in a care home in Darlington after nearly two months apart. The pair were separated after Harry contracted the coronavirus. Doreen said she could hardly believe her eyes when she saw her husband and that's a good thing. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced and unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.
