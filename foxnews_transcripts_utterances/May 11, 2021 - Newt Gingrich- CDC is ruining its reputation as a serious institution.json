It's so revealing. The DC bureaucracy, you hang out in DC for five minutes, you'll realize no one's going back to work. They've been paid for more than a year.

Workers at grocery stores, they're working; liquor stores, they're working; big box stores, they're working. And apparently, they're essential but hundreds of thousands of government workers in Washington DC are not. OK. I say, good.

Incompetence and radicalism are a dangerous combination. And those are his two defining traits right now. Just as more of America is starting to open up, his reckless policies risk shutting us down.

Compare that to last April under President Trump, there were only 17,000. That's an increase. Even with COVID, this is shocking of 944 percent. But not to worry, it's not a crisis. Remember, when Biden by the way, did on one occasion, I think at one occasion he called it a crisis. While the White House freaked out, they quickly walked that all back. So untold numbers of these migrants are infected with COVID, some have violent criminal records, the majority are just pouring in for free school, free health care, food stamps, free housing, and Biden seems to be totally fine with allowing this to continue as long as possible.

The old Jimmy Carter years. Last night we spelled out all the similarities, a deteriorating situation with Iran, terrorists emboldened and the growing threat of stagflation. There's even a refugee crisis. Remember, the Mariel boatlift. The only thing missing is Biden in a red cardigan sweater by the fireplace. But at least Americans can rest assure that Joe has the best interests of his own citizens at heart, or not. \"Politico\" reporting today that \"DHS' intelligence arm is setting up a dedicated team to focus on domestic terrorism. Its leaders also plan to work with the tech industry and outside academics to assess which online narratives may be most likely to incite violence\". So, DHS is using Big Tech to target Trump supporters. That's happening, but they failed to thwart a cyber attack on the colonial pipeline. Those are their priorities. By the way an attack that is four states to declare states of emergency, four states so far. But Biden's brilliant Energy Secretary says, \"Don't worry\", again, no crisis here. Just use a few synonyms and think positively, people."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Are you reassured? When Americans ignore what people like Granholm say, it's due to the administration's just refusal to speak the truth on all other crises out there, like their shameless attempt to take credit for vaccines and good economic news when it was all due to Trump's Operation Warp Speed, and the red state led push to reopen America. Of course, their refusal to admit that extended unemployment benefits are killing, hiring and stalling economic growth, their refusal to admit that their experts at the CDC were wrong about closing schools, were wrong about masks, were wrong about closing down in general. And of course, they were wrong about the benefits of vitamin D3, Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine and other drugs. And let's not forget their refusal to admit that the trillions in government spending that the Biden team are trying to ram through Congress is totally unnecessary and irresponsible. Even Larry Summers said it was unnecessary. How's that? And another issue that's gotten precious little attention. Biden's refusal to call all government workers back to the office. It's so revealing. The DC bureaucracy, you hang out in DC for five minutes, you'll realize no one's going back to work. They've been paid for more than a year. And most employees are just sitting at home supposedly working more efficiently. If you believe, what? Taking online yoga, macrame, planting an organic vegetable garden is work? Workers at grocery stores, they're working; liquor stores, they're working; big box stores, they're working. And apparently, they're essential but hundreds of thousands of government workers in Washington DC are not. OK. I say, good. Because when Republicans take the house next year, they should move to slash the federal payroll accordingly. They're not essential. And they should have cut the federal workforce when they had the chance, when they were in power, they didn't. But I'm telling you my friends, Biden cannot, \"Aw shucks, my granddad used to say himself out of this dire situation that his team has gotten us into\". Incompetence and radicalism are a dangerous combination. And those are his two defining traits right now. Just as more of America is starting to open up, his reckless policies risk shutting us down. Trump warned America that sleepy Joe was out of gas. And now millions of Americans may soon be as well. And that's THE ANGLE. Here to react Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House and a Fox News contributor. I think it's obvious that Biden's numbers, Newt, are artificially propped up as a result of the checks that are flooding America. When did the chickens come home to roost on his approval numbers if this continues?"

So you're really getting very phony polls that make Biden look much stronger than he is. I agree with you. I thought what you said earlier was really important. I remember, I was in Georgia and I taught it was Georgia College. I knew Jimmy Carter as governor. I ran for congress while he was president. There are weirdly similar patterns here. Now, you see the economy beginning to stumble a little bit with the jobs numbers coming in about 800,000 below what they thought, you see the beginning of real inflation, you see it compounded by just plain incompetence. I mean, it should bother every American that our largest pipeline to the east, 43 percent of all oil and gas for the eastern United States could be hammered by some private sector criminal gang and we have no idea who they are, where they are, how to get them, how to make it too expensive for some other gang to do it. These things all are compounding. And I think that another couple of months, you're going to see a real sense of dismay that --.

I don't know if they're coming back to work. I don't know when DC is ever going to recover, even if they open it up because they've been shamed into doing it? So they're not even working. And yet, and yet they kind of glibly say, \"Oh, well, it's not really a gas shortage. It's not like the toilet paper. Don't hoard it\".

And as soon as we get a chance to take control, those people ought to, frankly, be replaced. If we don't need them, don't pay them, which by the way, if you applied it to the teachers unions, would decimate, their dues paying memberships. Second, I think for the entire political class, this has been a devastating year. I mean, who's going to believe Governor Cuomo, who's going to believe the Governor of Michigan, who's going to believe Fauci who has said 780 positions in the last year. I think the CDC is ruining his reputation as a serious institution. So - and of course, Joe Biden basically is Humpty Dumpty. He believes that he can control words, he can define words, and as Humpty Dumpty says, Alice in Wonderland, it's all a question of who is in charge. You or the word? So you look at that, and then you have his press secretary. Imagine her job. I mean, can you imagine trying to go in and clean up every morning?"

And it's not a crisis and no one's going to ask. I mean, it's pretty easy job actually, when you think about it. Newt, we got to roll. Thank you so much. Great to see you tonight. We're already seeing the Biden malaise hit the economy. Millions of Americans are being enticed to remain jobless. So they qualify for these enhanced welfare benefits. It's hindering their recovery. For instance, the Iowa Restaurant Association says, 75 percent of their members list finding workers as the top problem they're facing. Iowa has 6000 more jobs available than people unemployed. That's why Governor Kim Reynolds announced today that she's putting an end to the Biden unemployment bonanza. We had such a huge reaction to her joining our town hall a few weeks back in Florida.

Our kids are in school, our daycares are open, and our economy is recovering. In fact, we have the second highest recovery in the country. We have jobs available. Our unemployment rate is 3.7 percent. We have vaccines available for anyone that wants them and Iowans are living their life. And this is discouraging people from going back to work. Workforce is our biggest barrier to economic growth in the state of Iowa. And as I travel the state, I go to all 99 counties time after time, from small, medium to large companies. They were crying for workforce. They'd seen some of the best years that they'd had in a long time and workforce was preventing them from continuing to grow at the capacity that I believe we can. And so it was a disincentive. We can't pay people to stay home. We need to be encouraging. These opportunities for Iowans and really do what we can to continue the growth that we're seeing in the state of Iowa."

And so that's why I think you see, especially governors in red states leading and moving and doing what we can to make sure that we're cutting taxes, we're growing our economy, we're investing in infrastructure like broadband and housing, and daycare.

And it's - we continue to see bad policies and inaction coming out of this administration and it's continuing to have an impact. We're lucky in Iowa, our economy is growing.

And the research that they conducted would be described, I think, by most reasonable scientists, as gain of function research, which is what it sounds like manipulating viruses or other organisms to change their makeup to make them say more transmissible, or more lethal. And, Laura, isn't it an amazing coincidence that this once in a century pandemic originated in a major metropolitan area like Wuhan, just a few hundred yards away from those laboratories, in the whole big country of China, a country the size of the United States, didn't come from some rural village up in the mountains near bad caves, but it came from a city larger than New York City, which just happened to have these laboratories that Tony Fauci 's agency was indirectly funding."

Why didn't the two agencies therefore halt the federal funding? Someone wrote a loophole into the moratorium, Dr. Anthony Fauci or Dr. Francis Collins, or maybe both, would have invoked the footnote in order to keep the money flowing.\" Senator, this is serious.

But he is also wrong today to say that the NHS never directly or even indirectly funded. This kind of research that reports you mentioned by Nicholas Wade is a blockbuster. I'd recommend to all of your audience to read it. Tony Fauci and his agency need to provide answers to the American people about what role they may have played in funding research in these laboratories. Now, perhaps it wasn't directly into what ultimately resulted in this worldwide pandemic. But why in the first place would American tax dollars be going to a Chinese communist lab that was conducting some of the world's most dangerous kinds of research in a laboratory that we know and that we knew three or four years ago, had very low, sloppy safety practices. It was extremely reckless. Tony Fauci may be a good scientist, but doesn't seem to know much about constitutional self government.

They are not learning how to read and write and be competitive in the world. And so it's really a way to the take down America. It is Critical Race Theory that is rooted in Marxism. It is not about helping the students to thrive no matter what their race. And it really harms Americans, all Americans."

      "speaker": "REP. JIM JORDAN, (R-OH) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RANKING MEMBER",
      "utterance": "You can't have the Republican Conference chair reciting Democrat talking points, especially when gas prices are up 50 percent, there's a crisis on the border, and Democrats are trying to federalize election laws. That is not helpful. That is the concern. And that's why three month ago, there were a number of us who wanted to make a change. That change in fact will happen tomorrow, Laura. And I think that's a good thing for our party. You want our party spokesperson to be in tune with more than a single digit percentage of the party. Ninety-some percent of the party disagree with Congresswoman Cheney. There needs to be a change. And again, I think that is going to happen tomorrow, and I think it will be a strong vote."

      "utterance": "How is anything she is saying different from any garden-variety leftwing pundit on MSNBC? They are literally citing her every morning on MSNBC and talking about her plight and how courageous she is. If Republicans are getting praised by that crowd, isn't that kind of an obvious -- that is not the present you want leading the party?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "No, and this is not new. This happened on January 13th when the Democrats went with their impeachment. I was the guy charged with managing our time on the Republican side, and all we heard was Steny Hoyer and other Democrats reciting statements that Congresswoman Cheney had made. But it goes back even further. How about at the Russian bounty story last summer, which we all knew it was bogus? But what did Liz do? She tweeted out against the president that very day. Why not just pick up the phone, call the White House and ask them, is there any truth to this story? They would have been glad to tell her, happy to tell her that there was nothing to it. And we now know there was nothing to it. So this has been a pattern, and I think, frankly now, there's just enough of our conference who have said we've got to make a change, and it is going to happen tomorrow morning."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Again, we tried to warn them, and they did not listen. One of your colleagues is pushing back against the possibility of Congresswoman Stefanik taking on Cheney's role. Congressman Chip Roy writing \"Let us contemplate the message Republican leadership is about to send by rushing to coronate a spokesperson whose voting record embodies much of what led to the 2018 blank kicking we Republican by the Democrats,\" indicating that she is more of a moderate, and not an American first conservative. Is his concern legitimate, Congressman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Look, Elise Stefanik is a good communicator. You saw her in action during the first impeachment and how she handled that, I thought very well. She has been endorsed by President Trump. She is supported by the minority leader. She is supported by Whip Scalise. She has an A-plus by the NRA, she was endorsed by the Susan B. Anthony List. I think that is pretty good. But the main focus here is can you communicate the consistent Republican message that our party believes in? That's the qualifications for this job. I think tomorrow we are going to make a change. Liz Cheney won't be there. I think sometime later in this week, Miss Stefanik will win that position. I think that's how it's going to play out, and I think overall that is a very good thing for our party."

Some of the factors that have doomed Labour in the last elections, such as the rise of the cultural ultraleftism could equally affect the Democrats in the United States and lead to their decline. Joining me now, Nigel Farage, former U.K. Brexit party leader. Nigel, do you see parallels here with what has happened to the Labour Party?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NIGEL FARAGE, FORMER U.K. BREXIT PARTY LEADER",
      "utterance": "Enormous parallels. The big thing that really has driven voters away from Labour has been just a complete open border, mass numbers of people coming into Britain illegally and legally. And of course, the champagne socialists in London don't think it matters. For them, it is cheaper nannies and cheaper chauffeurs. But out there in the working class communities, in the old industrial heartlands, they saw big changes to their lives. And that parallel, when you add to that, when you add to that the fact that Labour now want to take the knee to Marxist organizations like Black Lives Matter who are happy to see British history denounced, these people don't want to vote Labour. They came to me in their millions during Brexit. They are now voting conservative. They won't go back. And just look at the southern border in this country. You have got similar type of crisis here. I'm quite sure that the AOCs of this world don't think it really matters. But out there in working-class communities in America, it does matter. It is a huge opportunity for 2022."
