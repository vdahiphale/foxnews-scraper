He signed a $750 million contract with Abbott in August. The test, the Abbott wasn't approved until December.

It seems like they are always a step behind when it comes to Afghanistan, when it comes to inflation, when it comes to crime, they are reacting instead of being proactive as the 45th president was. And look, it's obvious even to the president's dwindling supporters, he and his team, and that includes Dr. Fauci because he is the leader of the coronavirus task force now, they have failed craptastically (Ph) on testing. They had years head start -- as you mentioned, they were warned of a winter surge, instead they are focusing on the other Joe, Joe Manchin, and Build Back Better instead because, you know, priorities. And look, Omicron caught the adults in charge here way off guard, and now we see those images on our phones and our TV screens of president and first lady, they're wearing a mask and at least the president was at some point, playing with his dog, they are not within 200 feet of anyone else. They're on a beach. They're on a vacation. Then you juxtapose that with the lines we are seeing stretching for miles in some situations -- and no hyperbole here by the way -- this is Biden's Katrina moment. He is absentee president.

They're still going to be front and center on our screens and home tests are not going to be in the hands of Americans and that's when anger and frustration is going to grow. There is no Jen Psaki bomb or Ron Klain tweet that's going to fix this. And independents and sober Democrats, Kayleigh, they are going to turn on this president to the point he likely won't run for a second term as the bottom drops out, not just on this issue, but on inflation, but on crime, gas prices, and so on."

This is an outbreak. And then on the other side say, but you know what, in a couple of weeks, maybe a month, you will be able to take test. You can't stand on one side and have Dr. Fauci, which really, what bothers me most about that sound bite. I don't need Dr. Fauci to concern himself with how society is functioning. In other words, I don't need him to make decisions based on what politicians, what an elected leader should be making a decision on. He is a bureaucrat. His job is to advise the leader of this country, and I don't know if anyone sits at home watches President Biden address the country and then listens to, you know, Dr. Fauci and the leader of the CDC and say OK, who is actually making the decisions here? We know who is making decisions here. What was fantastic about President Trump is I never once believed the buck didn't stop with him. As a matter of fact, Democrats would make fun of him firing people that they didn't think you should fire, you know, so often, but it's because he took advice, made the decision, and stuck with it, and that's what leaders do even when they are wrong.

I mean, you tell me, we talk about images and optics last segment, let's talk about it again. We have not seen the president flanked by police officers saying this must stop and I'm going to do everything in my power to help those mayors and those governors with that. Instead, we got the White House press secretary Jen Psaki, she actually argued once that, actually Republicans are the ones who wants to defund the police at one time at band camp. It's like, no, they don't want to defund the police. That's ridiculous.

He is abdicated leadership on this issue. It took him until summer of this year to even speak out against violent crime. And you are exactly right, Joey. There will be a big price to pay in the midterms.

But if you go to my house, literally every plug has a plastic cap in it because I have a 2-year-old and my biggest fear is her trying to put something in that plug as we know 2-year-olds eagerly tried to do, including my daughter. So, the thought that they could listen to TikTok and be instructed to do this -- TikTok, by the way, owned by bite dance, by the way, which is a China-based company. One last point, this China artificial prosecutor, 97 percent accuracy, maybe they should look at, oh, I don't know, China who's committing genocide against an entire people group, the Uyghurs. Just a thought."

And is this where we're headed with artificial intelligence prosecutors because we're using self- checkout even though many of us technophobes like me often cry for human help?"

But if you look around the country as some of the DAs we elect and how corrupt some of our local judicial systems are, I mean, maybe it would be a step in the -- in the direction of justice. All I can think about is the -- I think it's the Tom Cruise movie, it's the Minority Report where they start arresting people before they commit a crime, which is kind of like what we see with some of the purge in the military, that you were you were friends with somebody, we think you might become a radical, so let's go ahead and kick you out. I'm afraid that we're kind of heading in that direction in this country already."

      "utterance": "That's an excellent point. But I think we're so reliant on the more the more that we're just going to embrace this technology even if we're scared that eventually robots will take over the world. You look at polls, and something like 70 percent of Americans think that robots will take over. But I have to disagree with you and Kayleigh on the whole Alexa thing. I literally just told my kid today, I swear to God, that if you have trouble spelling a word when you're doing your spelling homework, ask Alexa and she'll tell you how to spell it. So, I think it could be a good thing sometimes perhaps."

I mean, if I were to be running around telling kids to put pennies in sockets, I don't think it'd be good enough for me to just say, oh, my bad, I won't do that anymore. There would be -- you know, I'd go to prison or at the very least there'd be an investigation. So, that's the question here. When these things mess up, who's responsible for that?"

A woman is suffering a beach photoshoot fail after a wave smashed into her while striking a pose. She then slipped again on mossy rocks. Ouch. All right, so, you know, Joe Concha, you are very famous for always wanting to get very good photos of yourself. So, do you have any tips or tricks for this woman as someone who does a lot of beach photo shoots?"

      "utterance": "-- on the jetty. Yes, it does. And this was the biggest fear, you know. And the problem is now this is the one thing she's going to remember about this day. So, look, the trick is to stand in front of the jetty. The photo can still get the ocean in the background. You don't have to be on it. And you avoid situations like this where you're being talked about in front of three million people on the most popular show on cable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Well, Leslie, I in general hate having my photo taken because it's just the camera on your face. Like, you got to look attractive and you have to look so attractive that you want to remember it forever. And I can't handle the pressure. So, I don't know how you feel about it but this would never be me."

      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Have you read my Twitter feed? What do you mean the camera adds weight, fatty? I mean, and you are skinny girls, so don't even talk to me. Don't -- I don't enjoy having my picture taken. I have my own inner critic that I need to silence when it comes to everything I do including my appearance. But just one quick thing on this I can give you. One of my best friends had in New York a gallery showing of her photography, a side job, she's a film producer here in LA, of people taking selfies and getting her even dying. This is a problem worldwide. We need to be more careful and not just worry about getting that perfect photo."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean listen, Johnny Joey Jones, look, I don't -- I don't think you're the biggest selfie guy. But have you ever been involved in a situation where you're with someone who is obsessed with getting the perfect selfie? How many photos do you take before you say I'm done here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Listen, here's the deal with pictures. They cause you to not remember the moment. Anytime someone asked me to take a picture for them, I give them one. I give him one picture and hand it back to them. That's it. Listen, you had a moment --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "I don't care. Listen, it's not about the picture. The picture is to remind you of the memory, not to post on social media and brag about what you did, with one exception. I'll take some time for a hunting picture because that -- you know, that's kind of my thing. But outside of that, I - - and when I say hunting picture, like, the landscape, the beautiful thing I'm getting to see while I'm out enjoying the world, the country that -- where we live, what God made for us. There's a giant social media -- there's a giant window to see the world. It's called your eyes. Go out and do it."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes, but Kayleigh, sometimes you don't -- you know, have you ever been like in bad look and real ugly and you see a picture of yourself and you're like, I look nothing like that right now. But it helps you to remember that you are capable of looking that hot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Yes. OK, so my husband loves taking photos of me at the most awkward times, like when I'm sleeping with my mouth open, or like I forgot to take off my makeup or I passed out on the couch. It's sick when you look through his phone, Kat. I'll show you next time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I would love to see it. All right, next up, who are you talking to? A new study finds that over half of adults admit they have conversations with inanimate objects while 60 percent say they have two-way conversations with their pets. Another 44 percent say they talk to their house plants. So, you know, Leslie, congratulations to all those people on keeping plants alive, which I have been unable to do thus far."

But I do talk to myself at stores and I tell people, I'm not crazy, I'm just doing my mental checklist out loud."

    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes, Joey, like I have full-on conversations with my cat. But at least talking to your animal, I think that number is a little bit low. What kind of person doesn't talk to their animal? What do you do, you just sit there and stare and breathe at each other? That seems sociopathic and strange to me."

      "utterance": "-- so there -- you know, crap rolls downhill, there's somebody you can gripe at they can't drive back at you. That's the whole point. My papa used to say it's OK to talk to yourself, you just can't answer yourself. And so, I've always abided by that rule. I tell myself, hey man, you need to do better. But I never -- I never chirp back at me so I'm OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the problem. You should be telling yourself then how to do better. That's how you improve. Joe, you have conversations with yourself, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "Absitively, and my dog as well like everybody else. I talked my dog constantly. He's a good listener, non-judgmental. He's my Dr. Melfi, all right. I can get everything out and feel better about. It's like talking to a priest but different."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",

You won't want to miss it. It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" And I want to thank all of you for purchasing my book For Such A Time As This: My Faith Journey Through The White House And Beyond. You made it a liberal New York Times bestseller. I'm just joking. It is not liberal. But pick up your copy wherever books are sold.

They have a program called Santa's Boots where they custom shop for 100 military families every year. And this year, one of the families here, Army widow, Gold Star widow Tara McLaughlin has three children ages two, five, and four. And they were able to deliver packages to them. And these are toys that those kids asked for. And I'll tell you, this is just one story out of 100 this year. The program is on 500 families in 29 states over the last handful years. And if you're looking for somewhere to buy toys other than maybe for your own school kids, check out bootcampaign.org. This is a great program."

So, she insists that it's all-natural. She says it's all-natural, not fake. But I know that's not true because a few Christmases ago, we put my hair extensions on my brother's dog. So, we have a photo of that. Yes, there's Rigby Timpf, my brother's dog wearing my hair extensions. It looks exactly the same. She's lying. I know what fake hair looks like on a dog."
