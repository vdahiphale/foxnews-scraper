So if you look at what's been happening in the news the last couple of days, you see a lot of people in the media, people who are politicians, people who used to be in the government, who perpetuated this false story that Donald Trump was a traitor.

Who was involved in this? Just today, \"The New York Times\" reveals that there were multiple overseas intelligence assets run against the campaign, and there's an interesting story that needs to be looked through, but it looks like this was part of a much larger operation then we have thus far been told. We're going to have to find out a lot more. Attorney General Barr said he wanted to get to the end of the Russia investigation, let that go through unimpeded. But he also wants to know just what was happening over at the Department of Justice and FBI.

On the other hand, you have the Democrats wanting to reinvestigate the Mueller report and stage hearings on it, and I think the reason you are seeing so much emphasis on trying to get the White House Counsel in front of cameras in the House is because Democrats in the House want to make this a television show. They don't think the American people is going to get into the weeds of a 448-page carefully written report. They want drama, and they want pictures.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think that clip that you aired just before this last one where he talks about investigating how this whole conspiracy theory began. So if you look at what's been happening in the news the last couple of days, you see a lot of people in the media, people who are politicians, people who used to be in the government, who perpetuated this false story that Donald Trump was a traitor. It's worth remembering, treason is a crime punishable by death. It turns out he was falsely accused of this, and we still don't understand how was it that he came to be falsely accused? Who was involved in this? Just today, \"The New York Times\" reveals that there were multiple overseas intelligence assets run against the campaign, and there's an interesting story that needs to be looked through, but it looks like this was part of a much larger operation then we have thus far been told. We're going to have to find out a lot more. Attorney General Barr said he wanted to get to the end of the Russia investigation, let that go through unimpeded. But he also wants to know just what was happening over at the Department of Justice and FBI. And so hopefully we will start to get some answers there. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": You do have this real division between the parties on this, on Capitol Hill, because you have the Republicans wanting to do exactly that investigation, and the attorney general yesterday dropped a big hint that he thinks there might have been more surveillance going on of the Trump campaign that we knew about. On the other hand, you have the Democrats wanting to reinvestigate the Mueller report and stage hearings on it, and I think the reason you are seeing so much emphasis on trying to get the White House Counsel in front of cameras in the House is because Democrats in the House want to make this a television show. They don't think the American people is going to get into the weeds of a 448-page carefully written report. They want drama, and they want pictures. And so that's why you are seeing this push to get Don McGahn."

      "utterance": "I think the president just laid out a pretty clear marker that he is not going to allow. We saw earlier today also in Emmet Flood's letter to the attorney general, responding to the Mueller report, essentially arguing that the president is not going to cooperate in this investigation any further, certainly when it comes to Congressional matters, that the special counsel's cooperation that the president gave documents, allowed his people to testify, interview with the Special Counsel, that was a one- time deal, one-time offer. That is not going to be the case with these Congressional investigations. That is going to set up quite a legal showdown and certainly a political showdown. Both parties seem to want to continue this fight, and so it will be interesting to see how that plays out going forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I think that is a key point, that the Republicans definitely now in a new way that you haven't seen previously, definitely want to continue to fight. They patiently waited, they said they were promised that there was treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the election. The end of that report came out, no one was indicted for collusion with Russia, no indictments for obstruction. And I think part of what you are saying on the Hill where people want to have all these hearings, is not just that they are frustrated that everything ended, they promised their constituency that not only was there treason, that they would be able to oust the president, and this report came out as a dud. At the same time, the people who were involved with it might be held accountable, and I think they are trying to avoid having those people held accountable."

Yesterday in front of the Senate, Barr gave a very plausible explanation for his testimony on this issue that Nancy Pelosi said he is lying about. But the House controls itself.

And Maduro is horribly oppressive to his people. It's offensive to see him talk about what a civil war would bring to his people when he is starving those people himself through his mismanagement of the government. It is also true that when the U.S. considers when to get involved in another region, if they are doing it for humanitarian concerns, invasion is not always a way to maximize humanitarian concerns. It can lead to greater death and it can lead to prolonged unrest. So I think we should be careful and monitor. There's a great coalition of people throughout the hemisphere who are caring about a peaceful transition, encouraging it and incentivizing it without a military conflict."

      "utterance": "Of course, we saw President Trump, who is not shy, didn't really want to get into red lines on the situation of Venezuela."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I think that was probably wise, too. We saw some previous administrations issue red lines and then fail to keep them, and you want to make sure that your word is solid, which is why I think that they should be careful about what they are promising might happen there and thinking through an array of options."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "It is really important to note that so far the diplomatic effort in Venezuela is really one of the president's great successes in terms of marshalling regional and international pressure on Maduro's government in terms of the recognition of Juan Guaido opposition leadership, the work in the Organization of American States. That has been unsung here, and really regardless of what happens, is it an interesting internationalist approached by this president that we have not really seen him bring to many conflicts before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "So you can count on Secretary of State Pompeo keeping up the pressure on Maduro and the regime and basically trying to marshal our allies in the region?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "That certainly seems to be the case. The question is, will that be enough?"

      "utterance": "All right, panel, thanks very much. When we come back, desperate prayers answered."

      "utterance": "Finally tonight, a godsend. Two Florida teaens were celebrating a senior skip day, but a swim at the ocean turned into a fight for their lives. Tyler Smith and Heather Brown ended up two miles from shore. Weak and tired, they started praying to god and crying out for help. They were stranded for two hours before a boat named \"The Amen\" came to their rescue."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "I cried out, was like, if you really do have a plan for us, just come on, just bring something. No other reason or explanation in the world that that wasn't God."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Amen. That is “Special Report” for tonight. I am Mike Emanuel in Washington.
