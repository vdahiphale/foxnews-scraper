Growing outrage over a liberal bail reform policies in the wake of the horrific Christmas parade rampage in Wisconsin. At any moment, the suspect, Darrell Brooks, will be making his first court appearance and it is not his first run-in with the law by any means. Local prosecutors under fire after it was revealed the career criminal was freed on bond not once but twice just this year. That's despite having an active warrant in Nevada for a sex crime. While many are furious and wondering how could this happen, members of the squad, well, they are doubling down on criminal justice reforms. AOC criticizing excessive bail in New York City. And Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib being confronted over a plan to release everyone from federal prison.",

You know, the white people are the enemy, that kind of crazy stuff. Also, wacky conspiracy theories about Jews and Hitler. The guy is a lunatic, #BLM all over the place. He wasn't happy with the Rittenhouse verdict, so you take that. And then you take the fact that he has an open sex offender warrant out in Nevada because he was pimping out a 15-year- old, got her pregnant. And he's got a slew of felony charges, felonious assault, gun charges, drug charges, and he just revolving doors out of there because you have a stupid D.A. there that's trying to reduce the prison population and rehabilitate everybody, restorative justice, as that kind of ridiculous mind-set. And then goes to mows down about 50 people, five dead. You know, they're putting people back together literally at the hospital right now. And Joe Biden's asked about it and he says, you know what, I don't want to say too much, still waiting for some of the facts and the details to come out. Okay. Well, Rittenhouse after that happened two days later slandered the guy as a white supremacist when there was video showing he was acting in self- defense. Now, this guy in Wisconsin was not acting in self-defense. The video clearly shows he is mowing people down and he's being charged with intentional homicide, but Joe Biden is holding his tongue, okay. And the media is basically memory hold the story already, I wonder why. We all know why. It doesn't need to be said. And what we heard yesterday was total garbage that he was fleeing a knife fight. Now, who drives through a parade to flee a knife fight? Doesn't make any sense. What? Are people throwing knives at his car? It makes no sense. And there was no pursuit because you see the guy on the door dash camera, the guy is having a sandwich while police are trying to find -- he's having a sandwich. He's not fleeing a knife fight. Get out of here! So everybody knows what's going on. It's horrible and, you know, the media is just going to pigeonhole it and we're going to have to pick up the pieces.",

He is amazing at what he does, and he gets people clearly to talk about things that they didn't intend on talking about the certain aspects of the bills or the policies that they support. There has to be a very serious conversation about who should get bail reform applied to them and what kind of offenders should not be able to have this. Absolutely with this one it raises a larger question about, you know, we treat people over assaulted women, obviously, the 15-year-old sex trafficking charge and getting her pregnant. That is something where this person, you know, a $1,000 bail is not enough for them. And I think Kyle Rittenhouse had a $2 million bail. Now, I'm not saying that Kyle Rittenhouse shouldn't have had a high bail, I believe that he should have, but the disparity is something for us to take note of.

You guys pretty much covered it. I like to add a couple of things. The thing that I find most scary is, I believe Democrats and Republicans were run over by this guy. I don't believe they really had a party preference. And I think that one thing is pretty universal as you heard James Carville speak up and other Democrats say the stupidest thing they ever heard was defund the police. And we're seeing now is the tone deafness of these Democrats saying let's start with this bail reform, no cash bail along with defund the police. We are seeing the one -- this is one story. The looting in San Francisco coming up later. The Rittenhouse story coming up next. And this story is all the same thing, defaming, defanging, and defunding the police is all about the lack of law and order in all three places. Please tell me how that benefits the American citizen, the American family. They are alienating the American people. You're not helping Democrats. And I just find it so hard to believe that President Biden seems to be listening to the squad and the left wing not the middle of his party. How could he be this tone deaf? I understand was to sign them, but I never thought they'd be driving the administration. That's the scary thing for the country. Forget about the party in the next election.",

He didn't want to be having a lot of the conversations that pundits have been having about his intentions and he really wanted to make a larger point about what he saw his case as which was a self-defense case. And I thought that made a big impact on people and he had one line that I thought was particularly important. You know, he said I'm a supporter of the Black Lives Matter Movement. We don't know about that photo with the Proud Boys. Maybe it was just two guys walked up to him and said take a picture with me. Maybe it was more than that. But he said something like think about what would have happened if I was a black person in this position who had done this. How would my trial have gone differently? And to acknowledge that, that's so core to people who support the Black Lives Matter Movement that they acknowledge that. And the fact that he brought that forward, it wasn't an extension -- it wasn't what Tucker asked him.

It's the same thing with the eviction moratorium. That wasn't working out. The money wasn't going out the door so then they had to like figure out other policy.

At any moment, the suspect, Darrell Brooks, will be making his first court appearance and it is not his first run-in with the law by any means. Local prosecutors under fire after it was revealed the career criminal was freed on bond not once but twice just this year. That's despite having an active warrant in Nevada for a sex crime.

I've now gotten comfortable to confirm his social media account traffics in black militancy, black nationalism, anti-white memes, a lot of anti-Trump, anti-capitalism content. You know, the white people are the enemy, that kind of crazy stuff. Also, wacky conspiracy theories about Jews and Hitler. The guy is a lunatic, #BLM all over the place. He wasn't happy with the Rittenhouse verdict, so you take that. And then you take the fact that he has an open sex offender warrant out in Nevada because he was pimping out a 15-year- old, got her pregnant. And he's got a slew of felony charges, felonious assault, gun charges, drug charges, and he just revolving doors out of there because you have a stupid D.A. there that's trying to reduce the prison population and rehabilitate everybody, restorative justice, as that kind of ridiculous mind-set. And then goes to mows down about 50 people, five dead. You know, they're putting people back together literally at the hospital right now. And Joe Biden's asked about it and he says, you know what, I don't want to say too much, still waiting for some of the facts and the details to come out. Okay. Well, Rittenhouse after that happened two days later slandered the guy as a white supremacist when there was video showing he was acting in self- defense. Now, this guy in Wisconsin was not acting in self-defense. The video clearly shows he is mowing people down and he's being charged with intentional homicide, but Joe Biden is holding his tongue, okay. And the media is basically memory hold the story already, I wonder why. We all know why. It doesn't need to be said. And what we heard yesterday was total garbage that he was fleeing a knife fight. Now, who drives through a parade to flee a knife fight? Doesn't make any sense. What? Are people throwing knives at his car? It makes no sense. And there was no pursuit because you see the guy on the door dash camera, the guy is having a sandwich while police are trying to find -- he's having a sandwich. He's not fleeing a knife fight. Get out of here! So everybody knows what's going on. It's horrible and, you know, the media is just going to pigeonhole it and we're going to have to pick up the pieces."

He is amazing at what he does, and he gets people clearly to talk about things that they didn't intend on talking about the certain aspects of the bills or the policies that they support. There has to be a very serious conversation about who should get bail reform applied to them and what kind of offenders should not be able to have this. Absolutely with this one it raises a larger question about, you know, we treat people over assaulted women, obviously, the 15-year-old sex trafficking charge and getting her pregnant. That is something where this person, you know, a $1,000 bail is not enough for them. And I think Kyle Rittenhouse had a $2 million bail. Now, I'm not saying that Kyle Rittenhouse shouldn't have had a high bail, I believe that he should have, but the disparity is something for us to take note of. I don't think the media is going to pigeonhole this.

No pre-trial, detention, cash bail. They tweaked it a little bit. But basically you can punch some old lady in the face and you're right back out on the street. I want them to go, go, go and continue to expose themselves for who they are they are and what they want. The more they spit in the faces of victims and their families, which is what you're doing with Raskin and Maloney and Ocasio-Cortez releasing this, complaints about bail, people being held on bail right after this deadly -- this murders in Waukesha.

You guys pretty much covered it. I like to add a couple of things. The thing that I find most scary is, I believe Democrats and Republicans were run over by this guy. I don't believe they really had a party preference. And I think that one thing is pretty universal as you heard James Carville speak up and other Democrats say the stupidest thing they ever heard was defund the police. And we're seeing now is the tone deafness of these Democrats saying let's start with this bail reform, no cash bail along with defund the police. We are seeing the one -- this is one story. The looting in San Francisco coming up later. The Rittenhouse story coming up next. And this story is all the same thing, defaming, defanging, and defunding the police is all about the lack of law and order in all three places. Please tell me how that benefits the American citizen, the American family. They are alienating the American people. You're not helping Democrats. And I just find it so hard to believe that President Biden seems to be listening to the squad and the left wing not the middle of his party. How could he be this tone deaf? I understand was to sign them, but I never thought they'd be driving the administration. That's the scary thing for the country. Forget about the party in the next election."

I thought he was well prepared for it and also very clear about the points he wanted to make and the sideshow stuff that he didn't want to get involved in. He didn't want to be having a lot of the conversations that pundits have been having about his intentions and he really wanted to make a larger point about what he saw his case as which was a self-defense case. And I thought that made a big impact on people and he had one line that I thought was particularly important. You know, he said I'm a supporter of the Black Lives Matter Movement. We don't know about that photo with the Proud Boys. Maybe it was just two guys walked up to him and said take a picture with me. Maybe it was more than that. But he said something like think about what would have happened if I was a black person in this position who had done this. How would my trial have gone differently? And to acknowledge that, that's so core to people who support the Black Lives Matter Movement that they acknowledge that. And the fact that he brought that forward, it wasn't an extension -- it wasn't what Tucker asked him. And I thought that that was a really important gesture towards the \"other side\" of this fight to say I understand the systemic challenges facing black people in this system and I thought he did really well by himself."

So, I -- to that point, I don't understand why the D.C. clutter boxes on T.V. like at \"The View\" keep talking about Rittenhouse the way that they do. Why do their bosses allow this?

Any president that tries to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to deal with prices -- we're not actually in an oil emergency, it's like a gnat on an elephant. It doesn't have the impact that it wants to do. And also it's just so craven, right? They do it right before Thanksgiving. And tapping the SPR is really just making up for the bad policy from before. So, canceling Keystone, canceling oil and gas leases, discouraging investment, not allowing ANWR to go through, so then you have to tap the SPR which is not going to do anything and you get through Thanksgiving and they're just like basically hoping that it all goes away. It's the same thing with the eviction moratorium. That wasn't working out. The money wasn't going out the door so then they had to like figure out other policy. And then they have to go to the courts, and they basically get saved by the courts until they can't do that. Or they're driving up inflation with bad policy. And now, they're like, oh, wait, now what are we going to do because of inflation? So, it's one thing after another. But the other thing about Jennifer Granholm, the Secretary, is yesterday -- and she's not the only one. The administration's position on this has been higher gas prices are the price that all of us are going to have to pay so that we can transition to a cleaner fuel for the climate. That's what they've said. So, she said that yesterday. Today, she's in the briefing room saying this is a very serious issue. It affects all low-income families. We're going to get on top of it. So, somebody called her between yesterday and today when they realized that their polling is so bad on this. Just now, there was a poll that said that 77 percent of people say they notice inflation and 57 percent of them blame Joe Biden.

But if he said it, I guess it works. He says everything is back on the shelves. The supply chain problem basically solved. So, if you look at the -- if things that you go to buy are more expensive. Things you go to buy, a lot of times we don't have them. You go to put gas in your car, it costs more. You actually try to buy stuff and you pay more and get less. You go out to a restaurant, and it costs more. The service isn't as good. People are not working. Sundays, that restaurant you like is closed because they're not staffed. So, when all these little areas around the country you're affected, and it affects the practical way we lead our lives which I find fascinating because it's apolitical. Everything I just mentioned has nothing to do with Republican philosophy or Democratic philosophy. It's making people say, is my life better now than it was in who is responsible for it? And he's always -- for somebody so experienced with experienced staff, I don't understand why he's always in reaction mode. He's never leading. Like, we got to get ahead of inflation. We got to get ahead of the concern about gas and oil. And now, he reacts just a day before he goes to a billionaire's house in Nantucket."

So, that's the political calculation on behalf of Walmart.

Because Jen -- if they screw up and tell you the truth, thank them for that if they make a mistake like Jen Granholm. But I was reading Kyle Basse on Twitter. He was just working down the numbers that the world, because it's a global commodity, it consumes 100 million barrels per day, so we release 50 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

But like, people are excited that they're vaccinated, majority of them, and that they can go see their families. Last Thanksgiving was not that great for a lot of people, Christmas, etcetera. If you want holiday cheer, you should go -- you should have the turkey. I do love those charts though, of what people would cut. It's so interesting when you find out like your friends hate the things that you love and blah, blah, blah. But pay for the turkey. Don't charge people for Friendsgiving. I guess people do that though, like, bring your own thing, but not at Uncle Larry's or wherever you're planning."
