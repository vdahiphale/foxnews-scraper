But when I think you look at the Virginia result, which I think is more instructive than the New Jersey result, which is just kind of a backlash against Joe Biden and what's going on in the economy and the like, I think what you see is a candidate who was very savvy when it came to Glenn Youngkin's approach to run on kitchen table issues, pocketbook issues, like the grocery tax, the various things that are raising costs for people in a time of inflation, but also, to lean in to these culture war hot button issues without any kind of fear, without any hesitation. It served two purposes. It both activated the conservative base, which was angry about these issues, and it reached out to a lot of suburban parents who had been lost in the last election cycle, who really came back to the Republican line. And that's the kind of thing that I think should really put the fear of God in Democrats. If you can get a coalition that has truck driving people with Trump stickers on the back of their pickups and people who are driving Subarus that have the honor roll middle school sticker on the back, that is a dangerous coalition for them. And I think that parents really came out and made the difference for Youngkin in a significant way that should really put the fear into Democrats going forward into 2022.",

And Glenn Youngkin worked on a campaign where he really talked about unity. He didn't talk in terms of Republican versus Democrat. He talked about giving parents back their rights. And Democrats in this state and states around the country have really abused their power, whether it's locking parents out of school boards or Terry McAuliffe at a debate telling parents that they really have no role in the kinds of books that go into their children's libraries. Glenn Youngkin was able to get women to come out for him. He got 54 percent of the Hispanic vote in Virginia. And the ticket that he ran on with Winsome Sears now as his lieutenant governor is diverse. And Terry McAuliffe desperately tried to paint Republicans and Glenn Youngkin as a white supremacist and completely failed. And we're seeing that strategy work all over the country as Republicans run minorities in districts where they are going to win, and they are flipping seats away from Democrats.",

As someone who has stood for public office and been on the ballot six times, I can tell you that all elections are different, but there is a huge common denominator. If you are not responding to people, if your vision is not crafted in a way that's looking to help and advance people, that you want to represent, you won't win. That's what Democrats have to get back to. The coalition that Ben so eloquently pointed out, those are the coalitions that helped Democrats and Republicans who have won in the past. That's how you win elections. If I'm a Democrat in the House or the Senate or I'm a strategist right now, this Youngkin victory, you put him in and Tim Scott, I don't know who would be president or vice president, that's a formidable ticket. You've got to think about how you appeal to everyday Americans, pocketbooks and wallets, how you incorporate the racial and social and societal concerns and issues that have always been present in American politics, and how do you craft a message that pushes us forward? You cannot look backwards. You cannot draw on the former president or even former presidents. I have to remind everyone on the panel, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton lost the midterms, and they both came back to be reelected. This White House needs to regroup, reset, and call on Congress to pass the legislation in front of them.",

One thing that I think is really very clear for the Democratic coalition going forward, you cannot continue this agenda that just sort of says, when we lose an election it means America is racist. Somehow yesterday America proved that it was racist again, or something like that. Glenn Youngkin was smart enough to run into the teeth of that, to take arrows for it, to reject it. And I think what we're going to find is that he was rewarded by Hispanic voters, by Asian voters, by other voter continues in Virginia that made the difference for him ultimately. We cannot continue this kind of race-based agenda that creates a hierarchy for children, in particular suggesting that in some way meritocracy or being good at math is a vestige of white supremacy or the like. People hate that, and they want to move away from it. Glenn Youngkin was part of that, and I think Republicans are going to lean into that going into 2022.",

      "utterance": "It was incredible to watch everything come together in Virginia, a state that hasn't been red in a very long time. And Glenn Youngkin worked on a campaign where he really talked about unity. He didn't talk in terms of Republican versus Democrat. He talked about giving parents back their rights. And Democrats in this state and states around the country have really abused their power, whether it's locking parents out of school boards or Terry McAuliffe at a debate telling parents that they really have no role in the kinds of books that go into their children's libraries. Glenn Youngkin was able to get women to come out for him. He got 54 percent of the Hispanic vote in Virginia. And the ticket that he ran on with Winsome Sears now as his lieutenant governor is diverse. And Terry McAuliffe desperately tried to paint Republicans and Glenn Youngkin as a white supremacist and completely failed. And we're seeing that strategy work all over the country as Republicans run minorities in districts where they are going to win, and they are flipping seats away from Democrats."

      "utterance": "Harold, first female black lieutenant governor, very impressive, on Martha's show this afternoon. And yet some of the punditry was that the reason Youngkin won was because he upset white parents about not teaching black history. Your thoughts on that?"

      "utterance": "So I think Democrats should not narrowly think about these races. As someone who has stood for public office and been on the ballot six times, I can tell you that all elections are different, but there is a huge common denominator. If you are not responding to people, if your vision is not crafted in a way that's looking to help and advance people, that you want to represent, you won't win. That's what Democrats have to get back to. The coalition that Ben so eloquently pointed out, those are the coalitions that helped Democrats and Republicans who have won in the past. That's how you win elections. If I'm a Democrat in the House or the Senate or I'm a strategist right now, this Youngkin victory, you put him in and Tim Scott, I don't know who would be president or vice president, that's a formidable ticket. You've got to think about how you appeal to everyday Americans, pocketbooks and wallets, how you incorporate the racial and social and societal concerns and issues that have always been present in American politics, and how do you craft a message that pushes us forward? You cannot look backwards. You cannot draw on the former president or even former presidents. I have to remind everyone on the panel, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton lost the midterms, and they both came back to be reelected. This White House needs to regroup, reset, and call on Congress to pass the legislation in front of them."

      "utterance": "I think that when it comes to what Harold is saying there, there is a lot of truth to it. One thing that I think is really very clear for the Democratic coalition going forward, you cannot continue this agenda that just sort of says, when we lose an election it means America is racist. Somehow yesterday America proved that it was racist again, or something like that. Glenn Youngkin was smart enough to run into the teeth of that, to take arrows for it, to reject it. And I think what we're going to find is that he was rewarded by Hispanic voters, by Asian voters, by other voter continues in Virginia that made the difference for him ultimately. We cannot continue this kind of race-based agenda that creates a hierarchy for children, in particular suggesting that in some way meritocracy or being good at math is a vestige of white supremacy or the like. People hate that, and they want to move away from it. Glenn Youngkin was part of that, and I think Republicans are going to lean into that going into 2022."
