Mueller didn't have to come out and say any of this. As he said himself during his statement, nothing he said is different from what was is in his report, and just as if he were to testify in front of Congress, nothing he would say there would be different than what is in the report. Why did he say it? Why did he come out and do it? I can't answer why, but, clearly, he was aiming to send a political flare and to kind of role the political waters here. And he waited until Bill Barr was on his way to Alaska, the farthest you can be away in the country in order to do this. And I can't help but think that Bill Barr was firing sort of a shot back across Mueller's bow in response by saying, why didn't he do his job? Why didn't he make a ruling on the obstruction issue? Because I think that Bill Barr knows the reason, the answer to that, and I think Mueller knows the answer to that, and that is that they couldn't have charged the president.

And he said that it would be unfair to make a charge without giving the person you are charging the opportunity to respond to it in court. You can accept that it is his real reason or not, but that was his justification for this, for the action that he took. I think it is hard to be inside Mueller's head, I think there are possibly two reasons why Mueller made this announcement yesterday. One is that he differed with the interpretation that Barr put out about what his report said. It's different. His interpretation of his statement about what his report said is different from Barr's description of it. And the other is the final thing that Mueller said in his announcement, which was that every American should be concerned about Russia's influence and attempt to meddle in our election that that's getting no attention, and it is still getting no attention.",

But he had his reasons for not doing it, which he explained. And I'm not going to argue about those reasons, but when he did not make a decision, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt that it was necessary for us as the heads of the department to reach that decision."

      "speaker": "BRET BAIER, HOST",
      "utterance": "Attorney General William Barr with CBS saying that he thought Robert Mueller could've come to a conclusion one way or another with obstruction of justice. He didn't, so that Barr did. We'll start there with our panel, Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times.\" OK, Charlie, he is so matter-of-fact in his delivery, it is really such a contrast to politicians up on the Hill. But it is a stark difference in saying he should have been able to make a case. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": And more than just that, I think it was a real shot across Mueller's bow, because you think about what happened here. Mueller didn't have to come out and say any of this. As he said himself during his statement, nothing he said is different from what was is in his report, and just as if he were to testify in front of Congress, nothing he would say there would be different than what is in the report. Why did he say it? Why did he come out and do it? I can't answer why, but, clearly, he was aiming to send a political flare and to kind of role the political waters here. And he waited until Bill Barr was on his way to Alaska, the farthest you can be away in the country in order to do this. And I can't help but think that Bill Barr was firing sort of a shot back across Mueller's bow in response by saying, why didn't he do his job? Why didn't he make a ruling on the obstruction issue? Because I think that Bill Barr knows the reason, the answer to that, and I think Mueller knows the answer to that, and that is that they couldn't have charged the president. They didn't have the evidence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Ultimately, Susan, because of the rules of the Special Counsel, it is Attorney General Barr's decision to make, not Robert Mueller's. SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": But Mueller says the reason that they didn't come to a conclusion was not because they didn't have the evidence, but because they were prohibited from bringing an indictment. And he said that it would be unfair to make a charge without giving the person you are charging the opportunity to respond to it in court. You can accept that it is his real reason or not, but that was his justification for this, for the action that he took. I think it is hard to be inside Mueller's head, I think there are possibly two reasons why Mueller made this announcement yesterday. One is that he differed with the interpretation that Barr put out about what his report said. It's different. His interpretation of his statement about what his report said is different from Barr's description of it. And the other is the final thing that Mueller said in his announcement, which was that every American should be concerned about Russia's influence and attempt to meddle in our election that that's getting no attention, and it is still getting no attention."

      "speaker": "JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST",

But I think you hit the nail on the head when you said it is up to the attorney general to make these decisions. I think the reason Mueller did not come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice is not because the evidence wasn't there. It's there. There are 10 crimes outlined. There's enough there to get an indictment on any of them if the defendant were not the president of the United States. I think the reason is because he knew that the attorney general would never give him permission to do so. And he is a soldier. He is a marine. He does not want to challenge and take on his boss publicly."

    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "I don't know if a prosecutor would, but under the law there is enough for a prosecutor to do so. And as far as the OLC, Office of Legal Counsel opinion, it's an advisory opinion. It was issued in October of 2000. Forty-five days later, the Justice Department prosecuted the president of the United States, Bill Clinton, for obstruction of justice and perjury. And 45 days after that he pleaded guilty to a felony while still in office. So it is clear that this opinion is not a bar to prosecuting the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right, but Judge, I guess the question is, if he was never going to make a case, he was never going to go no-go, decide if he had a case or didn't decide he had a case, why wouldn't he say that at the beginning? That's number one. Number two, how long did he know he was not going to make a case? And how long did he know there was no collusion? Number three, why did we go through all of this, other than the Russia part, which is incredibly important?"

One thing that Bob Mueller said yesterday which is absolutely not true is that this is not the last time we are going to hear from him. He's a private citizen.

I actually agree with Mrs. Pelosi that impeachment without a broad bipartisan national consensus behind it is fruitless, futile, and needlessly divisive. Now, when the Sam Ervin Watergate Committee, which was both Houses of Congress, began its investigation of Richard Nixon, there was no broad national bipartisan consensus behind it. At the end of that investigation, by the time Rodino and the House Judiciary Committee started, there was. The Democrats may want to use that as a model. But right now, there's nothing but the hard core of the Democratic Party's left, as I see it that wants impeachment"
