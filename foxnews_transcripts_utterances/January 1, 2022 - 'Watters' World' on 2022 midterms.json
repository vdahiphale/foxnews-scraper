This lineup is fantastic. So, let's get started for the first show of 2022. Here we go. Let's look back, if we will. Our President thought not so much about a great year in 2021. How did he do in 2021? Not so good. Joe, in many ways had a disastrous first year at office. He came in with an economy on the rise, a secure border, the vaccine ready to go and he squandered it. President Biden failed to keep his promises from day one. He promised the world on COVID, well, we'd get rid of it. We'd get rid of the virus and provide more testing.",

Most of the major cities that broke homicide records in 2021 veered left on crime and policing like Philly and Portland in Chicago, surging an over 60 percent increase in murders from 2019, not to mention the millions stolen and destroyed and these horrible smash-and-grabs this year -- everyone heard that term before -- crimes ever seemed to be a Biden administration priority though, they still aren't. Now, his D.O.J. is giving $1.6 billion to cities to battle the violent crime after his party denied it was even happening. Biden halted construction of the border wall on his first day in office and surprise, surprise, a crisis erupted. Record numbers of illegal crossings happening throughout the year. In fact just in November, 173,000-plus encounters at the border, double the number from 2020 and over four times the number of 2019. Look, not to mention over 130 percent increase in fentanyl being seized at the border from 2020 and the millions that cartels are making from human trafficking. This is not tough. He's not even trying. Joe ended up reinstating former President Trump's remain-in-Mexico policy and is closing gaps in the wall though he is still fighting the courts there, and Joe's border czar Kamala is MIA. No wonder she is on the image rehab tour. She was asked what her biggest failure has been as VP. Listen.",

Inflation soared throughout the year, reached up to almost 40-year high through November, and things are not only expected to get worse in January. You've got food manufacturers saying some of their prices will rise this month like Heinz, General Mills, Campbell's -- all of them as much as 20 percent. But Joe says inflation was just transitory. But by far, the President's supposed epic fail that will live for generations sadly, is Afghanistan. The Taliban took over in a flash and Americans had until August 31st to get out. Thirteen would die trying to execute this tragically flawed exit plan. This is what Joe said before August 31st.",

It's just that you know, rather than now being upset about Trump, we are now upset about Biden, but both sides, you know, we're in a tribal moment, everybody goes to their corner. Democrats think Biden is doing a great job just as Republicans thought Trump was doing a great job. The key is the Independents, and the Independents who are the people who put Biden into office have turned against him, because as you said, I mean they go through that litany, you know, COVID, he is mishandled that, bungled that. Inflation, dismissed it when we were all feeling it when we went to the store or at the pump. The economy slowing down with more government mandates, spending going wild. The American Rescue Plan, which was supposed to be COVID-related is mostly an expansion of the welfare state. Build Back Better turned out to be a gigantic fraud. Oh, it's only going to be $1.7 trillion. So that's because we've got a bunch of gimmicks in it. If you take the gimmicks out, it's actually $3 trillion in debt, and $5 trillion in new spending. Afghanistan, you did a good job on that one. Immigration, you're right. You know, you did a good job of explaining what they did wrong on that. It's just been disaster, debacle, mistake, and error after error. And occasionally, there have been a few grace notes. He finally got around to thanking President Trump for Operation Warp Speed, but that was so -- the country has been so poisoned by both sides, this President had a chance to go in and say things and do things in a different fashion. But instead, with a few -- with one major exception, has always found a way to blame it on his predecessor, and I don't think that's healthy for the country and it certainly hasn't been healthy for his presidency. Think about this, we end the year with 30 percent of the American people thinking the country is going in the right direction and 62 percent thinking we're off on the wrong track. That ain't a good place to be if you're the new President of the United States. It is hard to turn that around.",

So he said, we've got to be cautious about projecting that we know what we know, and that we know everything. And Biden came in promising that eradicate the virus by July 4th, and the guy who proved, who in 2002 and 2003, Dr. Fauci, was right. There are lots of imponderables, and this administration acted like it had everything under control. And you're right on testing. In September, he said, we're going to have hundreds of millions of tests. And it turns out that, three months, four months later, they hadn't even ordered them.

SHEMEKA MICHELLE, CO-HOST \"CUT THE BULL\" PODCAST: Brian, you know, Nikole Hannah-Jones is a prime example of what happens when a woman marries a man who takes her last name. And I can't help but wonder if she attributes her success to hard work and determination or the fact that she is a mixed American, and so therefore, she is where she is because she is privileged, because she is half white.

It happened to him once, it's probably not going to happen again and he lives tell the story, which brings me to my next positive, which this story will get you out of any awkward social situation.

This lineup is fantastic. So, let's get started for the first show of 2022. Here we go. Let's look back, if we will. Our President thought not so much about a great year in 2021. How did he do in 2021? Not so good. Joe, in many ways had a disastrous first year at office. He came in with an economy on the rise, a secure border, the vaccine ready to go and he squandered it. President Biden failed to keep his promises from day one. He promised the world on COVID, well, we'd get rid of it. We'd get rid of the virus and provide more testing."

We will deal honestly with the American people and we will never ever, ever quit. That's is how we will shut down this virus. I'm not going to shut down the economy, I'm going to shut down the virus. We need to scale up testing. So, anyone who needs one can get a test. After 10 months of the pandemic, we still don't have enough testing. It's a travesty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "It is so much easier to be a candidate. A year later, not only have COVID cases surged and deaths exceeded Trump's final year, which was without benefit of a vaccine, but the President never ramped up the testing after campaigning all of Trump's supposed failures. The big one was testing. People unable to get at-home tests waiting hours in line to get tested. You saw this today, all blaming Biden. So what does our 46th President decide to do? He decides to punt to the Governors, let them handle it."

    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Yes. When Joe can't solve a problem, his only other line of action is to deflect it. Crime soared across the nation this year. Most of the major cities that broke homicide records in 2021 veered left on crime and policing like Philly and Portland in Chicago, surging an over 60 percent increase in murders from 2019, not to mention the millions stolen and destroyed and these horrible smash-and-grabs this year -- everyone heard that term before -- crimes ever seemed to be a Biden administration priority though, they still aren't. Now, his D.O.J. is giving $1.6 billion to cities to battle the violent crime after his party denied it was even happening. Biden halted construction of the border wall on his first day in office and surprise, surprise, a crisis erupted. Record numbers of illegal crossings happening throughout the year. In fact just in November, 173,000-plus encounters at the border, double the number from 2020 and over four times the number of 2019. Look, not to mention over 130 percent increase in fentanyl being seized at the border from 2020 and the millions that cartels are making from human trafficking. This is not tough. He's not even trying. Joe ended up reinstating former President Trump's remain-in-Mexico policy and is closing gaps in the wall though he is still fighting the courts there, and Joe's border czar Kamala is MIA. No wonder she is on the image rehab tour. She was asked what her biggest failure has been as VP. Listen."

      "utterance": "Yes. She doesn't want to go to the border. Right? What about Joe? Fumbling the economy, mandates causing worker shortages, the port backlogs causing supply chain issues. These are some issues he should have chosen from. The question should have been with multiple choice. Inflation soared throughout the year, reached up to almost 40-year high through November, and things are not only expected to get worse in January. You've got food manufacturers saying some of their prices will rise this month like Heinz, General Mills, Campbell's -- all of them as much as 20 percent. But Joe says inflation was just transitory. But by far, the President's supposed epic fail that will live for generations sadly, is Afghanistan. The Taliban took over in a flash and Americans had until August 31st to get out. Thirteen would die trying to execute this tragically flawed exit plan. This is what Joe said before August 31st."

Of course, hundreds of Americans were left behind, and you name it, they have gone where things have gone wrong with this administration. And this year, will they get more luck? Will they get better outcomes with these policies? It is not likely. Here to break down what happened in 2021, and go over what could happen in 2022 is the one and only Karl Rove. Karl, you wrote a column in \"The Wall Street Journal\" at the end of 2021, and you graded yourself. First off what I ran through, how much did you predict?"

I projected that Joe Biden would govern as a traditional Democrat, and instead of being the sort of traditional liberal, he went way out on the left wing of his party and associated himself with the squad and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and their agenda. And so I got it -- numerically, I was right, but on a bunch of them, but I've got to tell you, on the ones that I got wrong, then that was the biggest one. I thought, he could -- I believed him. You know, he said, the biggest issue of the incumbent was messing up on COVID and I'll get it right, he said, and I'll be a normal President and a normal Democrat, but he hasn't been a normal President or a normal Democrat."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I think we're sort of the same level of polarization. It's just that you know, rather than now being upset about Trump, we are now upset about Biden, but both sides, you know, we're in a tribal moment, everybody goes to their corner. Democrats think Biden is doing a great job just as Republicans thought Trump was doing a great job. The key is the Independents, and the Independents who are the people who put Biden into office have turned against him, because as you said, I mean they go through that litany, you know, COVID, he is mishandled that, bungled that. Inflation, dismissed it when we were all feeling it when we went to the store or at the pump. The economy slowing down with more government mandates, spending going wild. The American Rescue Plan, which was supposed to be COVID-related is mostly an expansion of the welfare state. Build Back Better turned out to be a gigantic fraud. Oh, it's only going to be $1.7 trillion. So that's because we've got a bunch of gimmicks in it. If you take the gimmicks out, it's actually $3 trillion in debt, and $5 trillion in new spending. Afghanistan, you did a good job on that one. Immigration, you're right. You know, you did a good job of explaining what they did wrong on that. It's just been disaster, debacle, mistake, and error after error. And occasionally, there have been a few grace notes. He finally got around to thanking President Trump for Operation Warp Speed, but that was so -- the country has been so poisoned by both sides, this President had a chance to go in and say things and do things in a different fashion. But instead, with a few -- with one major exception, has always found a way to blame it on his predecessor, and I don't think that's healthy for the country and it certainly hasn't been healthy for his presidency. Think about this, we end the year with 30 percent of the American people thinking the country is going in the right direction and 62 percent thinking we're off on the wrong track. That ain't a good place to be if you're the new President of the United States. It is hard to turn that around."

The chance for a global pandemic based on this virus that was emerging in China, and I remember the guy who led the briefings was talking about all the imponderables, all the things we didn't know and how we had to be cautious about predicting what would happen because there were lots of how transmissible it was, how and what kind of mitigation could be taken, what kind of therapeutics and how fast would we get a vaccine and so forth. So he said, we've got to be cautious about projecting that we know what we know, and that we know everything. And Biden came in promising that eradicate the virus by July 4th, and the guy who proved, who in 2002 and 2003, Dr. Fauci, was right. There are lots of imponderables, and this administration acted like it had everything under control. And you're right on testing. In September, he said, we're going to have hundreds of millions of tests. And it turns out that, three months, four months later, they hadn't even ordered them.

She was a Nassau County executive who lost a nail biter, Bruce Blakeman in her seat, and she believes it is because of what's happening at the White House.

And what we need always and especially now is someone who exudes confidence and competence, someone who sets a reassuring tone, and we're not getting that at the top right now. And unfortunately, I think your previous guest, Karl Rove, is absolutely right. I think it's going to be a bloodbath for the Democrats in the midterm. So, you know, the question is, as a Democrat, I think it's really important to have a strong two party system. I think it's good for democracy. I don't think it should be one party rule either way. But unfortunately, it seems like we are giving the Republicans ammunition just to shoot us because we exude this weakness. People want to be reassured that government is there for them, not telling them what to do, but making sure the roads are in good shape, making sure the sewage is properly run, making sure that public safety is where it should be.

She says no way. We'll try to explain that when we come back in this Special Edition of WATTERS' WORLD. NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES, AUTHOR, 1619 PROJECT: I don't really understand this idea that parents should decide what's being taught. I'm not a professional educator. I don't have a degree in Social Studies or Science. We send our children to school because we want them to be taught by people who have expertise in the subject area, and that is not my job."

Parents should have no say in education. And she's not a professional. I thought she is on Howard University's faculty? I want to talk about this with three perfect people who tackle topics like this on a daily basis. We have \"Cut the Bull\" podcast co-hosts: They are Professor Wilfred Reilly, Charles Love from Charleston, South Carolina; Shemeka Michelle is joining us together they are cutting the bull. Shemeka, I'll start with you. I was shocked to hear that. Terry McAuliffe tried that. He is no longer a candidate to Governor, he lost. What do they have against parents, Shemeka? SHEMEKA MICHELLE, CO-HOST \"CUT THE BULL\" PODCAST: Brian, you know, Nikole Hannah-Jones is a prime example of what happens when a woman marries a man who takes her last name. And I can't help but wonder if she attributes her success to hard work and determination or the fact that she is a mixed American, and so therefore, she is where she is because she is privileged, because she is half white. I think it's an insult to parents that do feel like we don't have the intelligence to decide what our kids should be learning. Of course, we should have some type of input. Am I you know, the person to teach my child Calculus? No. However, do I think my child should be taught Calculus through the prism of racism or race? Absolutely not."

But in terms of what she is getting to, and that is the history of this country built on stolen land off of slavery. That's what she wants to get across. CHARLES LOVE, CO-HOST, \"CUT THE BULL\" PODCAST: Yes, is terrible. You know, I think that we're burying the lid here. To be fair to her, I don't think she was saying that parents shouldn't be involved, but she's still wrong because what she's saying is, we don't want parents writing curriculum when we know no one is saying that. Right? We are saying that the teacher should teach, but the parents should say what shouldn't be taught when things are inappropriate and to the history thing, you know, my book \"Race Crazy\" has a chapter on every essay in the 1619 Project. Why I say they're burying the lid is what she said in his interview earlier, she said that it is not a work of history, it is a work of memory. And now in this interview, she said both that it is a journalistic project, not a history project, and that she is not an educator. Well, if that's the case, it shouldn't be taught to kids, and if they're going to do it, I would challenge all these people who are lauding this new book she has to take my book and teach them both and use it as a critical thinking exercise and see which is really the true history."

I will say that Nikole Hannah-Jones's original comments fall into what I call the cult of the professional or the cult of the expert, which is this idea that you can't criticize anyone with any kind of upper middle class degree. For example, a DEI consultant. And I really think that's pretty silly. I mean, there's expertise like surgery. That's the process of long methodical training. Then there's expertise like teaching or coaching that most people have done at some level, leading meetings -- I'm an educator myself -- where the average parent really can't have input. And yes, the average parent is correct to say it doesn't sound like 1619 is an unbiased view of U.S. racial history. That's something an average smart person absolutely can figure out.

I am not saying clearly here that is not a percentage of. What that percentage is -- is it two? Is it 20? I don't know. But I know it's not a hundred. And when we become race crazy, that's all we see. So, if someone gets shot, it's race. If someone is sick, it's race. How do we fix anything that way? So, you talk about getting back to it, we need to get back to actually focusing on things that will work. Just think about what they propose. And if it won't fix anything, just don't be afraid to cast it aside. Don't let them call you racist, or whatever the case may be, that's just BS. It is not going to work, so, I'm not going for it. You can't teach me that my 10-year-old is -- tell my 10-year-old that he is the reason why racism exists and think you're going to fix it. It's silly.

And through that imperil democracy, perhaps that's what the Vice President thought, but I don't think so. I'm not really sure, you know, what her concern is. I don't think the Soviet Union is coming back and the Communist Chinese as much as they don't like us, they're not going to impair our democracy, but they certainly are both in Russia, acting more like the Soviets and China, certainly acting like a classic communist regime are both ready to make big moves in 2022."

So you know, you're facing a multiple series of challenges. The Belt and Road is interesting because it's a type of return to economic mercantilism and imperialism in almost cult of quasi-colonialism. So, I think that as China starts to move outward and reclaim what it sees as its lost history where it once dominated Asia in its own mind, it never really did, but let's not put that -- let's put that aside, the Chinese think they dominate Asia, and they want to regain their dominance. As that happens, this economic imperialism will expand as well, their willingness to take hostages, and I mean, American exporters in China, American business people, they all need to be worried about becoming hostages to the Chinese government if Taiwan gets hit, we will sanction them.

What are they trying to do? Jack up the price of natural gas, hold natural gas hostage because where they're positioned in the North and in the East of Russia on the borders of the Ukraine, I should say. That is the perfect position to sort of protect these pipelines. You know, they can send the price of natural gas in Germany skyrocketing and hold them hostage, break the back of NATO.

SUNNY HOSTIN, COHOST, \"THE VIEW\": I want to say about Governor Death- Santis in Florida -- and there have been allegations again from the very beginning that Florida misrepresented the COVID-19 data."

That's the media with Ron DeSantis. They complained about this guy, again, with no regard for the facts, with no regard for the fact that he did the best job of any Governor in that he prioritized the elderly who are the most vulnerable to this pandemic and got them vaccinated at an astonishingly high rate, and he managed to take the pandemic seriously without crashing his economy, which is why Florida has the best job market in the country. The one thing I will say that DeSantis has going for him though, Brian, is nobody is scared of COVID in a state where people eat each other's faces."

This is according to reports -- I just checked the calendar, the first \"Triple Play\" of 2022, and let's see it. It's an electrifying experience. Also, I have to say this, I have managed to lasso Carley Shimkus, the same one who co-hosts \"FOX and Friends First\" to help me with this \"Triple Play.\" She wanted to be introduced as the most talented woman in television history, but I'm just going to say co-host of \"FOX and Friends\" First. Carley, welcome. CARLEY SHIMKUS, COHOST \"FOX AND FRIENDS FIRST\": Thank you for having me, Brian. I do appreciate the wonderful intro."

This security guard just walking in the rain, which is the reason why you have an umbrella, which means it'll happen again, and it almost acts like a radio transmitter, just blows up. I think Benjamin Franklin tried this hundreds of years ago. What is your take on this, Carley?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, this is a truly wild video. I'm sure that getting hit by lightning ruined his day, but there are some positives to this that I'd like to point out. The first is that getting struck by lightning, the odds of that happening are very low, for it to happen once. But for it to happen twice, even lower, so at least he got it out of the way. It happened to him once, it's probably not going to happen again and he lives tell the story, which brings me to my next positive, which this story will get you out of any awkward social situation. If somebody tells a bad joke or two family members are fighting during dinner, you just tell your lightning story, and it totally serves as a distraction, and everybody can move on in a positive direction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "So I don't know if you could tell, but evidently the backstory is, it has gotten millions upon millions of views. He was given by his sister dissolvable swimming trunks. So as soon as they got wet, they disappeared. He finds himself in the ocean, totally naked, and this woman was experiencing huge backlash saying it's cruel. So is this funny? Or is this cruel, Carley Shimkus?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, Brian, that's exactly right. So this video has gotten like 29 million views on TikTok. But the overwhelming volume of negative comments is unbelievable, and really serious stuff. Like somebody said, \"What if the genders were reversed, they would never do this if it was a girl.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Right."

    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "\"Just really cruel, a total loss of trust.\" Then somebody says, \"This is not even doing sibling stuff. It's just mean. You could have gotten him arrested for public indecency.\" If I watched this video on social media, I would, you know, view it once, say that it's like a silly sibling prank and move on with my life. But the internet overreacting to some silly thing is another day ending and why? So it shouldn't come as any surprise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple of things, two I'd like to add to that. Number one, I don't know the relationship between the two, but the sister got so upset, she went back on social media and blasted all of her critics. So this thing is totally out of control. I do look at it as pretty cruel, especially if he was forced to get out of the water, it would be terrible, or it was very cold water. It will be awful reputation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "They handed him -- yes, the reputation. Like, they gave him a pair of swim trunks before he got out of the water. So, everything wound up being fine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Right. By the way, why are you going to Goodwill and getting swim trunks and give them as a gift to people. There's so much wrong there. So here's something that's going to be impossible for us to do in our jobs and that is detached from tech. But Kahlua, which is the only alcohol worth anything will pay $25,000.00 to a couple who will ditch technology for a month. The question is as those who enter it, they'll have to take a polygraph to prove that you didn't. If you do take this challenge, could you and your husband do it, number one? Number two, is this possible?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I'm just having this image in my head of a producer saying something to me like, did you read the latest \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed? And me saying back? \"No, I didn't as a matter of fact, I didn't do any research for this morning's show because I just entered a 30- day internet challenge sponsored by Kahlua.\" I don't think that that will go over very well. But for whoever this challenge is for, some people can do it depending on their jobs. I say go for it except continue to go on foxnews.com, FOX Nation, FOX Weather, and briankilmeade.com as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Right. But Carley, the problem is that would eliminate them. They fail the polygraph and would be forced to live life partially without tech for a month and with a lot of Kahlua, which I don't know, there might be a different fate in that. Carley Shimkus, your mission from 2022 is to be as great as you were in 2021. I'm convinced you can do it. Will you accept that challenge?"
