Good evening everybody. I'm Martha McCallum in New York and this is “The Story” with 50 days until the presidential election. Now these officers were shot in this point blank ambush.

Joe Biden said that the perpetrator must be brought to justice and that violence towards police is unacceptable and outrageous.

You can see the numbers in those two states up in the sixties as something that is very much on their minds as they look toward the election.

The outcome you know they're not happy with and you know that will come out when investigation is finished and we'll deal with it then but the fact of the matter is I don't know how anybody could actually equate these two incidents. Somebody in the commission of a crime carrying a firearm he's not allowed to have and coming - you know encountering law enforcement and then two deputies sitting at a train station, providing security while doing their jobs and just sitting there minding their own business and somebody comes out of the woodwork and shoots them. This wasn't a police contact situation that went bad.

We just learned that the mayor there has decided that she's not going to let him do that. He's been fired so he is now out as well.

That's your attitude. I've taken a firm stand here in Detroit. I've been supported by Detroiters. Let me just say, Detroit doesn't want them gone and so I'm not leaving, they have to leave. And I've said it publicly, both locally and nationally and I'm going to hold my ground because our men and women who serve deserve much better than this. And I got to say Martha, if I can, I just want to pray for those two offices out in the Los Angeles county sheriffs. I spent 20 years of my career in LAPD and so it's despicable. I'm angry about it.

There's a lot of back and forth over what it means to defund the police but he's really laying it out quite clearly. This is Ed Markey. \"Portland police routinely attack peaceful protesters with brute force. We must disarm these officers and every other police department in America, of weapons of war and enact a nationwide ban on tear gas, rubber and plastic bullets and bean bag rounds.\" What would you say to Ed Markey, Sir?"

When are we going to start talking about disarming criminals? I've been on the record, I support law abiding citizens to be armed but criminals? And so it's OK to attack police officers and then everyone always says one thing, these were peaceful protesters so I guess when you throw a Molotov cocktails, railroad spikes, other projectiles, using green lasers, I guess that constitutes being peaceful. We have never tried to stop folks from their right to free speech. We've been dealing with this for in excess of 100 days. Six instances where we've had to use force because they were either attacking us or they resisted a lawful arrest. Enough is enough and I got to tell you, shame on that city manager out there in California. If anybody needs to step down, instead of the police chiefs, he needs to go."

When you look at the downward shift in the overall trend of new cases and thankfully in the death rate as well. New infections have been down for eight consecutive weeks across the board and daily fatalities thankfully, have dropped from - have dropped to 71 percent from the horrific peak that was hit back in April. This as pharmaceutical companies around the world continue the race for a vaccine.

Many encouraged localities to require mask wearing, many closed the indoor dining and bars that have been linked to a lot of outbreaks. And I think because of that we're seeing reductions in those numbers. There are a number of states where the numbers are creeping up and it's important that the public health officials in those states look and say OK, what's going on here? Has there been a change in any particular activity that could be linked to the increases that they're seeing?"

It is I think by any estimation very surprising that we are actually seeing these trials of several vaccines because in the beginning of this, we were told that it would take at least a couple of years, that the fastest vaccine never was developed in four years so you know is that remarkable to you and how optimistic are you that we will have something that will be fairly distributable and you know able to get your hands on if you're someone who needs it?"

But I urge caution and I use the phrase if we have a vaccine because there's no guarantee that any of these trials will definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective. I'm optimistic because there's many different approaches to vaccination that are being explored but there are a lot of infectious diseases you know, HIV and malaria and Hepatitis C where scientists have worked for decades and we still don't have a vaccine. So we can't rely on that, we have to take the measures of wearing masks and social distancing and hand washing to ensure that we have this under control until a situation where we have an effective vaccine."

Five years ago Iran was a bad regional actor requiring active deterrents and push back. Since Trump took office, Iran or its proxies have killed two American service members, a U.S. contractor, has severely injured more than 100 U.S. troops, damaged Saudi oil facilities and disabled commercial ships transiting the gulf.

He said you're not going to get a nuclear weapon and you're not going to get American taxpayer money and you're not going to conduct commerce around the world to build out your capacity to threaten via Hezbollah or Shia militias in Iraq. We've taken serious bite out of the Islamic Republic of Iran's regime and their power will continue to do that."

We urge the Europeans to take these same kinds of threats to humans rights seriously and just now, 30 days, 32 days, the Iranians will be able to buy and sell weapons and we had urge the Europeans to join us in the effort to make sure that the arms embargo, the one that Vice President Biden and his team negotiated that expires in just, now a month."

And they say why would they give up their safe harbor for terrorists, why would they, you know, agree to peace with the Afghan government.

Three administrations have tried to create that moment where the Afghans sat across from each other at the table and began to have serious conversations about what the Afghan government ought to look like what reconciliation ought to look like. They have been finding themselves for 40 years and we have been there for 19. It's time for peace. I think every Afghan recognizes that whether they're in the north or in the south, they're part of the Afghan coalition or part of the Taliban. They recognize that the military solution to this isn't at hand, that's been near stalemate for years now. And so, we are hopeful. We are hopeful that there can be an accommodation and reconciliation that brings Afghanistan the opportunity to once again build up their economy, build that opportunity and protect the human's rights of every Afghan citizen. It was a great day. It was truly historic to be there and watch these two parties that really had refused to sit in the same room together for two decades join in a conversation. It will be a rocky road, it will contentious for all the reasons, Martha, that you highlighted."

We'll accomplish those. President Trump wants to do that. There are fewer than 200 Al Qaeda left inside of Afghanistan. Times were different than they were six years ago or ten years ago. It's time that we can accomplish the mission of protecting the homeland with a much smaller footprint inside of Afghanistan and you see the same thing. We took down the caliphate in Syria and Iraq. It's time we can reduce our physical presence on the ground there and still perform the counterterrorism mission that keeps Americans safe."

You know, I remember Secretary Kerry saying that if the nuclear deal was abandoned that Israel would become more isolated when in fact just the opposite is now happening. They've joined hands and now they many more partners across the region. Each of those countries, those Gulf states recognize that the sheer threat from the Islamic republic of Iran is very, very real and now they are working together building out security and economic relationships and real ties between these countries.

It's the first time in nearly a week that he has left his home state of Delaware for a campaign event. In a new op-ed today Victor Davis Hanson writes this. Biden will stay sequestered, visit a key state occasionally, popped out of the plane and say he is barnstorming Michigan or Wisconsin and then fly back into hid -- into his Biden bunker for more Zoom puff interviews and hope progressive polls that he show that he can endure weekly bleeding until November 3rd. So that from Victor Davis Hanson. Here now, Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush, and former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile. Both are Fox News contributors. Good to have both of you with us today. So, with Victor Davis Hanson's words in there, Donna, you know, obviously, Vice President Biden, the former vice president spends about 90 percent of his time in Wilmington, Delaware.

I can tell you on each and every given day the voters in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, all across the country, they are not only hearing from the vice president, and perhaps they are hearing from the vice president's on Zoom and all of these virtual meeting rooms across the country. But they are hearing him on radio and they are hearing the vice president with the local TV interviews that he's doing. He's going directly where people live, where they work, where they play, and where they play."

I don't think the American people are going to like that. And at some point, I think it's going to add to the doubts of whether he's got the physical stamina and the strength to be the president of the United States. I think you put your finger on it. Kamala Harris is running around the country. He's at home. They are claiming that it's the science that's keeping him at home. It isn't. It's that they don't want him out on the campaign trail because they know that it's going to be difficult for them to project an image of strength and vitality if he does that."

In the beginning it looked like it wasn't having a major impact. Now you've got 65 percent of the country saying that they think it's a major problem. We put up a poll a little while ago that showed in Minnesota and Wisconsin voters think that this law and order issue is a major problem. One of the interesting internals here, Donna, is that, it says that, you know, most of the lean Republican folks think it's a big problem. Not surprising, right? However, non-Republicans who are black, 60 percent or another race or ethnicity, 66 percent feel this way that this is a major problem. So, when you look at Latino voters, you look at black voters, they are much stronger on being concerned about what's going on with law and order. How does that impact the Biden campaign?"

And whether it's politicized to split us apart or divide us, gun violence is violence. We're all concerned about violence whether it's rape or murder, robbery, looting. Violence is violence. And that's why it's important that not only Joe Biden -- Joe Biden condemns it but Donald Trump and everybody else, because violence is violence and we need to put an end to the violence in the United States of America.

I thought it was smart on his part the president denounced the violence against the two police officers on Las Angeles on Saturday.
