This would have been the Obama administration. People on Capitol Hill. And other elite influence, you know, makers. So, he was working in a very, very high level. And what has leaked out seems to indicate he has got a lot of information that relates specifically to uranium one. So, it's going to be very exciting and I think it's important to point out, Judge, also, remember, we already have a foreign government official saying that involving uranium one that he and his fellow government employees were extorted by the Clintons then Senator Hillary Clinton. This comes from the Kazakhs head of their atomic agency saying that Senator Clinton refused to meet with Kazakhs officials unless and until they granted uranium concessions Frank Giustra to ended up giving more than $100 million to the Clinton foundation. So we have got that testimony. We have got this new witness coming out. It's going to get very interesting here in the weeks ahead.",

So now, when members of the left leaning media or politicians like Senator Gillibrand speak out about this, it rings hollow because the time to speak out was either in the 1990s when President Clinton was in office or during the 2016 campaign when his wife was running and she ran a narrative back in the 1990s and even each last year dismissing his accusers.

The rules have changed and until people get used to the new normal, there are a lot of people like Senator Franken who are and perhaps Judge Roy Moore who are going to go down because they haven't caught up with the new rules.

I covered it on justice. I mean, it was explosive. Your facts were uncontroverted. And, yet, Hillary Clinton says, you know, it was a false charge. It was, you know, it was controverted by, you know, press reports. I mean, what was -- what is she talking about?"

The uranium one story we shared before the book became public with the investigative unit at the \"New York Times.\" they ran a 4,000 word front page piece confirming the findings, the hidden donations, the cfius approval, the Clinton's connection to this drama. Really after the book came out, Judge, the FBI did launch an investigation. And they felt there was enough compelling evidence. This has been widely reported in the \"Wall Street Journal\" and other places. They felt there was enough evidence to get the Department of Justice to grant them subpoena powers. And they were turned down by the Obama Justice Department. So, you know, her argument that this has been debunked. It hasn't been debunked. All the debunkers do, Judge, is they change the time line or they exclude facts and they say the fact pattern doesn't work because they excluded certain facts. What I have said from the beginning, you and I have talked about it. You're a seasoned prosecutor is, look, you just need to investigate and find out what happened and then you can figure out what crimes, if any, have been committed. And that is all we are calling for."

On my show, \"Justice\" one of the things I did was I talked about the fact that uranium is an essential ingredient for molly 99, which is the law in this country requires that we make in this country that we are now shipping uranium out to other countries and then paying for it. It's essential ingredient for nuclear medicine and for medical isotopes. And now it make sense to me that, you know the Russians were in such a rush to buy it, but what do you think is going to happen if this witness who was gagged and now Dianne Feinstein wants to hear from this FBI informant and is now ungagged, what do you think we're going to hear from him?"

      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to say upfront, I have not met him. I don't know him. But, what I understand by looking at legal documents involving this case. This guy was an insider's insider. He was being paid by the Russian company $50,000 a month to serve as a lobbyist. And in the legal filings, what you find is his job was to basically carry the flag for this entity in Washington, D.C. and that job included setting up meetings with high ranking administration officials. This would have been the Obama administration. People on Capitol Hill. And other elite influence, you know, makers. So, he was working in a very, very high level. And what has leaked out seems to indicate he has got a lot of information that relates specifically to uranium one. So, it's going to be very exciting and I think it's important to point out, Judge, also, remember, we already have a foreign government official saying that involving uranium one that he and his fellow government employees were extorted by the Clintons then Senator Hillary Clinton. This comes from the Kazakhs head of their atomic agency saying that Senator Clinton refused to meet with Kazakhs officials unless and until they granted uranium concessions Frank Giustra to ended up giving more than $100 million to the Clinton foundation. So we have got that testimony. We have got this new witness coming out. It's going to get very interesting here in the weeks ahead."

It is a step by step, first thing we need to do is gather all the information without having one subpoena, without having looked at any of Hillary's emails, while not looking at any personal communications, we already have the transference of money. That money being hidden, not publicized by the Clintons that they received this money at the time the deal was being approved.

The Justice Department has tried to kind of distance itself from that we saw that Attorney General Sessions made that statement well, you know, this case was criminal.

And for Hillary Clinton to sit here now and talk about how she is being pursued on political grounds, it's a laughing stalk. I think a lot of other developments that don't have anything to do with this, but have Democrats jumping ship like rats trying to get away from the Clintons, I think it's going to put them in very, very tough situation and to answer a question you asked earlier, is she scared? She should be scared, but I bet because of 30 years of getting away with stuff like this, she is not scared."

I don't think people even remember all the stories we broke earlier in the year on unmasking and the expansive laws of the NSA. Charlie brought that up. There is a lot of concern there, too. How far was the Obama administration listening in? Looking into people, political players? I mean, was it political espionage? And this is something that I think we really need to focus on. Something we really need to look at. I think when it comes to uranium one, yes, absolutely, with all the evidence out there, Peter Schweizer brought up some great points. We have evidence already. This is just more evidence. And if they don't call for an investigation, I think a lot of Americans will be asking why."

We will have an exclusive interview with Congressman Jim Jordan and Ron DeSantis. I traveled down to Washington, D.C. to ask them about the developing Clinton scandals and so much more. Plus, we'll have a new installment of \"Street Justice\" on who the sexiest man alive is again that is tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. We hope you join me tomorrow night. So have a great night.
