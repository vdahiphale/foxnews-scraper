You've been hearing a lot about the Trump Putin meeting not a summit, but I guarantee that you'll get analysis here that you're not going to find anywhere else. So stick it right here, stick with us through the hour, you don't want to miss a minute. Plus Raymond Arroyo will be here to tell you about a sick cartoon that was published by the New York Times, it is unbelievable. And back state side anti-police protests in Chicago got violent over the weekend after a police shooting. Mark Furman breaks down the surprising revelation in the officers' body camp footage. And Judge Jeanine will tell us how things are only going to get worse for those anti-Trump texting FBI lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. But first, Trump and Putin go to Helsinki, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For three hours today, President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met a summit in Helsinki. And though the meeting's now in the history books, the fall out and the political tax have just begun. Now so much of the commentary today was devoid of even the slightest hint of context or history, so we thought we'd try to rectify that tonight. He was following a strategy that he's used effectively with Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea and the President of course was gracious and chummy with Vladimir Putin today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } President Trump prefers to turn on the charm in person while using the hammer and sickle behind the scenes.

We don't know yet because we don't have the transcript, and honestly, I don't know why we don't and we probably should. But I think it would be fascinating to see the two of them together testifying and finding out what her interpretation was and his, although with this is plain English.

You've been hearing a lot about the Trump Putin meeting not a summit, but I guarantee that you'll get analysis here that you're not going to find anywhere else. So stick it right here, stick with us through the hour, you don't want to miss a minute. Plus Raymond Arroyo will be here to tell you about a sick cartoon that was published by the New York Times, it is unbelievable. And back state side anti-police protests in Chicago got violent over the weekend after a police shooting. Mark Furman breaks down the surprising revelation in the officers' body camp footage. And Judge Jeanine will tell us how things are only going to get worse for those anti-Trump texting FBI lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. But first, Trump and Putin go to Helsinki, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. For three hours today, President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met a summit in Helsinki. And though the meeting's now in the history books, the fall out and the political tax have just begun. Now so much of the commentary today was devoid of even the slightest hint of context or history, so we thought we'd try to rectify that tonight. He was following a strategy that he's used effectively with Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea and the President of course was gracious and chummy with Vladimir Putin today. President Trump prefers to turn on the charm in person while using the hammer and sickle behind the scenes. But the president made his objective clear, he was there to begin a true reset of our relationship with Russia."

Did he cancel future sales of lethal weapons to the Ukraine? Of course he didn't. But he might as well have given the media and Liberal hyperbole on what happened today. Today's Obama's CIA director John Brennan tweeted in part, ‘Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki rises and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors. It was nothing short of treasonous' Why doesn't anybody laugh about that? And why did not one call it surrender, by the way, when in 2009 President Obama nicks the UN missile defense shield that was to be built in Poland. Was that a surrender to Putin? Or was it a surrender or collusion when Obama asked Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev for a little favor until the 2012 election was over?"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I mean they're holding hand and practically spooning. What was that? A profile in patriotism? I don't recall the media kicking up a fuss when Obama joined the Cuban dictator Raoul Castro for a baseball game or normalize relations with that murderous regime, by the way, a puppet of Russia. Now you can also say this, Trump clearly should not have created any semblance of moral equivalency between our intelligence, even if it has its flaws it does, and the assurances of Vladimir Putin. As the recent indictments of Russian agents alleged, there was meddling in the election by partisan members of congressional panels concluded that, so did our director of national intelligence. But it also, no sense, that it affected the outcome of the 2016 election and no Americans were named in last week's indictment. So President Trump probably should have said it that way, addressed it that way. Instead he kind of committed an unforced error. But look, the president is right, at the same time be frustrated by the anvil that the deep state has hung around his neck for two years now. First the elements within the FBI, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok and now Mueller and his ever expanding team. And we know inside the DOJ they basically protected Hillary Clinton while attempting to damn and undermine the legitimacy of Trump's election. And this gnaws at the president and it perhaps explains why he let those wounds get the better of him today. But it is a good thing to improve our relationship with Russia and at the same time we cannot appear to buy their obvious deception while we're standing on the world stage. I'm doing a lot of well, at the same times, but this is a complicated thing and I think while insulting Putin on camera like doing that, Donald Trump versus Vladimir Putin on a total insult fest, that wouldn't have accomplished anything. At the same time, there are other subtler ways to make our concerns and our objections known and the president should have taken that path. US national intelligence director Dan Coats issued a statement in the wake of the summit today. He said the following, \"We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy. And we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security\" Now setting aside the overly dramatic reactions and even the president's at times poor and unfortunate word choice, let's look for a moment at what Trump is substantively doing vis-.-vis Russia. He's building up the military, key. At a NATO Summit, he called out the German-Russian Nord Stream pipeline. In March of this year he imposed sanctions on five Russian entities and 19 individuals for interfering in the 2016 election. The media don't like to remind you of that one of course, that doesn't fit their narrative. And of course he closed the Russian conflict in Seattle. And as I eluded to earlier, he expelled Russian diplomats and suspected spies, 60 of them. So if Trump is Putin's poodle. He has a real weir way of showing it. As writer Russell Meade said in American Interests last year, if Trump really was a Russian mole, he would be doing things like the following, limiting tracking as much as possible. Blocking oil and gas pipelines. Cutting U.S. military spending and trying to tamp down tensions with Russia's ally Iran. But Trump's doing none of that so the selective indignation on the left is truly hilarious. They keep changing their stories. For decades, they favored a conciliatory stance first toward the Soviet Union, then toward the Russian Federation. And now they're all pretending to care about Russia and casting Trump as a Putin surrogate. But it's good to remember just a few years ago how certain Liberals reacted when then presidential candidate Mitt Romney suggested that Russia was a foe."

So despite some of these verbal missteps, the president has already put us, I think, in a better position by engaging Russia and opening dialogue. It's just a start and that's the Angle.

The idea that we have Liberals calling for open warfare is absurd. By the same token, it's fair to criticize the president today. He had some errant answers. He gave some answers that are actually uncoupled from his own foreign policy. I think if we go back to what important, looking at the policy, I think he's got it dead on right."

      "utterance": "Well as you had said Laura, the selective outrage of the Liberal media is breath-taking to behold. They criticize President Trump onus as if he was sending $150 billion on a palette to Iran, for example. But in fact our polices directed against Russia are considerably stronger than they were a decade ago and it's starting to tell. Another key point that perhaps you missed was that our present energy policy. Our energy policy of increasing our exploiting of natural gas to Northern Europe is in fact undercutting Russian natural gas and hurting them where they live. It's depriving President Putin of the revenue he needs from mischief making abroad. So our polices are working and in this case, deeds speak stronger than the occasional gaps of the US president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yeah Scott I think if Donald Trump were up there and just started lobbying insults at Putin, I think that gives Putin a real PR victory at home. Because he can go home and say, \"Look we've gotten so much under their skin. Look I stood up to the President\" But you use that for your nationalist gains at home. I lived in the Soviet Union in the old days in 1983 for a semester in college and that was when Andropov was president, that was in the real dark days of the quickie presidential terms back then. But the idea that he was just going lobby insults at him, that is just ridiculous, unrealistic. We don't do that with President Xi, Obama didn't and as far as I can tell neither did Bush. We rolled out the red carpet and China took 50 million of our personnel files during the Obama administration, I've never even heard him talk about it."

That was during the Cold War now we're post-Cold War, we still have challenges, but now they want to get tough on Russia. I was just howling at those because for those of us who were around this town in the 80s and if we worked in the Reagan administration, you couldn't get a break with the left and is dealings with the Soviet Union.

And I think we've really really run the limits on absolute Trump derangement syndrome across the board on how people react to this kind of thing. But really I think the President was trying to do two hard things at one time today and it might have been what's tripped up some of the communications. I agree completely on the strategy side of it that you got in the Angle. He's restoring realism, trying to get great power relations back on track, balancing one power against another to try to solve real problems. The proof of this is results, not in instantaneous sound bites but he's also the deal maker. He wants something now and he's jumping in there and I think the deal maker in him used some traits there in the presser that complicated things.

But Monica look some of these points are well taken and I think all panel here all believes that China here is the real threat to the United States long-term militarily, it's the largest standing army. The economy's going to dwarf ours, stealing our technology, the South China Sea, they're moving into Africa and beyond. But nevertheless Obama back in 2016 I think it was October or December of 2016, he was talking about the fact that he didn't confront Vladimir Putin on this Russian meddling when he could have confronted it as president. Listen to what he said."

You don't get anything from the Russians by shaming them, I think that gives Putin a huge victory at home. Ariel might disagree but Monica your shot at this, Obama was kind of interesting what he said there bit the media seemed to forget this."

The Obama administration was made aware including all the way up to the president himself, certainly during the spring months and then later of 2016, that the Russians were engaged in these active measures to disrupt the American electoral process. What we also forget is that the Russians targeted the Republican National Committee servers and their sort of computerized systems. They weren't able to penetrate those but they were able to penetrate the DNC's. The idea somehow that all of this is new, we know that the Russians have been actively engaged in trying to disrupt American elections, Western elections, really since the advent of the cold war. What different now is that they have these cyber capabilities that take it to a whole other level."

And so while I really support the president's attempt to try and press the reset button with the Russian relationship unlike Mrs Clinton and President Obama and they're failed attempt, I support the overall effort. But the core strength of the American president's power is his moral authority and I would have liked to have seen a stronger public statement on behalf of the president to condemn this. I mean we remember in 2009 Laura, when the Iranian people rose up against the Iranian regime, we pounded President Obama for not at least speaking a word of moral support for them. I would have liked to have seen the president give some moral statement against what the Russians have done, not just to us but to our allies."

He didn't actually say that Crimea is Russian. He didn't actually say the Americans are going to stop military exercises in the Baltic. He didn't actually say the Americans are going to pull troops out of Syria. For all of the moral equivalency and the statecraft that he should not of done, the fact that the content of the U.S.-Russian relations today are exactly the same as they were yesterday, and that is an appropriate thing."

      "speaker": "CRAIG SHIRLEY, REAGAN HISTORIAN",
      "utterance": "Sure. Thank you, Laura. It reminded me in some ways of Kennedy at Vienna with Khrushchev in 1961. They got into a free for all debate over the merits of the western system versus the east. Kennedy couldn't mount an effective defense of the free market or democracy, and Khrushchev came away from the summit very, very unimpressed with Kennedy's performance, which a lot of people thought -- a lot of a historians thought at the time emboldened Khrushchev to keep going with the Berlin crisis and later build the wall, and later thereafter to put missiles into Cuba. Fortunately Kennedy found his steel and forced the missiles out. But it was a disastrous summit by all accounts. Obviously Yalta, also for FDR was also a disaster. He went in there thinking Joe Stalin was a good guy, I'm going to give him what he wants, and I'm not going to ask anything in return. And we ceded millions of people to the eastern bloc, millions of people in now the Warsaw Pact countries who ended up living under enslavement under the Soviet Union for many years."

    {
      "speaker": "SHIRLEY",
      "utterance": "Nixon gave too much away to Brezhnev. Nixon and Kissinger were interested in a good photo op, they were interested in the trophy on the wall. Nixon gave grain sales to the Soviets, he gave loan guarantees to the Soviets, didn't really ask anything in return. That was the point, is that Reagan understood what these other presidents didn't understand. The Soviets will take and take and take until you draw a line in the sand. Back in 1964 Reagan understood this in his famous speech for Barry Goldwater. This is that the Soviet Union -- and he knew this from his days in Hollywood fighting off Soviet provocateurs with the Hollywood trade unions -- is the Soviets will never stop until somebody stands up to them. And that is what Reagan understood, what FDR only understood in the last couple weeks of his life where he admitted to a reporter before he passed away that it was a mistake to trust Joseph Stalin. Carter found out he was dismay it was a mistake to trust Brezhnev because within weeks of the SALT-II treaty being signed the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. That's what Trump needs to understand is that the culture, whether it's a Soviets or the Russians, it doesn't matter. They respect strength, they abhor weakness, and you have to deal with them for a position of strength."

And it's just a fact of life. He should have dealt with my position of strength and not undermined his own intelligence agencies. He can clean this up. Kennedy cleaned it up, FDR didn't, obviously, he passed away. But he can make amends, he can make repairs to this. The point, I think, Laura, is that the mistakes that Trump may today aren't earthshaking."

It's an approach and tone, which, it is what it is now but he didn't agree to substantive caves is on key issues. We have a pretty realistic, tough approach to Russia. And he just thinks we should try to figure out ways to work together, which is what Obama said, Bush said, Clinton wanted, they all wanted this. And none of it came too much fruition. But Craig, the historical part of this is so important, and I so much appreciate you joining us tonight. If it didn't happen in \"The New York Times\" today, most people think it never happened. So we really appreciate your insight. Thanks so much.

On July 7th -- or 6th, rather, they posted a story, \"Why Scarlett Johansson should not play a transman.\" She was about to play transgendered man and a movie. Now, their argument was you can't have someone who is not transgendered playing a transgendered character. So why is it OK to have two straight men in what is essentially a gay romantic comedy?

      "utterance": "Two-hundred-and-sixty-one, that's how many people have been murdered in Chicago this year, and most of it happening in minority communities on the city's west and south sides. It's an ongoing American tragedy, yet you don't see many protests demanding change. Unless of course a police officer is involved. And on Saturday, officers shot and killed 37-year-old Harith Augustus following a confrontation. A violent protest quickly broke out, and Chicago police say four officers were injured from the demonstrators throwing rocks and bottles, some of which were filled with urine. Police swiftly released body cam footage of the encounter which appears to show Mr. Augustus with a holstered gun around his waist. Protests continued tonight, however. Joining me now for reaction is former LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman. So Mark, based on what you have seen in this body cam footage, I've had a chance to watch it a couple of times, do you think these protesters tonight have a legitimate beef?"

Just like in the Michael Brown shooting, you have a false narrative of his hands were up, he was running away, not running towards the officer, but there was nobody camera. Now Superintendent Johnson in Chicago immediately released, something that is really out of protocol and really actually harms an investigation, but he did it do try to save exactly what is happening. And this body cam is the view of an officer in a tactical situation that is crystal clear, something that you will rarely ever see again, crystal-clear, and everything there is the evidence that points to a justified police shooting. I am in shock that the public in Chicago is up in arms about this man acting as he did, armed, with four officers."

They call for the mayor's resignation -- I am no fan of Rahm Emanuel, but they are calling for his resignation tonight, the resignation of other top city officials, saying they are violating the ongoing I guess consent decree with the government. There is real damage done again, and everyone seems to be afraid to call this what it is. It's crime and reaction to an unfortunate, awful situation. But a lot of these protests turn into criminal activity over the weekend."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. But let's not forget the suspect precipitated his own death. He had many opportunities where he didn't have to have to die, and he chose to do what he did, and he did die. But when you look at this narrative of Black Lives Matter, it is the boy who cried wolf. And pretty soon nobody is going to listen when there is really an incident where they actually should take up protests and actually demonstrate their power to actually get justice. This is not the case."

They're not going to believe the video that is released, they don't believe that. You see stuff online that's all fake, it's a fake video made by the police, it's not really what happened. It's another Laquan McDonald situation."

      "speaker": "FUHRMAN",
      "utterance": "The police and the city government of Chicago should just ignore them then. If they are not going to be reasonable and look at body cam footage, you can't do anything more with police officers then put a camera on their chest and have you view what the officer views and actually see the action the officer takes against the suspect and the reaction of the suspect. You can't do anything more. If they are not satisfied with that, then stop placating their demands. Just stop listening."

And your book dovetails perfectly into what we have seen with Strzok and Page.

And my book, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals\" talks about Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, and all of these people at the higher echelon of the FBI. But you know what's amazing to me. This guy, Peter Strzok, goes before Congress, and in an unapologetic, defiant, sarcastic, smug way, says none of you Congressmen and women, you can't believe your lying eyes, just because I said it, I didn't mean what I said, when in truth, what he said as the textbook definition of bias. So now we've got Lisa Page. And some of these congresspeople are more effusive about her, finding her to be more credible. That's no surprise. There was very little of what Strzok said that was credible. But what was so telling to me, Laura, was they said that there was a suggestion that based upon her testimony, the FBI desired a specific outcome. We don't know yet because we don't have the transcript, and honestly, I don't know why we don't and we probably should. But I think it would be fascinating to see the two of them together testifying and finding out what her interpretation was and his, although with this is plain English. We can both read it and figure out what they were saying. They don't like Donald Trump, they didn't want him elected, and the insurance policy was to prevent him from getting elected, or in the event he got elected, making sure that he would be faced with some kind of investigation, which would be the basis for impeachment."

He said \"Remarkably, we learned new information today suggesting the DOJ had not notified Lisa Page of Congress' outstanding interview request for over seven months now. The DOJ/FBI appeared to be continuing their efforts to keep material facts and perhaps even witnesses from Congress.\" Judge Jeanine, your reaction to that? That's a wild revelation. I don't think we should have any reason to lie about that. She would be held in contempt if she didn't show up on Friday and continuing today, but they didn't tell her?"

But we've got a Department of Justice now, Laura, and an FBI that is covering its tracks, that is more interested in protecting its own flanks and not being exposed than it is in confronting and identifying the truth. And unfortunately, we've got a Department of Justice run by a guy named Rod Rosenstein who was part of the swamp. He's part of the establishment. And so for them not to tell Lisa Page she was subpoenaed doesn't surprise me at all. You've got to clean house and that's the end of it, Laura. And I worry that it's not going to happen."

What do they want to say? Do they want to just admit they came here illegally and were not seeking asylum in the first place? If, as everyone on the left has been telling us, they are here for asylum, you and I both know they could have gone to port of entry. Now the judge is buying into it, saying I'm going to let them decide if they really want asylum. No, they just want to come illegal, judge -- they either want asylum or they should be deported."
