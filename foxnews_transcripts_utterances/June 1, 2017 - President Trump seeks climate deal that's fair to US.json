The climate pack seeks to reduce the amount of worldwide pollution emissions.

So, I don't know if he got hoodwinked or he wanted to knock America down to size. But, it caused $3 trillion and you lose 6 million jobs.

Obviously, it's not capitalism works. Trump said something very specific. He loves the American worker. There's nothing wrong with that. And I think Democrats used to understand that, they don't anymore. He's not beholden to foreign capitals, he's beholding to the constitution.

It's a non-binding agreement, which means it really is useless and also it's a bad deal. It's a -- as Jesse pointed out, it's so absurdly expensive for a negligible increase.

Now, you're watching everybody going crazy over this. All he said was, it's a bad deal. If it becomes a better deal, I'll go in. He's like the guy who walked into the showroom and said -- he looked at the car, he says, \"That's too expensive. You know what, give me a call, I'll come back.\" That's exactly what he did. Or another metaphor is, he went to a party, realized the party sucked, and said, \"I don't need to be here.

It's called \"Conservatism is soiled by scowling primitives.\" He writes, \"Today, conservativoism is soiled by scowling primitives whose irritable gestures lack mental ingredients. America needs a reminder of conservatism before vulgarians hijacked it.\" Fair enough, but should one engage hijacked conservatives by calling the people that they might support \"scowling primitives\"? Something tells me isn't about George giving advice, but flexing his intellectual muscles. Anyway, I'm seeing a lot of this. Conservatives go after Trump and his supporters often using a tone of knowing mockery. It's not that you're wrong but you're also stupid. You know who else does this? Trump apostles.

It's 9 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" President Trump today fulfilled a controversial and major campaign promise by pulling the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. The climate pack seeks to reduce the amount of worldwide pollution emissions. But the president said it imposes far too heavy a burden on America's economy and that it's unfair to America's workers."

They don't put America first. I do. And I always will. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All -- kaboom is right, that's the less reaction if you listen to the television today. I mean, we went from leading from behind to America first today. Let's remember this Paris deal was negotiated by none other than Barack Obama, not the best dealmaker if you look at Bergdahl, Obamacare and the Iran deal. So anything he does is suspect. So, I don't know if he got hoodwinked or he wanted to knock America down to size. But, it caused $3 trillion and you lose 6 million jobs. And to, what, hypothetically bring the temperature down a fraction of a degree in 100 years seems pretty stupid to me. And, India and China, they can continue to push coal, they receive taxpayer money, and they can increase emissions. Meanwhile, we can't do any of that. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I think spreading the wealth schemes don't work. If they did, Venezuela would be a paradise. Obviously, it's not capitalism works. Trump said something very specific. He loves the American worker. There's nothing wrong with that. And I think Democrats used to understand that, they don't anymore. He's not beholden to foreign capitals, he's beholding to the constitution. If Obama wanted this done, he would've sent it to the Senate for ratification. You know, Democrats can't control their emotions, let alone the temperature in 100 years. The same people that were saying Hillary was going to be elected in November are telling us what the weather is going be like. I don't think so."

He's already expended a lot of political capital. He's not very popular. He could have gotten strange new respect from the left by letting this go. He could have agreed with his daughter. It's a non-binding agreement, which means it really is useless and also it's a bad deal. It's a -- as Jesse pointed out, it's so absurdly expensive for a negligible increase. Up to $200 trillion over a century will cut 1 percent of the carbon target, which is a 2 Celsius reduction in global temperature. So, in order to reach their ideal, you would need to multiply 200 trillion by 100 trillion or something like 200 by 100, which we don't even have. So it's carbon cutting is a farce. The impact of this deal is negligible, but it will destroy economies. So, what he did was actually brave in the sense that he didn't have to do it, he could've just not followed through. Now, you're watching everybody going crazy over this. All he said was, it's a bad deal. If it becomes a better deal, I'll go in. He's like the guy who walked into the showroom and said -- he looked at the car, he says, \"That's too expensive. You know what, give me a call, I'll come back.\" That's exactly what he did. Or another metaphor is, he went to a party, realized the party sucked, and said, \"I don't need to be here. Maybe there's a better party.\" So the idea that this is somehow an awful thing is hysterical. If you're going to lose your crap over this, you are lying, you're a liar. This is not bad."

You just have to say that you do and then everybody will like you.\" And he's like, \"Oh, really, is that how that works?\""

I don't think this is a deal that anybody should be crying about. Like we said, it's nonbinding. And the United States is already a clean energy, oil and gas leader. So, we can keep doing what we're doing. We can keep reducing our admissions. Why would we, in fact, put ourselves at an economic disadvantage, giving and subsidizing an economic windfall to other countries and sort of a climate redistribution of wealth scheme? It makes no sense to me. I think he did the brave and courageous thing. And in fact, I told him that this morning at 8:00 a.m. when he called. And I spoke to him about it.

A Never Trumper is right on many of Trump's flaws. A Trump apostle is right that the president needs support. A Never Trumper is wrong to think Trump isn't trying to do right by Americans. A Trump apostle is wrong to deny serious obvious mistakes. Fact is, sticking to one perception creates a forced purity of thought that blinds you to realities which then keeps you from offering constructive criticism that might help a leader who actually could use it. So never say never and stop saying always. History shows that lockstep is always a march to disaster. At least I can say that today, the Never Trumpers and pro Trumpers united under the -- over the lefty meltdown."

So, there's a lot that they want to do together, health care reform, tax reform, infrastructure plans, et cetera, that it just takes a lot of granular work.

That should be something it grabs the attention of all Americans in terms of a privacy grab and surveillance which is, you know, one of the basic things that we hold near to our hearts and dear in this country. We fought for our liberty, our freedoms, our privacy rights. And here we've seen, you know, evidence, suggestion that this actually has occurred. So, I think it's important that they conduct the investigation and really get to the bottom of this and it can't just be swept away with just an inordinate amount of focus on Russia collusion with so far we have no evidence of."

Look, if Susan Rice, Brennan, and now Samantha Power, I mean, she's not even at all affiliated with the intelligence community so what was she doing submitting unmasking requests? So remember, there's paperwork for each unmasking request. They're going to, under oath, asked them why'd you do it. If they take the fifth, if they perjure themselves or they give some sort of partisan reason or unmasking these Trump people and then were disseminating classified information, we have a full-blown political spying scandal on our hands and that's a big deal."

What were the reasons why and let's just get answers to all of it. And I do wonder -- I do think the Nunes thing is bizarre because if you say you're going to take a step back and then you're issuing subpoenas without talking to your partisan counterpart, in this case the Democrats, I do think that that is a little strange."
