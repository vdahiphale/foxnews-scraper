      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is 'The Ingraham Angle.' Of course, I say this every night, but we really do have a lot of breaking news from the Nation's Capital tonight. Just in the last few hours, you heard Hannity hit on some of this, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee has released thousands of pages of closed-door interviews with top Obama officials. It's like Christmas we've been calling through them for you and you will not believe what former AG Loretta Lynch said about spying, yes indeed. John Yoo and Joe Diare here in moments to discuss the latest. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight Victor Davis Hanson is going to tell us how Obama's Intel Chiefs are now turning on each other. It's like something out of you know the Serengeti, they're turning on each other. Plus he details where the real obstruction lies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we sent our cameras to a rally held in Times Square today calling for Congresswoman Ilhan Omar to be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and one of the men leading that effort will join us tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, rinse and repeat, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now as Joe Biden continues to dominate these early months of the 2020 presidential race, the other Democrat candidates are - they are left to pick up whatever table scraps they can get. Poor old Beto thinks that taking ear hair and white privilege will make him relevant again. Kamala is trying a reset, Corey a rebrand, and Kirsten a reframe. And then there's Mayor Pete, who desperately needs a Reboot-I- Gieg. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well,but of course, he's oblivious about his own deficiencies as a candidate, because he usually glides through interviews, rarely facing tough questions. Now last night he appeared on this network for a town hall event in front of a studio audience that included a lot of supporters. Now when he wasn't pushing for tax increases or lobbying lame cheap shots, he was trying to pass off political pabulum as some type of high-minded oratory. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I think somewhere Cecil Rhodes is muttering that he wants a scholarship back. I think I was ahead of the curve a few months ago when I called out Buttigieg for sounding just as judgmental and sanctimonious as some of the Christians whose faith he was questioning. Last August he derided President Trump as basically a disgraced game show host and a Vice President Pence he said this, \"A social extremist, the likes of which our country has not known in national politics\".

It's you can't do it. You got to treat the people like they deserve to be treated. But forget Mayor Pete, maybe we should call him Pope Pete, because don't you love how he - because he attends church we're supposed to treat him as the be-all and end-all moral authority or the arbiter of who is and who is not operating in good faith.

I'd ask him really serious tough questions. And I'd ask him to tell us more about his parents, specifically his father's Marxist pedigree. And tell us the glories of socialism that family members - your dad may be champion as a professor, and were you steeped in those at home? I think the country would like to know. You have plenty of time to share all of your truth while on the road, especially given how little time Pete Buttigieg seems to spend in South Bend these days.

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is 'The Ingraham Angle.' Of course, I say this every night, but we really do have a lot of breaking news from the Nation's Capital tonight. Just in the last few hours, you heard Hannity hit on some of this, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee has released thousands of pages of closed-door interviews with top Obama officials. It's like Christmas we've been calling through them for you and you will not believe what former AG Loretta Lynch said about spying, yes indeed. John Yoo and Joe Diare here in moments to discuss the latest. Also tonight Victor Davis Hanson is going to tell us how Obama's Intel Chiefs are now turning on each other. It's like something out of you know the Serengeti, they're turning on each other. Plus he details where the real obstruction lies. And we sent our cameras to a rally held in Times Square today calling for Congresswoman Ilhan Omar to be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and one of the men leading that effort will join us tonight. But first, rinse and repeat, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now as Joe Biden continues to dominate these early months of the 2020 presidential race, the other Democrat candidates are - they are left to pick up whatever table scraps they can get. Poor old Beto thinks that taking ear hair and white privilege will make him relevant again. Kamala is trying a reset, Corey a rebrand, and Kirsten a reframe. And then there's Mayor Pete, who desperately needs a Reboot-I- Gieg. Well,but of course, he's oblivious about his own deficiencies as a candidate, because he usually glides through interviews, rarely facing tough questions. Now last night he appeared on this network for a town hall event in front of a studio audience that included a lot of supporters. Now when he wasn't pushing for tax increases or lobbying lame cheap shots, he was trying to pass off political pabulum as some type of high-minded oratory."

And it does call for that longer view. So everybody's got different attributes that they bring. One of the ones I bring, I think, is the possibility of that kind of generational shift."

I think somewhere Cecil Rhodes is muttering that he wants a scholarship back. I think I was ahead of the curve a few months ago when I called out Buttigieg for sounding just as judgmental and sanctimonious as some of the Christians whose faith he was questioning. Last August he derided President Trump as basically a disgraced game show host and a Vice President Pence he said this, \"A social extremist, the likes of which our country has not known in national politics\". Wow, so much for those conservative family values. Beyond his Boy Scout demeanor and mayor peach dig (ph) Buttigieg is but another creation of a media apparatus desperate to oust Trump. And, as I'm sure, you saw again and again on the other networks, he showed this unattractive strain last night. But it's hard to patronize and condescend your way to winning the nomination. It's you can't do it. You got to treat the people like they deserve to be treated. But forget Mayor Pete, maybe we should call him Pope Pete, because don't you love how he - because he attends church we're supposed to treat him as the be-all and end-all moral authority or the arbiter of who is and who is not operating in good faith. So he finds conservative media objectionable, but third trimester abortions - well, they're perfectly moral."

Now look this is all giving aid and comfort to the kind of modern-day Taliban, the Destroyers of history, the people who rather than learning from the sins and shadows of history, prefer to simply strike the names and the images of our past from the public square. That way you short-circuit debate altogether. All right, they're not purging them from the history books, just from your sight line and from everyday life, so you don't see it anymore. How magnanimous some of them. Now I'd be delighted to have Mayor Buttigieg on 'The Ingraham Angle,' I'll treat them fairly, but I'm not going to let him traffic in the generalities about complex issues that I've heard him speak about such as China or religious liberty. I'd ask him really serious tough questions. And I'd ask him to tell us more about his parents, specifically his father's Marxist pedigree. And tell us the glories of socialism that family members - your dad may be champion as a professor, and were you steeped in those at home? I think the country would like to know. You have plenty of time to share all of your truth while on the road, especially given how little time Pete Buttigieg seems to spend in South Bend these days. According to a new report in the South Bend Tribune, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg was out of town for nearly half the days in recent months. And then in response to reporters' questions for his calendars, they asked him to produce his calendars, this is what the South Bend Tribune said. \"His administration responded by providing a calendar in which 45 of the 120 days were redacted. Other days didn't indicate whether it was in town and some were blank\". Well, that's very transparent of him. Look, if you can't show up for the city you're pledged to serve, what confidence can the American people have that you're going to show up for them. In good faith, that's THE ANGLE. All right joining me now to react, Dan Bongino, Fox News Contributor and Author of the upcoming book \"Exonerated: The Failed Takedown of The President Donald Trump by The Swamp\"; and Chris Hahn, Radio Talk Show Host and Former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer. Dan, Buttigieg is just one of many of the 2020 radicals, and they're trying to kind of - they're trying to take the moral questions for their own, and he in particular has been pretty deft at doing that to a fairly, I think, favorable press."

Mike Pence who publicly praised him, even though they were of different parties, said he had work with him when Pence was the Governor of Indiana. And then what does Buttigieg do in one of the most disgusting political moves I've ever seen, he turns around and attacks him and starts a fake fight with a guy, who even though he's of a different political party, Pence had praised his working relationship with him when he was the Governor of Indiana.

According to the Justice Department and lower courts that have looked at this, the aides that are closest to the President, like the Chief of Staff, the National Security Advisor and the White House Counsel they're basically extensions of the President himself. And so just like Congress can't drag President Trump to testify before it, because that would show disrespect to a coordinate branch of government, it'd be like it's of Congress drag Chief Justice John Roberts before it to testify, they can't do that either. So too you can't drag the closest aides to the President in front of Congress and force them to answer questions. Second, the Justice Department makes a very good point which is if Congress really want to harass the President and prevent him from doing his job doing the business of the country, it could just subpoena and keep bringing all of these staff before it."

Now these were interviews that were conducted with a number of Obama era folks, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now here's one interesting exchange. This is Nadler questioning her. I think this is in December of last year. \"Do you believe the FBI or DOJ ever investigated the Trump campaign for political purposes?\" Lynch says, \"I know they did not\" Nadler then says, \"And how would you have reacted if you had received a request of this nature from any presidential administration?\" She says, \"I would have declined it and told them how inappropriate it\".

The fact that they have to lie about it now after denying it, just shows you how bad off they are and how frightened they are a Bill Barr. And John, real quick there's also an issue with what Comey claimed Loretta Lynch said about the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. And this is another quote from the December 19th interview. She said, \"I was quite surprised that Comey characterized it in this way. We did have a conversation about it, so I wasn't surprised that he remembered that we met and talked about it. But I was quite surprised that that this was his characterization of it, because that was not how I conveyed it to him, certainly not how it was intended.\" calling the probe a matter instead of an investigation.

As you can tell, you're suggesting Laura, neither Comey nor Loretta Lynch now wants to take responsibility for essentially clearing Hillary Clinton. But one of them did, because they're both in charge. The FBI and that Justice Department they're in charge and they shouldn't, I don't think, have ever gone public and cleared her in the first place.
