      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". Buckle up. Busy news night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tonight, the investigation into the Russia witch hunt, it is now ramping up in a big way because developing tonight, it appears now in the coming weeks, Christopher Steele will reportedly be interviewed by U.S. officials. This is a big deal, a massive development, and this is part of what we have been waiting for. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You, we, the American people, we will now get and we deserve the answers from Steele. He is at the very heart of what is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American political history. The guy who literally put together the bought and paid for dossier with Russian lives and he could blow the entire investigation into the deep state wide open. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But as we all know by now, he was the former's five from Great Britain. He was paid for by the Clinton campaign, by the DNC. Remember they funneled money, filtered it through a law firm, Perkins Coie, and then they hired Fusion GPS, an op research firm, all to dig up Russian dirt on Donald Trump. Simultaneously, of course, being compensated by the FBI, at the same time, for his salacious lying material which according to \"The New York Times\" was likely Russian disinformation, the entire time. And then Steele later testified under the threat of perjury that the dossier was unverifiable and he had no idea any of it, any of it was true. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, he was only -- as he said 50/50 on whether or not this intel was at all reliable. We know payments also for multiple sources for the same Russian dossier full of lies. Get this, while he was being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton and Comey's FBI, guess else, Steele is working with the Putin-linked Russian oligarch and being paid by him for the same lying information. This all happening at the height of the 2016 election. Christopher Steele was able to literally disseminate his unverifiable Russian lies, not only throughout the highest levels of our government, the FBI, the CIA, NSA, Obama's DOJ, even creepy, sleepy Joe Biden but at the very same time, this information was selectively leaked, through news media, the Trumpet hating media mob and many outlets in the country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, in fact, they were disseminating the information, why? To help Hillary win the election. In other words, to point out false Russian lies so that Hillary would win in 2016. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, how Robert Mueller ignored this Russian disinformation, but he had time for FARA violations, loan applications, taxi medallions and tax violations as Tucker, Michael Caputo was just talking about, that raises a lot of questions about Mueller's priorities. But as a result, he has ignited the left's Russian hysteria and gave the deep state a vehicle to weaponize this country's most powerful tools of intelligence that we entrust to them to protect us. And yet, they would turn on the American people and they were turned on the presidential candidacy known as Donald Trump, and all of his allies. James Comey use Steele's dirty dossier, remember, he signed the first FISA application. It was the bulk of information coming from the unverified dossier against Donald Trump to secure that FISA warrant, which became a backdoor into spying on the entire Trump campaign, later the Trump transition team and then the Trump presidency. And Comey also directed an international spying campaign using informants undercover agents, even blond bombshell to monitor three different Trump campaign aides, Carter Page, Sam Clovis, and, of course, George Papadopoulos. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then-NSA Director James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, they allegedly promoted the dossier inside and outside of the U.S. government. Clapper is accused of leaking Steele salacious material to his current employer, fake news CNN. And despite all of this, Hillary Clinton lost in an electoral landslide. And, now, by the way, she has a lot to answer for herself. What did she know? When did she know it? Because as John Solomon writes, quote: Never before until 2016 have the apparatus of a U.S. presidential candidate managed to sic the weight of the FBI, the U.S. intelligence community on a rival nominee during an election and by using a foreign fed, uncorrupted, unverified political opposition research document. And let me get back to this monologue in a minute. But, first, joining us with more details on this new discovery is \"The Hill's\" investigative reporter, John Solomon. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } John, this now goes deeper. The question is, why Steele now is agreeing to talk? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He may like to talk a littler bit about what they were doing, what he knew, how he represented the information to the FBI and try to clear his name in some way. At the end of the day, though, this is one step towards a much bigger person who needs to be questioned. And that is Hillary Clinton. As I wrote this morning: Hillary Clinton has for the last 18 months escaped any scrutiny from Congress and from the American media. Hasn't been asked any of the questions, when did you know, who did you know, did you know Steele was going to the FBI? Did you know your lawyer was going to James Baker and feeding this information? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She's escaped that scrutiny and it's remarkable because it's been 18 months now that Hillary -- we learned first that Hillary Clinton had funded the dossier and right after that, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a request for documents and answers, she's never answered. She's thumbed her notes to the Senate. So, we need to get answers to know how high up in the Clinton campaign this entire conspiracy was known and executed it. Christopher Steele can start us on that path but I think Hillary Clinton ultimately has to answer the questions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And as we speak, there are now multiple investigations underway, as the Attorney General Barr is working hard to hold our government bureaucracy accountable, to fix this mess that were created by some. Those that would rig an investigation, those that try to rig with Russian lies a presidential election, those that try to bludgeon and unseat a duly elected president. And the same cannot be said for House Democrats. They clearly are more interested in a political circus designed to smear the president, all in advance of the 2020 election. There you have House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler set to call John Dean of Watergate fame to testify in the Mueller report. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } John Dean, the star and witness in Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". Buckle up. Busy news night. Tonight, the investigation into the Russia witch hunt, it is now ramping up in a big way because developing tonight, it appears now in the coming weeks, Christopher Steele will reportedly be interviewed by U.S. officials. This is a big deal, a massive development, and this is part of what we have been waiting for. You, we, the American people, we will now get and we deserve the answers from Steele. He is at the very heart of what is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American political history. The guy who literally put together the bought and paid for dossier with Russian lives and he could blow the entire investigation into the deep state wide open. But as we all know by now, he was the former's five from Great Britain. He was paid for by the Clinton campaign, by the DNC. Remember they funneled money, filtered it through a law firm, Perkins Coie, and then they hired Fusion GPS, an op research firm, all to dig up Russian dirt on Donald Trump. Simultaneously, of course, being compensated by the FBI, at the same time, for his salacious lying material which according to \"The New York Times\" was likely Russian disinformation, the entire time. And then Steele later testified under the threat of perjury that the dossier was unverifiable and he had no idea any of it, any of it was true. Now, he was only -- as he said 50/50 on whether or not this intel was at all reliable. We know payments also for multiple sources for the same Russian dossier full of lies. Get this, while he was being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton and Comey's FBI, guess else, Steele is working with the Putin-linked Russian oligarch and being paid by him for the same lying information. This all happening at the height of the 2016 election. Christopher Steele was able to literally disseminate his unverifiable Russian lies, not only throughout the highest levels of our government, the FBI, the CIA, NSA, Obama's DOJ, even creepy, sleepy Joe Biden but at the very same time, this information was selectively leaked, through news media, the Trumpet hating media mob and many outlets in the country. And, in fact, they were disseminating the information, why? To help Hillary win the election. In other words, to point out false Russian lies so that Hillary would win in 2016. Now, how Robert Mueller ignored this Russian disinformation, but he had time for FARA violations, loan applications, taxi medallions and tax violations as Tucker, Michael Caputo was just talking about, that raises a lot of questions about Mueller's priorities. But as a result, he has ignited the left's Russian hysteria and gave the deep state a vehicle to weaponize this country's most powerful tools of intelligence that we entrust to them to protect us. And yet, they would turn on the American people and they were turned on the presidential candidacy known as Donald Trump, and all of his allies. James Comey use Steele's dirty dossier, remember, he signed the first FISA application. It was the bulk of information coming from the unverified dossier against Donald Trump to secure that FISA warrant, which became a backdoor into spying on the entire Trump campaign, later the Trump transition team and then the Trump presidency. And Comey also directed an international spying campaign using informants undercover agents, even blond bombshell to monitor three different Trump campaign aides, Carter Page, Sam Clovis, and, of course, George Papadopoulos. Then-NSA Director James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, they allegedly promoted the dossier inside and outside of the U.S. government. Clapper is accused of leaking Steele salacious material to his current employer, fake news CNN. And despite all of this, Hillary Clinton lost in an electoral landslide. And, now, by the way, she has a lot to answer for herself. What did she know? When did she know it? Because as John Solomon writes, quote: Never before until 2016 have the apparatus of a U.S. presidential candidate managed to sic the weight of the FBI, the U.S. intelligence community on a rival nominee during an election and by using a foreign fed, uncorrupted, unverified political opposition research document. And let me get back to this monologue in a minute. But, first, joining us with more details on this new discovery is \"The Hill's\" investigative reporter, John Solomon. John, this now goes deeper. The question is, why Steele now is agreeing to talk?"

      "utterance": "Well, listen, he may have some blame to lay at the feet of others. He was working for other people, right? Hillary Clinton and Perkins Coie law firm are his clients. He may like to talk a littler bit about what they were doing, what he knew, how he represented the information to the FBI and try to clear his name in some way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "At the end of the day, though, this is one step towards a much bigger person who needs to be questioned. And that is Hillary Clinton. As I wrote this morning",
      "utterance": "Hillary Clinton has for the last 18 months escaped any scrutiny from Congress and from the American media. Hasn't been asked any of the questions, when did you know, who did you know, did you know Steele was going to the FBI? Did you know your lawyer was going to James Baker and feeding this information? She's escaped that scrutiny and it's remarkable because it's been 18 months now that Hillary -- we learned first that Hillary Clinton had funded the dossier and right after that, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a request for documents and answers, she's never answered. She's thumbed her notes to the Senate. So, we need to get answers to know how high up in the Clinton campaign this entire conspiracy was known and executed it. Christopher Steele can start us on that path but I think Hillary Clinton ultimately has to answer the questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think she has to. But, I mean, again, these are the same people that rigged her investigation because Trump was loathsome and Hillary, they decided she'd win 100 million to zero. And then, of course, oh, Strzok and Page laughing at the fact that Loretta Lynch has put the fix in on the investigation to begin with, never mind the tarmac meeting."

And what do we know when that particular case? They never looked at real evidence and all popular regular procedure within the FBI was cast aside. They didn't tape it, they didn't record it, there is no 302s, and she was allowed to bring in a witness and one other person to give her comfort while the FBI was supposedly interrogating her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right. Listen, in one day, Jerry Nadler issued more than 80 subpoenas. In 18 months, there hasn't been a single subpoena to the Clinton campaign, or to Mrs. Clinton. You can see the difference in justice even in the way that Republicans in the Senate versus the way the Democrats on the House have treated these investigations. At some point, you need to compel answers if we're ever going to get to the truth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. John Solomon, investigative reporter, thank you. This is going to build as the days move on. And as we speak, there are now multiple investigations underway, as the Attorney General Barr is working hard to hold our government bureaucracy accountable, to fix this mess that were created by some. Those that would rig an investigation, those that try to rig with Russian lies a presidential election, those that try to bludgeon and unseat a duly elected president. And the same cannot be said for House Democrats. They clearly are more interested in a political circus designed to smear the president, all in advance of the 2020 election. There you have House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler set to call John Dean of Watergate fame to testify in the Mueller report. John Dean, the star and witness in Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal. That was 47 years ago. He has absolutely nothing, zero, to offer as it relates to the Mueller report, or frankly, any of the issues at hand here. Nothing. He has no expertise on Russian election hacking. But Dean only now works for fake news CNN as a professional Trump hater, 24/7, hate, rage psychosis. Now, Jerry Nadler figures, oh, nobody more perfect, let's roll him out for another Trump -- round of Trump bashing even though he has no relevance to the case and by the way, if you are like most Americans and you don't watch fake news CNN or conspiracy TV MSNBC, here's a small sample of the great insight, the great knowledge, the great objective analysis of Jerry Nadler star witness and what he will bring to Capitol Hill and the circus he has thrown over there. Take a look."

      "speaker": "JOHN DEAN, FORMER NIXON LAWYER",
      "utterance": "Trump is showing true Nixonian style. Trump is Nixon on steroids and stilts. If I had to channel little of Richard Nixon, I think he'd tell this president he's going too far. This is the sort of stuff of a banana republic. This is what an autocrat does. Frighteningly dictatorial. He is thinking like Putin would think."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So why would Jerry Nadler promote an obviously angry, washed up, far left, extreme leftist CNN hack to perform in front of his partisan circus? Intel Chairman Adam Schiff, well, he's busy continuing to lie through his teeth as per usual. And today, the cowardly Schiff called the Attorney General Barr the second most dangerous man in the country. Really? Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "And so, we find ourselves I think for the first time with an attorney general who really is the president's defense lawyer and spokesperson, and who is quite good at it, and has the veneer of respectability to camouflage what he's doing. He is not the sophist that Giuliani is. He's much more dangerous. And I think he is the second most dangerous man in the country for that reason."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Most dangerous place in the country is being between the cowardly Schiff, and either a microphone or a camera, because he's obsessed with seeing himself and hearing himself. Now, it's this kind of baseless vitriol, it's nothing new because for years the cowardly Schiff has been breathlessly promoting lie after lie, Trump Russia conspiracy theories over and over again. He has lied more than any other single member of Congress which says a lot about him. Now, we have invited him for a full hour on this TV show. I have offered him three hours complete on my radio program, 616 stations, so he can defend his reckless rhetoric. That's four hours of airtime with me. I have a dossier on everything he has ever said. Like all these other lying Democrats, he refuses to come on because Schiff is not only a coward, he's a liar and he knows he's a liar. So, instead of defending himself, he's just going to double down on his absurd lies that get more absurd every day. Maybe he will invite fellow conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow to the Hill, two biggest layers in the country together in one place at last. Now, CNN's John Dean can testify and he has nothing to offer I guess anything at this point as possible. Of course, Maddow can use the publicity because her ratings as well CNN ratings have taken a dive since their lies and conspiracy theories for two-plus years have been exposed. Now that the American people no longer trust NBC's chief conspiracy theorist. By the way, Tom Brokaw, are you proud of this? Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST",
      "utterance": "We are about to find out if the new president of our country is going to do what Russia wants once he's commander-in- chief of the U.S. military. We haven't had to reckon with the possibility have someone has ascended to the presidency of the United States to serve the interest of another country rather than our own. What's the corrective to that? How do you remedy that? These are no longer hypothetical questions. This is where we are. The presidency is effectively a Russian op. This like negative 50 degrees in the Dakotas right now. What would happen if Russia killed the power in Fargo today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "OK. Anyway, sadly, Maddow's delusion is not uncommon in so-called mainstream media. In other words, the 99 percent of the media that spent two years lying again and again to the American people, smearing, lying, besmirchment, conspiracy theories, fake news, you name it, they dominate coverage on the three networks -- \"Washington Post,\" \"New York Times,\" CNN, MSNBC and any other basic outlet out there. Of course, they are merely doing the Democratic Party's bidding as they work in unison, and they are only but it is an extension of all things Democratic socialist. That's why the media has ramped up their impeachment hysteria after Mueller's nine-minute public diatribe disaster last week which resulted in a complete detraction and a complete clarification hours later, because those nine-and-a-half minutes contradicted everything he had been saying up until to that point. In the end, as I have been saying, Mueller is done. This whole Mueller investigation is over. It's finished, confirmed by the attorney general. The president is guilty of zero crimes. There was no collusion, no conspiracy with Russia. And there was none, zero, obstruction of justice. But the media, they can't help themselves after two years of lying, perhaps they have convinced themselves that their lies and conspiracy theories are true. They are still begging for impeachment. For what reason? They cannot offer one. Take a look."

Joining us now, former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova, and former deputy assistant attorney general, Victoria Toensing, Fox News contributor Sara Carter.

It's not the inspector general from the Department of Justice who's going to talk to him because he doesn't have any reason to talk to Mr. Horowitz. He's going to talk to John Durham and his people. So, there's obviously some sort of deal that has been worked out. This is great news. But according to some reports, there are limitations on his testimony. I can't believe that Durham would agree to such limitations. But this is what's important. He has to tell the truth to Durham because even though his testimony will be given overseas, he can be indicted in the United States if he lies to Durham. So, I assume he's going to tell the truth because this is the big, this is the big casino now. And what he's going to prove is that the FBI lied in the FISA warrants and they lied to Congress and they lied to everybody about what they knew about Steele's behavior. This is the beginning -- the walls are beginning to close in on the FBI fraudsters."

When do we get this FISA report finished and completed, or is it possible that he's completed it and handed it over to the attorney general and we don't know? Victoria is saying no. Why, Victoria?"

We know that he does have 700 investigators, but remember, Sean, Michael Horowitz isn't just focused on the Russian investigation, although that's the main investigation his teams working on. They are working on a variety of investigations. So, this is really taking up the bulk of his time. But every day, we get something new, at least I do in my email box from the inspector general on other issues that they are working on. And as for Christopher Steele, I think what is so significant here, is that he probably worked out some kind of immunity deal before coming here before making any statements to investigators or to the prosecutor whether that be John Durham or somebody else that they have in mind. So think about that. If he did cut an immunity deal, that means he probably has a lot to say."

That it was all unverified. That he couldn't vouch for it. And therefore, it's pretty obvious that he probably told the same thing to the FBI. And that the FBI knew that it was merely a cover piece for them to use to try to get Carter Page and Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn and everybody else. Listen, make no mistake about it. The FBI at the James Comey level, at the senior level, and the senior Department of Justice under Obama were engaged in a criminal conspiracy against President Trump while he was a candidate, while he was president-elect and while he was president. That's why John Durham wants to talk to him because there was a criminal conspiracy led by senior FBI officials. And I just hope all of them, McCabe, James Comey, all of them, Baker, just keep talking publicly. Just keep talking."

What does that mean? And remember, it was just weeks ago that it was Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the real speaker of the House, Pelosi speaker in name only, called out Biden, accusing him of not being radical enough for the new unhinged Democrats. So ask yourself, why didn't Biden push anything this drastic while he was in the White House in the Biden/Obama administration? Why now, all of a sudden, 12 years later, 10 years later, does Biden sound just like Ocasio- Cortez? I think the answer is obvious because sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe, he doesn't have core values and he knows he is vulnerable to the attacks from this extreme wing in his party. So, clearly, he's willing to do and say anything to get elected, to make nice with the new climate cult that runs the Democratic Party, even plagiarizing his own campaign plan. Now, because beyond the bad policy, his campaign is under fire tonight for apparently stealing the exact identical passages from other climate documents. Now, Biden's camp is trying to downplay it claiming it was just a multiple citation errors. But, of course, plagiarism is nothing new from Biden, because the scandal back in 1988 torpedo that years White House bid where he literally copied word for word a speech by British Labour Party leader at a the time named Neil Kinnock. So, while Biden feigns fake moral outrage over this over and over again, well, his past shows he'll do whatever it takes to win and election. Now remember, a younger Joe Biden even attacked his opponent over his age. Kind of ironic considering that his biggest up on it now may be the young, media darling with a worse track record of any politician in the country, and that would be good old Mayor Buttigieg, who's also ramping his own brand of climate alarmism.

It cannot be tolerated, because as soon as we start to tolerate religious bigotry, it's going to carry over into every realm of our society.
