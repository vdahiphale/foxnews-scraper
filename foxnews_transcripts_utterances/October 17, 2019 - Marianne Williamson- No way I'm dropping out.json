It is clear that this investigation no longer revolves solely around the president's request to investigate Joe Biden. Instead, Democrats on the House Intel Committee are now honing in on a new word which you heard here last night, and the word is extortion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And basically, they wanted Volker to say that the Ukraine -- that the Ukrainians felt terribly pressured by President Trump, who was demanding that they investigate Biden in 2016, and at the same time, withholding aid from them. So, therefore, they felt very pressured. And Volker, said, look, that just didn't happen. I mean, I was there and it didn't happen because the Ukrainians did not know that the aid was being withheld. In fact, they thought things were going pretty well. They got a visit from John Bolton, who was then the national security advisor.

The Marine Corps has acknowledged that the man previously identified as Private First-Class Rene Gagnon is actually Corporal Harold \"Pie,\" it was his nickname, Keller, and for 74 years no one knew that. He's the man that you see highlighted in the yellow. So, in moments, we're going to speak exclusively with Keller's daughter who says that her father never spoke of being in that photo and we'll talk to her about why that might have been. But first, the chief breaking new correspondent Trace Gallagher with this incredible back story tonight. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: The story is fascinating, Martha. It really is. I mean, there were actually two American flags raised on Mount Suribachi in Iwo Jima back in February 2rd, 1945. But commanders thought the first flag was too small, so they replaced it with the second flag and the second flag raising is when Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal snapped this famous photo. It's also where some of the confusion comes in because Private First-Class Rene Gagnon, who we thought for 74 years was in the famous photo, actually helped raised the first flag. And we know it was Corporal Harold Keller, not Gagnon who helped raised the second flag. And it's fascinating how they solve this. First, a group of historian Jews film footage atop Mount Suribachi then they compared the film to still photos. Taken by other soldiers from different vantage points. The evidence was then sent to special investigative board convened by the marines and with the help of the FBI's digital evidence lab, the finding was confirmed. In fact, to make the positive I.D. investigators used things like Keller's camouflage pattern on his helmet and his wedding ring. Rene Gagnon was not married. And there was never a doubt that Harold Keller was on Mount Suribachi when the famous photo was taken because he had the proof hanging in his living room. For many years Keller had a picture of the co-called gung-ho shot of 18 marines on the summit with the flag in the background that you see there. A picture that was also taken by Joe Rosenthal and also included Harold Keller. His children said their dad never made a big deal of the picture and would say it was the photo of the guys who raised the flag on Iwo Jima. Harold Keller whose nick name was Pie because he once ate too much pie before a football game was part of some of the biggest battles in the Pacific Theodore and receive the Purple Heart. In 1979, Keller died of a heart attack at the age of 57. There was no mention of Iwo Jima in his obituary. Rene Gagnon it was on his gravestone.",

So, they've come up with this idea of struck of extortion. And what's interesting is they kind of tested this idea in their examination of Kurt Volker, who was the former envoy to Ukraine. And basically, they wanted Volker to say that the Ukraine -- that the Ukrainians felt terribly pressured by President Trump, who was demanding that they investigate Biden in 2016, and at the same time, withholding aid from them. So, therefore, they felt very pressured. And Volker, said, look, that just didn't happen. I mean, I was there and it didn't happen because the Ukrainians did not know that the aid was being withheld.

      "speaker": "MCCAUL",

Like, you know, I talk about what's been made public out of the committee in his opening statement. He does refer to Giuliani operating as sort of -- at some times in conjunction with the State Department, sometimes not. But I think what is like a common theme with the testimony that's been made public is that there is no quid pro quo here. And I think that's very clear from the presence of phone conversation. I was a former federal prosecutor in the Public Integrity Section. They reviewed that phone call and found that there is no criminal violation. I think that's been talked about very much. And so, I don't think there's anything really earth-shattering that I've seen come out these depositions. And as a top Republican on Foreign Affairs, I've been sitting through all of them."

    {
      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "Well, I agree with what he -- I just got a phone call from the vice president, updating me on the cease-fire negotiations. I commend the vice president and Secretary Pompeo, and president for ending this bloodshed. I have my concerns about withdrawal from Syria, particularly, as it pertains to protecting the homeland. I think, when I was at the White House meeting yesterday that's been so publicized. And I think after the Speaker left and we got down, Democrats stayed in the room, we had a very civil -- a very sensitive conversation. My number one position was that look, after we pulled out of Iraq, as you know, Martha, 10,000 troops and ISIS reared its ugly head and the Caliphate was formed. I didn't want to see the same thing happen in Syria. I got assurances from the chairman of the joint chief of staff, to the secretary of defense, to the president of the United States that we are not completely withdrawing from Syria. That we will have a residual force to protect the homeland. And I commend the vice president on the negotiations, a five-day ceasefire after which there will be a permanent ceasefire in place. Let's hope that works."

And you know, some people have noted that, that is more sort of the Turkish language for this group. And then, you know, the president said that he has a friend in President Erdogan, and that he's a tough guy, and he's glad that he -- you know, sort of saw the light on this -- on this agreement. Are you concerned about the way that we are talking about Erdogan right now? Do you trust him? Is he our ally? Would you agree with that?"

Is that right? I think it's the third rally that he has done this week as he continues to try to rev up the base. Obviously, very interested in keeping Texas in his corner as he heads into 2020. Some of the staffers are getting off. So we'll keep one eye on that. We'll bring you there as soon as that gets underway this evening the big event in Dallas. So after a White House meeting yesterday, went off the rails, I think that's a fair assessment on all sides, right? President Trump tweeted this photo of what he called nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown. But the tweet ended up inspiring the #PelosiOwnsTrump, and then that started trending on Twitter. And Congress' top Democrat cashed in on the moment. She made it her new Twitter photo on her Twitter page. This is the world we live in now, right? And saying this about it today."

And the thing that struck me -- and of course they were very critical of Donald Trump having sent it out and very supportive of Nancy Pelosi having stared him down. But what I remembered, the first thing that came to my mind was back in 2012, Jan Brewer, the Arizona Governor standing and doing the same thing to Barack Obama and she was completely excoriated for it. No one was saying, oh she owned him. They called her a racist and they said she was rude."

      "speaker": "STRASSEL",

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. It certainly does. Here's a headline from Vox News. Trump is nervous. Nancy tweet shows his problem with powerful women which goes exactly to what you are saying. You know, my question is, you know, how does -- so we talked at the top of the show with Byron York about now the move -- the impeachment move is towards extortion. You know, I said the words get ramped up. We haven't even gone through. There's not even an actual process yet, an official impeachment process open. But you know, everybody's sort of gotten so good at these buzzwords and messaging that that's where we are now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, and we keep moving the goalposts. And we saw this because you know, I spent a lot of time covering this Russia collusion false story in the end. And you started out with a couple of accusations and pretty soon we're looking into servers and foreign banks. I mean, and then there's just wild allegations that the chases -- the press is chasing down. We're doing the same thing here. Remember, the original accusation was that Trump said I will withhold money unless you give me dirt on Joe Biden. Now, apparently there is something inappropriate or it is a quid pro quo for the President to say we're not going to give you money until you tell us whether or not you meddled in our 2016 election. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but we just asked Bob Mueller to do the exact same thing for several years with regards to Russia. I mean, that's not a quid pro quo. That's a legitimate ask. We do care about foreign countries meddling in our elections. It is good to get that information. But the press has suddenly changed the goalposts again. And now even asking about 2016 is supposedly an impeachable offense."

But she was absent from the stage on Tuesday night, and now says there's no way that she is dropping out of this process. Instead, she's pointing the finger squarely at the DNC for stifling the Democratic process writing in The Washington Post. The Democratic National Committee has sought to narrow the field of presidential candidates at the very moment when it should be opening up, placing a political straightjacket on our primary system, controlling the process via money and ridiculous rules. The party is risking disaster. Marianne Williamson is back on “The Story” tonight. good to have you back. Thank you for coming back in."

And George Washington warned us against them, and he said that we had to be very careful because they could form the factions, factions of men that he said that would be more concerned with their faction than with their country. And so I feel very strongly about the power of the individual citizen. That's the decider in all this. That should be the decider obviously in our elections, but I think that's also who should be the decider in our primaries. So both political parties, I think that their process is to facilitate democracy not dictated in any way."

But I see how with the rules and with the polling and with the numbers -- you know, there are two different political universes. One is the pundits, and the polls, and the money, and all of that. And then there's another political universe and that's what happens when candidates are out there in the primary states just talking to people about our country and about what matters. And there are two such different Universes. So one is very difficult. You have to have a lot of money. There's a lot of establishment power involved there, media, political parties."

Not malpractice, well-meaning patients, African groups got together with attorneys and doctors were going to jail. This sent shockwaves through the system at the same time they were disciplined that took the patient physician that pain is whatever the patient says it is and pain controls whatever the patient says it is that there should never be pain again and that there's always been a solution which was the opioid-related drugs and we just weren't giving enough.

Again, my patients were dying, the addicts were dying, but now, we've gone the other way where people with cancer pain can't get their opiates.

He moved to Utah, we discouraged him from that. He went anyway. We stayed in close touch with him. And he called me one day and he said, doctor, I'm having back pain. I said, Mike, please don't tell a doctor, whatever you do don't tell a doctor. Two weeks later he was dead with a bottle of Oxycontin and Benzodiazepine by his bedside. My patients were routinely killed and it was so painful and so difficult to live through that time. Now we've cut off everybody from their opiates and they are going to the street, rather than calling them in and say, hey, we made a mistake, we've got a second problem here now called addiction. We didn't mean for that to happen. Let's go treat it. Instead, we say you're a bad patient. And of course, those patients are now going to the street. And now the big problem is Fentanyl and heroin."

      "utterance": "So, this is quite a story. For the second time in three years, one of the U.S. servicemen in the iconic flag raising photo from February 23, 1945 had been misidentified and it has now been correctly identified. The Marine Corps has acknowledged that the man previously identified as Private First-Class Rene Gagnon is actually Corporal Harold \"Pie,\" it was his nickname, Keller, and for 74 years no one knew that. He's the man that you see highlighted in the yellow. So, in moments, we're going to speak exclusively with Keller's daughter who says that her father never spoke of being in that photo and we'll talk to her about why that might have been. But first, the chief breaking new correspondent Trace Gallagher with this incredible back story tonight. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: The story is fascinating, Martha. It really is. I mean, there were actually two American flags raised on Mount Suribachi in Iwo Jima back in February 2rd, 1945. But commanders thought the first flag was too small, so they replaced it with the second flag and the second flag raising is when Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal snapped this famous photo. It's also where some of the confusion comes in because Private First-Class Rene Gagnon, who we thought for 74 years was in the famous photo, actually helped raised the first flag. And we know it was Corporal Harold Keller, not Gagnon who helped raised the second flag. And it's fascinating how they solve this. First, a group of historian Jews film footage atop Mount Suribachi then they compared the film to still photos. Taken by other soldiers from different vantage points. The evidence was then sent to special investigative board convened by the marines and with the help of the FBI's digital evidence lab, the finding was confirmed. In fact, to make the positive I.D. investigators used things like Keller's camouflage pattern on his helmet and his wedding ring. Rene Gagnon was not married. And there was never a doubt that Harold Keller was on Mount Suribachi when the famous photo was taken because he had the proof hanging in his living room. For many years Keller had a picture of the co-called gung-ho shot of 18 marines on the summit with the flag in the background that you see there. A picture that was also taken by Joe Rosenthal and also included Harold Keller. His children said their dad never made a big deal of the picture and would say it was the photo of the guys who raised the flag on Iwo Jima. Harold Keller whose nick name was Pie because he once ate too much pie before a football game was part of some of the biggest battles in the Pacific Theodore and receive the Purple Heart. In 1979, Keller died of a heart attack at the age of 57. There was no mention of Iwo Jima in his obituary. Rene Gagnon it was on his gravestone."

      "speaker": "KAY MAURER, CORPORAL HAROLD KELLER'S DAUGHTER",
      "utterance": "Thank you. Well, I started receiving phone calls from a couple of the researchers, Brent Westemeyer and Dustin Spence. They started out with, we know your dad was on Iwo Jima, do you know what he there? And I'm going no, not really, he was with the group that went up the mountain but I didn't really know anything much beyond that. And they said, well, we'd like to come to your house and kind of fill you in on what your dad did. So. Then, which they did and got to meet both of the men and got to Skype with the man from Ireland, Stephen Foley, and so it was quite an afternoon."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, it is, it's amazing, and I think a lot of people remember the book and the film \"Flags of our Fathers,\" and I think it's important to point out that Rene Gagnon was on Mount Suribachi. And as Trace pointed out, was part of the first flag raising. It gets a little confusing because the second battalion 28 marines were had secured the mountain and they went up and there was one flag raising then a second one. But what I find so interesting and I'd like to hear about your dad, why do you think -- I mean, he obviously knew that he had helped to push that flag into the ground. So why did he never --"

And I think his heart was there, fighting the war, not to come back on a war bond tour. And so, I think he just mummed up and refused to identify himself when it was asked --"

And that kind of humility that you discussed when you talk about your father and not it meant to him to sort of not be the one in the spotlight or not be the one that was seen as the big hero is a very common thread that I see running through these men. And so, it doesn't surprise me at all that your father, Harold \"Pie\" Keller was a guy like that. So, what has it been like for all of you?

So, we're really about minutes away from him taking the stage. This is a really unique venue here. He's been here before by the way, but this where the Dallas Mavericks played basketball. It's where the Dallas stars play hockey. And there is very much this feeling of sort of a sporting event, if you will, some people were doing the wave not long ago. People are getting nachos and pizza and they're getting ready to settle in and listen to the president to talk. There are a lot of people here. This venue can hold 20,000 people. So, the top row are still waiting to be filled in. However, our crews on the outside tell us that there are several thousand, just several thousand people outside of this arena and they may not get in to actually hear the president talk. So, there is something big going on here tonight. Because at 7 o'clock this morning, Martha, 12 hours before the president was even scheduled to take the stage people were camped out here about a thousand at 7 o'clock this morning. So, no doubt a lot of Texans are fired up to see President Trump and he is expected to take the stage any time now. Back to you, Martha."
