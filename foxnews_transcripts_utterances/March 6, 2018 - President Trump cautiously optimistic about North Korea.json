The Democrats will never give anybody credit, especially Donald Trump, when something happens positive for the American people. I think both parties are responsible for this. You know, Pelosi, they called the tax cuts crumbs. Harry Reed wouldn't even admit that the surge worked. There were Republicans who wouldn't give Obama credit for killing Bin Laden. I get that. But the media said that this would lead to war, the fire and fury and all these war games. So the media should be completely discredited because it led to the opposite.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" It's a significant development, a major breakthrough if true. Kim Jong-un is signaling he is willing to denuclearize North Korea if the U.S. agrees to talk. The surprising news came out of a meeting between the dictator and a South Korean delegation. President Trump reacted today with cautious optimism."

I really believe they are sincere. I hope they're sincere. We're going to soon find out."

And by all accounts, they are very close to achieving an objective they've been after for 25 years. So why do they want to talk now? I will bet you a dollar just as we're sitting here today you're going to hear almost immediately the United States has to contribute to the atmosphere. We've got to show good faith. Let's prime the pump. All of which is code talk for make concessions. And if that comes, then I think you can count on this. North Korea will get deliverable nuclear weapons before the end of this year."

And skepticism should always be where you're from. But what would you rather hear than this? I mean, what would you -- Like, you're actually hearing something positive. Sure, you'd like him to say we're going to end labor camps and we're going to go to our free market system. But in the spectrum of positive shifts, this is actually pretty good and it is new. I mean, they're talking about getting together, South Korea, for the first time in ten years. I don't think they've ever talked about denuclearization as part of this plan. If this happened under Obama, the Nobel peace prize would've been shipped, Amazon Prime, next day, one-touch delivery. I thought Trump's response was pretty reserved."

      "utterance": "Right. Rocket man is crazy. And he's very slick. So this could just be a ploy for cash infusion. But at the same time, it's a positive development, as Greg said. Where are the Democrats? Because the Democrats have been saying that all this tough talk would lead to war, and all we need to do is sit down at the table and have negotiations and diplomacy. Well, Trump has now gotten us to the point of potential diplomacy and talks. I don't hear anything from the Democrats. The Democrats will never give anybody credit, especially Donald Trump, when something happens positive for the American people. I think both parties are responsible for this. You know, Pelosi, they called the tax cuts crumbs. Harry Reed wouldn't even admit that the surge worked. There were Republicans who wouldn't give Obama credit for killing Bin Laden. I get that. But the media said that this would lead to war, the fire and fury and all these war games. So the media should be completely discredited because it led to the opposite. And it's because they don't report cause and effect. President Trump says some things and all of a sudden border crossings are down, or NATO countries are ponying up money, ISIS is decimated. These are the results of Trump rhetoric, action and policy. But the media won't tell you the whole story. They're only reporting things in isolation because they're just dishonest."

Now we're the unpredictable person, and the unpredictability actually resets the table with North Korea. And it has reset the table and other areas as well if you look at certain things. Even with immigration. Like, we don't know what's coming and things change because of that. But I disagree. I don't think that Kim Jong-un is crazy. I think he's a rational actor and this is what he's doing to make sure that he survives, because I think he's figuring out that this is going into a different phase. And when he says something like we will denuclearize, if we feel that you guys aren't going to -- that's actually a rational statement. Like Bolton says though, he could be lying. The thing is, to Jesse's point, which is true, and to Kimberly, you don't have to like Donald Trump to admit now and then that progress is made. None of your friends are going to think less of you because you can't admit that he actually did something pretty good. The problem is he's done five pretty good things this year."

And then it was a little bit like, \"Well, I'm not exactly sure.\" Because it's a tough district.

Remember, they were decimated in the Obama years. So they are having a chance to really make their way back. The other thing I would point out is on turnout, in Virginia's gubernatorial election last November, Ed Gillespie got more Republicans than ever in the history of that state to come out and vote for him, and he still lost by nine points. So turnout is key."

President Trump said this: \"Gary has been my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms, and unleashing the American economy once again. He's a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\""

And had a lot of internal fights with some members of the administration. And some people are now speculating that he may have resigned in the wake of President Trump's saying that he's going to enact steel tariffs. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

I say it's fair to say that people thought that he was more of a globalist. That term has been used. I think that he's somebody, obviously, that wanted to serve the country. He worked very hard in there. The president liked his organization. And he would present, like, charts with him, and like different color-coded, and he liked that. So he was very organized. I like organization. Dana Perino likes organization."

If he felt that, you know, he had kind of provided the opportunities and the help and the assistance to the president and to the country, and his work was done there, that's one thing. I mean, the president made a tweet this morning, put out a tweet that said there may be some staff changes and things coming in the future. I think this is one that was expected. There's been discussion about Cohn, McMasters, and chief of staff John Kelly. So you have one of those people already now leaving, you know, the president. I'll also note that, you know, he's always been very close with Jared and Ivanka, as well. And that was kind of like a triumvirate right there, that the three of them were together and probably coalesced on some, you know, of the issues. He wasn't a big fan, proponent of exiting the Paris Climate Change Accord, so that was also probably part of the reason why people would, you know, frame him in that fashion as a globalist. But he certainly knows the economy, and he was very helpful, I think, to the president, you know, in that regard. And now you see, they'll bring in some -- some new people.
