Remember, first, it's collusion, then it's obstruction. Now, it's racism. Anything to just hate Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day. If he'd cured cancer, they'd still hate him. The evolution of the left's anti-Trump rage and psychosis is beyond desperate and predictable, and despicable at the same time. Now, moments ago, the Democratically controlled House of Representatives voted to condemn President Trump's love it or leave it tweets about the four far left radical socialist congresswomen known now as \"The Squad\", especially Congresswoman Omar. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Speaker Pelosi called the president of the United States a racist on the House floor. But the funny part is, it was only a few days ago when the squad leader, Congresswoman, the real speaker of the House, Pelosi, speaker in name only, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez actually accused Nancy Pelosi of picking out people of color and racism. And don't forget in March, remember those same Democrats, they refused to condemn Congresswoman Omar during a resolution spurred by her constant, vile, virulent anti-Semitic remarks? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Just take a look at your screen over there. These four radical congresswomen, they now run the House of Representatives. They are in control, pretty much of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Pelosi, speaker in name only. And now, the four radicals, two of which are bigoted anti-Semites, are now setting the agenda for the entire Democratic Party. Now, tonight in just a few minutes, after some news, we are going to provide context. We have a special “Hannity” history lesson about the Democratic Party, their history with race, their rampant hypocrisy, their shameful political grandstanding on the issue of race, and much more.

You know, I -- when I go through this history, it is deep, it is profound, and nobody else in the media will talk about it. The laws in Somalia are pretty horrible towards women, horrible on abortion for those that are pro- choice, horrible on gay rights, and so much more. The president said, when you fix Somalia, then you can come back here and show us how to do it.

Last year, 68-year-old Willem van Spronsen was arrested after wrapping his arms around a police officer's throat in an effort to free another protester. Then Saturday morning, Van Spronsen came back with a rifle, started tossing incendiary devices at cars, and tried to blow up a propane tank that ICE said, quoting here, could have resulted in the mass murder of staff and detainees housed at the facility. Van Spronsen was shot and killed by responding officers. But it appears he was looking to die, because he left behind a manifesto, where he identifies as Antifa, and says, quoting, I regret that I will miss the rest of the revolution doing what I can to help defend my precious and wondrous people.

Now, earlier tonight, we referenced this ongoing feud between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez. Well, a few days ago, the party infighting boiled over, when Ocasio-Cortez accused the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, of racism. And, of course, the freshman congresswoman from New York is using a political tactic that is deployed by the Democratic Party. They used it against Republicans and they have for decades.

For years, anything Democrats disagree with, they would label as racist or sexist. Look at your screen. The Betsy Ross American flag, room temperature walls, the national anthem, Mitt Romney, they said he was racist. Every modern day Republican, any conservative president, yes, racist. The Electoral College, red hats, private schools, public schools, the Covington High School kids, 401(k)s, the Bible, almost everything you can think of has been in the past labeled as racist or sexist by some member of the left. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And meanwhile, the long, despicable, disgusting ties of racism, those ties to the Democratic Party are almost totally ignored by so-called progressive. We will remind them tonight. And why haven't they made condemnations in each of these cases? Here's the current Democratic governor of Virginia, the commonwealth, Ralph Northam. Well, this was a picture under his name and his medical school yearbook. Well, to this day, he won't admit whether he's the one in blackface or the man wearing a KKK outfit. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He was not kicked out of office. He wasn't even officially censored. But, by the way, his attorney general admitted to wearing blackface as well. He, too, is still in office, and I don't see Democrats raising and condemning and saying they need to get out of office like yesterday. Zero consequences. Oh, so we only get outraged when a Republican or conservative does it. And, of course, if Trump does, well, at least if they can accuse him of it, why not run with a good political story? Not because it's true. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How many times have we said, while they were all the I-believers about Justice Kavanaugh from what he did in high school, crazy allegations, unproven allegations. Here it is -- significant, serious allegations of rape, violent sexual assault against lieutenant governor of the commonwealth of Virginia. Not a peep out of people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Want to talk about obstruction of justice?

That would be Hillary Clinton. Of course, not a peep from the selective moral outrage of the left. But go back a few years. Let's go to 2008. The left, the media totally ignored candidate Obama's relationship with the reverend preacher, Jeremiah Wright. Wright's philosophy was based on something called black liberation theology which blames white people for all the world's problems.

They interviewed one of his primary sources, a Russian living in the West. And they came to the assessment after the interview, which I believe, was in January February of '17. That he was either intentionally misleading Steele or exaggerating in ways that cause Steele's report to be grossly inaccurate. They then took every statement, every factual statement in the Steele dossier memos, put them in a spreadsheet and analyzed them. And they came to conclude that the vast majority of them were either wrong, unverifiable despite all the intelligence tools the FBI had or things that an intern with a Google search could find on the Internet. Not actionable intelligence, but Google garbage. That is the quality of what they had. And why is that significant? At the time they were learning this, they were continuing to represent to the court that Christopher Steele was a reputable source, that his information might be reliable. One thing they discovered, that they learned early on was wrong, the seminal thing they shared with the FISA Court. They wrote in a verified FISA Application that Christopher Steele had corroborated or verified that Carter Page had met with Igor Sechin and Igor Divyekin. Two senior Russians close to Putin during a trip July 2016. The FBI never verified that and ultimately concluded it did not happen. That is the sort of information that they knew was wrong in 2017.

If you've got more trouble that I don't even know about. All right, Tucker, thank you. Welcome to “Hannity.” We start tonight with a Fox News alert. We've got massive breaking news surrounding the Steele dossier tonight we will break, \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. FISA abuse did occur. We've got confirmation. We'll tell you all about it. Also, coming up, Solomon will be here with the brand-new evidence that will blow a lot of this wide open. Also tonight, we are going to begin with the fake moral, phony, selective outrage, that is the swamp, Washington, D.C. Remember, first, it's collusion, then it's obstruction. Now, it's racism. Anything to just hate Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day. If he'd cured cancer, they'd still hate him. The evolution of the left's anti-Trump rage and psychosis is beyond desperate and predictable, and despicable at the same time. Now, moments ago, the Democratically controlled House of Representatives voted to condemn President Trump's love it or leave it tweets about the four far left radical socialist congresswomen known now as \"The Squad\", especially Congresswoman Omar. Speaker Pelosi called the president of the United States a racist on the House floor. But the funny part is, it was only a few days ago when the squad leader, Congresswoman, the real speaker of the House, Pelosi, speaker in name only, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez actually accused Nancy Pelosi of picking out people of color and racism. And don't forget in March, remember those same Democrats, they refused to condemn Congresswoman Omar during a resolution spurred by her constant, vile, virulent anti-Semitic remarks? Just take a look at your screen over there. These four radical congresswomen, they now run the House of Representatives. They are in control, pretty much of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Pelosi, speaker in name only. And now, the four radicals, two of which are bigoted anti-Semites, are now setting the agenda for the entire Democratic Party. Now, tonight in just a few minutes, after some news, we are going to provide context. We have a special “Hannity” history lesson about the Democratic Party, their history with race, their rampant hypocrisy, their shameful political grandstanding on the issue of race, and much more. My monologue, my history lesson in just a moment. We'll get to it in this segment. But first, joining us now, someone who voted against today's resolution, House Republican Conference chair, Congresswomen Liz Cheney. You know, I -- when I go through this history, it is deep, it is profound, and nobody else in the media will talk about it. The laws in Somalia are pretty horrible towards women, horrible on abortion for those that are pro- choice, horrible on gay rights, and so much more. The president said, when you fix Somalia, then you can come back here and show us how to do it. The press selectively forgets that part."

You know, you had Democratic leadership completely unwilling to condemn their own members particularly for really vile anti-Semitic remarks. And then today, you watched as Nancy Pelosi showed total utter contempt, disregard for what is really the heart of our constitutional republic, for the floor of House of Representatives. She violated the rules, she stormed off the floor. She refused to come back. You know, she's acting as though she thinks this is Nancy Pelosi's house, when it is the people's house. It's really important for us to focus on what they stand for, and what they stand for is a socialist agenda that would be devastating for this nation."

A HANNITY history lesson on the Democrats' racist, hypocritical past, their selective moral outrage, moments away. First, we turn to an important story that is receiving almost zero attention from the mainstream media mob, because over the weekend, a radical group of Antifa, they attempted to actually blow up an Immigration and Customs Enforcement center in order to inflict mass casualties, who's ultimately killed in a shootout after opening fire on police officers. Here now from our West Coast newsroom with the full report is our very own Trace Gallagher. Very dangerous situation there. And, by the way, where is some of the Democrats condemning Antifa?"

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "And, Sean, it turns out the man who tried to blow up the ICE detention center this weekend in Tacoma had a previous run-in at the very same facility. Last year, 68-year-old Willem van Spronsen was arrested after wrapping his arms around a police officer's throat in an effort to free another protester. Then Saturday morning, Van Spronsen came back with a rifle, started tossing incendiary devices at cars, and tried to blow up a propane tank that ICE said, quoting here, could have resulted in the mass murder of staff and detainees housed at the facility. Van Spronsen was shot and killed by responding officers. But it appears he was looking to die, because he left behind a manifesto, where he identifies as Antifa, and says, quoting, I regret that I will miss the rest of the revolution doing what I can to help defend my precious and wondrous people. And like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, he also referred to the detention centers as concentration camps four separate times. Meantime, the American flag has now been restored to an ICE facility in Colorado after protesters tore it down and replaced it with a Mexican flag. They also took down a blue lives matter flag, honoring law enforcement. They spray-painted \"abolish ICE\" on it, and then they re-raised the flag upside down -- Sean."

While the Antifa terrorist manifesto reportedly echoed language from Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, we do not hold the congresswoman responsible for the actions of this deranged individual. That's something liberals and Democrats do. It's a shameful political tactic on the left. We do expect elected members of Congress to denounce violence, especially when the target of that violence includes federal law enforcement officials who serve and protect our country and put their lives on the line for us every single day. Now, after initially dodging questions, to her credit, Ocasio-Cortez eventually condemned the attacks in a statement to \"The Daily Caller\". A fellow squad member, Congresswoman Omar, apparently won't condemn the far left violence. Really, Congresswoman? You can't -- you're going to defend this? Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Will you condemn them for that? Can't give an answer to that? I guess when you laugh about al Qaeda as she has and Hezbollah and referred to 9/11 as some people did something, I guess we shouldn't expect any better. And as we speak, the fringe members of this group are now in full control of the Democratic Party, with the most influence of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Now, earlier tonight, we referenced this ongoing feud between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez. Well, a few days ago, the party infighting boiled over, when Ocasio-Cortez accused the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, of racism. And, of course, the freshman congresswoman from New York is using a political tactic that is deployed by the Democratic Party. They used it against Republicans and they have for decades. That is their playbook, every two and every four years. That brings us to a very important “Hannity” history lesson in our monologue tonight. For years, anything Democrats disagree with, they would label as racist or sexist. Look at your screen. The Betsy Ross American flag, room temperature walls, the national anthem, Mitt Romney, they said he was racist. Every modern day Republican, any conservative president, yes, racist. The Electoral College, red hats, private schools, public schools, the Covington High School kids, 401(k)s, the Bible, almost everything you can think of has been in the past labeled as racist or sexist by some member of the left. And meanwhile, the long, despicable, disgusting ties of racism, those ties to the Democratic Party are almost totally ignored by so-called progressive. We will remind them tonight. And why haven't they made condemnations in each of these cases? Here's the current Democratic governor of Virginia, the commonwealth, Ralph Northam. Well, this was a picture under his name and his medical school yearbook. Well, to this day, he won't admit whether he's the one in blackface or the man wearing a KKK outfit. He was not kicked out of office. He wasn't even officially censored. But, by the way, his attorney general admitted to wearing blackface as well. He, too, is still in office, and I don't see Democrats raising and condemning and saying they need to get out of office like yesterday. Zero consequences. Oh, so we only get outraged when a Republican or conservative does it. And, of course, if Trump does, well, at least if they can accuse him of it, why not run with a good political story? Not because it's true. How many times have we said, while they were all the I-believers about Justice Kavanaugh from what he did in high school, crazy allegations, unproven allegations. Here it is -- significant, serious allegations of rape, violent sexual assault against lieutenant governor of the commonwealth of Virginia. Not a peep out of people. Want to talk about obstruction of justice? What happens if when you obstruct justice and delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails, then you acid wash your hard drive with Bleach Bit? And then, of course, you remove the SIM cards and have an aide bust up all your devices and you have an underlying crime that's called the Espionage Act, and the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible because we know you had top secret, classified and special access programming marked as such at a mom and pop bathroom closet server that you had to bypass congressional oversight. That would be Hillary Clinton. Of course, not a peep from the selective moral outrage of the left. But go back a few years. Let's go to 2008. The left, the media totally ignored candidate Obama's relationship with the reverend preacher, Jeremiah Wright. Wright's philosophy was based on something called black liberation theology which blames white people for all the world's problems. And get this -- Obama, of course, he was inspired to write a book on this topic. And he quoted Wright's message in his memoir. Here's Obama's words, we knew this before he became president. Take a listen."

I wonder if that was a picture of Trump and Farrakhan how the media would react, how Democrats would react. Meanwhile, a former President Bill Clinton recently spent time right there, let's see, the Reverend Al Sharpton, Jessie Jackson, and Farrakhan, and, yes, Bill Clinton. How are you doing? That's me.

When you talk about the president's record, what he's doing on the economy, what he's doing for veterans, what he's doing for the military, are all things Americans can be proud of and support. And I think we as conservatives can't take our eye off the ball. We've got to remember if we have a campaign on the issues, we win. And we need to get it back to policies and issues and not let it get personal anymore. That's the distraction. The Democrats know that the president's winning on issues. We know that the president has got the right agenda and we as conservatives know that our policies are going to carry this country forward in a very positive way for all Americans.

It's AOC in charge.

But in 2017 - early 2017, the FBI had begun in a significant effort to assess credibility of the Steele dossier and here's what they found. They interviewed one of his primary sources, a Russian living in the West. And they came to the assessment after the interview, which I believe, was in January February of '17. That he was either intentionally misleading Steele or exaggerating in ways that cause Steele's report to be grossly inaccurate. They then took every statement, every factual statement in the Steele dossier memos, put them in a spreadsheet and analyzed them. And they came to conclude that the vast majority of them were either wrong, unverifiable despite all the intelligence tools the FBI had or things that an intern with a Google search could find on the Internet. Not actionable intelligence, but Google garbage. That is the quality of what they had. And why is that significant? At the time they were learning this, they were continuing to represent to the court that Christopher Steele was a reputable source, that his information might be reliable. One thing they discovered, that they learned early on was wrong, the seminal thing they shared with the FISA Court. They wrote in a verified FISA Application that Christopher Steele had corroborated or verified that Carter Page had met with Igor Sechin and Igor Divyekin. Two senior Russians close to Putin during a trip July 2016. The FBI never verified that and ultimately concluded it did not happen. That is the sort of information that they knew was wrong in 2017.

Nancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker. They are in control with it. The problem is what's going to happen in the next election. I see that these candidates may be playing a long game. They think they can get a lot of Millennials that are on the college campuses. But when it comes to this election there had to be Donald Trump and how are they going to win back those same counties that Barack Obama had that Donald Trump turned over to the Republican side, they can't do it with these progressive--"
