      "utterance": "He's not going to change. This is who he is. This is the man who was elected president. I really struck me watching the media response to the speech in Phoenix, people shocked, people fainting. Can you believe it? Yes, I can believe it. Where have you been for the last two years? If you are orbiting the earth in a satellite somewhere with no access to any information and you parachuted into Phoenix last night, yes, that would have been a very bizarre political performance. But if you have been a sentient human being for two years, it is exactly what we've come to expect because that's Donald Trump. That is the president, and whether you like it or not, people elected him knowing that is precisely who he is."

Some of his attacks on the press, same old thing. But some people in the press afterwards came out as if prompted by the president and went way over the top in their commentary and suggested he was suffering from dementia or was psychotically demented."

So Clapper went pretty far there, but that is the debate that you here among a lot of Democrats but also among some Republicans these days."

I had my doubts about that which is why I was vociferously opposed to him during the Republican primary in particular. But we have litigated that exact question in a primary, in a general, and then he was elected. So this is not new news. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.
