Now, what's scary is that some staffer who is getting paid tax dollars to work every week actually thought, wow, this line will show America that Joe is really on top of his game. But, what Republicans most support here are Trump's pre-pandemic policies. You just heard him recount some of them with Hannity. Why is Trump still talking about them? Well, they delivered record unemployment, rising wages, a tight border, better trade deals, strong investor optimism and consumer confidence. And, even Joe in his adult state, he knows all this. So, his rhetorical question about the GOP was just another exercise in deflection and distraction. But, none of this is landing with the voters. Two new polls out just today tell the bleak story for Joe Biden. His approval rating has dropped 10 points since April in the new NBC survey and the AP tracks closely with just 43 percent approving. But, what should be most alarming for the DNC and Biden is that a staggering 70 percent of Americans said they did not want Biden to run for reelection. Now, contrast this to how things are booming for Republican governors. They're gaining population in most states for a reason. People like their policies, the policies of lower taxes, lower crime rates, freedom from stupid COVID rules and keeping kids in school. Now, this isn't rocket science. It's common sense.",

Well, we were right. Sadly, now the blue states are struggling to revive their economies and also even to get their schools back on track. It could be years before any of them get back to normal, if they ever get back to normal. So, as we look back on the past two years, we should never forget how journalists failed in their proper roles to question the proclaimed orthodoxy of the lochdowners. Rather than questioning those who were so quick to rob us of our freedom, they jumped into bed with them.

Doctors who found success with therapeutics were villainized, governors who questioned school closures were menaces to public health. Politicians who didn't want to ditch the filibuster, well, they're racist. People who were then 1,000 yards at the Capitol on January 6, they are insurrectionists. What we're seeing is a far left carousel of false accusations and it's all breaking down. But, the Democrats cling to these hollow tactics whether on COVID or any of these other issues because it's all they have. There are no successes to crow about. There is only disappointment, high prices and empty shelves. On foreign policy, the White House just stumbles from one crisis to the next. It's embarrassing. At this point, the nation is just eager to return to some semblance of clarity and pragmatism. They know that Trump conservatives in office, while not perfect, are far better at avoiding economic turmoil and foreign wars. First and foremost, they stand for America. Democrats seem eager for a radical change away from the American system of government to one that supports a new international order. Now, most of us know by now that that's just a recipe for less prosperity and less freedom for the average person. And, you know what we say to that? No, thanks. So, as you go low, we're going to go high. And, that's the Angle. All right, joining me now is former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich and Fox News contributor. Newt, it's great to see you tonight. It has been reported that you're working with some members of the GOP on what is perhaps a new Contract with America. Can you tell us about it?

Kevin McCarthy this morning, the next Speaker of the House, promptly issued a list of things we stand for. I am working with a lot of different people, including Kevin, on what we could do. There is huge potential for a Republican contract this year, much like we had in 1994. I have not particularly been in favor of one in the recent past. But, I think this is the year where we ought to come out and say here are 10 big things we'll do. This is what you can count on. And frankly, a number of them can be done no matter what Biden does. So, you can design it in a way that it has a huge impact. I do think we have to run a positive alternative. It's not enough just to be anti-Biden. That's why my most recent book was called Beyond Biden, because I think the country is worried. The biggest thing I would bring to bear particularly after this last press conference by President Biden is this is not just political. This is historic. We have the weakest president in modern times who openly said it was OK for the Russians to take a piece of Ukraine and then had to spend the next 24 hours backtracking. He tells lies and what I think is troubling is - and he may actually believe his own lies. He may live in a world where he makes things up and then he believes whatever he makes up which - and the President United States is really dangerous. So, I think we as Republicans have an obligation not just to reach out to our base but to broaden that base dramatically by offering solutions. You just showed a picture of Glenn Youngkin, the new Governor of Virginia, who is doing a great job of reaching out to Independents, to Democrats, to minorities, to creating a vision of a better Virginia that brings people together. All those governors you showed who are doing great jobs, same thing, they're positive, they're solution oriented and as a result not only are their states doing better but the governors are doing pretty darn well.",

It's so dark in so - it's so dour that I think most people are just like that's not - I love this country. Like, we are incredibly blessed to live here.

And, it's been trending down. But, the most frightening numbers for Democrats should be that he is under 30 percent, 25 percent in one poll with independents, and his support among Hispanic voters is less than 30 percent. Those are the kinds of numbers that lead to wipe out, the midterm wipe outs, and Biden needs to energize his base but he can't do it at the expense of alienating moderates, independents and other minority voters.",

Although I rarely respond to pot shots from haters, tonight I make an exception because this particular smear is the noxious byproduct of today's floundering Democrats. In a Q&A with a media website, the occasional CNN pundit Bakari Sellers in discussing the cable landscape, called me an unabashed racist who sells racism. This of course, is a despicable, disgusting lie, and defamatory. Yes, sadly, it's the no go-to tactic of the modern left, and it's being fed by Joe, Jim Crow 2.0, Biden. The fact is today's hardcore leftists believe much of America is racist. The 74 million Trump voters, the Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance, the Star-Spangled Banner, it's all pretty much racist. Anyone who believes in voter I.D., racist. Anyone who refused to play their woke games, racist. Anyone who believes in colorblind hiring and school admissions, racist. Anyone who thinks we need to get tough on crime, you bet they're racist. And anyone who believes in building more statues, not tearing down old ones, yes, racist. Any parent who opposes racial politics in schools, racist. In other words, disagree with the Democrats, and you're not just mistaken or ill-informed. You're racist. Of course, this reeks of the modern left desperation and utter weakness. Calling someone a racist is the surefire way to end a debate. And when everything is racist, real racism gets a free pass. Asian Americans have been discriminated against for a while now in college admissions, and no one on the left really cares. Why? And given the horrific polls for Biden and dismal ratings for CNN, one would think that they'd start to listen to, not insult the millions of Americans who have already begun to tune them out.

Like many other schools, the University of Chicago participates in the COVID theater of regular testing for the unvaccinated and universal mask wearing. But it actually gets worse. They also joined the ignorant herds by announcing a booster requirement as well, because we know that work so well against Omicron. The deadline is January 31st. While we're sure most of the students and staff will blindly comply despite Omicron's evasion of vaccines and boosters, one student, an unvaccinated football player, has stood his ground. He was initially granted a vaccine exemption, but suddenly UChicago has told them that they will no longer recognize it. But here is the truly disturbing part. That student says the school forced him to move into a single room last fall because he hadn't gotten the jab. And when he didn't immediately do so, this happened. He wrote that \"I was awakened by three exceeding officious university housing officials pounding on my dorm door, screaming my name. I groggily opened the door, and each of the three berated my in turn for sleeping in an unauthorized bed.\" That's when he realized he was being surveilled by the school.

But, what should be most alarming for the DNC and Biden is that a staggering 70 percent of Americans said they did not want Biden to run for reelection. Now, contrast this to how things are booming for Republican governors. They're gaining population in most states for a reason. People like their policies, the policies of lower taxes, lower crime rates, freedom from stupid COVID rules and keeping kids in school. Now, this isn't rocket science. It's common sense."

The four states with the highest unemployment rates are all led you guessed it, by Democrats. Now, back in the early summer of 2020, the Angle predicted that states that drag their feet on reopening, that refuse to reopen quickly and prolong their lockdowns, would fall behind and end up inflicting terrible damage on their people. Well, we were right. Sadly, now the blue states are struggling to revive their economies and also even to get their schools back on track. It could be years before any of them get back to normal, if they ever get back to normal. So, as we look back on the past two years, we should never forget how journalists failed in their proper roles to question the proclaimed orthodoxy of the lochdowners. Rather than questioning those who were so quick to rob us of our freedom, they jumped into bed with them. Meanwhile, prominent media figures launched relentless attacks on the courageous leaders like governors DeSantis, Abbott, and Noem."

Politicians who didn't want to ditch the filibuster, well, they're racist. People who were then 1,000 yards at the Capitol on January 6, they are insurrectionists. What we're seeing is a far left carousel of false accusations and it's all breaking down. But, the Democrats cling to these hollow tactics whether on COVID or any of these other issues because it's all they have. There are no successes to crow about. There is only disappointment, high prices and empty shelves. On foreign policy, the White House just stumbles from one crisis to the next. It's embarrassing. At this point, the nation is just eager to return to some semblance of clarity and pragmatism. They know that Trump conservatives in office, while not perfect, are far better at avoiding economic turmoil and foreign wars. First and foremost, they stand for America. Democrats seem eager for a radical change away from the American system of government to one that supports a new international order. Now, most of us know by now that that's just a recipe for less prosperity and less freedom for the average person. And, you know what we say to that? No, thanks. So, as you go low, we're going to go high. And, that's the Angle. All right, joining me now is former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich and Fox News contributor.

      "utterance": "What a historic turning point. And, the truth is, Biden set us up for an easy victory. He said, gee, I don't know what they stand for. Kevin McCarthy this morning, the next Speaker of the House, promptly issued a list of things we stand for. I am working with a lot of different people, including Kevin, on what we could do. There is huge potential for a Republican contract this year, much like we had in 1994. I have not particularly been in favor of one in the recent past. But, I think this is the year where we ought to come out and say here are 10 big things we'll do. This is what you can count on. And frankly, a number of them can be done no matter what Biden does. So, you can design it in a way that it has a huge impact. I do think we have to run a positive alternative. It's not enough just to be anti-Biden. That's why my most recent book was called Beyond Biden, because I think the country is worried. The biggest thing I would bring to bear particularly after this last press conference by President Biden is this is not just political. This is historic. We have the weakest president in modern times who openly said it was OK for the Russians to take a piece of Ukraine and then had to spend the next 24 hours backtracking. He tells lies and what I think is troubling is - and he may actually believe his own lies. He may live in a world where he makes things up and then he believes whatever he makes up which - and the President United States is really dangerous. So, I think we as Republicans have an obligation not just to reach out to our base but to broaden that base dramatically by offering solutions. You just showed a picture of Glenn Youngkin, the new Governor of Virginia, who is doing a great job of reaching out to Independents, to Democrats, to minorities, to creating a vision of a better Virginia that brings people together. All those governors you showed who are doing great jobs, same thing, they're positive, they're solution oriented and as a result not only are their states doing better but the governors are doing pretty darn well."

It's so dark in so - it's so dour that I think most people are just like that's not - I love this country. Like, we are incredibly blessed to live here.

If you have a president who is cognitively confused on a regular basis, who refers to Kamala Harris as President Harris, who, as you just pointed out, referred tonight, to the presidents in the Senate, again and again, you have to wonder, how weak is he in terms of his grip on reality and how dangerous is it? Remember, our system has a Commander in Chief as President where we require somebody who is strong, coherent, capable. You can like or dislike Donald Trump but he certainly was a strong person.

And, it's been trending down. But, the most frightening numbers for Democrats should be that he is under 30 percent, 25 percent in one poll with independents, and his support among Hispanic voters is less than 30 percent. Those are the kinds of numbers that lead to wipe out, the midterm wipe outs, and Biden needs to energize his base but he can't do it at the expense of alienating moderates, independents and other minority voters."

Now, it's true that the Democratic Party is almost entirely behind Biden when it comes to the House supporting what he wants in the Senate. Almost everybody is supporting what he wants. So, he is in the mainstream, I guess, of the Democrat party, but those horrible numbers that you're seeing in terms of what people think about how he is handling everything from the economy to COVID to foreign policy, show that he is not in the mainstream of where most Americans are and no matter how much media, corporate media, types claim that he is a moderate or claim that he is uniter.

And, the idea that she would somehow generate the political chops to be a vice president that could handle the kind of media scrutiny that she is getting and the kind of issues that have been put on her plate just wasn't going to happen.

They love the NATO involvement in Libya. They love the regime change operation in Syria. They were angry at Biden, for withdrawing from Afghanistan. The cynical motive is obviously it is big ratings and they get to be really important. But, I think it's really ideological these people spend all their time and days talking to the CIA, the Pentagon. They kind of love this liberal internationalism. Obviously, going to war over Ukraine, even as a proxy war won't do anything for the American people, the American worker, but it kind of elevates the U.S. on this global stage and I think that's the ideology of the American media."

Tom Friedman, and all of these neo-cons, Laura, who used to be with George Bush and Dick Cheney during war are now with the Democratic Party. They're on MSNBC, Bill Kristol, David Frum, all of those people, the Lincoln project people, they're still doing the same thing which is cheering every word, Tom Friedman being one of those sociopathic, but they went to the Democratic Party because they know that's where the war lies.

Usually, the bank has to notify the customer that someone has served a subpoena. But, knowing that they had Loretta Lynch as their counsel, they said don't tell him until the very last second. They worked it out on purpose so that the bank agreed to give the Committee his banking records on December 24, Christmas Eve when all the courts were closed. They notified him two days before, refused to change the date. They gave him - they gave the Committee the records and he had no judicial review possible. He was only able to go after the fact and Obama appointed judge said sorry, you're too late. They already gave them. This Committee needs a lot of attention, Laura.

And now, every night on THE INGRAHAM ANGLE, what do we do? Well, we aim to inform and entertain you. And, I'm a populist conservative. I don't pull any punches. That's my style. So, over the years, I've developed a pretty thick skin, it's a job qualification for anyone in the public eye but especially a strong female conservative. Although I rarely respond to pot shots from haters, tonight I make an exception because this particular smear is the noxious byproduct of today's floundering Democrats. In a Q&A with a media website, the occasional CNN pundit Bakari Sellers in discussing the cable landscape, called me an unabashed racist who sells racism. This of course, is a despicable, disgusting lie, and defamatory. Yes, sadly, it's the no go-to tactic of the modern left, and it's being fed by Joe, Jim Crow 2.0, Biden. The fact is today's hardcore leftists believe much of America is racist. The 74 million Trump voters, the Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance, the Star-Spangled Banner, it's all pretty much racist. Anyone who believes in voter I.D., racist. Anyone who refused to play their woke games, racist. Anyone who believes in colorblind hiring and school admissions, racist. Anyone who thinks we need to get tough on crime, you bet they're racist. And anyone who believes in building more statues, not tearing down old ones, yes, racist. Any parent who opposes racial politics in schools, racist. In other words, disagree with the Democrats, and you're not just mistaken or ill-informed. You're racist. Of course, this reeks of the modern left desperation and utter weakness. Calling someone a racist is the surefire way to end a debate. And when everything is racist, real racism gets a free pass. Asian Americans have been discriminated against for a while now in college admissions, and no one on the left really cares. Why? And given the horrific polls for Biden and dismal ratings for CNN, one would think that they'd start to listen to, not insult the millions of Americans who have already begun to tune them out.

As the pandemic ends, it's not actually a biological question, it's a political question, when have we reached a point where we say enough is enough. We no longer need all these restrictions.

Yet we are about to interview a young University of Chicago football player who is being threatened with separation from the school because he has not been vaccinated, does not want to be vaccinated, already had COVID, probably had Omicron as well, has tons of immunity. And the University of Chicago is through threatening basically to throw this kid out. I can't wait to talk to him, but that's what we're facing in American universities today. How insane is that?"

We have multiple analyses showing increased risk of someone who takes a vaccine who has already recovered from COVID-19. So we should never penalize a young person for making a correct medical decision. He weighed out the risks and benefits and he came out with the correct decision that is no vaccination."

And I hope someday it comes to California so we can be free of these lockdown related policies. They've done so much harm, and they haven't really protected us against COVID."

I just mentioned this, but the University of Chicago used to be considered a real enlightened place. Now it's has divulged into bastion of COVID tyranny against unvaxxed students and staff. In moments, you'll hear from one of those students who is fighting back."

      "utterance": "The latest in our college COVID war series, this from the once sensible University of Chicago which instituted a campus-wide vaccine mandate last summer. A December e-mail from the university's provost to students and staff bragged that 98 percent of employees and 97 percent of students are compliant with the school's vax requirement. Like many other schools, the University of Chicago participates in the COVID theater of regular testing for the unvaccinated and universal mask wearing. But it actually gets worse. They also joined the ignorant herds by announcing a booster requirement as well, because we know that work so well against Omicron. The deadline is January 31st. While we're sure most of the students and staff will blindly comply despite Omicron's evasion of vaccines and boosters, one student, an unvaccinated football player, has stood his ground. He was initially granted a vaccine exemption, but suddenly UChicago has told them that they will no longer recognize it. But here is the truly disturbing part. That student says the school forced him to move into a single room last fall because he hadn't gotten the jab. And when he didn't immediately do so, this happened. He wrote that \"I was awakened by three exceeding officious university housing officials pounding on my dorm door, screaming my name. I groggily opened the door, and each of the three berated my in turn for sleeping in an unauthorized bed.\" That's when he realized he was being surveilled by the school. And he calls these tactics authoritarian and has a warning tonight to students and parents across America. We welcome University of Chicago sophomore Arthur Long. Arthur, it's good to see you tonight. First, you already had COVID, I believe, and you are a positive for SARS-CoV-2 t cells, and the school did grant you an exemption last summer. So what the heck changed?"

      "utterance": "Hi, Laura, thanks for having me on tonight. And that's correct, I received a medical exemption back in June of last year. And then when I showed up to football camp in August, I was rudely awakened by three university officials who banged on my door and said that I was sleeping and an unauthorized bed and forced me to move to a single, which is what all unvaccinated kids need to do now at the UChicago. This was the first of three shocking events that happened to me at the university. During midterms I received an unsigned e-mail from Student Wellness saying that I was not in compliance with the university's mandates. And it told me that my wi-fi, access to university buildings, and my dorm room where I sleep were about to be terminated. And then during final exams, I received an e-mail from the director of Student Wellness saying yet again that I was not in compliance with the mandate. He cited a bunch of anonymous experts and no facts, and tried to override the advice of my own personal physician."

But this sounds Orwellian. Apparently, just going back to August for a second, when those school officials pounded on your door, what happened, one of your friends heard what they were saying and the hallway?"

      "speaker": "LONG",

      "utterance": "So what's next for you? Is there a January 31st deadline, that booster deadline that now all the students have to comply with even though it doesn't work against Omicron, obviously? So they have to comply. So where does that leave you? School begins again for the semester on Monday, I understand."

    {
      "speaker": "LONG",
      "utterance": "That's correct. We resume in person classes next Monday, but the thing is, Laura, I'm not going to get the vaccine. I'm certainly not going to be coerced by a bunch of anonymous bureaucrats and so-called experts who think they can make my own personal public health -- my own personal health decisions for me. I know this is a fight that's going on across America, and it's sad that it's come to the UChicago which is known as a bastion of intellectual freedom and open, rigorous debate. But the only people who don't want to debate this are the university administration."

      "speaker": "LONG",
      "utterance": "The support so far since the publication of my piece at \"The Chicago Thinker\" has been overwhelming. Lots of my teammates and friends were, in fact, coerced to take this shot. They did not want to do it, but with the university threatening all these authoritarian measures, they have nowhere else to go. That's why it's important for us to all to stand up as students and tell the university that this is not going to stand."
