      "sentences": "That shouldn't be a tough question to answer. If someone asked me, hey, Greg, what is a woman? I just show him this picture. Yes. She still makes me tingle and all the wrong places. But why was it so hard for a judge to answer this question? Because we've let the woke take the clearest distinctions in life and destroy it. And now people are terrified of facts. It's part of the left's trifecta, create victims, create new reasons to call people bigots and give college professors something to waste time on. USA Today came to Jackson's defense, but totally screwed it up by using nothing but gender studies scholars. Yes, there are scholars in gender studies. That's like being a tall munchkin. In the health and wellness section. Ironically, the headline reads, Marsha Blackburn ask Ketanji Brown Jackson to define women. Science says there's no simple answer. Yes, the same folks who came up with the phrase follow the science, then ignore their own advice when it doesn't benefit their politics. So, I guess we can't call Jackson the first black woman Supreme Court justice, because according to them, she might not be a woman. But in reality, what is female has been a simple question for the 300,000 years humans have existed. It's only in the last decade that idiots have turned it into a trick question on a biology test. And why? Because they prefer ideology over biology. So, there's no way to clearly define what makes someone a woman. Well, I got an idea to put this debate to rest, ask 100 men off the street. They'll define a woman as a human being who has a nurturing side. Who can be emotionally strong as a bull, who will always have your back forever and maybe the most beautiful creatures on earth but who can't parallel park. A sexist would say, but this is where USA Today screwed up. They interviewed only gender studies experts on questions of biology. That's like interviewing Dana Perino on death metal. And they all said Jackson was wrong to even cite biology. You thought Jackson was woke? When it comes to defining a woman compared to these zombies? She's Andrew Dice Clay. But this is from the freaks who brought you two plus two doesn't have to equal four. So, they believe that judge punted by referring to biology. According to gender studies professor Rebecca Jordan-Young, there's not even a singular biological answer to what is a female. Sarah Richardson another gender expert says science cannot settle what are really social questions. So, your sex is social, not biological. And I thought Bill Clinton was phony for trying to redefine what is his. No wonder dudes can share women's locker rooms, use female restrooms, and male perverts can move into female prisons. Its sex is just a social thing. You can do or say almost anything. That way a fact changes from what is to what people say it is. And biology which is based in absolutes is as unwelcome as Katie Pavlich at a PETA rally. Gender studies is like astrology. With astrology you look up to the skies and make up stuff. With gender studies you look down in the locker room and then deny reality. Julia Williams and other gender expert says white supremacy denied that black women and women of color were female. Well, then wouldn't you then embrace biology which refutes that. You know, if you think about it, she's using horrible racism to justify a racing women. That logic moves backwards quicker than me in the ring with Tyrus.",

Gender Professor Kate Mason says lots of people are assigned male at birth have higher testosterone levels, it could never make a division one swimming team. Why do we attribute Thomas's current success to her assigned sex rather than to her long record as an elite swimmer? Well, you dope, because she was an OK male swimmer who's now beating outstanding female swimmers. Precisely because they don't have the innate muscle mass. Her aside maleness gave her, you dope. She conflates all males not being better swimmers than elite women to deny the fact that a mediocre male can dominate the female ranks. How nuts is that? And pardon me for saying nuts. I mean, that kind of squirrels eat. This nonsense makes me testy. I'm sorry. So, what defines a woman? In the article they say embracing reproductive justice, fighting the inequality of investment in girls sports and wage discrimination. Again, it's not biology, it's ideology which means a female could go her whole life without being female because she didn't obey the doctrines of gender studies graduates. That's intellectual fascism, not biology. And I say that as a proud woman of color.",

I'm really glad that judge wasn't asked something like complicated about the constitution, like define emoluments or something like that when she's supposed to be interpreting the law in the U.S. Constitution. And I think people are -- who are opposed to her nomination. It's not necessarily that they're opposed to her, obviously, but they do have questions of, if you can't define woman, how are you supposed to look at the law and interpret more complicated issues, especially when women are deeply embedded in the law when it comes to the issue of abortion or Title IX.

It's like they're not happy with anything white supremacist do. Will Billy Blanks be surprised? According to the author of physical fitness and far right extremists share an unhealthy obsession with masculinity, strength and competition. So, I guess a common stereotype is that black people are unathletic, and don't like sports? But Hitler wrote about the importance of boxing and jujitsu for his military. So, therefore, anyone into boxing, or MMA must be cool with the holocaust? This is a good time to remind the world that Hitler was a vegetarian. Mixed Martial Arts enthusiast are apparently the world's next great terror threat because we've run out of other terror threats -- Trump voters, truck drivers, parents.

She still makes me tingle and all the wrong places. But why was it so hard for a judge to answer this question? Because we've let the woke take the clearest distinctions in life and destroy it. And now people are terrified of facts. It's part of the left's trifecta, create victims, create new reasons to call people bigots and give college professors something to waste time on. USA Today came to Jackson's defense, but totally screwed it up by using nothing but gender studies scholars. Yes, there are scholars in gender studies. That's like being a tall munchkin. In the health and wellness section. Ironically, the headline reads, Marsha Blackburn ask Ketanji Brown Jackson to define women. Science says there's no simple answer. Yes, the same folks who came up with the phrase follow the science, then ignore their own advice when it doesn't benefit their politics. So, I guess we can't call Jackson the first black woman Supreme Court justice, because according to them, she might not be a woman. But in reality, what is female has been a simple question for the 300,000 years humans have existed. It's only in the last decade that idiots have turned it into a trick question on a biology test. And why? Because they prefer ideology over biology. So, there's no way to clearly define what makes someone a woman. Well, I got an idea to put this debate to rest, ask 100 men off the street. They'll define a woman as a human being who has a nurturing side. Who can be emotionally strong as a bull, who will always have your back forever and maybe the most beautiful creatures on earth but who can't parallel park. A sexist would say, but this is where USA Today screwed up. They interviewed only gender studies experts on questions of biology. That's like interviewing Dana Perino on death metal. And they all said Jackson was wrong to even cite biology. You thought Jackson was woke? When it comes to defining a woman compared to these zombies? She's Andrew Dice Clay. But this is from the freaks who brought you two plus two doesn't have to equal four. So, they believe that judge punted by referring to biology. According to gender studies professor Rebecca Jordan-Young, there's not even a singular biological answer to what is a female. Sarah Richardson another gender expert says science cannot settle what are really social questions. So, your sex is social, not biological. And I thought Bill Clinton was phony for trying to redefine what is his. No wonder dudes can share women's locker rooms, use female restrooms, and male perverts can move into female prisons. Its sex is just a social thing. You can do or say almost anything. That way a fact changes from what is to what people say it is. And biology which is based in absolutes is as unwelcome as Katie Pavlich at a PETA rally. Gender studies is like astrology. With astrology you look up to the skies and make up stuff. With gender studies you look down in the locker room and then deny reality. Julia Williams and other gender expert says white supremacy denied that black women and women of color were female. Well, then wouldn't you then embrace biology which refutes that. You know, if you think about it, she's using horrible racism to justify a racing women. That logic moves backwards quicker than me in the ring with Tyrus."

Gender Professor Kate Mason says lots of people are assigned male at birth have higher testosterone levels, it could never make a division one swimming team. Why do we attribute Thomas's current success to her assigned sex rather than to her long record as an elite swimmer? Well, you dope, because she was an OK male swimmer who's now beating outstanding female swimmers. Precisely because they don't have the innate muscle mass. Her aside maleness gave her, you dope. She conflates all males not being better swimmers than elite women to deny the fact that a mediocre male can dominate the female ranks. How nuts is that? And pardon me for saying nuts. I mean, that kind of squirrels eat. This nonsense makes me testy. I'm sorry. So, what defines a woman? In the article they say embracing reproductive justice, fighting the inequality of investment in girls sports and wage discrimination. Again, it's not biology, it's ideology which means a female could go her whole life without being female because she didn't obey the doctrines of gender studies graduates. That's intellectual fascism, not biology. And I say that as a proud woman of color."

It's not fair to me that she is beating me because six months ago, she was a man beating me, now she's a woman and I don't think I made any sense."

Scientifically, a woman is a human being who's an adult who has 2x chromosomes. That's the easiest scientific way to put it. I'm really glad that judge wasn't asked something like complicated about the constitution, like define emoluments or something like that when she's supposed to be interpreting the law in the U.S. Constitution. And I think people are -- who are opposed to her nomination. It's not necessarily that they're opposed to her, obviously, but they do have questions of, if you can't define woman, how are you supposed to look at the law and interpret more complicated issues, especially when women are deeply embedded in the law when it comes to the issue of abortion or Title IX. One thing I want to say about Lia Thomas, a year and a half ago, Lia Thomas was Will Thomas swimming on the men's team. So, this is not like a lifelong situation here."

On that list, Marines can grow their hair up to three inches instead of two. And edge it up to make for neater haircuts. They can now wear black or all of socks in addition to brown, yay. But the exciting part, female Marines can now wear two-tone nail polish. Although it must be in shades of pink or red that \"complements skin tone.\" Oh, that'll make for a sexy salute. Now, of course, plenty of people are calling all these changes woke B.S. Maybe it is or maybe it's changing with the times. Speaking of changes in the armed forces, the army has dropped its plans to have a six-event physical fitness test that is gender and age neutral. Apparently, men were passing the test at a much higher rate than women and older soldiers now who would be allowed to pass while meeting some reduced standards. Hmm.

Instead, it's oh, well, their stuff is too hard. It hasn't been too hard to make us the safest nation in the world. We have the number one military on the planet. Actually, I think were the top five, because people sacrificed and work their ass off to get in here to earn the right to wear that uniform. It's not just they -- people just want things given to them now. So, oh, I can't do 10 chin ups but I should be able to defend my country.

And local officials now say 300 men, women and children were killed last week when Russian forces struck that theater turned refugee shelter in Mariupol. An enormous inscription reading children was posted outside the theater in Russian, but it was struck anyway. And President Biden meeting with U.S. troops in Poland, telling them that the stakes of the Ukraine will go well beyond its borders.
