It looks like the Obamagate scandal is about to get a lot bigger. Acting National Intelligence Director, Ric Grenell, has declassified information about the Obama administration officials responsible for unmasking Michael Flynn. A source familiar with the intel saying those yet to be released names on the list will make waves. The DOJ is reviewing the documents ahead of a possible release. Remember, leaking unmasked information or using it for political gain is illegal. Barack Obama and Joe Biden facing renewed scrutiny over a key Oval Office meeting back in January 2017, where the Flynn investigation came up.

I do think a couple things so remember this -- supposedly, it was predicated on a counterintelligence investigation. And I think it would almost be worse if you had a rogue Justice Department and FBI not telling the president of the United States and the vice president, what they were up to. That would be super bad. Like, you would see that in a movie. I don't think that it would be unusual that President Obama would be informed and briefed about a counterintelligence investigation even if it involved the incoming administration. I think it would be a huge scandal if it was not. Now that said, for the people that were asked to have Flynn's name unmasked or got the unmasking, found out Flynn's name. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He found out whoever leaked that. That is obviously a very bad thing. And all of these people that worked for President Obama in that world. I bet you're going to see a couple things, Jesse, one, if they're -- they're going to want to talk about this, right? So if the DNI is declassifying their names, is it also fair then that he should declassify the information and basically let it all out so that they can defend themselves. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Because, as I would feel about it, like, if you had a top-secret clearance and you are a part of this and then your name gets out there but you're still under the clearance rules so that you can't talk about it and defend yourself. That doesn't seem exactly right. So I don't know where that part is going. But the second thing I think will happen is you're going to see all of these people lawyer up very quickly. And probably with pro bono lawyers, as you saw before with McCabe and Strzok, and those GoFundMe pages, if you'll remember those. But I think that will happen, so if they are not allowed to talk about it, they will lawyer up, and then it will go very quiet. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But the argument up to this point has been that the president wasn't involved. He didn't know anything. This, of course, he didn't reach the highest levels of the Obama administration. Well, now, we know at least that President Obama knew about it. And he was giving information to people at the Justice Department at the time, and details about it to them that they didn't have before. So it seems like he was pretty involved. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then you couple that with the Obama administration's history and actions of using the power of the federal government, whether it was the IRS going after Tea Party groups for political reasons or the Department of Justice going after gun dealerships by punishing their banks, or whether it was going after reporters who were talking to sources that Obama wanted to put behind bars for talking and leaking information. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So all of that information leads to more questions, and people want accountability for this. There has been a wrong here.

Yet our media, a bunch of tools, got suckered by this garbage, as well as panoply of politicians who chased this crap down. Steele himself was just a conduit for this nonsense.

      "utterance": "Well, I think this story is a big deal. I think the issue is a big deal, and we are seeing that play out. I do think a couple things so remember this -- supposedly, it was predicated on a counterintelligence investigation. And I think it would almost be worse if you had a rogue Justice Department and FBI not telling the president of the United States and the vice president, what they were up to. That would be super bad. Like, you would see that in a movie. I don't think that it would be unusual that President Obama would be informed and briefed about a counterintelligence investigation even if it involved the incoming administration. I think it would be a huge scandal if it was not. Now that said, for the people that were asked to have Flynn's name unmasked or got the unmasking, found out Flynn's name. He found out whoever leaked that. That is obviously a very bad thing. And all of these people that worked for President Obama in that world. I bet you're going to see a couple things, Jesse, one, if they're -- they're going to want to talk about this, right? So if the DNI is declassifying their names, is it also fair then that he should declassify the information and basically let it all out so that they can defend themselves. Because, as I would feel about it, like, if you had a top-secret clearance and you are a part of this and then your name gets out there but you're still under the clearance rules so that you can't talk about it and defend yourself. That doesn't seem exactly right. So I don't know where that part is going. But the second thing I think will happen is you're going to see all of these people lawyer up very quickly. And probably with pro bono lawyers, as you saw before with McCabe and Strzok, and those GoFundMe pages, if you'll remember those. But I think that will happen, so if they are not allowed to talk about it, they will lawyer up, and then it will go very quiet."

I mean, you can't say President Obama told him to call Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador, and discuss the sanctions regime for Russian interference. I don't think anyone wants to make that case. So I don't think that's Obama. I don't think that's Biden. No one is saying, oh, yeah, you know, he's that one that told Flynn go ahead and act as a lobbyist for Turkey but don't register as a lobbyist. Nobody is saying all that was done by Stone, by Manafort. Oh, that was all made up by the Obama administration.

And he was in the Oval Office when President Obama informed Sally Yates that the FBI had been listening in on phone calls that Michael Flynn had made to the Russian ambassador. So for him to say he doesn't know anything doesn't really, you know, stick with the facts here on the situation. But, you know, Dana made a good point that the president of the United States would, of course, be involved and informed of a counterintelligence investigation, especially if it was someone who was on a campaign in the political sense. But the argument up to this point has been that the president wasn't involved. He didn't know anything. This, of course, he didn't reach the highest levels of the Obama administration. Well, now, we know at least that President Obama knew about it. And he was giving information to people at the Justice Department at the time, and details about it to them that they didn't have before. So it seems like he was pretty involved. And then you couple that with the Obama administration's history and actions of using the power of the federal government, whether it was the IRS going after Tea Party groups for political reasons or the Department of Justice going after gun dealerships by punishing their banks, or whether it was going after reporters who were talking to sources that Obama wanted to put behind bars for talking and leaking information. So all of that information leads to more questions, and people want accountability for this. There has been a wrong here. And they want to know which public officials that they were paying were unfairly and illegally leaking information and names to the media on a citizen who had done nothing wrong."

Because I think he didn't know, because I can't believe anybody would come to him for advice. The guy was more out of the loop than a drunken figure skater. He was just a nice guy you had in the room who shook hands and wore the aviator glasses. As for this being a waste of government time and we should be focusing on the Wuhan virus, I said that three months ago. I said that four months ago in January when I was screaming about the Wuhan virus. And everybody was intent to watch the impeachment hearings. So nobody can lecture anybody on that. It's a load of crap. I am curious where the hyperventilating, tick-tick-boom idiots who drooled over every Russian name in the phonebook, why isn't Rachel Maddow leading her show with the scandal behind the scandal? If this is a joke, if this is meaningless, how about your three-and-a-half your delusional fantasy that went on based solely on somebody knowing somebody? You only had thoughts but no proof, so you inflated your thoughts into proof. And now, you find out that it's worse than you thought because it involves Trump -- Obama, your side. So now it scares you. This leads to something that I've always wanted to talk about but we could never talk about it on THE FIVE, because it was too gross, the Steele dossier, which is behind all of this, right? We could never talk about it, because the media used it as a shield of scuz. Like, they could talk about it at late-night shows. We could never really get into it because the content of the dossier was sufficiently lurid, right? So the media could use it at will. We really couldn't touch it. But let's be clear how the Republic -- how the Russians -- getting ahead of myself -- how the Russians really praying to us, because the Steele dossier was a cartoon version of what you think would enrage Obama loyalists. You had a Russian going what if we tell them that we have hookers defile the bed Obama has slept in front of Mr. Trump. That's what we tell them. How obviously absurd and fake is that? All that's missing is Boris Batanov (ph), Natasha, and perhaps Rasputin in the same room. Yet our media, a bunch of tools, got suckered by this garbage, as well as panoply of politicians who chased this crap down. Steele himself was just a conduit for this nonsense. So the real hilarious punchline of the last four years is that a porno fantasy suckered all of our bright minds in the media and all our sharp dressers in D.C."

You have to ask -- you have to say how would you have done this differently? But you cannot use 20/20 hindsight. We do know that Trump relied on experts, and experts were wrong on masks, tests, ventilators, and especially the experts that were informing Cuomo rest homes. So if you believe that you would've done better, the big question -- if you knew something, why did you hold out on us? All you smarty-pants people in the media, why did you have this inside info on fighting a virus and held it back for us? And that -- it is amazingly -- it's amazing how accurate pundits and politicians are when they're looking backward, like the standard for testing, you know? Tell us exactly what the standard for testing is, considering the experts don't even know what it is because they haven't dealt with it before. So the thing is you can't tell what a good job is when it's the first job. We know it could always be better. But you don't know how. So do not trust the media on this, but do not fault people, whether it is Fauci, whether it is Trump, even whether it is Cuomo, who give advice or take a risk and turn out to be wrong, because everybody's going to be wrong on this no matter what."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, because government has done so well over the last so many years. To Greg's point about the Democrats' strategy, it's a great point because we still don't know what the Democrats' strategy is, because all they say is Trump is either doing things too slowly or he's doing things too quickly. So all it is, is just a complaint. I mean, Petraeus had the surge strategy. Though, Trump had the tariff of strategy with China. There is no Democrat strategy on this. It's whining. That's all it is. So I watched this entire hearing. And it's incredibly frustrating because they have set these traps with tests. Now, we would have gotten the tests sooner if China hadn't destroyed the virus samples in the lab, if they had just shared it with the rest of the world. We could have gotten the tests a lot quicker. But now, here's what they are doing with testing. Now that we've tested more people than all the other countries in the world combined, they say OK, well, the testing rate isn't good enough. Permission to make a sports analogy, Dana, this is like when a quarterback goes 9 for 10 for 100 yards. And the opposing quarterback goes 39 for 50 for 400 yards. The Democrats think the quarterback that went 9 for 10 is better because he had a better completion percentage. No, anybody with a brain will take the quarterback that had 39 completions for 400 yards. So don't fall into that trap. I do agree, though. Testing needs to get better. And I was disappointed with the CDC director, this guy, Redfield. I don't get a good feeling about him. They had the lab contamination early. He doesn't inspire confidence. He is a poor communicator. He is not clear. He doesn't look charged up. Something about this guy I don't like. I can't put my finger on it. But the fact that he hasn't been out in front center on this whole thing from the beginning, as the CDC director, tells you a lot."

You know, we see them in the official setting of a Senate hearing. And you think it's just some guy in a suit. In response to what Jesse was saying, by the way, I was taken by the idea that you had Republicans like Lamar Alexander, Mitt Romney saying, hey, the testing has just not been sufficient and nothing to celebrate. And especially if we are looking towards reopening schools in the fall, we don't have that in place. Fauci was very clear about that. We don't have any kind of regiment or testing or any kind of way that we can assure the chance at the University of Tennessee, for example, I think that's what they were talking about, with Senator Alexander, that you can open school in the fall. Because right now, it just doesn't seem that that's a reasonable goal to have. The other thing I would say is in terms of what Fauci said, again, I don't think this is Republican or Democrat. I think Fauci just said with those -- with the potential for spikes out across our country, not just in the big cities. There is just too much potential for death and more suffering and more people getting sick. And I -- it was very clear to me that he was trying to not politicize it, not to get into a back-and-forth with Rand Paul, but to say he was speaking as a scientist and that people should listen."

Fauci said absolutely, that is possible."

There would be severe consequences for that. And also, Dr. Fauci said that the vast majority of people who get this disease recover. And I think there needs to be more focus on the recovery numbers in addition to the new cases and the continuation of the flattening of the curve. And in the end, they're going to be consequences on both sides of this no matter what decision they make. Do you keep it locked down? There will be severe consequences in so many different sectors for that. If you open it back up, yes, there will be more cases, but the deal was never to have zero cases.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You were right. You can't read his mind. The fact that he says -- he calls everybody nasty, Dana. We know that. We know he calls everybody names."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No. You know, that's the thing about one man and --"
    },

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "He treated Rand Paul pretty bad during the -- oh, my God. Is your amnesia that bad? Is your amnesia that bad that you forget the debates and what he did to everybody during the debates, the nicknames? He was ruthless. All right, we got to move. Dana, last word to you. Thoughts. Do you find that her question -- here's a -- I felt her question was deliberately designed to create some attention and not to gain knowledge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, welcome to the White House press briefings. I mean, that's been true for a long time. You know, the question about testing had come up over and over again. I will say that when -- as soon as I heard him say it, I was like, she might take offense at it or it might gain some steam. And even if he didn't mean it that way, it's how it comes across and perception is a lot of it. The briefing was really good yesterday about testing. We've got a lot of information out there. And I think the White House wants more of these briefings. So if the 18th question on testing is going to push everybody over the edge may be just asked 16 questions on testing next time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, there you go. All right, up next, will Joe Biden ever come out of hiding? The former V.P. explains his basement campaign next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "The Coronavirus taking Joe Biden off the campaign trail, forcing him to campaign from his basement in Delaware. Now, critics claim the Democrats are hiding him. But the presumptive nominee, he's pushing back. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "I'm anxious to go out and campaign, George. You know, when I campaign, I'm usually the first one there and the last one to leave. I enjoy interfacing with people. I'm not trying to avoid it, but I'm trying to set an example as to how we should proceed in terms of dealing with this health and economic crisis."

      "speaker": "GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ANCHOR, ABC NEWS",
      "utterance": "Finally, Mr. Vice President --"

      "speaker": "BIDEN",
      "utterance": "And no damage so far that I can see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So Jessie, do you think that's right? No damage so far. He's up, I think, it's plus four and the Real Clear Politics average polls and the President's approval rating not going up, but about 45 disapproval about 51, so what's the damage to the Biden?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, you're wrong because Biden's lead on Trump went from seven to four since the quarantine. And Trump is in an all-time high in Gallup 49 percent approval. So Biden has lost ground under quarantine. He doesn't want to leave his house. He's afraid to go outside. He wouldn't know what to do if he went outside and his advisors are still getting paid. So they're happy to keep Joe locked up so he doesn't make more gaffs. I mean, it's -- Biden could go get a test. He could go tour at a mask factory. He could go look at a lab. They just opened up Amtrak. He could take a ride on Amtrak. People could see him getting out there, and it would inspire confidence. He says he's doing this because he wants to lead by example. No one looks to Joe Biden to say what to do with coronavirus. Every interview, he's coughing touching his face. Come on, the guy doesn't know what he's doing. The other thing is to -- Juan, listen, Joe Biden is going to get rusty in the basement. He's out of shape. He's going to come in and the debates are going to go up. He's going to get his clock clean. He's not ready. And no one's ever said Joe Biden has been a strong campaigner. That's -- no one has ever said this guy is a workaholic. So stop acting like he's the first one there and the last one to leave."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So Greg, the question arises, the president says he'll get Joe Biden the test so you can get out of the basement, get on the campaign trail, but do you think that Biden is just happy to have a referendum on Trump and Trump's briefings and every mistake Trump makes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "No. I mean, again, what is it -- what -- how sad is it when the best thing you can say about your candidate is that he's out of sight, right? That -- it's like -- it's such a relief that he's hidden. The pandemic gave the Democrats the perfect excuse to keep Biden under wraps. Oh, he's quarantining. He's now like a generic candidate in a survey. He's there and not there. If the Dems have their way, no one will see Joe in the flesh until Election Day when they will come out in bubble wrap, you know, with a pre-recorded message. You know, this is not -- this is not a candidate you could support if he must be kept in secret. His best trait is his absence, which is why they're navigating to find some kind of V.P. that will add to it. And how -- I mean -- and I believe it's probably going to be Kamala Harris, right? Because you know why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Katie, what do you think about -- I think -- I don't know, personally. I don't. But Katie, what do you think about the ads? I see that the Trump campaign is going to roll out $10 million in ads trying to tie Biden to China?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, the digital game is one that the Trump campaign has won before. They have a lot of money to do it. And the Biden campaign is running this ad in places like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, blaming President Trump for the collapse of the economy. Well, that opens the door right up to say, do you want to Biden economy which he mimic less than two percent GDP growth as you saw, or do you want a Trump economy? So -- and the China thing, there's a lot of questions that he's going to have to answer about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So Dana, where would you go on that? If you're the Trump campaign, do you think it's early to be spending that much money? It seems early, but they have a lot of money to spend."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "No, I don't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "They have -- they've raised a tremendous amount of money. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes, they have a lot of money. And remember that adage that presidential campaigns are won or lost in the late spring in early summer. So, I think now is absolutely the time that both campaigns should try to step on the gas. We're in a pandemic. That might look very different. I have a feeling and got a little Spidey sense that we might not actually see Joe Biden until late summer, you know, leaving his house. I think that that is an actual possibility. However, I think the country is so polarized that up -- that you will see this race be neck and neck all the way up until the fall."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Thanks, Dana. Coming up, a dangerous situation in prisons. Inmates trying to infect themselves with the coronavirus on purpose. Wow. We're going to tell you more about that after the break on THE FIVE."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. Coronavirus chaos wrapping up in some major liberal California cities. San Francisco coming under fire after a homeless camp tripled in size during outbreak. The city being sued because the encampment grew by 300 percent creating unsanitary and unsafe conditions. And over in Los Angeles, a sheriff saying inmates are deliberately trying to infect themselves with the coronavirus in an effort to get early release. So this is a lightning round. Dana, what are your thoughts about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",

      "utterance": "Yes, Dana, lightning round, over to you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "OK. I think one -- yes, a lot of people do recover from the virus, but a lot of people get very, very sick and many, many people have died. So trying to infect yourself is a terrible idea. California had so many problems before this pandemic that now this is all compounding. And we just heard right before this show that the public health commissioner in Los Angeles County is basically saying they might not be able to let up on their lockdown for another three months. So their problems are just like exponentially growing."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Greg?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, inmates trying to get the virus is a lesson in incentives. The government incentivize them by linking the disease to freedom. And the choice was kind of logical. Five years in a cell with somebody who hate or take a chance at two weeks to three weeks of near-death illness, I would take the risk too, and I'm kind of OK with prison. I like three meals and being alone. As for the broken system that Dana mentioned, it's enabled by moral cowards who are fearful that any adult decision dealing with the homeless and mentally ill will be viewed as the media as anti-compassion. And that isn't going to get better in a pandemic."

But they just trying to outsmart the system and you just got to treat it as utter stupidity. That's all I would say."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, if I went to prison, which I probably will when the deep state sets a perjury trap for me, I would do whatever I could to get out. I'd ask, you know, Big Leroy to cough right in my face so I could get out of there. Whatever it takes."

Yes, he's just passed out. It's early. He just fell asleep. Now, he denies he fell asleep. He said he was looking down at his iPad. Sure, you were. Sure, you were. Who knows what he did, but he looks like he dosed up. Anyway, Kilmeade would never do that, ever, ever. Maybe I do see (INAUDIBLE). All right, Dana, what do you got?"
