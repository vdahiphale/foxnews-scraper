Now, many of you I know, not all, but many of you voted against Donald Trump by voting for Biden. And at the time, I think you felt good about it, virtuous even. Especially, you suburban women. You're the biggest voting cohort making up to, what, 24 percent of the voters in 2020?

Well, the events of the last year and especially of the past six months demonstrate that you've got a lot more trouble than you bargained for. The fact is, there are now more moderates left in the Democrat party to rein in the radicals.

His stupid gun control speech today just confirms what we noted last night, that Democrats defiantly refuse to do what we all know works to reduce crime. And they're doing that in favor of empty symbolic gestures that satisfy their rabid anti Second Amendment base. Now under the leadership of President Bill Clinton, and with the help of then Senator Joe Biden and Republicans, remember, they all tackled rising crime in the 1990s. Did a good job of it. But now that the hard left is in charge, they're simply never going to crack down on crime.

Why would anyone risk his or her life for a country that's systemically racist, one that brutalizes minorities? Why would any country respect us or follow our lead if that's who we are? Those are some of the questions he should probably think about before he touts the value of teaching far left Marxist racist ideology to our troops.

He'll do everything they tell him as long as they keep the Military industrial complex flush with cash. But is any of this what mothers and fathers in the suburbs thought they were getting when they voted for sweet old Joe Biden? Think about all of this. If you worked hard trying to raise a family, if you paid your taxes, you're a good citizen, you have every right to expect that where you live will be safe and clean, that your schools will be functional.

But the hard left, they're fine with urban America living this way.

But try to imagine what our country is going to look like if the far left is allowed to get away with teaching an entire generation or two or three, to despise our country and its founding, to view the traditions we grew up loving, from singing the Star Spangled Banner at a baseball game to flying our flag. Consider those things like racist dog whistles? Plus, let's remember many of you suburbanites, either run successful businesses, or you work at one. You may feel insulated, I know, from the madness around you. But if you think that, you're sorely mistaken.

They think putting up BLM approved yard signs or trendy flags are going to protect them? They're not going to protect them. They think giving money to Democrats or Black Lives Matter affiliated groups is going to save them? It won't save them. If the canceled culture doesn't get you, the racial division squads in the schools will get your kids and then they're going to turn your kids against you. And then crime is going to start seeping into your neighborhoods just in time for you to see the cost of everything go up. And of course, that means your paycheck won't go as far.

We have a ton to get to. So let's dive right in. It's do or die in the suburbs. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, it's a moment of truth for all you moderates living in the suburbs. Now, many of you I know, not all, but many of you voted against Donald Trump by voting for Biden. And at the time, I think you felt good about it, virtuous even. Especially, you suburban women. You're the biggest voting cohort making up to, what, 24 percent of the voters in 2020? And you went 59 percent for Biden, and only 40 percent for Trump. Well, you felt good about yourselves at the time, but what about now? Well, the events of the last year and especially of the past six months demonstrate that you've got a lot more trouble than you bargained for. The fact is, there are now more moderates left in the Democrat party to rein in the radicals. And as I warn now, I think it was exactly almost a year ago, Biden's too weak to stand up to the hard left."

And if you resist or you don't publicly profess your white guilt, they'll destroy you. They hate our history, our traditions and our way of life."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, not to mention that Biden's lackeys want to wipe the suburbs off the map. Now like everything else, they see the suburbs as themselves, inherently racist. Kind of the sign of decadent white privilege built on the backs of minority suffering. Now, as we've warned you, the administration will cajole localities into eliminating so called exclusionary zoning laws that make the suburbs possible. Goodbye picket fence houses, hello high rises, and multi-use living, and of course, the ramp in crime that can come along with it. Now, speaking of which, Biden's answer to the terrifying spiral of crime that's sweeping across the country, should itself be a wake up call to all you suburbanites who voted for him. His stupid gun control speech today just confirms what we noted last night, that Democrats defiantly refuse to do what we all know works to reduce crime. And they're doing that in favor of empty symbolic gestures that satisfy their rabid anti Second Amendment base. Now under the leadership of President Bill Clinton, and with the help of then Senator Joe Biden and Republicans, remember, they all tackled rising crime in the 1990s. Did a good job of it. But now that the hard left is in charge, they're simply never going to crack down on crime. They just mouth platitudes about community engagement, and then they shovel taxpayer money out the door to their cronies."

Yesterday, one more was killed with five wounded by gunfire, including a 15-year-old boy shot in a drive by. But of all the depressing headlines about inner city America in the past few days, I found one particularly disturbing. 57 dead in 50 days as violence continues to ravage Baltimore City. Today, these two men, Christian St. Rose and Jamal Kingsborough were arrested for the shocking midday execution of their 34-year-old Tony Hedgspeth. Yet no protests, no marches, no celebrity demands for justice for these victims. And if you refuse to submit to what their thought process is about why crime is exploding, what are they going to do, they're going to try to run you over.

I want to understand white rage, and I'm white, and I want to understand it. It's important that we understand that because our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and guardians, they come from the American people. It matters to our Military and the discipline and cohesion of this Military."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Let's pull the active duty servicemen and women about that, sir. Now, somehow, I don't think General Milley would ever speak in this dismissive tone that he took today to his Chinese counterparts. Not the way he spoke to congressman Waltz who questioned him. I have a question for the General. Why would anyone risk his or her life for a country that's systemically racist, one that brutalizes minorities? Why would any country respect us or follow our lead if that's who we are? Those are some of the questions he should probably think about before he touts the value of teaching far left Marxist racist ideology to our troops. The fact is Milley has made his choice and he has chosen to indulge the radical whims of Democrats. He'll do everything they tell him as long as they keep the Military industrial complex flush with cash. But is any of this what mothers and fathers in the suburbs thought they were getting when they voted for sweet old Joe Biden? Think about all of this. If you worked hard trying to raise a family, if you paid your taxes, you're a good citizen, you have every right to expect that where you live will be safe and clean, that your schools will be functional. They teach your kids an informed patriotism, and prepare your children for the challenging world ahead. I mean, this should be the case no matter where you live in a country like the United States of America, whether you're in the city or the or the country, rural America. If we think about it, in urban America, the middle class right now, it flees as soon as it can, because liberal leadership has driven it all into the gutter in the cities. But the hard left, they're fine with urban America living this way. But I don't think the rest of the country wants to live that way. Most Republican-run States are blueprints for better, more prosperous and safer living today. But try to imagine what our country is going to look like if the far left is allowed to get away with teaching an entire generation or two or three, to despise our country and its founding, to view the traditions we grew up loving, from singing the Star Spangled Banner at a baseball game to flying our flag. Consider those things like racist dog whistles? Plus, let's remember many of you suburbanites, either run successful businesses, or you work at one. You may feel insulated, I know, from the madness around you. But if you think that, you're sorely mistaken. No one is safe in their land of thought control. Just in the past month everyone from a liberal playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda to Singer Billie Eilish has felt the need to apologize for their supposed unwokeism. And things went to a new level of the absurd when 89- year-old legend Rita Mareno had to apologize for dismissing the colorism attacks against Mr. Miranda. The point is, if those beloved celebrities aren't safe from these vicious takedown mobs, why would your average suburban mother without any power, celebrity status, things should be safe. They think putting up BLM approved yard signs or trendy flags are going to protect them? They're not going to protect them. They think giving money to Democrats or Black Lives Matter affiliated groups is going to save them? It won't save them. If the canceled culture doesn't get you, the racial division squads in the schools will get your kids and then they're going to turn your kids against you. And then crime is going to start seeping into your neighborhoods just in time for you to see the cost of everything go up. And of course, that means your paycheck won't go as far. Does that sound like building back better to you? And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Glenn Youngkin, Republican gubernatorial candidate for the great Commonwealth of Virginia. Glenn, good to see you tonight. Your reaction to what we saw unfolding in Loudon County last night. And what it says about this grass roots movement of parents fighting back."

And what we saw last night was yet another chapter that was just so disturbing, where parents are standing up for their children, teachers are standing up for their children, and they're being canceled. And we must recognize that this election that we're having in Virginia this year is, in fact, going to be the first moment for Virginians, but also for Americans, to see the entire Commonwealth of Virginia stand up and say no more.

This is the absolute antithesis of what we know we need to do as society in a community which is come together and actually find things that unite us. At a time we are coming out of a pandemic, and absolutely trying to get our lives back and reestablish something that is much closer to common sense, we're seeing chaos.

This was revolving door of criminality in the United States. \"Across the nation, states and local jurisdictions are recognizing the need to shift from our reliance from monetary bail. That's why we must invest in programs that allow localities to release individuals before trial.\" Glenn, what is that going to do with everyone from MS-13 gang members or [ph] dabbling in gang members to the garden variety criminals that are wreaking havoc in our cities and in our suburbs.

I legitimately think he is confusing critical race theory for some type of diversity training, or a history class on fascism and communism. I have no problem with history and understanding our history or with diversity, but understanding that critical race theory is teaching our future Military leaders that they need to resist, our very basic institutions that our Constitution, our court system, our political system is bad, and at its core is racist, misogynist, colonialist, and therefore needs to be pushed back against. These are just some kids out in Cal Berkeley, sitting out there smoking pot somewhere, these are the cadets at West Point, the future leaders of our Military that will one day have their finger on the button, and it is a cancer. Critical race theory is a cancer that needs to be carved out. The Secretary of Defense didn't even realize it's being taught at West Point to include a seminar on how to deal with your whiteness and your white race. I can't think of anything that is more divisive and more destructive to unit morale and the cohesiveness of our Military."

Why is Congress not saying we're not going to give you a penny until all of this is eradicated from the Military budget? Nothing. This is my offer to you. Nothing. That's what I would say.

Congress should not be sending money to the Military in order to teach critical race theory. Frankly, we need our white men and women who serve in our armed forces to be prepared, to defend our nation against all foreign entities that are going to cause us harm, not having to answer for their whiteness. That is ridiculous. That is a joke. If you want to study the history of the nation, study the history of the nation. But let's be very clear, critical race theory is a subjective lens to view the history of the country, not an objective study of the history of the United States. CRT is going to split our Military ranks, like it splits our young children in schools. It has no place there. It has no place in K-12 education. And the United States government should not be funding that. If academics want to theorize in the halls of academia, it's a free country. God bless you. Go, do it.

Now despite this, our political and media elites are obsessed with forcing vaccinations on kids. Well, now the vaccination push is even more twisted. The CDC's Vaccine Advisory Committee now says there's likely a link between the COVID vaccines and a dangerous heart condition in young adults and teens. Now, for weeks this show along with my medicine cabinet, we've been documenting these cases. We've called out the reckless and unethical effort to push these vaccines on kids. And for that we've been smeared, not just as anti- vax, but responsible for deaths. Like so many other COVID revelations, we've once again been proven right. Joining us now two of those aforementioned members of the medicine cabinet, Dr. Harvey Risch, professor of epidemiology at Yale; and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, professor of medicine at Stanford University. Dr. Bhattacharya, let's start with you. Now, despite this startling admission, the CDC is still pushing forward with the idea of mass vaccinations for kids. Just yesterday, Rochelle Walensky, CDC Director, was back at it. So your response to this?"

Here, we have a link for young boys that is solid. I mean, one in 15,000 on that order. And in Israel, the rates were even higher of Myocarditis, a serious side effect of this vaccine for that group. I think it's worth thinking about whether it's really right to do that. It might not come down on the side. It doesn't make sense. Since the risk of COVID is so low in young boys, I think we should just pause."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Myocarditis and pericarditis are much more common if you get COVID-19, and the risks to the heart from COVID-19 infection can be more severe.\" Dr. Risch, you first on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. HARVEY RISCH, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH",
      "utterance": "Well, this came about because of the CDC's review panel, as you mentioned, that reviewed and did a cost-benefit, a risk-hazard analysis, benefit analysis, for myocarditis after vaccination versus COVID results. And I was astonished at what they put in this report, and it made me angry, actually, that they treat the myocarditis cases that comes out of the VAERS database as if they are a real count of the number of cases that have occurred after vaccination. We know that Harvard has estimated that at between one and 10 percent of the reality. Most of these cases are still not evaluated because there's a backlog from January of evaluating these cases. And many of these cases are asymptomatic, their silent. They can be screened for and found, but they are not found in the VAERS. So there's at least 10 times the number of myocarditis cases if not 50 times that have occurred up to now that the CDC is ignoring in order to make a statement that's contrary to the facts."

And I think rightly so given the cost-benefit analysis, risk-benefit analysis to the young, especially when the old are vaccinated. Am I missing something here?"

      "utterance": "No. I think the right thing to do to regain trust with the public is just tell the public honestly for whom the vaccine really makes sense, which is the older populations. The risk of COVID is so bad that it's worth taking some small risks from the vaccine, admittedly, but just be honest about what it is. For the younger populations, it doesn't make sense. If you squarely tell the American population what the risks are, they'll listen to you. They'll take your recommendations. But if you come across as pushing for a vaccination in a group for whom it's clear that it doesn't look like there's a huge benefit, people are going to start to distrust, honestly distrust you. And I think one of the things I think I'm most concerned about is, how do we regain that trust? Public health has to be trusted. It serves a really important role. And during the pandemic, its squandered much of that public trust."

      "speaker": "RISCH",

And I think the problem is, as Dr. Bhattacharya said, that the federal agencies have told the public what the agencies want the public to know that will motivate them to carry out the agencies' plans rather than the truth. If there are side effects, you tell the truth, you say what the side effects are. Give the public credit for the ability to evaluate the evidence for themselves. Don't railroad it down on them because you think the public can't decide for themselves."
