      "sentences": "Welcome to this special edition of \"Hannity.\" Democratic scandals. I'm Jeanine Pirro in tonight for Sean. The bad news keeps piling up for liberals. The Detroit Free Press, the hometown newspaper of Congressman John Conyers is now calling for him to resign. This comes as the House Ethics Committee has launched an investigation into Congressman Conyers after he admitted that his office paid out $27,000 in taxpayer money. This harassment complaint from a former staffer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And just breaking tonight, according to The Washington Post, a new woman is accusing Congressman Conyers of calling her in to his office while he was in his underwear. The woman is also alleging that Conyers harassed and verbally abused her. An attorney for Congressman Conyers is saying, he has no plans to resign. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight, two new women are telling The Huffington Post that Senator Al Franken inappropriately touched them in separate incidents. And, a new Politico poll shows that 50 percent of voters think that Senator Franken should resign. This survey was conducted after radio host Leanne Tweeden released this photo showing Franken groping her during a 2006 USO tour. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But before a second woman put out this image, where she is alleging that Senator Franken grabbed her behind. Now, despite all those allegations, against Congressman Conyers and Senator Franken, Democrats in the media are still defending them. When asked about the allegations against Conyers, Congressman James Clyburn told the \"New York Times,\" quote, \"You can't jump to conclusions with these types of things for all I know all of this could be made up.\" And Senator Mazie Hirono from Hawaii, put aside calls for Senator Franken resignation. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The Detroit Free Press, the hometown newspaper of Congressman John Conyers is now calling for him to resign. This comes as the House Ethics Committee has launched an investigation into Congressman Conyers after he admitted that his office paid out $27,000 in taxpayer money. This harassment complaint from a former staffer. And just breaking tonight, according to The Washington Post, a new woman is accusing Congressman Conyers of calling her in to his office while he was in his underwear. The woman is also alleging that Conyers harassed and verbally abused her. An attorney for Congressman Conyers is saying, he has no plans to resign. Also tonight, two new women are telling The Huffington Post that Senator Al Franken inappropriately touched them in separate incidents. And, a new Politico poll shows that 50 percent of voters think that Senator Franken should resign. This survey was conducted after radio host Leanne Tweeden released this photo showing Franken groping her during a 2006 USO tour. But before a second woman put out this image, where she is alleging that Senator Franken grabbed her behind. Now, despite all those allegations, against Congressman Conyers and Senator Franken, Democrats in the media are still defending them. When asked about the allegations against Conyers, Congressman James Clyburn told the \"New York Times,\" quote, \"You can't jump to conclusions with these types of things for all I know all of this could be made up.\" And Senator Mazie Hirono from Hawaii, put aside calls for Senator Franken resignation.

So, when you get to four and you have the photo evidence with Leann Tweeden, how can he possibly survived, Judge?"

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

You know, everyone has tried to draw a distinction including the woman, Tammy, who wrote the article, the op-ed piece for the New York Times and then felt guilty that she said Al Franken should resign. But just before I come to you with a question, here's his so-called apology. Everyone said he apologized. Ergo he should be forgiven. He says, the first thing I want to do is apologize. I want to apologize to you personally, talking to Leann and he says, I understand how or why you could feel violated by the photo. He does not at any point in time apologize to her for touching her breasts, whether it was under the Kevlar vest or not. His hands are on that. He apologizes for taking a photo. Nothing more."

As somebody who has been violated in that way, I can just tell everyone, and every woman who has experienced that, that is a sexual assault. And so that is her other allegation. He doesn't even mention that. But here's the conundrum, of course. Now that we also know they have paid $17 million out in Congress that we know this is a problem for the liberals, for the Democratic Party, if one person resigns, there is going to be no excuse for someone else in the same position not to resign. This is why they can't allow him to do that. Because who knows how many seats they would lose. But this also goes beyond. It comes down really, too, the nature of what the Clintons did to this party. They set a tone in the `90s that as long as you are right on the issues, if you speak properly about feminism and if you are on their side, you have free reign. In other words, we are going to sacrifice individual women's lives for the collective. This is an abandonment of women. It's an abandonment of feminism by everyone who is a liberal. And finally now it's clear. And this is -- this has got to be the thing on which we sweep out part of the swamp."

Instead of saying it's a personal issue between Bill and Hillary and instead talked about the moral core of this country and the power between relationship between women who were vulnerable and men who were in power, so many thousands of women wouldn't have suffered. But I want to read something to you where Conyers' attorney is now saying he is not going to resign and if people were required to resign over allegations, a lot of people would be out of work in the country, including many members of the House Senate and even the president. I don't agree with the last one. But, don't you think we ought to clear out the House and the Senate because for two decades they have spent $17 million of our money to cover their sexual harassment. They should all be gone and doesn't this speak to the issue of term limits?"

One of the most devastating things about the Conyers accusations involves that latest accusation that you just mentioned a woman named Melanie Sloan who is a tough lady, she's a liberal, she worked for Conyers some years back. She is used to standing up to people. And she -- in that story, that came out this evening, she said that she went to Dick Gephardt and other leaders in the Democratic Party and complained about Conyers, told them sorts of things that he had done to her. And to other staffers, and they all turned a blind eye to it. And so, I think there is a lot more questions that need to be asked and we need to find out a whole lot more about who has been along the way that swept this stuff under the rug."

The Democratic Party is clearly collapsing and all of this kind of false front that held that up and kept people at bay and afraid now that is gone. You got the book shattered, you got Donna Brazile's book. And now it's free for everyone to speak the truth. This is where the Republicans have to stand up for what they say is right. And they do stand for women. They stand for individual freedom, for us to be able to live our lives freely. The Democrats are destroying women's lives.

They are going to pay for each other's sins while women are forced to sit for 90 days or 180 days and then forced to mediate. It's like in domestic violence.

That takes no guts to walk around the battlefield and shoot the wounded and shoot the people that are already dead. Where was Kathleen Sibelius when it mattered when these people were powerful?

Brady has yet to be charged but the FBI has executed a search warrant of the Congressman's AOL email accounts with probable cause to believe that he committed election law violations. Joining us now with more is Salem radio nationally syndicated host Larry Elder and Fox News contributor Kevin Jackson. All right. Good evening, gentlemen, I must tell you that I know someone who years ago offered a job to a primary opponent in a state assembly race in New York and as a result of that he was indicted and he ended up going to jail.

And this is not going to happen anymore. And in Philadelphia as I mentioned, one of the most corrupt cities in the country, they had an 11 term congressman just indicted and charged and thrown out of office.

What Donald Trump had done with Al Franken or some of these other people had done, we would have reacted identically the same. Our moral core stays complete. It's Larry's point, now only are Democrats bad when it comes to the issue of sexual harassment, they are bad on every other policy. Look at their policy on immigration. You can find 50 high level Democrats who said, we need to secure the borders for all the reasons that Donald Trump says. You can find 50 Democrats during the time of Obama that said, we need to look at our Muslim refugee resettlement program and so on and so forth. All they care about who is in power. And so, right now they are living on the muscle memory. They don't know, do the Clintons still have power or do they not? And that's what you are seeing. They don't know for sure."

Could it be that if a senator resigns like Al Franken, that maybe you know, if there is a Republican governor, the Republican governor gets to a point that this is not about women. It's not about their moral core. It's about rank politics. It's about power and money and it has nothing to do with moral campus."

How come you didn't go after John Conyers? They are now caught in their hypocrisy. And recall, after Kathleen Willey claimed she was groped by Bill Clinton, a feminist name Gloria Steinem wrote a column and said, even if you believe what Kathleen Willey said is true, that's not sexual harassment. Because Bill Clinton stopped after being told to stop. Are you kidding me? This is the way where the left twisted themselves to defend the Clintons and now the chickens have come home to roost."

And the problem they're having, Judge, is they still don't understand where the power structure is. So, they are still trying to weed out, do the Clintons still have power? Does the Obama have any power? In fact, I heard they are going to bring Bill Clinton out to campaign. Somebody wants the Clinton to campaign in 2018."

President Trump said this on the campaign trail that Hillary was instrumental in trying to silence and delegitimize the accusers against Bill Clinton. She said earlier oh, it's somehow a two term president's fault that I lost the election. You didn't campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin. You got outworked.

Harvey Weinstein, it's getting a public moment. And I think that is why you are hearing more kind of soul searching.

The woman who wrote the op-ed piece in the New York Times saying Al Franken has to go and then had a change of heart the next day and says nah, he shouldn't really have to go. It's base politics. When they realize that if Al Franken goes, then, you know, there is going to be a new Senator and, you know, that the political climate or the political balance in this country is going to change, and then when Democrats say you can't believe a woman just based on an allegation, and yet, when the president says the same thing, he is destroyed.

These people are no longer politically relevant to the media or the Democratic Party. So now they are able to expose all this stuff. If Hillary Clinton won the election.
