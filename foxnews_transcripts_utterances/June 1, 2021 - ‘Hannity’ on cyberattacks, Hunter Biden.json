      "sentences": "And welcome to HANNITY this Tuesday night. Tonight, we begin with a bombshell report in \"The New York Post\". It reveals Joe Biden did, in fact, meet with zero experience Hunter's business associates, foreign associates from Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, all while Joe was vice president. This in spite of the numerous claims by Joe himself that he never, ever, talked to zero experienced Hunter about his overseas business dealings. Why did you lie, Joe? We need to know the truth? What's going on? And, Joey, if your last name was Trump, well, you know what that would mean. You'd be impeached and probably indicted. There'd be a grand jury summoned immediately. By the way, if you even know what that means anymore. We're going to unpeel the layers of this report coming up. We'll ask an important question. Is the corrupt Biden family syndicate now impacting U.S. foreign policy? Interesting. Russia, China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan seems like it potentially may be because they're compromised. Also, another week, another massive cyberattack from the hostile regime of Vladimir Putin and the hostile actors that are in Russia, making a fool out of sippy cup Joe, and it's about to get much worse. Later, the extremely expensive and exclusive Dalton School in New York City, this private school showing -- well, this cartoon to six-year-old kids in first grade that teaches them how to touch themselves. Viewer warning, this was shown to first graders, six year olds, but probably not appropriate for children. That's my recommendation. Three -- if you don't want them to see it -- one, I would just put it on off but come back in seconds. Here's a preview. Take a look.",

But, first, over the Memorial Day weekend, millions of us, we all honored the heroic service of the brave men and women that died defending our freedoms, our liberties and our country. For many families, it was a somber weekend of remembrance for those loved ones who made the ultimate sacrifice. When we do quietly reflect on the blessings that are liberty that we all kind of usually take for granted if we're honest, so many people made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us. But for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, oh, it's just a nice long weekend. Have a great long weekend. No Joe and no Kamala. On Friday, Biden kicking off the national holiday tweeting a picture of himself with an ice cream cone and a caption that reads: Stay cool this weekend, folks. And not to be outdone is Kamala Harris tweeting a picture of herself smiling from ear to ear enjoy the long weekend with no mention of why we have a long weekend, which would be Memorial Day, whatsoever. That kind of brings back memories of Obama. He didn't know the difference between Veterans Day, Memorial Day. Remember he referred to Navy corpsman, Navy corpsman. He did it three times in one speech and the DNC which tweeted out this celebratory Memorial Day picture of Obama with an ice cream cone in 2015. Well since so many liberals seem to have such a difficult time honoring our fallen heroes or remembering what Memorial Day is all about, maybe they could learn a thing or two from the Indy 500, because here's how they kicked off their Memorial Day race.

Reverence, appreciation, respect, thankfulness. There's a powerful moving tradition from the Indy 500. We give them all the credit in the world. In case you were wondering, Joe eventually honored our fallen soldiers and then celebrated the long weekend by staying cool at a French restaurant in Washington, D.C. called Le Diplomate. And on Friday, Joe also spoke to our military members in a base in Virginia but his prepared remarks went off the rails when Joe made more creepy remarks about a very young girl in the audience. Then, of course, he stammered and stumbled and bumbled like he usually does. But, yeah, this was particularly creepy.",

With China, Russia, Iran all teaming up an unholy alliance against the us and every country besides them in the Middle East, meaning the Iranians, waging war, cyber attacks, proxy wars around the world, members of our military facing serious challenges, woke Kamala seems more interested in solar panels and the fight for social justice. It's not only tone deaf but also kind of scary and chilling. Hostile actors in Russia just pulled off what is a second major cyberattack. First, it was against America's largest oil and gas pipeline system, impacting the entire East Coast of the United States. Biden did nothing. Now, the world's largest meat supplier has been disrupted again, according to reports, by Russian hackers. JBS processes a quarter of America's beef, one-fifth of our country's pork and they operate a couple of dozen chicken processing facilities all across the country. Matter of fact they probably have fed every one of you watching tonight. That's not good and it means that already high meat prices, they're just going to get higher and higher and higher. So, Joe, you're president, what the hell are you going to do to the hold the Russians, this hostile regime, this hostile actor Putin accountable? And sadly, it appears that Joe per usual is going to do nothing? In fact, his one-on-one meeting with Putin, now, it's still on the books for June the 19th. Make no mistake and let me go on record up here and just lay it out. This summit's a bad idea. Putin will be assessing and he's not going to see Joe through the prism of the media mob and big tech. He will be assessing Joe Biden and I'm pretty confident he'll come to the same conclusion that many of you have that Joe is weak, he is frail, a total, complete cognitive mess and a hollow shadow of his former self. And Putin will use that firsthand assessment and walk all over him and the U.S. and he probably will leave laughing at our country and leave embolden, feeling he can get away with anything. For once, I would argue Joe needs to take his little sippy cup, go to the basement, take a nappy. If he's really good, we'll give him a bedtime story. Meanwhile, according to an explosive report from \"The New York Post\", in 2015, the vice president, then Biden, was a regular at this D.C. hot spot where he frequently met with his son's sketchy foreign business partners. That includes oligarchs, other individuals from Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia, which brings us to a couple of serious unanswered questions. Why was the vice president meeting with zero experienced Hunter's sketchy business partners? And why did Joe lie again and again and again and again and say he's never discussed his foreign business dealings with Hunter? Clearly, those foreign nationals were paying for access. Did Joe get a cut? You know, where's the special counsel looking into this corruption? So is the corrupt Biden family syndicate business now impacting America's foreign policy? And is anybody in the media mob will you ever once actually build up a little bit of courage ask Joe the questions that you know you'd be asking every second, every minute, of every hour, of every day if it was Trump? Of course, you'll need to head to Delaware and shout the question from the beach because tomorrow, Joey is taking a sippy cup back to his beach house, marking the 12th trip to Delaware in four months. Now, keep in mind, he only starts his day at 9:30, starts getting ready for biddy bye at 7:00. He's never seen the show that I know of as president. Zero experience Hunter is now under a criminal investigation but he's a liberal, he'll probably get away with it. Only conservatives get life in jail for jaywalking. Of course, Hunter's charges, international money laundering, tax fraud. But outside \"The New York Post\", FOX, a couple of other outlets Biden is protected by the Democrats the media mob and of course big tech people that pretend to be journalists. Here with reaction from the Trump Organization, Eric Trump. Imagine if it was your father. We already know the answer, Eric. And this is a problem I have -- I could no longer say honestly to the American people that I believe we have equal justice under the law. I cannot say because I don't believe it that we have equal application of our laws, because if we did, quid pro quo Joe would be held responsible for firing the prosecutor investigating his zero experienced son being paid millions, and all of these other instances now where he's been caught red- handed lying about knowing anything about Hunter's foreign business dealings.",

But yet every single day, my family is attacked and they look for any comma that's out of place and the prosecutorial misconduct in this country is out of control. But yet, because we're Republicans, they attack us and they do absolutely nothing to the other side. And we've talked about this a thousand times. I mean, Hunter Biden gained three and a half million dollars from the -- you know, Moscow mayor's wife. Could you imagine if I took three cents from Russia, right? I mean, you'd have another Russian collusion hoax. I mean, why didn't he get charged with that? Could you imagine if I threw away a loaded firearm in a dumpster outside a grocery store? Could you imagine if I smoke crack? Could you imagine if I did 1/100th of what this kid does?

Well, let me ask you another thing, why is no one asking the question that once Joe Biden was out of office, once he was no longer vice president U.S., why did Hunter Biden's salary get cut in half? So, January of 2017, Hunter Biden's salary got cut in half, right? Immediately when Joe Biden was out of power, they cut his salary in half. I mean, what do you think that they were paying for? And again, no one's investigating him. The media carries their water. The guy -- I mean, your opening monologue was genius. I mean, it was -- it's unbelievable. You're right. Putin is literally licking his chops right now knowing that he's going to be meeting this guy. He's going to be sizing him up. He's looking at the weakness in this country in terms of fuel prices going, you know, sky high, lumber prices going sky high, food prices, everything. He's looking at inflation. He's looking at you know how effective, you know, they've been in terms of hacking pipelines and meat processing plants and every single -- you know, everything else. They're looking at the Middle East, Sean, and, you know, the mess in the Middle East because of the lack of U.S. leadership right now. You never had any of these problems under Donald Trump. You had the exact opposite. And, you know, you better believe that Putin is licking his lips and a lot of other adversaries around the world are doing the same thing, because they're seeing a weak leader and it's -- it's very, very scary.

Eric Trump, thank you, sir. Thanks for being with us. Now, we turn to a disturbing story out of South Carolina. Look at this, over the weekend, apparent far left anarchist vandalizing the home of Congresswoman Nancy Mace. They graffitied her property with personal attacks, profane language and anarchist symbols with two young kids at home. These images are extremely chilling. The congresswoman will join us in a moment, along with Sean Parnell. He's now running for Senate in Pennsylvania. Now, I do wonder the stories out there about what fake Jake Tapper over at fake news CNN thinks about this. Remember, Tapper, now he likes to claim that he's a fair and balanced and objective journalist. Well, apparently, he begged Parnell not to run against Conor Lamb and in the House in a series of private messages on Twitter. Now, I think private messages should be private but I guess they're not. Let me be clear, if fake Jake wasn't a liar and didn't claim to be something he's not, a journalist, it wouldn't be a big deal. Now, I'm a case in point. I am a member of the media. That's right, a member of the press. I am a talk show host. We have thousands of hours of straight news I can produce on radio and TV, thousands of hours of investigative reporting that we've done, thousands and thousands of hours of opinion that I give, and thousands of times where I state up front, completely honest, I'm a conservative. And we do sports and culture. I'm like the entire newspaper. You see fake Jake claims to be something that he's not. He claims to be a journalist. No, he's not. He's a political activist or maybe he's a talk show host wannabe who just really needs to be honest with his viewers and say, I have opinions, these are my opinions -- you know, like most people in the news media claim to be objective journalists and they're full of, you-know-what, Adam Schiff. Here with more two veterans, South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace, Pennsylvania senatorial candidate Sean Parnell. Nancy, first, I'm sorry what happened to you. Nancy, I'm sorry what happened to you and your family and, you know, tell us about what happened. How scary is it? I've been in the immediate 33 years. I've lived through a lot myself.

They don't care about the truth. Look at every single major story that came out last year, impeachment one, hoax. Impeachment two, based on a lie. Our troops are losers and suckers, lie, right? The Russian bounty stories, lie. President Trump said that we'd have a vaccine for coronavirus in a year, the media said that he was a conspiracy theorist and liar that was based on no evidence. That was untrue. And I think the most egregious example of this, Sean, is that last year, President Trump said that there was a really great possibility that the coronavirus came from Wuhan, a lab in Wuhan. The media for a year called him a conspiracy theorist. And ultimately, that cost American lives. Imagine where this country would be if we were investigating the origins of COVID over a year ago and -- over a year ago? And the only reason why the media did this is not because they have a commitment to the truth. It was because they did not want President Trump to get reelected. And if you think it stops there, it doesn't. Big tech is just as bad. They are the enforcement arm of the Democrat Party. They are the enforcement arm of the media. If you step out of line, if you think critically, if you question the narrative, they call you a conspiracy theorist and they censor you. Sean, they're doing it to me. Have your viewers Google Sean Parnell U.S. Senate Pennsylvania, you won't find my website there, which makes it hard for me to raise money. And so, clearly, the Democrats and big tech and the media have their finger on the scale here and are wading things toward the Democrats, and it's a problem.

Oh, maybe it is possible. Of course, we've documented right here on this program, he's flip-flopped on everything from masks can't fix anything, they won't do anything, to one masks, to two masks, to mask once a season.

No word on whether it will address all the controversy surrounding gain of function research and now, Fauci still refuses to give a straight answer on that.

Now, normally, left-wing lies don't really matter a whole lot but this one does, because bad guys know the police are pulling back because the police are fearful of being called racist and good black guys are being taught to be afraid of officers and therefore don't cooperate and as a result a an ordinary encounter ends up becoming something a lot more serious because a young black man has been taught that the guy pulling him over is an enemy, is a villain and wants to kill you.

      "utterance": "And welcome to HANNITY this Tuesday night. Tonight, we begin with a bombshell report in \"The New York Post\". It reveals Joe Biden did, in fact, meet with zero experience Hunter's business associates, foreign associates from Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, all while Joe was vice president. This in spite of the numerous claims by Joe himself that he never, ever, talked to zero experienced Hunter about his overseas business dealings. Why did you lie, Joe? We need to know the truth? What's going on? And, Joey, if your last name was Trump, well, you know what that would mean. You'd be impeached and probably indicted. There'd be a grand jury summoned immediately. By the way, if you even know what that means anymore. We're going to unpeel the layers of this report coming up. We'll ask an important question. Is the corrupt Biden family syndicate now impacting U.S. foreign policy? Interesting. Russia, China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan seems like it potentially may be because they're compromised. Also, another week, another massive cyberattack from the hostile regime of Vladimir Putin and the hostile actors that are in Russia, making a fool out of sippy cup Joe, and it's about to get much worse. Later, the extremely expensive and exclusive Dalton School in New York City, this private school showing -- well, this cartoon to six-year-old kids in first grade that teaches them how to touch themselves. Viewer warning, this was shown to first graders, six year olds, but probably not appropriate for children. That's my recommendation. Three -- if you don't want them to see it -- one, I would just put it on off but come back in seconds. Here's a preview. Take a look."

But, first, over the Memorial Day weekend, millions of us, we all honored the heroic service of the brave men and women that died defending our freedoms, our liberties and our country. For many families, it was a somber weekend of remembrance for those loved ones who made the ultimate sacrifice. When we do quietly reflect on the blessings that are liberty that we all kind of usually take for granted if we're honest, so many people made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us. But for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, oh, it's just a nice long weekend. Have a great long weekend. No Joe and no Kamala."

      "utterance": "Stay cool this weekend, folks. And not to be outdone is Kamala Harris tweeting a picture of herself smiling from ear to ear enjoy the long weekend with no mention of why we have a long weekend, which would be Memorial Day, whatsoever. That kind of brings back memories of Obama. He didn't know the difference between Veterans Day, Memorial Day. Remember he referred to Navy corpsman, Navy corpsman. He did it three times in one speech and the DNC which tweeted out this celebratory Memorial Day picture of Obama with an ice cream cone in 2015. Well since so many liberals seem to have such a difficult time honoring our fallen heroes or remembering what Memorial Day is all about, maybe they could learn a thing or two from the Indy 500, because here's how they kicked off their Memorial Day race. Take a look."

Reverence, appreciation, respect, thankfulness. There's a powerful moving tradition from the Indy 500. We give them all the credit in the world. In case you were wondering, Joe eventually honored our fallen soldiers and then celebrated the long weekend by staying cool at a French restaurant in Washington, D.C. called Le Diplomate. And on Friday, Joe also spoke to our military members in a base in Virginia but his prepared remarks went off the rails when Joe made more creepy remarks about a very young girl in the audience. Then, of course, he stammered and stumbled and bumbled like he usually does. But, yeah, this was particularly creepy."

With China, Russia, Iran all teaming up an unholy alliance against the us and every country besides them in the Middle East, meaning the Iranians, waging war, cyber attacks, proxy wars around the world, members of our military facing serious challenges, woke Kamala seems more interested in solar panels and the fight for social justice. It's not only tone deaf but also kind of scary and chilling. Hostile actors in Russia just pulled off what is a second major cyberattack. First, it was against America's largest oil and gas pipeline system, impacting the entire East Coast of the United States. Biden did nothing. Now, the world's largest meat supplier has been disrupted again, according to reports, by Russian hackers. JBS processes a quarter of America's beef, one-fifth of our country's pork and they operate a couple of dozen chicken processing facilities all across the country. Matter of fact they probably have fed every one of you watching tonight. That's not good and it means that already high meat prices, they're just going to get higher and higher and higher. So, Joe, you're president, what the hell are you going to do to the hold the Russians, this hostile regime, this hostile actor Putin accountable? And sadly, it appears that Joe per usual is going to do nothing? In fact, his one-on-one meeting with Putin, now, it's still on the books for June the 19th. Make no mistake and let me go on record up here and just lay it out. This summit's a bad idea. Putin will be assessing and he's not going to see Joe through the prism of the media mob and big tech. He will be assessing Joe Biden and I'm pretty confident he'll come to the same conclusion that many of you have that Joe is weak, he is frail, a total, complete cognitive mess and a hollow shadow of his former self. And Putin will use that firsthand assessment and walk all over him and the U.S. and he probably will leave laughing at our country and leave embolden, feeling he can get away with anything. For once, I would argue Joe needs to take his little sippy cup, go to the basement, take a nappy. If he's really good, we'll give him a bedtime story. Meanwhile, according to an explosive report from \"The New York Post\", in 2015, the vice president, then Biden, was a regular at this D.C. hot spot where he frequently met with his son's sketchy foreign business partners. That includes oligarchs, other individuals from Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia, which brings us to a couple of serious unanswered questions. Why was the vice president meeting with zero experienced Hunter's sketchy business partners? And why did Joe lie again and again and again and again and say he's never discussed his foreign business dealings with Hunter? Clearly, those foreign nationals were paying for access. Did Joe get a cut? You know, where's the special counsel looking into this corruption? So is the corrupt Biden family syndicate business now impacting America's foreign policy? And is anybody in the media mob will you ever once actually build up a little bit of courage ask Joe the questions that you know you'd be asking every second, every minute, of every hour, of every day if it was Trump? Of course, you'll need to head to Delaware and shout the question from the beach because tomorrow, Joey is taking a sippy cup back to his beach house, marking the 12th trip to Delaware in four months. Now, keep in mind, he only starts his day at 9:30, starts getting ready for biddy bye at 7:00. He's never seen the show that I know of as president. Zero experience Hunter is now under a criminal investigation but he's a liberal, he'll probably get away with it. Only conservatives get life in jail for jaywalking. Of course, Hunter's charges, international money laundering, tax fraud. But outside \"The New York Post\", FOX, a couple of other outlets Biden is protected by the Democrats the media mob and of course big tech people that pretend to be journalists. Here with reaction from the Trump Organization, Eric Trump. Imagine if it was your father. We already know the answer, Eric. And this is a problem I have -- I could no longer say honestly to the American people that I believe we have equal justice under the law. I cannot say because I don't believe it that we have equal application of our laws, because if we did, quid pro quo Joe would be held responsible for firing the prosecutor investigating his zero experienced son being paid millions, and all of these other instances now where he's been caught red- handed lying about knowing anything about Hunter's foreign business dealings."

We're doing absolutely nothing wrong. We gave up business when my father went to the White House. They did the exact opposite. When Joe Biden became vice president, Hunter Biden got into business. But yet every single day, my family is attacked and they look for any comma that's out of place and the prosecutorial misconduct in this country is out of control. But yet, because we're Republicans, they attack us and they do absolutely nothing to the other side. And we've talked about this a thousand times. I mean, Hunter Biden gained three and a half million dollars from the -- you know, Moscow mayor's wife. Could you imagine if I took three cents from Russia, right? I mean, you'd have another Russian collusion hoax. I mean, why didn't he get charged with that? Could you imagine if I threw away a loaded firearm in a dumpster outside a grocery store? Could you imagine if I smoke crack? Could you imagine if I did 1/100th of what this kid does?

So, January of 2017, Hunter Biden's salary got cut in half, right? Immediately when Joe Biden was out of power, they cut his salary in half. I mean, what do you think that they were paying for? And again, no one's investigating him. The media carries their water. The guy -- I mean, your opening monologue was genius. I mean, it was -- it's unbelievable. You're right. Putin is literally licking his chops right now knowing that he's going to be meeting this guy. He's going to be sizing him up. He's looking at the weakness in this country in terms of fuel prices going, you know, sky high, lumber prices going sky high, food prices, everything. He's looking at inflation. He's looking at you know how effective, you know, they've been in terms of hacking pipelines and meat processing plants and every single -- you know, everything else. They're looking at the Middle East, Sean, and, you know, the mess in the Middle East because of the lack of U.S. leadership right now. You never had any of these problems under Donald Trump. You had the exact opposite. And, you know, you better believe that Putin is licking his lips and a lot of other adversaries around the world are doing the same thing, because they're seeing a weak leader and it's -- it's very, very scary. Very scary."

Eric Trump, thank you, sir. Thanks for being with us. Now, we turn to a disturbing story out of South Carolina. Look at this, over the weekend, apparent far left anarchist vandalizing the home of Congresswoman Nancy Mace. They graffitied her property with personal attacks, profane language and anarchist symbols with two young kids at home. These images are extremely chilling. The congresswoman will join us in a moment, along with Sean Parnell. He's now running for Senate in Pennsylvania. Now, I do wonder the stories out there about what fake Jake Tapper over at fake news CNN thinks about this. Remember, Tapper, now he likes to claim that he's a fair and balanced and objective journalist. Well, apparently, he begged Parnell not to run against Conor Lamb and in the House in a series of private messages on Twitter. Now, I think private messages should be private but I guess they're not. Let me be clear, if fake Jake wasn't a liar and didn't claim to be something he's not, a journalist, it wouldn't be a big deal. Now, I'm a case in point. I am a member of the media. That's right, a member of the press. I am a talk show host. We have thousands of hours of straight news I can produce on radio and TV, thousands of hours of investigative reporting that we've done, thousands and thousands of hours of opinion that I give, and thousands of times where I state up front, completely honest, I'm a conservative. And we do sports and culture. I'm like the entire newspaper. You see fake Jake claims to be something that he's not. He claims to be a journalist. No, he's not. He's a political activist or maybe he's a talk show host wannabe who just really needs to be honest with his viewers and say, I have opinions, these are my opinions -- you know, like most people in the news media claim to be objective journalists and they're full of, you-know-what, Adam Schiff. Here with more two veterans, South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace, Pennsylvania senatorial candidate Sean Parnell. Nancy, first, I'm sorry what happened to you. Nancy, I'm sorry what happened to you and your family and, you know, tell us about what happened. How scary is it? I've been in the immediate 33 years. I've lived through a lot myself. It's not fun."

I'm a single mom and I have two kids and I'm sad for my kids because they had -- they had to see this. And I'm sad for my neighbors. They didn't ask for this to happen. But this is a left coming after the right, coming after us conservatives. And earlier today, I'm conservative, first thing I did was talk to local law enforcement, got them to my house. And there was a former Obama staffer, you know, forging conspiracy theories on social media today saying I didn't even file a police report. What do you think I did, Sean? The very first thing I did was file a police report. And so, if your viewers want to see that police report, they want to see the photos, the photographic evidence and videos that I took when this happened, then go online to my website at nancymace.org.

      "utterance": "Yes. Yes, correct, correct. But, Sean, I think that this speaks to a much larger issue in our national discourse. Many in the media today, they're not fair and balanced. They don't care about the truth. Look at every single major story that came out last year, impeachment one, hoax. Impeachment two, based on a lie. Our troops are losers and suckers, lie, right? The Russian bounty stories, lie. President Trump said that we'd have a vaccine for coronavirus in a year, the media said that he was a conspiracy theorist and liar that was based on no evidence. That was untrue. And I think the most egregious example of this, Sean, is that last year, President Trump said that there was a really great possibility that the coronavirus came from Wuhan, a lab in Wuhan. The media for a year called him a conspiracy theorist. And ultimately, that cost American lives. Imagine where this country would be if we were investigating the origins of COVID over a year ago and -- over a year ago? And the only reason why the media did this is not because they have a commitment to the truth. It was because they did not want President Trump to get reelected. And if you think it stops there, it doesn't. Big tech is just as bad. They are the enforcement arm of the Democrat Party. They are the enforcement arm of the media. If you step out of line, if you think critically, if you question the narrative, they call you a conspiracy theorist and they censor you. Sean, they're doing it to me. Have your viewers Google Sean Parnell U.S. Senate Pennsylvania, you won't find my website there, which makes it hard for me to raise money. And so, clearly, the Democrats and big tech and the media have their finger on the scale here and are wading things toward the Democrats, and it's a problem. And ultimately, Sean, the American people are the ones that lose."

This is not the first time that I've been attacked with vandalism. They -- they keyed my car last year when I was campaigning for Congress on the day of one of my debates. And now, they're on my front doorstep. But I want to say one thing, if the folks that did this, the person or persons that came onto my front doorstep that did this, thinks that I'm going to be intimidated -- well, they thought wrong.

That's pretty -- you really can't get worse than that but a lot of New York public schools are that bad. So the competition for parents to start, they have to set up interviews and testing for kids to get into kindergarten so they can get into the right kindergarten which will set them up to get into the right grammar school and high schools, and then they will have a decent shot at an education and a chance at a decent college. But now, so the parents are like -- one parent in one story at \"The New York Post\" said, well, if I speak up, I know I'm going to get canceled, and there's 15,000 other parents who has a kid that they want to take that spot. So the parents are cornered here. It's their values or the highway pretty much."

They may think they are, but their kids will be better off in virtually any school in America than for them to shell out that kind of money, 55 grand a year, to have every value that they hold dear undermined rather than undergirded. That's not an education. That's an indoctrination. Parents need to wake up and quit surrendering their children and turning them over to some outfit that will absolutely destroy their very children's future. This isn't a hard decision. Parent need to act like parents and start speaking up, standing up, and get their kids out of places like that, and put them into a decent school and we demand every place in the country give parents a choice for their kids' education."

Oh, maybe it is possible. Of course, we've documented right here on this program, he's flip-flopped on everything from masks can't fix anything, they won't do anything, to one masks, to two masks, to mask once a season. He flip-flopped on ventilators, schools and reopenings and the risk of outdoor transmission to the threshold needed for herd immunity and so on and so forth. And then, of course, the issue of the gain of, yeah, gain of function research being done at the Wuhan lab at the NIH, apparently, partly funded. Now, the book's reportedly only 80 pages long. No word on whether it will address all the controversy surrounding gain of function research and now, Fauci still refuses to give a straight answer on that. But back in 2012, Fauci claimed the benefits of this controversial gain of function research outweighed any risk of a pandemic. Dr. Fauci, you still believed that? And one of the senators who has been forcing Fauci to actually answer the tough questions, he's from the great state of Louisiana, Senator John Kennedy. And, by the way, Senator, I strongly -- unless you ask me not to -- strongly support your re-election. You have done a phenomenal job as a senator from the great state of Louisiana and you become a true leader in the Senate and I have a great admiration for you, sir."

The evidence has finally caught up with the Chinese communist party with Dr. Fauci and with the other permanent Washington types who for over a year have said that the idea that the coronavirus came from a China lab leak was a conspiracy theory and that anybody believed that was circus freak crazy. Well, it wasn't a conspiracy theory and people aren't circus freak crazy. It was a reasonable question to ask from day one, suspicious facts have existed from day one if people cared to look pointing to that possibility. The Chinese communist party and Dr. Fauci -- and I'm going to be blunt here -- have said for over a year, look, nothing to see here. The coronavirus came from an animal. Except after a year, no one's been able to prove that. And as \"The Economist\" magazine put it this week, no one has found anything close to a smoking bat. Not to put too fine a point on it, but a year ago this month, in May of 2020, my friend Dr. Fauci gave a number of interviews and in them he dismissed the lab leak theory. Now, I want to be fair to him. I know the press was all over him and he did it under pressure from the press, but Dr. Fauci should have told the press to stick it up their fact checker that I'm going to follow the science and he didn't. And we've lost a year here. And I don't know if we'll ever find the origin of the virus now. It's not a question, Sean, of keeping score, who was right or nah, nah, nah, you were wrong, we need to know this, so that we can keep it from happening again. And I don't know now if we'll ever find out, and that's a -- that's a bloody shame."

In gain of function research, a scientist in a lab takes a harmless, benign pathogen and turns it into a deadly contagious virus to learn from it. And this is happening all over the world and labs leak, and we didn't know about it.

The officer, who is Asian, suffered a bloody nose and minor injuries during the attack. But police have yet to say whether it will be investigated as a hate crime. We've now been watching an alarming increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans and what's a dramatic screens in virulent anti-Semitism in the U.S. and worldwide. Of course, it's just the latest act of violence under the California city's failed far left leadership. In New York City, yet another shocking crime caught on tape. Look at this.

NYPD's police commissioner says the state's far left socialist no bail laws that let criminals roam the streets, well, that's partly to blame. I would add that the billion dollars in cuts to the NYPD are to blame. Ask yourself, where are you Democrats, media, mob, where are all these activists groups? BLM? They claim to care about the most vulnerable. Where are the protests for the victims of these anti-American Asian hate crimes? You know, the victims here? How come -- how come there is no-bail law? How is that working out? How is this billion dollar cut to the NYPD working out?

A dirty little secret, of course, is that the majority of these perpetrators against these Asian Americans are people of color, and that is one of the reasons why the media has been downplaying all of this. But regarding the gentleman who has had an epiphany about Black Lives Matter, he ought to have an epiphany about the premise behind Black Lives Matter which is bonus. And the premise is that the police are out killing blacks just because they're black. There's been ample studies showing the reverse that the police if anything are more hesitant more reluctant to pull the trigger on a black suspect than a white suspect. Now, normally, left-wing lies don't really matter a whole lot but this one does, because bad guys know the police are pulling back because the police are fearful of being called racist and good black guys are being taught to be afraid of officers and therefore don't cooperate and as a result a an ordinary encounter ends up becoming something a lot more serious because a young black man has been taught that the guy pulling him over is an enemy, is a villain and wants to kill you. That's what's going on here."
