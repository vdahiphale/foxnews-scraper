I overcame those challenges with grit, hard work, and inspiration. And so, the truth is, the left today, they seem to be working on a blueprint on how to ruin America. If you wanted to ruin America, you would print and spend trillions of dollars leading to the highest inflation we've seen in 40 years. Why is that negative to point out the fact that under Joe Biden's leadership, we've had the highest inflation in 40 years? Why is it negative to point out that we've had four and a half million people across our southern border illegally? Why is it negative to point out the fact that we've had 100,000 deaths to overdoses linked to fentanyl thousands upon thousands of those deaths?

And we've lowered their taxes for a single mom by 70 percent. We promised to put more than $4,000 back in the average family's pocket, we ended up around $4,400. We were able to lower unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians to the lowest level in the history of the country and the lowest level since World War II for women. We actually saw more money come to the Treasury with lower taxes than anyone imagined and at the exact same time, wages grew at the bottom faster than at the top. I created opportunity zones, my signature legislation, that has seen more than $50 billion attack poverty in the hardest hit areas of the country. At the same time I focused on education, I started the School Choice Caucus. We led to the highest level of funding for HBCUs In the history of the country and then we made it permanent. I led on the vast majority of those pieces of legislation, I've worked on police reform where we want to make sure that the best wore the badge, that the officers have the best resources, the best training, and we never questioned their qualified immunity.

So, it was a political stunt, but I think the administration knows that it can't allow itself to be seen as absent. And so ramping up that response, showing themselves on the ground more.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "There's no doubt, Shannon, that when you look at that poll, that's one of the reasons why I think it's really important for us to come forward and have an authentic and sincere conversation about the goodness of America. In today's society, the progressive left is trying to make America into grievance culture when in fact we've always stood on the foundation of greatness. Our original sin should never define us because the story of redemption is what we've been living through more than 50-plus years. The greatest story of progress in the world is American progress in the last 50 years. I wish we'd spend more time talking about the goodness of this nation and stop the cancel culture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. Let's talk about this positive message in talking about things like cancel culture. Will it work? \"The New York Times\" says this about your assets being optimistic and possibly history-making as the nominee. Both of those assets could prove to be a liability in today's Republican primary environment where voters rail against what they see is unfair favoritism toward people of color and where activists may be more interested in anger than optimism. Everybody says they hate negative ads. They don't like the political sniping. But the numbers show us they actually worked. So, will this optimistic message work?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, I think it's always worked. I mean, America is a country founded on the concept of hope. Think about it this way -- a world without America is a very dark place. America without faith is a nation without hope. So we definitely have to continue to work on the foundation that we have stood upon for the last 250-plus years. But in addition to that, we have to be able to contrast between why we are a great country and why the left wants us to talk about the grievance. The fact is that the left is trying to sell a drug of victimhood and a narcotic of despair. The truth is we have so much to celebrate and yet today, in many parts of the country, you feel like you're in quicksand. We should not allow the zip code of a child to determine the quality of their life because education is the most powerful tool to equalize opportunity in this nation. But there are poor zip codes where that's not possible. We have to do something about that as one American family and, frankly, governors like Kim Reynolds and others are starting to take that responsibility, and prove that we as the GOP, the great opportunity party, we love America, we love our kids, and frankly, we are the best hope for a united future."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "-- trip to Iowa. So, not everybody thought your message was uplifting, including this one reporter from \"The New York Magazine's\" \"Intelligencer\". He says this: It's hard to recall a more stridently asserted expression of belief that the route to national peace and unity requires the subjugation of one party by the other, the Scott speech was a relentlessly partisan screed accusing Joe Biden and the left of pursuing a blueprint for ruining America. So, how does that square with the message of us having faith in each other as Americans?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, Shannon, that's a great question. And once again, it goes back to the contrast that is necessary. I'm a hopeful guy not because I didn't have to overcome problems. I had a miserable beginning, growing up in a single-parent household mired in poverty, the challenges that I face from self-esteem to low grades were monumental. I overcame those challenges with grit, hard work, and inspiration. And so, the truth is, the left today, they seem to be working on a blueprint on how to ruin America. If you wanted to ruin America, you would print and spend trillions of dollars leading to the highest inflation we've seen in 40 years. Why is that negative to point out the fact that under Joe Biden's leadership, we've had the highest inflation in 40 years? Why is it negative to point out that we've had four and a half million people across our southern border illegally? Why is it negative to point out the fact that we've had 100,000 deaths to overdoses linked to fentanyl thousands upon thousands of those deaths? If we don't understand the state of America and the weakness of the progressive movement, then it's impossible for us to offer positive optimistic solutions to the challenges that we face because of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party."

    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "OK, it sounds good. The policy positions that I've taken. One of the most important parts of being in the majority was the opportunity we have with the Tax and Cut and Jobs Act. I had the good fortune to be the lead sponsor of the TCJA on the personal side of the tax code. So I had the opportunity to help write that specific legislation. And we've lowered their taxes for a single mom by 70 percent. We promised to put more than $4,000 back in the average family's pocket, we ended up around $4,400. We were able to lower unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians to the lowest level in the history of the country and the lowest level since World War II for women. We actually saw more money come to the Treasury with lower taxes than anyone imagined and at the exact same time, wages grew at the bottom faster than at the top. I created opportunity zones, my signature legislation, that has seen more than $50 billion attack poverty in the hardest hit areas of the country. At the same time I focused on education, I started the School Choice Caucus. We led to the highest level of funding for HBCUs In the history of the country and then we made it permanent. I led on the vast majority of those pieces of legislation, I've worked on police reform where we want to make sure that the best wore the badge, that the officers have the best resources, the best training, and we never questioned their qualified immunity. We had to stand in the gap when it matters the most -- that means leading from the front and not from the back."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "School choice. Lisa Lightner, a special education advocate, said what you do is end up hurting public schools when you let parents take the money elsewhere. She says the vision is that the same amount of money spread out over more schools, only the best would survive. If a public school has to compete with the charter or private school, it will find a way to become better. But she asked, how can they improve if you take even more money from them? It's just not possible. Your response?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "So, let's look at Success Academy in New York City where you see the populations are about 87 percent minority and yet their schools are the top in the state of New York. What we've seen very consistently, charter schools gets about half the money as public schools, yet there are public charter schools that provide choice for the parents and better quality education. Out of the top 25 percent of high schools in the nation, more than -- about 12 or about half of those are charter schools. So what we're seeing around the country is a success of some form of school choice. And, by the way, I don't care whether it's a public school, a private school, a charter school, a STEM school, a home school, a virtual school, I want every child in every zip code to have quality education. That should improve all aspects of education, not reduce funding."

It says, Scott's message is that racism is not an institutional or systemic problem, but an individual failing. That's precisely what conservatives want to hear so they can say, well, I'm not a racist, which means we don't have to do much of anything about racism."

      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "The only word I can think of is hogwash. The fact of the matter is I was Austin on Friday having a conversation with several hundred GOPers and we talked specifically about how the Jim Crow South impacted my family specifically. My grandfather made the choice to be stubborn in his faith, his faith in the future, faith in himself and faith in this nation. But we had to overcome those challenges. What I don't like is when we hear President Biden talk about Jim Crow 2.0 when my family lived through Jim Crow, and that's when you had to figure out the number of jellybeans in the jar in order to cast a ballot. To suggest that the current Georgia election laws are consistent with Jim Crow is just a lie. And so, what we have to do is make sure that we arm our people today with the challenges of today and not pretend like we're living in 1923 as opposed to 2023."

But we had an opportunity to show unity in support of Ukraine, to make clear that Russia -- this is Russia's war of aggression."

So, China is right in the middle of this whole thing at this point. We've got a brand-new Fox News poll out this morning that shows 68 percent of Americans think China is a major threat to that U.S., add another 26 percent who say there are some threats. That's 94 percent of Americans who really don't trust China. What do you make of their growing role in the middle of this Russian- Ukrainian conflict?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "I'm with the 68 percent. I do think China is a major threat against the United States. Look, they're encouraging this war by working with Russia, now perhaps providing additional weapons for Russia to be able to pursue this war of aggression. This is an attack on the sovereignty of the democratic state. There's no question that Ukraine is the front line, but Russia will not stop there. And China is assisting that, so China is a major threat against the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",

It doesn't sound like they are very afraid of our warnings."

    {
      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "Well, China needs to know there will be consequences. So, we've isolated Russia economically. We can do the same thing in regards to sanctions against China. China needs to understand they need to be on the right side of history here. And an attack on the sovereignty of an independent state, what Russia has done as a war of aggression and China should be with us in the overwhelming majority of the world to speak out. The vote in the United States Security Council -- General Assembly indicated the wide understanding of who is responsible for this war. China sat on the sidelines on that vote. That was wrong. But clearly, they should be on the right side of history."

Secretary Blinken will also visit three countries this week, who did the same thing, they obtained for voting, so what should his message be to them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "You can't sit on the sidelines. You got to pick a side here and the one side is right, one side as wrong. Russia is wrong.

The top four all relate to foreign policy: Russia, Ukraine, the Chinese spy balloon, national security, foreign policy. He is upside down on all of that, and the disapproval outweighing the approval. So Americans think that the president is failing on these foreign-policy fronts and a majority of Democrats who are primary voters when asked about whether they want him to run again, 53 percent say they want to see someone else.

I saw that at this meeting where the U.S. and President Biden were so respected, his visit to Kyiv, his address in Warsaw. It really reunited the free world. And domestically, I think the ability to pass up a major agenda during the first two years shows that he knows how to handle our domestic agenda, rebuild our infrastructure, deal with the CHIPS and Science bill, to take on China as international competitor, to deal with climate change.

They say most inventories will take many years to replace and inventory replenishment will become an increasingly pressing problem. And then the secretary-general of NATO said this on Thursday."

Yes, we need to replenish the equipment and make more sophisticated equipment available. We need to bring this war to an end with Ukraine's victory and that means supplying them with the equipment they need to successfully defend their sovereignty. It's going to be a challenge, make no mistake about it, but we've had coordination on the supply chains and we've been very effective in supplying it.

Right now, 43 percent of Republican primary voters chose Donald Trump as their preferred nominee. That's followed by Ron DeSantis with 28 percent. Nikki Haley and Mike Pence each at 7 percent. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and former Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney each at 2 percent. All others getting 1 percent or less. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, 53 percent of primary voters would like to see someone other than Joe Biden run, but 37 percent say they do want to see the president back on the ticket. Let's run the numbers with our Sunday group. District Media Group President Beverly Hallberg, Axiom Strategies co- founder and CEO Jeff Roe, former DNC communications director Mo Elleithee, and \"Axios\" senior politics reporter Josh Kraushaar.

    {
      "speaker": "ROE",
      "utterance": "Sure. Absolutely. He should get in. He's a great voice for the Republican Party. He's been a great senator. But the reality is, is this is a two-person race between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Nearly 75 percent of the voters have chosen between those two. We've not seen that from a governor or even frankly a senator have that kind of strength this early in a - in a presidential primary. So, the reality is, this will be a very small field. A lot of people were talking about a crazy barroom brawl. I don't think so at all. I think it's going to be a small field because the money's not there, the debate stage rules will keep it very limited. Yet have to have a donor threshold, you have to have national polling, and there's simply no room for a - for a third and fourth or even fifth person in this race."

    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they're running for just the name identity, whether that is for VP or for other purposes as well because think even when Donald Trump ran initially for president, I don't think he thought he was going to get the nomination, but it does great things for people 's businesses, et cetera. But I think what we're going to be looking for is how long people stay in. So, I agree, it's going to be the two-person race between Ron DeSantis and Trump more than likely . But if people are for anybody but Trump on the Republican side, the more crowded the field is, the harder it's going to be for anybody to defeat him in the primary. So, it depends on whether or not certain Republicans are going to coalesce together to try to get people to jump out quicker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, and, Josh, we're talking about Ron DeSantis. The governor's not in the race, yet. JOSH KRAUSHAAR, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": He's not in the race. And, boy, that number for Donald Trump, 43 percent of the Republican vote, it is - it is significant. And you underestimate -- every Republican would underestimate Donald Trump at their own risk. He's had a - quietly had a pretty good political month in terms of doing some of these retail events in South Carolina that he didn't do a whole lot during the 2020 campaign. His trip to East Palestine, Ohio, ahead of Pete Buttigieg, going to McDonald's. He's shown sort of a common touch that he had trouble with, frankly, when he was president and running for re- election. So, these numbers show that Trump is still formidable within the Republican Party. And I agree with Jeff, Ron DeSantis, if he does get in, is going to be the - the other big elephant in the room. But, boy, like Trump, any - you know, you're not hearing a lot of Republicans going after Trump. They're going after DeSantis or trying to figure out where they stand in the party. And I think they do that at there own peril because Trump is still very, very popular within the Republican Party."

And the poll probably shows a good reason why. OK, another poll. We asked people, how much money do you have in your pocket versus last year. Here are the numbers. More, 12 percent. Good for those folks. The same, 31 percent. Less, 57 percent. And that is, I mean, a huge jump from -- if you look back to February 2018, just a couple years ago, under the Trump presidency. Mo, that may be part of the reason why folks say they aren't excited for a President Biden repeat."

But people haven't felt it. And there's a simple rule in political communications, you can't go out there and tell people that they're wrong about how they feel. So, even though he can, and he should, continue to go out there and make the case about why the economy is stronger and how it's getting better, the next part is the most important part, and this is when too many people oftentimes flub in politics, we're getting better, but not enough people are feeling it and here's what we're going to do next. That has to be with this president talks about every single day for the next two years. And I think he's well- positioned to do it. And I think the way this Republican field is shaping up actually gives him even more room to do it because if the Republican field is out there talking about how woke the left is, and the president is out there saying the economy is getting stronger but not enough people are feeling it and here's how we're going to make sure you do, that's a contrast Democrats would really like to have."

The numbers only get worse when you get into opioids, gun, immigration, economy, inflation. Inflation, he's down by, I'm not great at math, but 35 points, I think. So, Beverly, what does he do with that? How does he turn around those perceptions? Like Mo said, perception is reality for a lot of folks when they're trying to pay their bills and put food on the table."

And so he can say all he wants, that things are great, but if people see something different, it's not going to resonate. I think he would do better if he actually talked about the pain people are feeling, acknowledging that, talking about what he is trying to do to lower that. I think that would be a better message for him."

He had a radio interview this week. \"The Hill\" reports on it this way. When pressed further on whether he has definitively ruled out a bid for the presidency, Manchin responded, I don't know. I think right now you don't know who the Democrat nominee or who the Republican nominee is going to be. Manchin responded, that's fair when radio host Hoppy Kercheval said he thinks the senator is still considering running for the presidency. So, Jeff, does he run as a Democrat? Does he run as of third parties spoiler?"

So, I think they're in a pickle here with Biden. They can't get rid of him. They can't let him run. And so if it's anyone besides Trump, it's a real problem because Trump provides the base motivation for Democrats. That's what took us from a historical 125 million votes turnout for a Republican presidential election, to 150 last time. And so I think that's their hope, that they get the rematch that they want and the rest of the country really isn't looking for."

I think he is - he is a walking grenade in any room of politics, right? You never know when he goes off and what it does. But I'll say this, I don't know what happens in 2024 because I think there are a lot of questions out there about what each candidate does. Ron DeSantis looks super strong, but Ron DeSantis has never been tested on the national stage. He could get on a national debate stage - remember, at this point in 2016 -- in 2015, I guess, Jeb Bush looked really strong for Republicans. Eight years before that, Rudy Giuliani looked really strong for Republicans, before they got tested. DeSantis hasn't been tested. If I'm on the Biden campaign, the guy I'm looking at the most closely is a Tim Scott, who has a way to talk about issues different than the rest of them who are all out there trying to be out anti-woke, out to - out anti-woke one another. That's not what's going to resonate in a general election. So, I -- I don't know what happens. I think the president knows what he needs to do.

They say, if Emily Kohrs, who was that foreperson, and Fani Willis, the DA, helped Trump convince Republican primary voters that the Democrats' quite to indict him here, there and everywhere is a politicized abuse of power, his bid for the GOP nomination could get a big boost.

And I think Democrats have put all their chips in this basket that some prosecutor, whether, you know, it's here in D.C., or Fani Willis is Fulton County, is going to have the smoking gun that's going to take Trump out of the political race. And that's just not going to happen. And, look, even if he is indicted, there's some evidence that that - as this - this foreman has said might happen, there's going to be a lot of question for the Trump campaign rightfully is going to raise about credibility and impartiality that could taint the case before it begins.

The president, it seems like he says he doesn't have a plan to go. When he was pressed on whether he'd even talked to the local mayor there, he said, I don't think I have.

Look, people there are unhappy with everybody right now. They're unhappy with the federal government. They're unhappy with the Republican governor. People want to see more reaction. I don't think Donald Trump going to hand out water and cleaning supplies is really going to turn people one way or another. It actually reminds me very much of his response to the hurricane in Puerto Rico when he was president and he went and he tossed out water bottles and paper towels. And, you know what, all these years later, Puerto Rico is still dealing with the ramifications of that. So, it was a political stunt, but I think the administration knows that it can't allow itself to be seen as absent. And so ramping up that response, showing themselves on the ground more. When Trump shows up making the point that, you know, this happened in part because of the deregulations that he put in place as president, but focusing on the cleanup as quickly as possible."

      "utterance": "Our department got a phone call. The woman at the door said, hey, there's a TV station on the phone. Would anybody be interested in drawing in a courtroom? And I jumped at it. And much to my surprise, it's been over 40 years."

      "speaker": "HENNESSY",
      "utterance": "It was crazy. The whole concept of it was basically, you know, so like imagine, just wherever you are, walking into a room full of, you know, 50 people and say, quick, we need a drawing of this. And I was like, I'm -- what do I draw here? I really had to think like a journalist. Well, I finally got a grasp on it and said, OK, I can -- I can do this."

      "speaker": "HENNESSY",
      "utterance": "The first impeachment, that really struck me because I had this sort of front row seat in the press gallery looking down on all that. I remember being just overwhelmed by that. And I remember this from government class, this never happens. It's so rare. There have been three now."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNESSY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. That is - that weighs heavily. When it's someone they know, they are looking to make sure you get it accurately. But, at the end of the day, you got to finish, you're done, it airs and that's the beset you could do and you move on to the next case."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNESSY",

      "speaker": "HENNESSY",
      "utterance": "I heard a commotion from the floor above and this shirtless guy comes flying down the escalator. I mean he's like going eight, 10 steps at a time, and he was moving. And he was being pursued by like four court marshals. It was crazy. The amazing thing about that is, if you look at that sketch, at the bottom there's a woman standing at the bottom of the escalator. She put her foot out and tripped him."

    },

      "speaker": "HENNESSY",
      "utterance": "Right. Right. I mean that's what's kind of cool about it, but also what's kind of crazy about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, you're in institution. You walk into these courtroom and people know Bill Hennessy is here. This is a trial of import and he's going to make sure that the public gets to see what's happening in here."

      "speaker": "HENNESSY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM (on camera)",
      "utterance": "And that case at the top there was a really big moment in history. That's the Dobbs case that ended up overturning Roe v. Wade."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNESSY",
      "utterance": "That's right. That's right. That was Dobbs. And, actually, there's a reporter in there you might recognize."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNESSY",
      "utterance": "It has changed. Now, 24-hour news, they want it immediately, as fast - almost as soon as the - the gavel strikes, court's adjourned, it's like, how soon can you have that? My method of working lends itself to this, because I draw fast and I like that kind of energy. Now it's - it's more demanding than ever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM (on camera)",
      "utterance": "Do you ever think about the legacy and these moments in time that you've captured? No camera could ever be there, but your artwork is going to be what we have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNESSY",
      "utterance": "I haven't really dwelled too much on that. Yes, that is pretty special in - in that regard. I'm going to let my kids figure out what the heck to do with all this - all those historical images."
