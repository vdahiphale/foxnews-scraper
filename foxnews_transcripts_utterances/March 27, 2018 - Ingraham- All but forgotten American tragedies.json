The Trump administration is causing Democrats to lose their minds again. Announcing it plans to ask, a citizenship question on the 2020 census, how dare they? Plus, a beloved figure on the left is revealing what we already know and what we know liberals think deep down about guns and the Second Amendment. And the \"political-correctness mob\" puts one of America's most important historical figures at the top of its target list. But first, the all but forgotten American tragedies, that is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" When Donald Trump announced his candidacy, the media reacted with horror to this statement. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Maybe he should have singled out Mexico, people are coming from a lot of places doing us harm. I'll tell you tonight there is continuous and sad evidence to substantiate his claims of the underlying crimes. Every day in this country there are fresh American tragedies to report on. American citizens brutalized, abused, murdered by illegal aliens. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yet most of these stories are buried at the back of the local metro sections in your local papers, and most of them are never heard national news broadcasts. The media are too busy doing, what? Capturing every utterance of a few specific porn stars. So, tonight, we are going to report on a handful of these American tragedies. In San Diego, a Mexican illegal alien, Constantino Banda Acosta, after a night of drinking, was charged with running a stop sign and slamming into a family's vehicle. A little boy in the backseat of the vehicle suffered serious head trauma and now has cognitive issues. He fled the scene. In addition to being an illegal alien, Acosta had been deported 17 times, yes, at 17. Last week a judge declared a mistrial in his case because they couldn't establish if it was he or the illegal alien in the car with him, who is actually behind the wheel at the time of the crash. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Thankfully, he was turned over to federal custody following the trial, but given California's sanctuary state laws, I expect he will find his way back into the golden state. And then this, in Fairhope, Alabama, on Sunday, a twice-deported alien, Jose Luis Alonzo De Leon, is accused of crashing his truck into a local woman who was on her bike and killed her. He was also drunk. He too fled the scene of the crash. Authorities later found him in possession of a stolen gun and believed he has used seven aliases in the past, they are now investigating his criminal history. A law enforcement official and the sister of the victim will join us in just a few moments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And last Friday in the suburbs of New Orleans, at 2:00 in the afternoon, this charmer sauntered into a Walmart. His name is Billy Yo (inaudible) Herrera. He allegedly approached a mother and her 2-year-old child with a machete. He told the mother if she didn't listen to his instructions, she and her child would die. He then tried to kidnap the infant. The mother resisted and hid with her baby behind the deli counter. He then ran off and attempted to abduct another child from a shopping cart. Walmart employees and an off-duty officer ended up tackling him. He is charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault, and an immigration detainer has been placed on him. Look, I don't even have time to report on the other crimes that have percolated out there just in the last few days. Salvadorian illegal immigrant, a traveling pastor, no less, charged just last week with enticing a 14-year-old girl in Virginia to record a sexually explicit of herself. Investigators believe this freak may have victimized many others or the Guatemalan, twice deported illegal, who allegedly raped a teenage girl. He posted bail in February and escaped before ICE could detain him, or the illegal in Dallas, who is charge with smothering a senior citizen and may be, according to authorities, a serial killer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This only scratches the surface of crimes committed on a daily basis by those who should have never been in this country in the first place. Every life lost, every child harmed, every woman abused are victims of not only the criminals who committed those crimes but also of the government that allowed criminals to enter this country in the first place. And, frankly, I'm sick of this argument. I don't really care what percentage of illegals in the United States commit crimes and what percentage doesn't. Even one American life lost at the hands of an illegal is too much. It is unacceptable. And contrary to what the media tell us, those who have flouted our laws and the families they've drag with them are criminals. The people who cross this country's border are criminals. They are not victims. Our policymakers, they are supposed to represent us, and address our needs, not cater to those of illegal immigrants. Donald Trump understands this, and he is right to step up enforcement across the board. The American workers, American taxpayers, I think are really tired of feeling like second-class citizens in their own country, like they are the interlopers as illegal immigrants to legally demand rights and legal benefits. That dynamic is starting to change because of President Trump. We Americans and all you hardworking illegal immigrants out there must demand that lawmakers stop protecting the lawbreakers and start protecting us, and that's the ANGLE. Joining me now for reaction is Lieutenant Brian McGregor with the Kenner Louisiana Police Department. He is investigating the attempted kidnapping incident involving an illegal alien with a machete at that Walmart that we just told you about. And in Alabama, Sandy Best, the sister of Amy Hawkins, who we just told it was allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant, Jose Luis Alonso-De Leon, as she was cycling. And Baldwin County Alabama D.A., Robert Wilters, who is prosecuting Ms. Hawkins' alleged killer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's start with you, Mr. Wilters, this broke my heart today to hear this story coming out of Alabama. I actually learned about it because one of my radio listeners called in to my show and said a colleague of his is the actual husband of the victim in this case, and that he was distraught and devastated. I looked it up and indeed this happened. Tell us about this case and any more details that you have discovered. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } ROBERT WILTERS, D.A. BALDWIN COUNTY, Ala.: Laura, thank you for having us on tonight, and as for you and your listeners, please pray for Amy Hawkins' family as they go through this tragic time. It seems that on Sunday at about 12:25 p.m., Amy Hawkins was riding her bicycle on one of our roads on the eastern shore near Fairhope and Daphne. And she was northbound, and the defendant in the case, Jose Luis Alonso-De Leon, was heading southbound. He swerved around the car to pass and struck Ms. Hawkins, who is riding a bicycle. He did not stop, and continued on, and was found a couple of miles away several minutes later. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He was highly intoxicated at that time when he was arrested by law enforcement. They also found a stolen pistol in the vehicle. We then have learned, through checking, that he has at least seven aliases and, according to ICE, immigration enforcement, he was deported twice during 2014. It is a tragedy that--",

      "utterance": "Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We have a lineup tonight that you do not want to miss. The Trump administration is causing Democrats to lose their minds again. Announcing it plans to ask, a citizenship question on the 2020 census, how dare they? Plus, a beloved figure on the left is revealing what we already know and what we know liberals think deep down about guns and the Second Amendment. And the \"political-correctness mob\" puts one of America's most important historical figures at the top of its target list. But first, the all but forgotten American tragedies, that is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" When Donald Trump announced his candidacy, the media reacted with horror to this statement."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "While many, some, at least, quibbled with the formulation the president made there. They knew what he basically meant. Maybe he should have singled out Mexico, people are coming from a lot of places doing us harm. I'll tell you tonight there is continuous and sad evidence to substantiate his claims of the underlying crimes. Every day in this country there are fresh American tragedies to report on. American citizens brutalized, abused, murdered by illegal aliens. Yet most of these stories are buried at the back of the local metro sections in your local papers, and most of them are never heard national news broadcasts. The media are too busy doing, what? Capturing every utterance of a few specific porn stars. So, tonight, we are going to report on a handful of these American tragedies. In San Diego, a Mexican illegal alien, Constantino Banda Acosta, after a night of drinking, was charged with running a stop sign and slamming into a family's vehicle. A little boy in the backseat of the vehicle suffered serious head trauma and now has cognitive issues. He fled the scene. In addition to being an illegal alien, Acosta had been deported 17 times, yes, at 17. Last week a judge declared a mistrial in his case because they couldn't establish if it was he or the illegal alien in the car with him, who is actually behind the wheel at the time of the crash. Thankfully, he was turned over to federal custody following the trial, but given California's sanctuary state laws, I expect he will find his way back into the golden state. And then this, in Fairhope, Alabama, on Sunday, a twice-deported alien, Jose Luis Alonzo De Leon, is accused of crashing his truck into a local woman who was on her bike and killed her. He was also drunk. He too fled the scene of the crash. Authorities later found him in possession of a stolen gun and believed he has used seven aliases in the past, they are now investigating his criminal history. A law enforcement official and the sister of the victim will join us in just a few moments. And last Friday in the suburbs of New Orleans, at 2:00 in the afternoon, this charmer sauntered into a Walmart. His name is Billy Yo (inaudible) Herrera. He allegedly approached a mother and her 2-year-old child with a machete. He told the mother if she didn't listen to his instructions, she and her child would die. He then tried to kidnap the infant. The mother resisted and hid with her baby behind the deli counter. He then ran off and attempted to abduct another child from a shopping cart. Walmart employees and an off-duty officer ended up tackling him. He is charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault, and an immigration detainer has been placed on him. Look, I don't even have time to report on the other crimes that have percolated out there just in the last few days. Salvadorian illegal immigrant, a traveling pastor, no less, charged just last week with enticing a 14-year-old girl in Virginia to record a sexually explicit of herself. Investigators believe this freak may have victimized many others or the Guatemalan, twice deported illegal, who allegedly raped a teenage girl. He posted bail in February and escaped before ICE could detain him, or the illegal in Dallas, who is charge with smothering a senior citizen and may be, according to authorities, a serial killer. This only scratches the surface of crimes committed on a daily basis by those who should have never been in this country in the first place. Every life lost, every child harmed, every woman abused are victims of not only the criminals who committed those crimes but also of the government that allowed criminals to enter this country in the first place. And, frankly, I'm sick of this argument. I don't really care what percentage of illegals in the United States commit crimes and what percentage doesn't. Even one American life lost at the hands of an illegal is too much. It is unacceptable. And contrary to what the media tell us, those who have flouted our laws and the families they've drag with them are criminals. The people who cross this country's border are criminals. They are not victims. Our policymakers, they are supposed to represent us, and address our needs, not cater to those of illegal immigrants. Donald Trump understands this, and he is right to step up enforcement across the board. The American workers, American taxpayers, I think are really tired of feeling like second-class citizens in their own country, like they are the interlopers as illegal immigrants to legally demand rights and legal benefits. That dynamic is starting to change because of President Trump. We Americans and all you hardworking illegal immigrants out there must demand that lawmakers stop protecting the lawbreakers and start protecting us, and that's the ANGLE. Joining me now for reaction is Lieutenant Brian McGregor with the Kenner Louisiana Police Department. He is investigating the attempted kidnapping incident involving an illegal alien with a machete at that Walmart that we just told you about. And in Alabama, Sandy Best, the sister of Amy Hawkins, who we just told it was allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant, Jose Luis Alonso-De Leon, as she was cycling. And Baldwin County Alabama D.A., Robert Wilters, who is prosecuting Ms. Hawkins' alleged killer. Let's start with you, Mr. Wilters, this broke my heart today to hear this story coming out of Alabama. I actually learned about it because one of my radio listeners called in to my show and said a colleague of his is the actual husband of the victim in this case, and that he was distraught and devastated. I looked it up and indeed this happened. Tell us about this case and any more details that you have discovered."

It seems that on Sunday at about 12:25 p.m., Amy Hawkins was riding her bicycle on one of our roads on the eastern shore near Fairhope and Daphne. And she was northbound, and the defendant in the case, Jose Luis Alonso-De Leon, was heading southbound. He swerved around the car to pass and struck Ms. Hawkins, who is riding a bicycle. He did not stop, and continued on, and was found a couple of miles away several minutes later. He was highly intoxicated at that time when he was arrested by law enforcement. They also found a stolen pistol in the vehicle. We then have learned, through checking, that he has at least seven aliases and, according to ICE, immigration enforcement, he was deported twice during 2014. It is a tragedy that--"

I cannot imagine what you are going through at this moment, and it sounds hollow to say that, but I am praying for you and your family and everything that you have gone through, and her two children, her husband, her entire family, you. If this thing could have been vetted and he could've been prevented from coming into this country, whether through a physical barrier or through effective deportation, I mean, your sister would be alive. Words don't even convey -- I am furious about these cases, and I am saddened and as devastated as I could be without having known your sister."

And it was your sister's death at his hands that caused his ultimate apprehension, and I assume will be put away for a long period of time.

And we almost had another situation unfold in Kenner, Louisiana, about 6 miles from New Orleans, and one of our contributors here from New Orleans, he brought this to my attention, got a guy with a machete in a Walmart trying to kidnap a little 2-year-old. He goes on to try to kidnap someone else, another person, and he should have been in this country. This is madness. Lieutenant? Lieutenant McGregor, your thoughts about this case now as it stands?

He engaged a female that had a 2-year-old in a grocery cart and he threatened that female. He also threatened the life of the child as well and he also put his hand on his side to indicate that he had a machete on his side. That female asked for help. He reached to grab that child and, like any mother would, she fought for her child and grabbed the child from the cart and proceeded to get that child on the other side of that deli counter. Some Walmart employees as well as citizens and everybody else that engage the suspect, he ran back to the meat and poultry section of the store. He drew the machete. He swung it at employees who create a distance, which allowed him to get back into the deli section where another mother who was coming through with infants strapped to the grocery cart, he tried to grab that child while he was still holding the machete. Like any other mother would, she fought for her child as well. An employee that was there, and a police officer that was off duty, to engage the suspect, got him down on the ground, handcuffed him, took him into custody."

But New Orleans itself is a sanctuary city, correct, and you have bleed through from New Orleans into your community? You've got people worried about tearing down statues in the middle of the night, but meanwhile, worried about making their way into the community. I want to ask both of you, law enforcement, how important is that for local authorities to cooperate with the federal government on this immigration issue and to get these people imprisoned and then out of the country. We'll go back to you, Mr. Wilters."

And in the last year, there has been tremendous cooperation between local law enforcement and immigration authorities where, for eight years, we didn't have it. So, having the knowledge that we can contact ICE and that ICE will actually come in and place a detainer on an illegal immigrant helps us tremendously. There are still some markings and at that have to be worked out, but the cooperation we've had in the last year has just been tremendous."

The entire state of California refusing to cooperate with federal officials, endangering the lives of Californians, individuals in the country illegally, violent criminals are released, they go on, and they create more havoc for the American people and illegal immigrants. I want to close with Sandy. Sandy, if you could say anything to, you know, immigration officials, the government, given the fact that you have lost your sister just a few days ago, out for a beautiful bike ride on a beautiful day, she should be here enjoying her family tonight. She was an incredible person. As an American citizen, what would you say?"

I know you're not looking at it, but we appreciate you and thank you all very much, and God bless your family, Sandy. Another day, another lawsuit by California.

    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",

The article quoted three anonymous sources that claimed interior secretary Ryan Zinke has repeatedly downplayed the importance of diversity in the workplace. CNN's sources said Zinke valued results over diversity and said, quote, 'You'll find we have the most diverse group anyone has ever had,' unquote. Which begs the question, dis Secretary Zinke allegedly say anything controversial at all? We should note an interior secretary spokesperson denied CNN's report, saying the anonymous claims made against the secretary are untrue. Joining us now to discuss the issue in L.A., civil rights attorney Leo Terrell, and in Washington, Horace Cooper, cochairman of Project 21. All right, Leo, let's go right to you on this. It seems like Zinke is being offered on the altar of political correctness here. I think I know what he said, which he said, look, if you hire the best people, of course you're going to get a diverse workplace because we think everybody from every background is smart and they have merit, and they will be hired. And we do a pretty good job of that. And yet it became a lightning rod that basically Zinke is racist. If you look through all the verbiage, Zinke is racist. You reaction to this?"

And you know what, if he has the best and brightest, why does he have to say we don't have to worry about diversity. I would submit to you, Laura, that that statement, show me some data and I'll keep my big mouth shut. But for him to just make a statement like that in this administration, and you know as well as I do, lawyer to lawyer, this administration does not have a Colin Powell or a Condoleezza Rice.

If he had stopped there, no one would have been surprised by the liberal justice's words, but he went a step further, a lot further, and he argued that demonstrators, quote, 'should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment.' Joining me now for reaction from New York is Monica Crowley, senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research, and with me in the studio here, Democratic strategist Joel Payne. OK, Joel, lay it on me. So now we are going right to what we thought all along, which is they want to get rid of the Second Amendment."

You know that Heller fundamentally changed what the Second Amendment was supposed to be. I think the justice was making a reasonable argument."

So we affirmed that the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, was an individual right. Monica, this is what a lot of us believed all along, that the left wanted to go for the guns, they wanted to take the Second Amendment. And now with John Paul Stevens, amazing that to write these op-eds at 97, but John Paul Stevens writes this piece in 'The New York Times,' and Bret Stephens, a big never-Trumper, by the way, he also is basically saying the same thing in an op-ed, the demonstrators should seek more effective and lasting reform.

They have long been attacking the First Amendment, and now they are ratcheting up their attacks on the Second Amendment. There is a reason why the founding fathers made those two sets of rights a one-two punch, because there is no guarantee of the First Amendment without the Second Amendment. And the left, and maybe some others from ideological parts of the country are now starting to make this argument. This is extremely dangerous. But I will say this, that Justice Stevens actually did us a favor because now no longer does the left have to pretend that they are interested in protecting the Second Amendment.

Guess who is on the chopping block now? T.J., Thomas Jefferson. Student activist at Hofstra University in New York are demanding a statue of him be removed from campus, claiming it belongs in a museum with proper context. They claim that white supremacists and neo-Nazi organizations embraced Jefferson as a hero. And this Friday, these students are even planning a Jefferson has got to go demonstration to further their -- advertising their ignorance about the whole thing. The American founding is apparently not among the courses offered at Hofstra this semester. I'm telling you, you give the P.C. mob an inch and they're going to take every founding father we have and a few presidents along with them. This is frightening. This is Taliban-esque, and this isn't America. History should be respected, you bet, in the proper context. Don't put our values today on the historical moments of the past."
