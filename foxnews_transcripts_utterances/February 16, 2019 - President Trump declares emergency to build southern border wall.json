Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro and thanks for being with us tonight. And thanks to all of you for once again, making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. We have a big show on deck with Freedom Caucus Chairman, Congressman Mark Meadows, Dan Bongino, Dennis Prager, Dr. Qanta Ahmed, and Charlie Kirk. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first my open.

Within a 36-hour period, we watched the President sign a bill to keep the government open, declare a national emergency because of the security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border. We watched an Attorney General be sworn in and watched the Deputy - former Deputy Chief of the FBI blow himself, the Department of Justice and the FBI up. We watched the economy reaching new heights. The left ignoring the blackface debacle because Democrats from the Virginia Governor to the AG, to Joy Behar we're all involved. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But what are we talking about today?

The left are lying to you when they say there is no crisis, that the President is concocting the nation's immigration emergency. They object to the President's characterization of the influx as an invasion when they say the effort to protect us is a waste of money and that the President is simply engaging in a political stunt. A primer -- our southern border is overwhelmed by illegal immigration, gang violence, crime, drugs and human trafficking. In fiscal year 2019, the DHS has already seen a 136% increase in the number of family units and unaccompanied children. Each month, 40,720 inadmissible have entered our southwest border in the last four months. Thousands of violent criminals cross that border, endangering Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In the last two years alone, I.C.E. has arrested 266,000 aliens with criminal records, including those convicted of 4,000 homicides, 30,000 sex crimes and 100,000 assaults. And if you don't believe those numbers, just look at the jails in Texas -- 186 illegal aliens and 276,000 criminal aliens were booked in local jails between 2011 and 2018. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last year I.C.E. removed more than 10,000 gang members already in our country illegally. Drugs are flowing across the border devastating American families. Every week, 300 Americans die of heroin overdoses of which 90% comes over that southern border. In 2019, I.C.E. made over 1,500 human trafficking arrest almost all of which were for sex trafficking; 20,000 children were illegally smuggled into the United States during the month of December alone. If this isn't a crisis at our border, it's hard to know what is. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Emergency is just the recognition of what other politicians have blatantly lied about to the American people so that they could fill their coffers with willing and many times, illegal Democrat voters since they have lost the heart of most Americans. So what happens to these people? When captured, they claim asylum, which of course they could have claimed at a legal port of entry. But even then they're released and given a court date, they don't even bother most of them to return. And 80% of them are not really eligible for asylum anyway, and their claims are ultimately rejected by immigration judges. But they don't care. They're off somewhere in America, maybe in your town, maybe even having a baby which gives them free access to just about everything. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now the President did everything he possibly could before declaring the state of emergency and if you want to criticize anyone, criticize Congress who dilly dallied since 1986, when President Reagan declare the last amnesty. They are so jealous of the other party, as well as this outsider President that they refuse to give him a win, when their concern should be about giving the American people a win. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They refuse to even consider that every day, they refuse to negotiate or work on our behalf, 130 Americans died from opioid overdoses and 90% of the heroin comes across that border. The left, however, instead of recognizing the danger to Americans is determined to do nothing but criticize President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This President is on firm legal ground. Both the Constitution and Congress have given him the right to declare emergencies as an executive action.

Should we be a refuge for the rest of the world to come for education, healthcare, housing, food stamps, and yes, even social security? And should they get a license? A free college education while American kids have to pay for theirs? And of course, should they get the right to vote? Where do you stand? Let me know what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and @JudgeJeanine.

It all goes back to January 29th, a date in which Smollett alleges that he was attacked in the Streeterville part of town by a couple of white individuals who hit him with homophobic and racist slurs and told him this is MAGA country. The story has continued to come unraveled, and police say what they want now is to bring Smollett in person for some more questioning, additional questions. They've contacted his legal representative and they're going to take it from there, Judge.",

This week, we saw a small and fast lightning glimpse of what your city and ultimately America could and will look like if socialists continue to have their way. Thursday, Amazon pulled out of its plan to headquarters in New York City after facing a fierce backlash from liberal lawmakers, progressive activists, socialist and union leaders. A move that will now cost the city and its residents thousands of jobs reflecting how socialist attack our capitalist values and one, even the liberal \"New York Times\" admitted in their opinion piece what a loss it is for the city of New York. One of the leaders of this movement, none other than freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this in celebration of Amazon pulling out of the deal, quote, \"Anything is possible. Today was the day a group of dedicated everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation and the power of the richest man in the world,\" close quote.

I've told you before, being a leader means making tough and many times, unpopular decisions. This week, we watched the leader declare a national emergency where one was unequivocally and undoubtedly needed. It was vintage Donald Trump and the reaction, vintage fake news left. Within a 36-hour period, we watched the President sign a bill to keep the government open, declare a national emergency because of the security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border. We watched an Attorney General be sworn in and watched the Deputy - former Deputy Chief of the FBI blow himself, the Department of Justice and the FBI up. We watched the economy reaching new heights. The left ignoring the blackface debacle because Democrats from the Virginia Governor to the AG, to Joy Behar we're all involved. But what are we talking about today? Is there really an emergency at the border? The left is calling it a political stunts and a total waste of money. Some even threatening to take the barrier down if built."

They object to the President's characterization of the influx as an invasion when they say the effort to protect us is a waste of money and that the President is simply engaging in a political stunt. A primer -- our southern border is overwhelmed by illegal immigration, gang violence, crime, drugs and human trafficking. In fiscal year 2019, the DHS has already seen a 136% increase in the number of family units and unaccompanied children. Each month, 40,720 inadmissible have entered our southwest border in the last four months. Thousands of violent criminals cross that border, endangering Americans. In the last two years alone, I.C.E. has arrested 266,000 aliens with criminal records, including those convicted of 4,000 homicides, 30,000 sex crimes and 100,000 assaults. And if you don't believe those numbers, just look at the jails in Texas -- 186 illegal aliens and 276,000 criminal aliens were booked in local jails between 2011 and 2018. Last year I.C.E. removed more than 10,000 gang members already in our country illegally. Drugs are flowing across the border devastating American families. Every week, 300 Americans die of heroin overdoses of which 90% comes over that southern border. In 2019, I.C.E. made over 1,500 human trafficking arrest almost all of which were for sex trafficking; 20,000 children were illegally smuggled into the United States during the month of December alone. If this isn't a crisis at our border, it's hard to know what is. Emergency is just the recognition of what other politicians have blatantly lied about to the American people so that they could fill their coffers with willing and many times, illegal Democrat voters since they have lost the heart of most Americans. So what happens to these people? When captured, they claim asylum, which of course they could have claimed at a legal port of entry. But even then they're released and given a court date, they don't even bother most of them to return. And 80% of them are not really eligible for asylum anyway, and their claims are ultimately rejected by immigration judges. But they don't care. They're off somewhere in America, maybe in your town, maybe even having a baby which gives them free access to just about everything. Now the President did everything he possibly could before declaring the state of emergency and if you want to criticize anyone, criticize Congress who dilly dallied since 1986, when President Reagan declare the last amnesty. They are so jealous of the other party, as well as this outsider President that they refuse to give him a win, when their concern should be about giving the American people a win. They refuse to even consider that every day, they refuse to negotiate or work on our behalf, 130 Americans died from opioid overdoses and 90% of the heroin comes across that border. The left, however, instead of recognizing the danger to Americans is determined to do nothing but criticize President Trump."

This President is on firm legal ground. Both the Constitution and Congress have given him the right to declare emergencies as an executive action. Youngstown vs Ohio 343 U.S. 579 according to Justice Jackson, \"The President is at his zenith of power here where Congress has delegated to him the authority and his own authority is at its maximum. He possesses his own right, plus all that Congress has delegated. In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said to personify a federal sovereignty.\" It's real simple, folks. What do you want? Should America be a nation state? Should we be a country defined by borders? Or should we simply be a repository for anyone who wants to come here? Should we be a refuge for the rest of the world to come for education, healthcare, housing, food stamps, and yes, even social security? And should they get a license? A free college education while American kids have to pay for theirs? And of course, should they get the right to vote? Where do you stand?

Twenty words, Judge, all they had to do is say, \"No funds from 10 USC 284 2808 shall be used to build a barrier between Mexico and the United States.\" Twenty words if they had put in there, basically would have prohibited the President from doing this. But the President did a real shrewd thing. Before they signed the bill and sent it to him, before they voted on it. He said, \"I'm going to declare national emergency.\" He put them on notice, and yet Congress didn't act. I think the Supreme Court will look at that and say, \"Why did Congress not act?\" And you know why they didn't act?

It wasn't just a campaign promise, it was a personal promise to so many families that have lost loved ones because of the open border, so he took a bold step and some are criticizing him. I am not. At least, we've had our chance, we should have put it in before him and we didn't and yet we couldn't even come up with a compromise, a reasonable compromise $2.5 billion to $3 billion to get started.

The Border Patrol chiefs believe it's a national emergency and they said, \"We need $5.7 billion for these three top priorities.\" And yet Congress failed to deliver on that.

One thing that has developed as his story seems to come unraveled all the time is that the official Chicago Police spokesman who has insisted throughout this process that Jussie Smollett was still the victim in the case, where he is no longer considered the victim, not yet classified a suspect. There were two Nigerian brothers who were identified as these persons of interest off of the grainy security video in the area at the time the alleged attack took place. They were brought in for questioning. They were released and that's because as I got from the official spokesman, they are now cooperating with police and that played a role in their release. A lot of what I have to talk about, but beyond this, it goes back to our sister station WFLD is writing anonymous sources saying that the rope that was allegedly put around Jussie Smollett's neck that they have a receipt for that showing these Nigerian brothers bought it, they say at the direction of Smollett, that he paid for their involvement in the alleged attack, again, citing anonymous sources. It all goes back to January 29th, a date in which Smollett alleges that he was attacked in the Streeterville part of town by a couple of white individuals who hit him with homophobic and racist slurs and told him this is MAGA country. The story has continued to come unraveled, and police say what they want now is to bring Smollett in person for some more questioning, additional questions. They've contacted his legal representative and they're going to take it from there, Judge."

Oh, equality Soviet Union. Equality in the way the left means it has caused more evil in the last hundred years than any other value."

She thinks that there is a $3 billion pot of money that we should just be giving to other companies or to New Yorkers. What she doesn't get is that there -- if there are 25,000 jobs, over $100,000.00 - we're not talking about minimum wage, although minimum wage would be great, too. So you've got $2.5 billion that generates a tax revenue. And then you've got $3 billion that they are providing in an incentive, but every year and then all the additional -- the restaurants, the bodegas, the shop owners, the transportation, the Ubers, the infrastructure, the building, the construct -- I mean, this is idiocy like I've never seen before. If there were a benefit to someone, I'd say, \"Okay, we have a difference of opinion,\" but this is pure stupidity."

And so they so loathe that anybody is richer than anyone else that it is better that everyone suffer at a low level than everyone be improved, but they'll still being much richer people. They live the idea of the violation, since I think in biblical terms often of the 10th Commandment, \"Do not covet what belongs to someone else.\" The left is based on coveting. They loathe the idea that Bezos is rich. I can't stand Bezos. But I don't loathe the idea that he is a billionaire. It is irrelevant to me. The only question is, will he do good by bringing business to my city? The answer is an unequivocal yes."

      "utterance": "Yes, socialism is this love of equality. And as I said, so much evil has been done in it. Everybody is equal. By the way, this is not just in economics. For the left, everything is flattened out to equality. Parent and child are equal. The left wing mindset does not want the parents to be unequal to their child, the teacher to be unequal to their student. Everything is equal and of course, we are gods. We are equal. We are gods in our own eyes. Marx said it and Engel said it. This is the beginning of leftism, \"I am my god. I don't answer to something higher than me.\" A child doesn't answer to a parent. The student doesn't answer to a teacher. A human doesn't answer to God. It is a flattening out in the name of equality."

She is showing the marriage of left wing politics in the Democrats with Islamism. Bernie Sanders congratulated her, instead he stands with his Muslim brothers and sisters, to me, he stands with Islamists, and they do not distinguish between the two. It's very problematic. The Islamism only succeeds by portraying itself as a victim and left wing politics thrives on victimization, victim ideology. She's no victim, as you said. She came as an asylum seeker. She's moved to one of the highest offices in the land within 23 years. What other country gives a refugee that opportunity?"

Somehow they can only see it on the right, but they're blind to their own. The other freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez received a telephone call from Jeremy Corbyn, who is openly anti-Semitic, who has laid wreaths at the tomb of Hamas commanders and could be poised to become the British Prime Minister. Do we want that here? We must - the Democrats, if I was a Democratic strategist, we must address this encroachment of being in bed with Islamism and empowering anti- Semitism, which is against every American value."

All right, good evening, Charlie. Now everybody's upset on the left with the idea of the President actually trying to make the country more secure. And they say that this wall is immoral and they're going to stop it at every turn in the courts and everywhere else they can. And one guy, Beto, Beto, whatever his name is says he is going to tear it down. What say you?"

      "utterance": "Yes, well, I call him by his birth name, Robert Francis O'Rourke because he's not actually Hispanic at all. But look here is how absurd the left has become as now they want to tear down all our walls. But look, the President was elected on the promise of getting this wall built. He went through Congress. He is keeping the government open. He's got some money for the wall. But it seems, Judge, that this has been a 30 or 40-year struggle to get both parties or even one party to fight to secure our border. And if this is not an emergency in our country, what is an emergency? As you said, in your open, which was brilliant, President Obama declared 13 declarations of emergencies. I am talking about the opioid crisis, the drugs in our country, the illegal guns. This is an emergency. The President is using his constitutional authority put forth in the National Emergency Act that was passed in the 1970s to be able to address problems such as the porous southern border, and he should be applauded for doing so courageously."

They just want to fill their coffers with Democratic voters, legal or illegal, it doesn't matter. And that's what this is all about. I've come to that conclusion. But let's talk about Ocasio- Cortez and the socialism that we see with Amazon basically being forced out of New York because one of her pals there and amazingly, Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio are not really criticizing her, you know, it's like they're talking out of both sides of their mouths."

You do too, and we should make fun of it. But this is really serious stuff because 25,000 middle class workers are not going to have work in New York because of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She cares more about herself than the constituents and the hardworking people of New York City and look, I am no big fan of Amazon, okay, I think they do a lot of deals that are not right. I think they should pay more in taxes. I think they use loopholes, but I personally would love to see Amazon employ 25,000 hardworking New Yorkers and said she is celebrating it."

It's unimaginable what it would do to Long Island City. And she doesn't understand. She doesn't get it. She just thinks we have $3 billion and we ought to just give it away. She doesn't get that that $3 billion is money generated by the money that Amazon is paying that will go into the tax revenues. She doesn't get it."

      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Exactly right. Yes, and this will be their corporate headquarters, not to mention each one of those people that will be working at Amazon, they will get raises. They'll be able to buy houses, get bigger apartments. The billions of dollars in investment that'd be happening in her community. But this is so important with what's happening with the far left. They would rather prove a point and try to destroy wealth creation and take credit for it, than actually see people's lives get better."
