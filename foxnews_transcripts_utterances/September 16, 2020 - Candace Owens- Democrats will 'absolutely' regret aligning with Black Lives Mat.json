Under his administration, he will mandate lockdowns and masks nationwide. Our medicine cabinet, with a twist, breaks it all down. Also, is the Left going to regret the devil's bargain they made with the Black Lives Matters movement? Candice Owens shares her thoughts. And Raymond Arroyo, he hit the streets of Florida. To hear from voters and that key battleground state, that in Biden's rough trip to the Sunshine State in seen and unseen ahead. But first, the comeback kid. That's the focus of today's ANGLE. Now, you'd never know it if you just checked out Facebook or you scrolled Insta, or watched those other networks that Sean and I were just talking about, but right now we're in the midst of the great American comeback. Now, remember not long ago, what the media was predicting for our economy because of COVID?",

Now you can see from the list that despite taking a slight hit, we did far better than other G7 nations.

The census just reported that the United States median wages broke a record in 2019, the highest recorded since they began tracking it. This means that Trump's policies were working for the average family. The poverty rate, that hit an all-time low as well. And income was going up across the board, increasing 7 percent from the year prior to more than 68,700 from 64,324. That is a $4,000 raise. Real money to real people among the highest increases ever recorded. OK, now, that's all well and good. But what about Trump's record in international affairs?

Now, would they have reversed course if Trump hadn't talked about it or intervened? Doubtful. The sports media, by the way, predicted it wouldn't happen, because they didn't want football to restart. It's a strange thing, sports media, these days. It's shameful. Now the Democrats and their cronies and the press underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. We all remember that. And they seem to be repeating their mistake in 2020. From the economy to foreign policy to sports, he's on a roll. And that is not just good news for his chances in November, it's good for America. The Trump resistance is always wondering why are these people so loyal to Trump. Why do they stand in line for hours and even days sometimes to see his rallies? Why do thousands of boats line up for these Trump water parades? Because his policies put money in those people's pockets. He respects their freedoms, too. That's why. And that's THE ANGLE.

County and declare yourselves freer and better. And when the real compensation for all of this is that you can plunk a dumb lawn sign on your lawns declaring you are on virtue because it says Black Lives Matter, or love is love.

And when the real compensation for all of this is that you can plunk a dumb lawn sign on your lawns declaring you are on virtue because it says Black Lives Matter, or love is love. I'm sorry that is not a great place to raise children, it is not a great place to build a company. And we decided we're moving and guess what, most of our employees are thrilled about it."

That Jacob Blake was only shot because the police were called to the home of the alleged victim of the rape, who said that the alleged rapist was back, the cops show up, he resists arrest, he attempts to apparently assault the police officers, he maybe has a knife on him, he certainly has a knife on the floorboards of his car before he was shot. And Kamala Harris and Joe Biden made their decision, now let's decide with the criminal. He attempt to walk all of that stuff back right now is going to, I think, be of little avail."

And now she realizes that after all, when somebody actually is committing a crime, that's a bad thing for your city. Businesses are fleeing Minneapolis, businesses are fleeing California, businesses are fleeing Oregon. This is going to continue.

They only care about not getting primaried by an AOC-approved candidate. The fact is, House Democrats, especially those in swing states, still need two things to survive, cash from Nancy and the party establishment; and again, avoiding getting challenged by the Left, so they sit quietly while Pelosi lets the radicals go wild. So if you're a swing voter, why would you grant another majority to the Democrat Party with no moderates, at least none who speak out, and pretty much no accomplishments? And let's not forget that the House Democrats have accomplished zero on the issues that they claim to care about, because they don't want to work with Donald Trump. Yesterday, Nancy Pelosi just said, \"Oh, forget about him\". When she was asked, do you regret not meeting him for a year? They did the impeachment drama, which was shameful and they have a bitter attitude about everything else. But they're going to try to claim credit for what, the USMCA, which was all Trump. It's just ridiculous. Joining us now, and I'm delighted he is with us, Kevin McCarthy, of course, the House Minority Leader. He will join us now.

There is still a lot of power at the state and local level. The White House couldn't get schools open. They genuinely wanted to get schools open in a normal way and they couldn't do it. I want to just add one thing about the masks, because I think it's fascinating, I was just looking up before we came on. You can go back to 1919, more than a century ago. In California, they looked at whether or not masks had done anything. They called them gauze masks then. You can find this online.

If you look -- the reason that this post-November prediction is being made is because it's unfalsifiable before the election. Right now, cases are down, hospitalizations are down, deaths are down.

      "utterance": "Absolutely. We're seeing it right now. They have completely overplayed their hand. They gave it too much time. In the beginning, Americans were apprehensive. They weren't sure. Maybe perhaps this race narrative was real. Maybe this was really about police brutality. Maybe this really was America striving towards equality. And now the truth is standing in everybody's face. The Black Lives Matter movement is not striving for equality. In fact, they're striving for entitlement. They want special entitlements. They want white people to stop and raise their fists in the air and salute them when they go into the diners as if it's the 1950s. The things that we would see white racists Americans doing in the 1950s we are now seeing Black Lives Matters activists do at cafes towards white people. People are waking up to the fact that this movement is really about Marxism. It's about the undoing of America. What they're trying to do is really sink all of the systems that we have in place. They just want to disrupt. That's all it's about. They want to disrupt, they want to cause hate, and they want to rapidly spread it, and then point the finger somehow at Trump, and say this is only happening because it's Trump's America."

      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And the reason for that is simple. The government wants to raise the children. They like the fact that you're seeing across these inner cities so many kids are failing. It's unbelievable. You saw me talk about this when I testified in Congress a few months ago -- 75 percent of black boys in California cannot pass a basic literacy exam. That is stunning. Everybody should be talking about that. That means the public school system is failing black Americans. You have that happening in inner cities. You have it happening in Baltimore where they can't find a single child across five schools that's proficient in reading or mathematics. And yet the Democrat Party says we want to keep these public schools in place. Why? Because they're able to replace hard academics like mathematics, like engineering, with the soft psychological conditioning courses, like \"The 1619 Project.\" They want to tell your kids about race and feelings. And this stuff is not going to get them ahead in the world. In fact, it's going to send them backwards. And that's exactly what the Democrat Party is after, Laura."

Does that affect the African-American psyche in the United States to move the needle further toward Democrats, or are people beginning to tune that all out when they see less money in their pockets?"

    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "I think that Cardi B and LeBron James, they are responsible for a lot of disruption that we're seeing in this nation. And they do these things unwittingly. I genuinely think that they do not understand the economics behind what they are preaching or the consequences behind what they are preaching. And unfortunately, when you have this angry rhetoric, when you have LeBron James saying that we're literally being hunted, when you have Cardi B saying that Trump's America is racist at the same time she's attacking me because I have a white husband. What ends up happening is you're raising a bunch of kids who believe that in this country they can't make it. When they see someone like LeBron James who is building a $100 million mansion in Bel-Air at the moment, say to you that we're literally being hunted, we being black people by white people, it makes them feel helpless and like they need to get up and do something about it. And it leads to these devastating, staggering crime waves that we're seeing, the increase in these inner cities, because they believe that. Unfortunately, you're seeing individuals get arrested for things like we saw in Los Angeles County. They'll find one person. He will be arrested. But there is an entire ecosystem of people that deserve to serve time. Politicians, the media henchman that have perpetuated this idea that black Americans are being hunted and caused all of this corruption that we see today."

Candace, come back soon, and thank you so much for your leadership on this.
