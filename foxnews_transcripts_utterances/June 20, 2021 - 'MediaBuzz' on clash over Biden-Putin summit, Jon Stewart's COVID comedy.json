Nobody, of course, is buying the ex-KGB man's propaganda and, of course, America's enemies are going to use our problems against us, but if any Russian journalist had asked about the crackdown and the killing of political rivals as ABC's Rachel Scott did, saying, Mr. President, what are you so afraid of, that person would probably end up behind bars or worse. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MEDIABUZZ. Ahead, former Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow joins us on a wide range of issues. Jon Stewart talks up the Wuhan lab leak theory as Powell (ph) Stephen Colbert wasn't having it. Why that turns out to be serious shtick. And we'll unveil a fast new feature called \"Buzz Beaters.\" Stick around for that. The media built-up for the showdown summit between President Biden and Vladimir Putin was relentless. The reality that the Geneva meetings didn't accomplish much was far less dramatic beginning with new star pundits trying to analyze the Russian leader's body language."

You mentioned in your monologue the whataboutism and the sort of shamelessness of Vladimir Putin. I mean, if you look at the rhetoric, it may have gotten a little bit tougher. There was a reference in the montage to the Helsinki summit, which I thought was a low moment in the Trump presidency. But while talks in the words of a president absolutely is important, it is something that matters, results matter more.

And the world war three comment from Clarence, with all respect, I mean, I don't think President Trump moved us anywhere at all close to another world war. There were peace deals achieved under the Trump administration that were pretty historic. So, he gave them a symbiotic, sometimes dysfunctional relationship where you didn't really know what he was going to do. It was exciting. There was going to be controversy. They were ready to sort of, you know, blow up any story into this international incident. And with Joe Biden, it is a little quieter, a little sleepier. You could say more normal, more traditional.

Frankly, we have a situation where the cyberattacks in particular, Joe Biden accusing Russia of cyberattacks, is certainly true. It's a terrible thing.

Joe Biden had said that he was confident that Vladimir Putin understood that continuing these attacks would lower his standing in the world. It was a completely fair question and frankly, it was a kind of fair answer, I mean a fine answer. We should be seeing kind of arguments between press and power. The press should be pushing power to the point that they get a little rankled. The problem though is that he goes and says, oh, you're in the wrong business. I mean, that was completely ridiculous. If we want to have this sort of intellectual consistency, okay, now these kinds of exchanges are okay, great. But we know what would have happened a year ago. If it was Donald Trump in power, it would have been white male misogynistic rage and this wouldn't have been a big story. Instead, as you mentioned, we have people actually attacking Kaitlan Collins. Soledad O'Brien, who before she was a professional Twitter troll actually was considered a journalist, called it a stupid question, questioned whether Kaitlan Collins was acting in good faith. David Axelrod, who is Kaitlan Collin's colleague at CNN, said it was just a silly mistake and he was -- Joe Biden was just doing what all politicians feel, and this time he actually said everyone should calm down."

      "utterance": "Right. The framing of the apology became the story among CNN and others in the media. I guess it was good he apologized. As you mentioned, they don't normally apologize. I think what it really show is that Joe Biden is just like any other president, whether it's Trump, Obama, Bush. They don't like to have these kinds of -- to be pushed by the press. And what we have to understand is that the press needs to be doing that. The problem is when the press then goes after the press for somehow trying to oh, you're putting words in Joe Biden's mouth, I mean, give me a break. Kaitlan Collins asked a very fair question. The press should be galvanizing around her. We should be seeing more of these kinds of exchanges. The press should be asking these tough questions."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, maybe he has a point, but the president -- the press doesn't always ask negative questions. The press often asks and should ask skeptical questions, challenging questions designed to throw a president or any other politician off the talking points."

      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, first of all, the negative view of life, what kind of psychoanalysis -- I'm not going to try to put too much weight on what President Biden is saying off the cuff. We know he speaks with the teleprompter and he's got a list of questioners that he can call on. So, this was an off-the-cuff moment. But no, yes of course they should be asking challenging questions. And Joe Biden if you're comparing the kinds of questions that, say, a Jim Acosta asking Donald Trump to Kaitlan Collins who's replaced Jim Acosta on the CNN as the new chief White House correspondent, you know, Kaitlan Collins is asking fair questions, Jim Acosta was asking completely absurd, off the wall questions that were, you know, purely there to feed the resistance on Twitter. So, yes, reporters should ask challenging, fair questions as you say. The idea that a president should feel that kind of questioning --"

Bush did it to Trump, so all those old rules are out the window. Look, the substantive point that President Trump is making is exactly right. We got nothing. I mean, in particular, in particular we handed over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline even before Biden got to Russia. Lost all sense of leverage. That pipeline was stopped. They're 100 miles short. I worked on that with others. O'Brien, Mnuchin, many other people in the government to stop the pipeline. Only Germany wanted it.

The two leaders don't always slam each other right next to each other although I think Biden made a mistake not having a joint press conference. But my point on that, Howie, just to put it into context, I was referring to this remarkable development where Biden released a highly classified document regarding the 16 most sensitive infrastructure sectors. Now, that is a gift to the hackers in Russia. That is target practice to the hackers in China and target practice to the hackers in Iran and probably North Korea as well. That should never have been put out and incidentally here too he got nothing for it. And it wasn't a complete list. That's the irony of it. It didn't include space. It didn't include oceans. It didn't include other things. It's like as our own John Roberts reported in Geneva, you have a nice block of homes, you can rob these houses but you can't rob these houses?"

But I'm very skeptical, the mainstream is a left-wing media. You know that. We're not breaking news on that point. And I'm saying why do you let Biden get away with that stuff, releasing classified material on our key sections? Why do we let Putin get away with it? They didn't even criticize Putin who said, hackers, we don't hack. The hacking is coming from North America and the U.S. and Canada. That's utter nonsense."

There should be a lot more investigative reporting there, a lot more critical reporting. I want to say again, going back to this Biden trip and the G7, Biden surrendered to the G7. Right? He surrendered on tax policy. We're now going to have a global minimum tax and we're going to have a windfall profits tax that will fall predominantly virtually completely on American companies. That's part of the $6 trillion plan. Remember, you're going to have a 3 or $4 trillion tax hike. You want to hear something, Howie, just in a second. A few 20 top --"

Joining us now, Mike Emanuel, Fox News chief Washington correspondent. Plenty of liberal detractors are dismissing the Marjorie Taylor Greene apology because it took so long. Of course, she's been criticized like Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell. What do you make of the reaction and her timing?"

      "speaker": "MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, my sense, Howie, is we have a forgiving country and she went to the Holocaust museum, she went on camera to show you how she felt about it and don't get me wrong, Marjorie Taylor Greene has said a lot of outrageous things. And I'm certainly not here to defend that. But in this case, she went to the Holocaust museum. She made a heartfelt apology. We'll see if it's sincere as time goes on. But bottom line, we're a forgiving country, and we are a country that believes in second chances. And so, my sense is she did a pretty good job cleaning up this mess. We'll see if she can clean up other messes along the way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Now Chuck Schumer, again, not the same category he was portraying himself as an advocate for the developmentally disabled but he used that offensive word, retarded. But then he didn't even issue a statement in his own name. So, is the press giving the majority leader a pass on this one but a lot of our viewers don't even know about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Yes. My sense is that the mainstream media likes to have Marjorie Taylor Greene as a punching bag, you know, somebody that they can point to and say she is outrageous and says all these crazy things. Meanwhile, the Senate majority leader says an insensitive thing and his spokesman does a little cleanup and it goes away pretty quickly. And so, look, I believe in forgiveness. If I mess up, I hope people will give me a second chance and forgive me. But I think it should be a two-way street, whether you have an r next to your name or a d. And I don't know. In this case, it seems like with Schumer he got a pretty easy pass."

Jeffrey Rosen who succeeded Bill Barr in those final weeks when he wouldn't go along. Is this a big story even though those pressure efforts failed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Well, my sense is Jeffrey Rosen comes out looking like a rock star with all the political pressure on him in the final weeks of the Trump administration. He held his ground. I don't think a lot of folks are surprised that President Trump wanted to do everything possible to try to hold onto his job as president of the United States. He felt like he should be entitled to another term in office. My sense is, it is a big story to a certain degree, a lot of our colleagues in the mainstream media love having President Trump's name out there. It's good for business. But I think a big aspect of whether it's going to be a huge story or not is whether he decides to run again in 2024, it may come up again at that point. If he stays in retirement then it should fade over time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. Rosen said in an e-mail that he wouldn't even look into a conspiracy theory into a company in Italy that was supposed to use satellite technology to tamper with the U.S. voting machines. But whether he runs again in 2024 or not I think Donald Trump is still the leader of the Republican Party and that arguably makes some of this old stuff relevant today. Quick response."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And I think Republicans are going to get asked about this kind of findings whenever they come up and asked whether they defend the president or whether they're going to condemn some of these actions that he may have taken in the final days in office. And so, it puts the GOP in an awkward spot, whether he wants to come back as speaker of the House, as president again --"

Chrissy Teigen, a celebrity cyberbully who once told a teenage singer to kill herself is suddenly sorry. Not a day, not a single moment has passed where I haven't felt the crushing weight of regret for the things I've said in the past. As you know, a bunch of old awful, awful, awful tweets resurfaced. I'm truly ashamed of that. Not buying it. Piers Morgan calling her duplicitous woke celebrity. It turns out she insulted Piers years ago as a piece of blank. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the brilliant creator of Hamilton is also sorry about his film \"In the Heights.\" Critics claiming, he used too light skin minorities. Miranda says I hear that without sufficient dark-skinned Afro- Latino representation, the work feels extractive of the community we wanted so much to represent with pride and joy, we fell short. Well, OK. But, did the guy who reimagined the founding fathers as black really have to apologize for the casting? Here's some breaking Pink Floyd news, Roger Waters, co-founder of the old Pink Floyd rock group just stuck it to Facebook, dropping a bunch of f bombs, he said Mark Zuckerberg personally offered him a huge amount of money to use one of their song in an Instagram ad. Water said he turned down the little back where he says he's trying to take over everything by saying the answer is f-you. No f-ing way. I will not be a part of this B.S., Zuckerberg. I guess the 77-year-old bass player has some blank your money. Yasher Ali is a Twitter based journalist. So connected that CNN president Jeff Zucker praise him in a Los Angeles magazine profile. But the story also reveals that the say ex-operative befriended wealthy women and then had these messy breakups. He moved in with Kathy Griffin and months later was ordered to leave. He borrowed $179,000 from heiress Adriadne Getty and she says he didn't repay most of it. Ali moved into a home owned by Democratic donor Susie Tompkins Buell, took a commission for auctioning off some of her art and that ended in a financial dispute. Ali tells the magazine he's in therapy and working on his dysfunctional behavior. I got to clean this one up a little bit, a sex scene was cut from HBO Max's Harley Quinn's show based on Batman. The cocreators tell Variety they showed the animated caped crusader giving pleasure to cat woman. They said the boss at D.C. comics told then you absolutely cannot do that. Heroes don't do that. Bad for the image, I guess. Cat woman could not be reached for comment. And the New York Times was denounced the Babylon Bee as far-right misinformation site has gotten stung its pure obvious forehead slapping satire. After getting a legal letter, the Times ran a correction meaning it's a right-leaning satirical web site. Here's Babylon Lee CEO, Seth Dillon."
