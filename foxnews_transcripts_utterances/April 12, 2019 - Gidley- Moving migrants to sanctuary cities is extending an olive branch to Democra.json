California certainly is always saying, oh, we want more people. And they want more people in their sanctuary cities. Well, we'll give them more people. We can give a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply. And let's see if they're so happy. They say we have open arms. They always say they have open arms. Let's see if they have open arms.

It is increasing on pace for over one million this year. And Democrats' only solution to this is to say, let's make everything that's illegal legal. It's completely ridiculous. And so, the president said, listen, I understand where you are, you're not lifting a finger to help protect American families at all. You say you want open borders, Democrats. You say that illegal aliens have a right to be here, regardless of the cost. So, you need work with us, our administration, and come up with a way that we can transport illegal aliens, that are going to be released anyway based on Democrat policies, into your communities and your districts and your states. That's the way it needs to be done. Democrats say they want them in those cities and sanctuary cities which are set up as sanctuaries for illegal aliens. They say they want it, the president said, fine, we'll put your money where your mouth is, we're going to send them to your districts, tell us when and where to deliver them and we'd do just that."

And I had suggested earlier and I continue to, well, what's particularly cruel about it? I mean, it's only cruel if you view illegal immigration as a burden. Am I reading this wrong?

At the very least, you should have characterized it as an olive branch, too much work with the Democrats. You say Democrats that you want all of these illegal aliens to come into this country unchecked. We have to release them based on the laws you put on the books and that you won't change. So, that's fine. Logically, we would just work with you, because along the southern border, Dan -- San Antonio, San Diego, El Paso, Yuma -- we continue to release people into the same communities. It's a burden. The folks that don't work for government, the private organizations, are telling us we are overtaxed, we can't do enough from our charities to protect or help any of these people. We've got to put them in other places across the country. The logical landing spot for so many of these illegal aliens are the sanctuary cities that Democrats say they love, and they say they want these people to come into the country, illegally and unlawfully. And they should go to those places and we're just asking Democrats, we're here to help you out. Where do you want them? And we're happy to take them there."

Anything at all you can put out for our audience?"

      "utterance": "Absolutely not. I've heard no particular plan at all from Democrats. Listen, they're choosing to stand with hundreds of thousands of people who pour into this country illegally and unlawfully as opposed to hundreds of millions of American citizens. They cannot and will not address this issue at all. I guess it's just political because Donald Trump is in the White House and they think they can get these people in the country and then get them to vote for them one day. But the fact is, we see human smuggling, child smuggling, human trafficking, the drug cartels, they control the southern border. The situation is so dire and so sad, and Democrats won't lift a finger to work with the White House to protect our people in the American communities, but also to stop this horrific practice of using children to come into this country illegally. We've actually arrested, or busted up several child smuggling rings in which they use the same child multiple times to send them back to, you know, El Salvador, and Honduras, and Guatemala, to come back up, they use them multiple times. It's such a tragic circumstance down there and Democrats won't do anything to stop it at all. Everything they're doing incentivizes more of this bad, illegal behavior. And for the life of me, I can't understand why they won't do a thing to work with this White House, to protect American communities. Their only solution is to let everyone come in here, not have a southern border, release them into your communities, into your schools, and into your neighborhoods. It's unacceptable."

It's a terrible ruling.

And I've been surrounded by those families my whole life. What the New York Democrat legislature did today was spit on the people, the finest one- half of 1 percent, who wear that uniform and enter combat. There's over 300,000 Gold Star families in Fort Drum, New York. That's my home. I take offense that they're attacking the military, especially the Gold Star families, but Gold Start families, my home, the people that live in New York, children go to school in New York, spouses work in New York, go overseas and pay the ultimate sacrifice and die for this country. And New York state won't take care of them like they take care of illegal aliens? Illegal aliens got 10 times more tuition assistance than Gold Star families.

It's one of the reasons why, now, 75 percent of the people presenting our family units. That's way up from what we've seen previously. And so, when we look at the crisis on the border, 3,000 people apprehended a day, that's just the ones we're catching, far more that we don't catch. It's a consequence of our policies to create these enticements. What we really need to do is crack down on sanctuary cities, institute an E-Verify system, and build the wall. I think under this president, we have a historic opportunity to finally secure the border, but it sure would be nice if Democrats today believe the very same things that they believe in the ‘90s, that illegal immigration was a security threat to our country and we had to have borders to be a country. Let's go back to that sense, we can argue then about what to do with the people who are here illegally.

I think it's very important that Attorney General Barr has said that he's going to look at the genesis of this investigation and he's going to be looking at whether or not things were improper, because as we know from what has been made public, here we have Hillary Clinton paid, and Democrat National Committee paid opposition research that was placed into the FISA court to get warrants to be able to undertake surveillance which, of course, is spying."

The Mueller probe, the big question I think that's getting left out of everybody's, you know, conversation on this, when did Mueller know exactly that this collusion was a hoax?

And he certainly knew a year ago from today. So why the American public had to go through this agonizing investigation that to some extent debilitated and deterred the President's efforts to advance policy decisions, why it - Mueller sat on at least that part of it, the no-collusion part is really bewildering and confounding. And - then it was commissioned by Hillary Clinton, the dossiers, what it's all about. And it was advanced by two nefarious characters, Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson. Steele was fired for lying, and he's gone into hiding. Simpson invoked the Fifth Amendment and has clammed up.

That is what children do. And I fight against all the time, as we all do, the efforts to infantilize women, especially women of color. And Representative Omar, in this process, seems to be infantilizing herself. This refusal to take responsibility to, in fact, demand that other Democrats take this approach in her dismissal of that, that speaks to her belief.

And she should take seriously that she has shocked the conscience of this nation, and if everyone in the western world who knows what that attack was and what it has led to. So this is her responsibility. And of course, in the process, the Democrats have to deal with what this means as well.

      "utterance": "Welcome back to this “Hannity Special: Justice in America.” I'm Dan Bongino in for Sean. Big stories broke all week with huge implications for our justice system. One-time media darling and CNN star Michael Avenatti got hit with a 36-count federal indictment. If he's found guilty, that could put him behind bars for up to 335 years. There's also accused hate- crime hoax perpetrator, Jussie Smollett, whose case is reportedly going to be reviewed by the Cook County Inspector General. And there is the ongoing saga of the college admissions scam, a fraudulent test taker has plead guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges. Meanwhile, former Full House star, Lori Loughlin, is said to be freaking out about possibly going to the big house and what that would do to her daughters. Joining us now to talk about these blockbuster legal cases, attorney Rebecca Rose Woodland, trial attorney Mark Eiglarsh, and civil rights attorney Daryl Parks. Rebecca, I'll go to you first. This case with the varsity blues, Lori Loughlin college admission scandal has everybody's attention. What I find fascinating as a former federal agent is why is Lori Loughlin doing not taking the plea? Is her lawyer not telling her? Please, take the plea. You're dead to rights on this."

      "utterance": "I can't imagine. As you well know because you've sat in the room with so many perpetrators, I can't imagine anyone isn't begging her to take the plea. Felicity Huffman, she took the plea. She admitted the guilt. She said I'm sorry, I apologize to students who my children took the place of. I mean, she has been very gracious in light of the fact of accepting the guilty plea, accepting being guilty. In this case, I don't know what's happening. There is wire evidence. There is information. There is recordings - recordings of her sending money. There's information of her sending the money to the charity--"

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOODLAND",
      "utterance": "--the hoax charity. I mean, this is very clear cut from what we understand. There is not really any coming to an innocent verdict from a court of law. It's not going to happen."

    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "I don't get it. I don't - and Mark -- I don't get it either. Mark, given your legal expertise and your experience at trial, I know you've probably had clients who thought they knew better than you and finally you talk sense into them. Do you have any explanation for why Aunt Becky - and again, everybody is innocent until proven guilty. I get that. They're allegations. But the allegations were serious, and at least the publicly released evidence is pretty overwhelming. Am I missing something here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "I'm going to say that her lawyers are hopefully advising her correctly, but she lives in an ulterior kind of universe, right, one that would cause her to do this type of activity, allegedly. And I, if I was representing her, would go to the closest footlocker, get the best pair of running shoes and have a run to the prosecutor's office, begging for some type of resolution, short of another indictment, which she's now facing because she failed to run to the government's office and beg for leniency."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "Right. Mark, I mean, you know prosecutors are just human beings like everyone else. They must know at this point. They must see this as being spiteful. I mean, I'm not suggesting anyone is acting unethically, but the evidence is overwhelming that something happened here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "And you know what? They also see, by the way. They see the footage on TV of her not walking into court, but her signing autographs, waving like she's on the catwalk, smiling and taking it all in. it was the worst PR I've ever seen. I don't get it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "Daryl, your opinion on this. Again, the evidence in the case, the innocent until proven guilty, we get it. But I think this case is so fascinating, a lot of people know Aunt Becky from Full House. But what possible motive would she have for holding out? Is it just ignorance of the federal judicial system, how it's going to work? I mean, what advice would you give to her at this point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DARYL PARKS, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, without question, she didn't serve herself well without - she should have plead early in the case. And her delaying, given the reason she gave for the delay, really wouldn't well serve for her. So I think I agree wholeheartedly she needs to go and try to get this case resolved with the federal prosecutors ASAP in Massachusetts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. On the Jussie Smollett case, this is another puzzling one for me. Again, an overwhelming amount of evidence that he was not attacked with MAGA hat wearing bleach carriers at 2 o'clock in the morning coming from subway. And instead of just taking the loss and coming out publicly and getting good legal advice, and this might be the bad legal advice, (inaudible) saying that \"What does he do?\" Right? He comes out and he doubles down, and he threatens them, the prosecutor and everyone else, for defaming him. Am I missing something on this? This is another case of horrible advice?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOODLAND",
      "utterance": "Clearly, no attorney would possibly advise Jussie to do any of this, to say any of this. Any attorney, with any law school experience, any legal experience, you could be out one year--"

Now, today, we have the head prosecutor saying - she welcomes an inspector and a report for investigating her prosecution. OK, let's see what happens now because now the drama continues. Now, it's not only Jussie being difficult, it's the Police Department being out of lot of money, over $100,000. I mean, this is - this--"

    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "Just quickly because I got to run. Any chance that this $130,000 - Mark, I got 10 seconds. Any chance the city gets its $130,000 back from - I'll take you and Daryl, quick - from Smollett."
