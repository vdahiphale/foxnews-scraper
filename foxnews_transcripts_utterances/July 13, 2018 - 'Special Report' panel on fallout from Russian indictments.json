    {
      "speaker": "TUMULTY",
      "utterance": "That is not surprising, but I don't know that that is anything more than election year posturing. One thing though that I think everyone should keep their eye on is the fact if Russia did this before they are likely to be trying to do it again. And I would like to see what kind of guarantees the president can come out of this meeting with that this is not going to happen this year in these midterm elections, because I have got to tell you, Congress has been pretty much asleep at the switch in hardening our own election defenses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Right. A lot of bickering but not a lot of action in terms of the folks behind us on Capitol Hill there. There's been some question about whether President Trump would be tough with the Russians. Check this out."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We have been extremely tough on Russia, including the fact that when the prime minister called when they had a horrible thing happen right here, very close by, we expelled how many people, 60. And $34 billion more was raised since I became president in NATO. That means that the other 28 countries have put in $34 billion more into NATO. Do you think Putin is happy about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Certainly presidents Trump and Putin are charming, but you expect some tough talk in that summit, Matthew?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "I think so. I think the president and his team recognize that a year ago when President Trump met with President Putin, they arranged a cease-fire in south western Syria, a cease-fire that was broken by the Syrian government aided by the Russian government last month. So I think that goes a long way to telling us how much trust we should put in Russian promises, which is not much."

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "It really is true that Russians are bad people. But that is not sufficient for a foreign policy. We really need to think through what we want to have, how we want to work with them, particularly respecting --"

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Bad government. Let's not blast all the people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "They're bad guys. But that's not sufficient. You need to actually have a goal and you need to give them a reason to work with us, particularly if we want to accomplish things in Syria, in Ukraine, in the war on terror, in nuclear disarmament. We need to give them a reason to work with us and just try and rebuild a little bit of trust of which there's almost none right now."

    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "Keep your objectives low, trade, maybe an extension of START with Russian compliance on the INF treaty which they have been in violation of now for over a year, and maybe you have a deal."

      "speaker": "TUMULTY",
      "utterance": "It will also be, I think, the outcome of this meeting is going to be very important especially after all of the drama of this week and kind of reassuring our allies, too, there is a strategy, because right now, I think the president comes out of this European trip having left a lot of our closest allies very, very concerned about this meeting.
