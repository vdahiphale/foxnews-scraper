      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight”. Here is a quick Civics lesson, what is politics? Well, politics is a system that allows people who violently disagree with each other to reach compromise without shedding blood. It's worked well for a long time in this country, but when one side decides it is no longer willing to compromise, that system breaks down. Without compromise, you no longer have politics. Instead, have you an especially fanatical form of religious belief. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } ISIS for example, is not a political organization. Its leaders reject accommodation of any kind. Its leaders assume that everything they do has the approval of a higher power. They are good people. They know that. They know their beliefs are not simply correct, they are the only possible beliefs. Anyone who disagrees with them is by definition immoral. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So a system like that does not allow for the possibility that good people might be mistaken once in a while or reach different conclusions sincerely. People with different opinions are, again by definition, bad people. In fact, may not be people at all, they might be subhuman. They must be converted to the faith or crushed and eliminated. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is not an American way of looking at the world and yet, suddenly, it's everywhere, and unfortunately, it now defines parts of the modern Democratic Party. Joe Biden didn't know this. Biden has been in Democratic politics all of his life. But he has taken the last couple of years off. He has been flying around the world getting rich by giving high price speeches. By the time Biden decided he wanted to run for President yet again, his party had changed completely, but nobody had told him. So he made the mistake just the other day of saying this about Mike Pence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "\"He is he a decent guy,\" Biden said of Pence. That's an old fashioned way to talk. That's how people in Washington - political Washington used to talk about each other. It was one way that they reminded themselves that politics maybe important, but it's not everything. Every political opponent is also on some level, anyway, a human being and a fellow American. Our common humanity is stronger than our political differences. That was the assumption that they had and have had at least since the Civil War, and by the way, it has to be the assumption that all of us have if we are going to live together in the same country. Cynthia Nixon disagrees with this. Nixon is a former actor. She is now a political extremist. She spends a lot of time on Twitter yelling at people. When she saw what Biden said about Pence, she was enraged. Cynthia Nixon disagrees with Mike Pence's views on gay rights questions. Therefore she knows Pence cannot be a decent person. It's just not possible. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She told Joe Biden this on Twitter. Joe Biden had no choice but to agree with her, \"You are right, Cynthia,\" Biden wrote back. There is nothing decent about being anti-LBGTQ rights and that includes the Vice President. People use to say that Joe Biden was a decent guy, too. But in the modern Democratic Party, there are no decent guys anymore, there are only people who are with the program and apostates who deviate from it. Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabberd suddenly is in the latter category. How did that happen? By the same measure, Gabberd is a staunch progressive. But she does hold heterodox opinions on foreign policy. Instead of agreeing with Bill Kristol's foreign policy, she still believes what many progressives used to believe, she wants to keep the U.S. out of pointless foreign conflicts and instead focus on domestic concerns. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And for having that opinion, she has almost been expelled from her own party.

In a closed door meeting after the vote, the Democrats who joined with Republicans on that were reportedly denounced by Party Leadership for their racism. The party's new ideological enforcer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez warned that Democrats who help Republicans in any way would go on a quote, \"list\" and would have primary challenges next time they ran.

So I want to make clear for the third time, you are opposed to the growing racial segregation in this country, correct?",

I have biracial children, and I have one black child who is adopted and we went on with our lives. Was there problems along the way? Of course you run into that as time went on. My husband did file an EOC lawsuit against a company who did discriminate against him. He eventually got the job with the company and worked for them the next 20 years.

And it has just gotten so out of hand, and I have a granddaughter now who I call a PONEC, a person of not enough color and she is going to be running into these kinds of things because now she is too white and not black enough. So I have just seen this over time. Well, Meet Up came along and kept sending me advertisements saying, you could join this group, you can join that group. And I am going, but these are all black only groups or people of color only groups or African-American groups. And then I found out there were hundreds of these on the internet across our country. And this is a direct violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it Meet Up is a multi-million-dollar business. They made, I think what? $40 million last year? $50 million? And they rent store fronts, essentially in their internet building. They rent these store fronts with meet up groups.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight”. Here is a quick Civics lesson, what is politics? Well, politics is a system that allows people who violently disagree with each other to reach compromise without shedding blood. It's worked well for a long time in this country, but when one side decides it is no longer willing to compromise, that system breaks down. Without compromise, you no longer have politics. Instead, have you an especially fanatical form of religious belief. ISIS for example, is not a political organization. Its leaders reject accommodation of any kind. Its leaders assume that everything they do has the approval of a higher power. They are good people. They know that. They know their beliefs are not simply correct, they are the only possible beliefs. Anyone who disagrees with them is by definition immoral. So a system like that does not allow for the possibility that good people might be mistaken once in a while or reach different conclusions sincerely. People with different opinions are, again by definition, bad people. In fact, may not be people at all, they might be subhuman. They must be converted to the faith or crushed and eliminated. This is not an American way of looking at the world and yet, suddenly, it's everywhere, and unfortunately, it now defines parts of the modern Democratic Party. Joe Biden didn't know this. Biden has been in Democratic politics all of his life. But he has taken the last couple of years off. He has been flying around the world getting rich by giving high price speeches. By the time Biden decided he wanted to run for President yet again, his party had changed completely, but nobody had told him. So he made the mistake just the other day of saying this about Mike Pence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "The fact of the matter is, it was followed on by a guy who is a decent guy, our Vice President, who stood before this group of allies and leaders and said, \"I'm here on behalf of President Trump.\" There was dead silence, dead silence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"He is he a decent guy,\" Biden said of Pence. That's an old fashioned way to talk. That's how people in Washington - political Washington used to talk about each other. It was one way that they reminded themselves that politics maybe important, but it's not everything. Every political opponent is also on some level, anyway, a human being and a fellow American. Our common humanity is stronger than our political differences. That was the assumption that they had and have had at least since the Civil War, and by the way, it has to be the assumption that all of us have if we are going to live together in the same country. Cynthia Nixon disagrees with this. Nixon is a former actor. She is now a political extremist. She spends a lot of time on Twitter yelling at people. When she saw what Biden said about Pence, she was enraged. Cynthia Nixon disagrees with Mike Pence's views on gay rights questions. Therefore she knows Pence cannot be a decent person. It's just not possible. She told Joe Biden this on Twitter. Joe Biden had no choice but to agree with her, \"You are right, Cynthia,\" Biden wrote back. There is nothing decent about being anti-LBGTQ rights and that includes the Vice President. People use to say that Joe Biden was a decent guy, too. But in the modern Democratic Party, there are no decent guys anymore, there are only people who are with the program and apostates who deviate from it. Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabberd suddenly is in the latter category. How did that happen? By the same measure, Gabberd is a staunch progressive. But she does hold heterodox opinions on foreign policy. Instead of agreeing with Bill Kristol's foreign policy, she still believes what many progressives used to believe, she wants to keep the U.S. out of pointless foreign conflicts and instead focus on domestic concerns. And for having that opinion, she has almost been expelled from her own party. Watch."

On Wednesday, for example, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to add an amendment to a universal background checks bill in the house. That amendment would require reporting a gun buyers to I.C.E. if that buyer is an illegal alien, a group that is not allowed to buy guns in the United States. In a closed door meeting after the vote, the Democrats who joined with Republicans on that were reportedly denounced by Party Leadership for their racism. The party's new ideological enforcer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez warned that Democrats who help Republicans in any way would go on a quote, \"list\" and would have primary challenges next time they ran. So that's what extremism looks like. The enemy is 100 percent wrong and we are 100 percent right always. They are going to hell and we are saved."

So what we have to do is people in their own district have to do what their constituents sit them there to do. If you are from a red state or if you are someone like me who is a pro-gun, pro- life fiscally conservative Democrat, then maybe AOC isn't the candidate for you. But we have to leave space for all those things to breathe. And let's not act as if Republicans weren't doing exactly this in 2010 and 2012 when they said that Obamacare was worse than slavery where you have people saying to Obama, \"You lie,\" in the Chamber of the House of Representatives. So what we need to do is tamp down the rhetoric on the extremes. The normal every day Americans, the people who just want clean air, clean water, a job, and good education for their children do not care about this crap on the political extremes. All they want is for people to come together and find a compromise. We could have had a compromise on immigration and border security. But the Freedom Caucus and Mark Meadows blocked that in 2013.

That member of Congress yelled at Obama when Obama said, \"Illegal aliens will never get government healthcare.\" The new government healthcare plan, Democrats now support, over 100 co-sponsors gives government healthcare to illegal aliens and so does Obamacare.

Democrats also are promoting a bill to take over healthcare, it's called the Medicare for All bill. It has over 100 co-sponsors in the House. That's a lot if you want perspective. The bill among other things would ban private health insurance, so to paraphrase President Obama, if you like your plan you definitely will not be able to keep your plan. The projected price tag for this, well no one really knows. Here is one estimate - $32 trillion over the next decade. But cost is no object as they often tell us.

He said that companies like Google are playing quote, \"a leadership role\" in American politics. He bragged that the company got a support of mass immigration on to a CPAC panel and that person argued in support of Google's agenda. It shows a lot about big tech's attitude toward the country. They are in control. Elections, parties, democracy -- just a hindrance to their control. So we told you a lot on this show about the potential dangers of big tech.

Self-driving cars and trucks are being tested on the highways right now and we need to evolve.\" We need to actually start pushing the way we think of economic progress to include how our families are doing, how our children are doing, and things that would actually matter to the American people because GDP is going to lead us off a cliff.

As we are sitting here together, the labor force participation rate in the United States is 63.2%. The same level as Ecuador and Costa Rica, and if anyone thinks that's where America ought to be, I mean, that number is even going to be further challenged when all of this technology comes online.

NYPD has now issued an officer safety alert, an internal bulletin saying that MS-13 gang members are planning on carrying out attacks on off duty police officers near their homes. In fact, the truly frightening part for officers and their families is that the alert reportedly states that gang members are conducting reconnaissance of police officers' private homes. A former FBI agent told CBS 2 New York, quote, 'They are going above and beyond what any other gang does and the scary part is that we already know that they legitimately carry out threats and are extremely violent.\" The warning goes on to advice police officers who live on Long Island to take extra precaution and change up their routines whenever possible. The gang's reign of terror is well documented by a series of brutal and bloody attacks in Queens, Nassau and Suffolk counties in New York and authorities note, the gang is notorious for murder, drugs, child prostitution and racketeering. MS-13 is made up mostly of Salvadoran illegal immigrants. The gang started in Los Angeles and has now spread to most major American cities. In recent years, the gang has spread like wildfire across Long Island. In fact, their tactics and techniques are so brutal that MS-13 members are often recruited as enforcers for major Mexican drug cartels -- Tucker."

      "utterance": "Unbelievable. Trace Gallagher, thanks very much. Well, murderous gang members are not the only problem here in New York City. There is rampant corruption, too. Here's one shocking example. The mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio's wife, her name is Chirlane McCray oversees a massive mental health project. It's called Thrive NYC, yet somehow Thrive NYC failed to properly keep track of $850 million in funds. They don't know where the money is. Seth Barron is an Associate Editor at \"City Journal.\" He pays close attention to New York City for us and he joins us tonight. Seth, $850 million, what does it mean they can't account for it? SETH BARRON, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, \"CITY JOURNAL\": Well, a billion here, a billion there. Soon you've got real money. Look, this is $250 million a year program and it was ill-conceived from the beginning. Thrive NYC is a mental wellness program. Chirlane McCray's pet project is to get everyone into therapy, get everybody who is sad or lonely or a little anxious to get them treatment. So she devised this program. It got hundreds of millions, close to a billion dollars in funding and it trains people in how to observe your neighbors and see if they are sad or not and teaches to you engage with them in conversation. There is a lot of advertising. They set up a phone bank where you can call if you are feeling sad."

The group she put online was completely fake. She was making an important and too often, too seldom made point, segregation is coming back to this country, horrifyingly, in guise of racial safe spaces. It is a point her critics seemed determined to miss and misrepresent of course because they are dishonest. Pat Brown joins us tonight to speak directly. Pat, thanks very much for coming on.

And then things were getting better and in 1979, I married a black man. I never thought twice about it and then I had children. I have biracial children, and I have one black child who is adopted and we went on with our lives. Was there problems along the way? Of course you run into that as time went on. My husband did file an EOC lawsuit against a company who did discriminate against him. He eventually got the job with the company and worked for them the next 20 years. There were little incidents here and there, but I raised my children to love everybody, to respect everybody and to judge them by their character."

But then, over the last decade, I have noticed things turning around where we are now seeing things through a racial lens where groups at this point, whites in time are being called oppressors and if you are not white, you are a marginalized person. And it has just gotten so out of hand, and I have a granddaughter now who I call a PONEC, a person of not enough color and she is going to be running into these kinds of things because now she is too white and not black enough. So I have just seen this over time. Well, Meet Up came along and kept sending me advertisements saying, you could join this group, you can join that group. And I am going, but these are all black only groups or people of color only groups or African-American groups. And then I found out there were hundreds of these on the internet across our country. And this is a direct violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it Meet Up is a multi-million-dollar business. They made, I think what? $40 million last year? $50 million? And they rent store fronts, essentially in their internet building. They rent these store fronts with meet up groups. People pay for them and in turn, if you have a Meet Up group, you can charge membership fees like a gym, you can charge for special events like a dance club. You can charge for lessons like salsa lesson."
