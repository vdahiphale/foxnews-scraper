And now all of a sudden, they are like talking about he should be removed.

So, I actually think that people can do their jobs in a nonpartisan way regardless of who they have actually supported or have given money to. If it becomes such an issue, then they want to hire a couple of pro-Trump lawyers. I actually think that's fine. I guess if you want, but it's unfortunate that an independent investigation that should be pure from all of that is basically getting tarnished. I think that what is setting it up to be is that building it up so much so that Democrats then can say, oh, look, we told you all along that there was collusion.

Juan, if the former FBI director says that there is no collusion and there is no obstruction of justice, then what exactly is Mueller investigating, that is one. And not only is he hiring three out of the five lawyers now, he is bringing democratic donors to the tune of $50,000 or something like that. You know, they are maxing out to Hillary, they're maxing out to Obama, they're maxing out to the DNC, it's not just a donation here, donation there. One of these people represented Hillary Clinton's Foundation. Same woman represented Hillary Clinton during her email investigation defense. You know, some of these things, one of the other lawyers that they just hired is representing or represented the guy that smashed Hillary Clinton's iPhone with a hammer. The IT guy. So, you have that. And in the other hand, you have the relationship between Mueller and Comey. And I think that's a new information that is starting to come out. They worked together for over a decade, they were close friends of the Department of Justice and the FBI, they were, quote-unquote, \"joined at the hip.\" It was a mentor protege situation, so if Mueller is going to come in and look at the dinner between Trump and Comey, and his good close friend is the star witness, or potentially the target, can he be impartial?

They certainly feel better. And I think you hit on an important point about Jeff Sessions playing not just defense, but really going on offense and saying I'm sick and tired of this. Don't question my integrity. Frankly, what took so long? We have not heard people around this president really speaking out in that way. Part of it is that others have not really testified up there. James Comey has had his chance. The president's inner circle hasn't really gotten their chance to push back. This idea of a war room being created around the White House never really materialized. So there's been a vacuum, and what it has been filled by? It's been filled by the president and his tweets. So maybe now, Sessions will be a turning point where they say, hey, this is the playbook.

First of all, with Jeff Sessions, yes, the fact of the matter is, this is somebody who got out there and showed that maybe it's been either fake news or a fake narrative at least, this idea that he and the president are at each other's throats. Yes, they all but confirmed a few days back that Jeff Sessions offered to resign some weeks back before the president's foreign trip because he believed that the president was really frustrated that he recused himself and that opened the door to a special counsel being named. But I think you're right, that based on his performance today, Jeff Sessions did not look like somebody who was uncomfortable. He did not look like someone who was at odds with his president. If anything, he didn't just stand up for himself, he stood up for the commander-in-chief and this entire ad administration. So that narrative out there seems maybe somewhat ridiculous, number one. And number two, I think look, look what the president was doing. I mentioned he was in Milwaukee talking about jobs this afternoon and evening.

And that bill is headed to the president's desk by next week. In addition to that, the president met with GOP senators. He talked to them about the health care bill. He's pressing them. Apparently he said it was mean. He wants them to fix it. But that bill is actually on its way in there expecting a vote in the Senate before the 4th of July. They're moving forward on Afghan troop levels. Apparently, the president is going to allow General Mattis to make a decision.

On the other hand, you mentioned health care, yes, he shows with this launch, with the senators here are the White House that maybe things are getting back on track, but that comment about will House bills is kind of mean, you have to fix it. That's a gift to Democrats.

Seriously, why doesn't Ruffalo accelerate diversity by rejecting roles and allow people of color to replace him? This guy has been in like 70 movies. Ruffalo's own selfish desire to saturate the marketplace makes him an obstacle for diversity. He's racist. In fact, all of those roles were opportunities for gays, lesbians, men and women of color that he took for himself. His callous appropriation of such roles deprive others of meaningful work. He's a selfish old white male and Hollywood should stop hiring him. I would circulate a petition, but unlike Marko, I have a life. Shouldn't he live by the sword die by the sword, Dana?",

There's no way he would then try to undermine our constitutional Republic in broad daylight with a foreign power. It doesn't make sense. Today was just another nail in the coffin for the Russia hoax. No one landed any punches on the sky. It was a lot of innuendo, not a lot of facts, and the reason they keep on shifting targets is because they keep witting. First, they start with Trump. And then they go to Jared Kushner, then they tried to make a thing out of Comey. Now, it's Sessions and they keep coming up empty handed. The facts are, this guy, Jeff Sessions, did not meet as a surrogate with any Russian officials, he meant as a senator twice last year. Once was just after a speech he gave at the RNC in Cleveland with a lot of other people and then once he had a meeting in his office and it was about the Ukraine invasion."

So, I like Tom Cotton's point. And I like the fact that the Attorney General Sessions was able to stand up for himself. Enough is enough already. He was aggressive, good for him. If people making, you know, false and serious allegations against you, impugning your character and integrity when you have served with, you know, patriotism for 35 years of this country, he deserves better and so do the American people. I'm glad he stood up for himself, he answer the questions, he's not a afraid of the truth, and he was honest when he said that we know that the Russians try to interfere, but that does not mean that there was any collusion. And believe me, there are even Democrats saying, there is no evidence of this. There is no there there. So are they going to conjure up something, because we had Comey testified too.

And then, the question was, why did Sessions recused himself if the President hadn't encouraged him to do so, and it was unclear. And then we heard from the former FBI Director Jim Comey that there was more, there was more that somehow not publicly known about Sessions' involvement with the Russians that led him to recuse himself.

It would just be interesting if the Democrats could just loosen up on their delayed release convulsion. Because that's what this is. It is a delayed released convulsion since the election.

And now all of a sudden, they are like talking about he should be removed. And it is slightly ironic for Republicans to be complaining that there were donations to Democrats given that President Trump himself and his family have donated to Democrats over the years many times. So, I actually think that people can do their jobs in a nonpartisan way regardless of who they have actually supported or have given money to. If it becomes such an issue, then they want to hire a couple of pro-Trump lawyers. I actually think that's fine. I guess if you want, but it's unfortunate that an independent investigation that should be pure from all of that is basically getting tarnished. I think that what is setting it up to be is that building it up so much so that Democrats then can say, oh, look, we told you all along that there was collusion. Or Republicans can say, oh, actually we told you all along that there was no collusion and it's a good thing Bob Mueller went our way. I don't like any of that, I think that people can actually be professional in Washington."

But I mean, I think a lot of people in the beginning thought Mueller was the right pick, and an alarm bells starts going off. And it's a few things. Juan, if the former FBI director says that there is no collusion and there is no obstruction of justice, then what exactly is Mueller investigating, that is one. And not only is he hiring three out of the five lawyers now, he is bringing democratic donors to the tune of $50,000 or something like that. You know, they are maxing out to Hillary, they're maxing out to Obama, they're maxing out to the DNC, it's not just a donation here, donation there. One of these people represented Hillary Clinton's Foundation. Same woman represented Hillary Clinton during her email investigation defense. You know, some of these things, one of the other lawyers that they just hired is representing or represented the guy that smashed Hillary Clinton's iPhone with a hammer. The IT guy. So, you have that. And in the other hand, you have the relationship between Mueller and Comey. And I think that's a new information that is starting to come out. They worked together for over a decade, they were close friends of the Department of Justice and the FBI, they were, quote-unquote, \"joined at the hip.\" It was a mentor protege situation, so if Mueller is going to come in and look at the dinner between Trump and Comey, and his good close friend is the star witness, or potentially the target, can he be impartial? So, those are the kind of questions people are asking, and like we've said before, a lot of times these special prosecutors are like a hammer in search of a nail."

She is still in the wilderness trying to figure out like what she's going to do. She just started a PAC and they've all moved on. So once an administration moves on its hard I guess to go back.

He's very queasy so he's getting queasy. And he actually listened to her, and then he did say that in front of the congressional hearing. Also, the secret meeting with bill Clinton on the tarmac -- also very troubling. Apparently they were talking about their grandchildren for 45 minutes. They must have a lot of grandchildren, who knows. And then there was a news report from Circa News from Sara Carter, and this is new information that Comey went to Loretta Lynch with communications, evidence, conversation between two top Democrats that were kind of alluding to the fact that if the Hillary Clinton investigation ever rose to a certain level, Loretta Lynch would spike it.

Overstepping his bounds and saying that there should be intent, that there is no intent and that the statute that requires intent which is totally erroneous."

But remember during that time and you had talked about as a lawyer that it was weird, like the investigator usually just turns over the document, the file and lets the DOJ decide.

So on Air Force One on the way back here to the White House, Sarah Huckabee Sanders briefed reporters and basically said that the president believes that Jeff Sessions did a \"very good job.\" She went on to say something else that's kind of interesting that you were just talking about with Bob Mueller, that at this point the president has no intention to fire the special counselor. You can bet Democrats are going to jump on the words no intention to say that the door is still open. But clearly, the White House trying to temp down any speculation that was put out there over the last 24 hours about the possibility of the president firing Robert Mueller. They certainly know here the political firestorm that was created by him firing James Comey, Juan."

One, do you think this is now going to be the blueprint for defending against the Russian attacks because Sessions was very, very strong in his rebuttal and kind of like, you know, how dare you question my integrity. And at the same time, are we getting to the point where the White House feels it's turned the page on this? In fact, a lot of very serious consequential testimony in the last two weeks, are they turning the page on this point or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, they haven't turned the page with Robert Mueller in business and really just staffing up as you were talking about it a moment ago. This is around for months or even years so you can't turn the page completely, but the advisor to the president that I have talked to in the last couple of hours believe that they're starting to turn the page, I guess you would say. They certainly feel better. And I think you hit on an important point about Jeff Sessions playing not just defense, but really going on offense and saying I'm sick and tired of this. Don't question my integrity. Frankly, what took so long? We have not heard people around this president really speaking out in that way. Part of it is that others have not really testified up there. James Comey has had his chance. The president's inner circle hasn't really gotten their chance to push back. This idea of a war room being created around the White House never really materialized. So there's been a vacuum, and what it has been filled by? It's been filled by the president and his tweets. So maybe now, Sessions will be a turning point where they say, hey, this is the playbook. Get out there and don't just play defense, get on offense."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "all right, don't worry. Don't be afraid Ed. So, it seems here now that this stabilized a little bit especially with the relationship between Attorney General Sessions and the president with Sessions performing I believe so well today in terms of being a bit, you know, defiant, being a bit almost like insulted by what he is being accused of and with good reasons given the fact that he has served this country so admirably. What do you think that the White House is thinking of in terms of next steps going from here? Maybe they don't need a war room to deal with the Russian situation if things are going to continue in this way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Two important points I think you hit on. First of all, with Jeff Sessions, yes, the fact of the matter is, this is somebody who got out there and showed that maybe it's been either fake news or a fake narrative at least, this idea that he and the president are at each other's throats. Yes, they all but confirmed a few days back that Jeff Sessions offered to resign some weeks back before the president's foreign trip because he believed that the president was really frustrated that he recused himself and that opened the door to a special counsel being named. But I think you're right, that based on his performance today, Jeff Sessions did not look like somebody who was uncomfortable. He did not look like someone who was at odds with his president. If anything, he didn't just stand up for himself, he stood up for the commander-in-chief and this entire ad administration. So that narrative out there seems maybe somewhat ridiculous, number one. And number two, I think look, look what the president was doing. I mentioned he was in Milwaukee talking about jobs this afternoon and evening. So, if they've got folks like Sessions playing defense and offense and the president getting back to what he was elected to do, they may have a playbook."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Oh no, maybe other way around. OK so, today the workforce and vocational training. You just talked about that. I wanted to ask if you could talk about things that happened that the president didn't exactly get a chance to talk about today but were important nonetheless. One, is that the House passed the Veterans Affairs Bill, which allows them to be able to fire people that are probably civil servants but they need to be fired so that they can start those VA reforms. And that bill is headed to the president's desk by next week. In addition to that, the president met with GOP senators. He talked to them about the health care bill. He's pressing them. Apparently he said it was mean. He wants them to fix it. But that bill is actually on its way in there expecting a vote in the Senate before the 4th of July. They're moving forward on Afghan troop levels. Apparently, the president is going to allow General Mattis to make a decision. So there are a lot of things that are happening while all of this is going on in the Senate Intelligence Committee."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, and you build on the Veterans Bill allowing the fire (ph) workers who should be fired with the fact that Secretary Shulkin has been pushing hard to modernize their system so, veterans actually get the benefits and the health care they need and this president can rightly say that he is out there innovating and doing some of those things he was elected to do. On the other hand, you mentioned health care, yes, he shows with this launch, with the senators here are the White House that maybe things are getting back on track, but that comment about will House bills is kind of mean, you have to fix it. That's a gift to Democrats. It's another self- inflicted wound perhaps for this administration because you have all these House Republicans as you know Dana, who went out on a limb to vote for that bill that the president celebrated in the Rose Garden and now he's saying it was mean. That's a campaign --"

I guess they know their lefty dribble can't compete so they smear other voices as evil to eliminate actual diversity of ideas. So, who are these hateful people that this networks is hiring? George Will. Nicole Wallace. Greta. Yes, real alt-right goons. If only Mark have the guts to focus on the violent fascists on his side. The scum who throw urine at young women at protests, who stab police horses, who demand days to celebrate racism -- that's your people Marko. Look, Mark's not that bright. So he masks his insecurities and social justice tantrums. But isn't it time to ask Hollywood to stop hiring white actors like him. Seriously, why doesn't Ruffalo accelerate diversity by rejecting roles and allow people of color to replace him? This guy has been in like 70 movies. Ruffalo's own selfish desire to saturate the marketplace makes him an obstacle for diversity. He's racist. In fact, all of those roles were opportunities for gays, lesbians, men and women of color that he took for himself. His callous appropriation of such roles deprive others of meaningful work. He's a selfish old white male and Hollywood should stop hiring him. I would circulate a petition, but unlike Marko, I have a life. Shouldn't he live by the sword die by the sword, Dana?"
