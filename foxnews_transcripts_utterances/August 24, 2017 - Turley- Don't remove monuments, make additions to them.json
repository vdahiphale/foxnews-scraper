People, anticipating that they are going to be skewered subjected to scorn as you described it, and then they say, oh, so we have to react preemptively and do something. And what it does is then it shuts down discussion. For example, that picture of the baby holding the flag, how is that racist? Is that nuts? That's a wonderful, happy picture. I don't care what race the child was. In fact, they had a subsequent picture of a child in a uniform that had a Nazi symbol on it, the Swastika, and I thought that's not cool. I didn't like that. I think that's negative. You don't want to put that out there. But nonetheless, what you see are people reacting because they fear the mob rule online. And the mob online, by the way, they just delight in putting down someone. It could be someone on the left putting down somebody -- someone on the right putting down their political opponent.

Taney ruled against the restriction of slavery in the Dred Scott case, no doubt a low point in our nation's history.

And he clearly played an important part in that, a noble part. But seven justices signed on to that opinion. And there are plenty of opinions throughout history that we now considered to be deeply wrong and troubling. You know, Buck V. Bell was a decision where Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of the most celebrated justices, said the citizens could be involuntarily, you know, operated on so that they could be sterilized so they could not have children. Lewis Brandeis signed on to that decision; tested the majority of justices. Are we going to start to take statues down, memorials, when we object to those decisions? We had the decision in Bowers V. Hardwick which was 5-4, which said that homosexuality could be criminalized. Today, many of us view that decision. I did at the time as deeply wrong and troubling. Sandra Day O'Connor signed off on that opinion. Do we take those memorials down? So, the question is: are we really going to remove those monuments to justices who ruled in ways that we now find quite troubling, or are we going to add to those memorials information like what's being done at the Jefferson Memorial that there will be an addition placed on Jefferson Memorial saying that he was a slave owner.

But that doesn't mean he wasn't a racist. He did not join the south. He stayed with the north during the Civil War. He was viewed, however, by Abraham Lincoln as one of his opponents. And all that creates this mix of history that's not easily divided between heroes and villains, but we can learn a lot from it. You know, this statue was there for 150 years.

But in the aggregate as they try to transfer decision making out of domestic American politics and into the international sphere where American views are -- let's face it, much more pro-liberty than most of the rest of the world, we would be in trouble. But I have to say also, you know, this idea is creeping into the American debate, too. And the New York Times is writing a story on this very issue we're talking about by two reporters contains the following sentence. This is a news report says, the American constitutions offers robust protections for racist speech, while some European countries explicitly prohibits pro- Nazi rhetoric. So there's a provision in the constitution, I think it's called the first amendment that says congress shall make no law against explicitly racist speech. What kind of mentality? In the New York Times protected by enumerable first amendment decisions, and indeed one where Justice Brennan called for uninhibited robust, wide open debate. The same word robust. The New York Times acting as if this is a perfectly legitimate criticism. It's really amazing.",

The boy speaks fluent English, he says he's an American, and more shockingly he claims to be the son of a U.S. soldier. The child goes on to threaten President Trump and the American homeland. We should note that Fox has not been able to independently verify these claims that are made in this video, but we'll continue to look into it. Also, when congress goes back into session in September, Democratic senator, Robert Menendez, probably will not be there. His criminal trial starts the very next day and the judge today turned down his request to postpone the case until after the legislative session. He faces 14 counts of bribery and conspiracy, including allegations that he did favors in exchange for gifts from a wealthy donor. If Senator Menendez is found guilty and if he were to be expelled from congress, it would of course shift the balance of power even more towards Republicans. Another story we will be watching very closely as that develops. So also developing tonight, a huge controversy. As the White House releases new details on the plan to ban trans-gender people from serving in the military. Fox News has confirm the guidelines that would include banning new enlistments, look at the deployability of current trans-gender troops, and whether they should remain in service, and stipulate that money will no longer be spent on medical or surgical treatments towards that end.

If the guys want to stand, they can stand. I think that maybe they can choose a better platform to state their beliefs. One thing I've learned about this, just here -- people here in America that they're followers. There's some that you may ask about different topics, but they'll say what they heard, not what they actually know, even with the Kaepernick situation. He goes on to say that he believes that Kaepernick is not a good enough quarterback for the teams to take him on with all the distractions that he brings to the table. These days, speaking your mind and not going along with the herd can get you shamed by the masses on social media, but LeSean McCoy says he doesn't care.

And what it does is then it shuts down discussion. For example, that picture of the baby holding the flag, how is that racist? Is that nuts? That's a wonderful, happy picture. I don't care what race the child was. In fact, they had a subsequent picture of a child in a uniform that had a Nazi symbol on it, the Swastika, and I thought that's not cool. I didn't like that. I think that's negative. You don't want to put that out there. But nonetheless, what you see are people reacting because they fear the mob rule online.

      "utterance": "Very important discussion that we're going to continue here on \"The Story.\" So, this is part of it as well: the nation, obviously, in a state of heightened sensitivity in the wake of Charlottesville. But it's prompting the question of where does all of this stop? Just a couple of days ago in a dead of night, a statue of Chief Justice Roger Taney was removed from the Maryland State House. Taney ruled against the restriction of slavery in the Dred Scott case, no doubt a low point in our nation's history. Our next guest says his removal opens the door to erase all kinds of historical figures that could, in effect, sanitize our history. Jonathan Turley is a constitutional law attorney and he joins me now. Jonathan, wrote an excellent piece today as well on this. Jonathan, tell us why you think Taney deserves sort of a broader understanding here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that the broader understanding has to be how we evaluate history. The Dred Scott decision is a markup on the entire nation as is Civil War, as is slavery. And he clearly played an important part in that, a noble part. But seven justices signed on to that opinion. And there are plenty of opinions throughout history that we now considered to be deeply wrong and troubling. You know, Buck V. Bell was a decision where Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of the most celebrated justices, said the citizens could be involuntarily, you know, operated on so that they could be sterilized so they could not have children. Lewis Brandeis signed on to that decision; tested the majority of justices. Are we going to start to take statues down, memorials, when we object to those decisions? We had the decision in Bowers V. Hardwick which was 5-4, which said that homosexuality could be criminalized. Today, many of us view that decision. I did at the time as deeply wrong and troubling. Sandra Day O'Connor signed off on that opinion. Do we take those memorials down? So, the question is: are we really going to remove those monuments to justices who ruled in ways that we now find quite troubling, or are we going to add to those memorials information like what's being done at the Jefferson Memorial that there will be an addition placed on Jefferson Memorial saying that he was a slave owner. And that is one of his great contradictions of Thomas Jefferson."

And you know, you think about the Taney decision and Dred Scott, which as you point out, when you read the language of it as, you know, it's obviously from a very different era, and it's reprehensible in its approach to the people of this country. However, you also pointed out that we probably wouldn't have had the Civil War without the Dred Scott decision. So, these are the moments in history that push forward the steps that bring us in our evolution to where we are."

      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. And Taney's words are deeply upsetting. Even at the time, there was a dissent in that case that redeemed the court to some degree. Taney actually viewed it as a state's rights issue. As did obviously, virtually, all the other justices on the court. He himself freed his slaves and gave pensions to the slaves that he inherited. But that doesn't mean he wasn't a racist. He did not join the south. He stayed with the north during the Civil War. He was viewed, however, by Abraham Lincoln as one of his opponents. And all that creates this mix of history that's not easily divided between heroes and villains, but we can learn a lot from it. You know, this statue was there for 150 years. I actually think that kids could learn a lot more by going to the statue, and saying this is someone who wrote something that was terribly wrong."

I'm pegging up tonight that we're going to see President Trump, in the days ahead, taking on a much bigger role in publicly selling tax reform -- something we did not see with healthcare. That is due in part to the fact that Hope Hicks is now the acting communications director, someone very senior who can get the president more involved. I'm told Hick has now taken former Fox News Contributor, Tony Sayegh, a Top Treasury Department official, indeed held him to the White House to focus on building public support for tax reform. But remember, the president is often his own communications chief. And his attacks on Republicans send the message to his base, he's not part of the swamp, but it complicates the push for his agenda. The president charging Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, is weak on the border. That could hurt a vulnerable Republican in the mid-terms. So, the president is betting his warm words for Dr. Kelli Ward, could give him a more reliable conservative vote if she beats Flake in a primary. Today, the president had another tweet. He said, \"The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that after hearing repeal and replace for seven years, he failed. That should never have happened.\" Now, while McConnell tried to patch things up today, Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not seem as accommodating when a reporter asked about Republican Bob Corker recently charging the president has not shown the stability to govern."

Who knows what's going to happen with the tax reform thing. And then, you got Paul Ryan saying, well, we really can't do anything except a C.R. or just get the debt ceiling done.

But the lesson of the ObamaCare fiasco and legislative fiasco that's happening up there is that 52 Republicans is not enough to get 50 votes. Because what happens is when you only have 52 Republicans, then John McCain becomes the swing vote who can deny Donald Trump his agenda. So, the solution to that not to go after Republicans who are reliable votes. Jeff Flake votes with Donald Trump 94 percent of the time. I understand why Donald Trump doesn't like him, that he said nasty things about, wrote a book about him, all the rest of them. But he's a 94 percent reliable vote. Dean Heller, a 90 percent reliable vote voted with him. So, you need to add to our majority, not reduce it. So, we should not be spending our energy, time, and money. And Donald Trump should not be spending energy, time, and money attacking Republicans who vote with him. He should be going out and going after the Democrats who vote against him and who are vulnerable and spending his energy trying to increase his majority so that John McCain isn't the guy who decides whether we repeal ObamaCare."

And a few senators, not all of them but a few of them, have undercut that agenda, most notably Jeff Flake. Jeff Flake didn't even vote for Donald Trump. He has profited off a book writing about Donald Trump. So, I think the question I ask, Mark and many others is: why wouldn't we support a candidate that really has the will of the people behind her? And that's Kelli Ward. So, I look at it where the Republican Senate Leadership has a real opportunity to really be the open party, open tent party. We should invite people that really are in line with the people's will, and really this Trump coalition agenda. This isn't your old Republican Party in 2004.

But the challenge to Donald Trump's presidency is not just keeping his base, which is vitally important to his success and to Republican's success but to grow that base. Donald Trump needs to get his popularity up into the 40s and not into 50s, because that's going to help him win Democratic votes on legislation, it's going to help him keep all the Republicans in his column on legislation. His problem is much more than he hasn't been able to deliver on major legislation. And that's what he was elected to do, to change Washington, and that reforms. His personality and his style, people will accept it, just not accept, get angry about it, and love it, but it's the legislation that he'll ultimately be measured by.

This is a news report says, the American constitutions offers robust protections for racist speech, while some European countries explicitly prohibits pro- Nazi rhetoric. So there's a provision in the constitution, I think it's called the first amendment that says congress shall make no law against explicitly racist speech. What kind of mentality? In the New York Times protected by enumerable first amendment decisions, and indeed one where Justice Brennan called for uninhibited robust, wide open debate. The same word robust. The New York Times acting as if this is a perfectly legitimate criticism. It's really amazing."

Plus, the White House revealing new guidelines in its effort to ban trans-gender people from serving in our military. Up next, we'll be joined by two veterans on both sides of this emotional and complicated debate. Lieutenant General Jerry Boykin and army ranger veteran Robin Biro, when we come back."

      "utterance": "So some short stories here as we come back. U.S. intelligence agencies are looking to identify this young boy who was featured in a new ISIS propaganda video. The boy speaks fluent English, he says he's an American, and more shockingly he claims to be the son of a U.S. soldier. The child goes on to threaten President Trump and the American homeland. We should note that Fox has not been able to independently verify these claims that are made in this video, but we'll continue to look into it. Also, when congress goes back into session in September, Democratic senator, Robert Menendez, probably will not be there. His criminal trial starts the very next day and the judge today turned down his request to postpone the case until after the legislative session. He faces 14 counts of bribery and conspiracy, including allegations that he did favors in exchange for gifts from a wealthy donor. If Senator Menendez is found guilty and if he were to be expelled from congress, it would of course shift the balance of power even more towards Republicans. Another story we will be watching very closely as that develops. So also developing tonight, a huge controversy. As the White House releases new details on the plan to ban trans-gender people from serving in the military. Fox News has confirm the guidelines that would include banning new enlistments, look at the deployability of current trans-gender troops, and whether they should remain in service, and stipulate that money will no longer be spent on medical or surgical treatments towards that end. Joining me now, Lieutenant General Jerry Boykin who served as deputy undersecretary of defense for President George W. Bush. Also with us tonight, Robin Biro, the first openly gay army ranger who served two tours in Afghanistan. Gentlemen, thank you both for being here tonight."

He talked to a group of us veterans, many of which were retired flag officers back in October of last year, and this was one of the issues that came up and He pledged to make this decision. So following through on this decision was very bold because he took on the entire LGBT community in doing so, but he did it because it's a common sense decision to make and we applaud him for doing this."

Remember, this is about the fundamental mission of the military, which is to win wars. If it enhances that ability, then it's a good thing to do. But you can't make a case that this enhances readiness in any way. Therefore we should not do this."

      "speaker": "ROBIN BIRO, ARMY RANGER",
      "utterance": "I sure can. I can make it a very easy argument against that, because I will tell you that over 90 percent of high school graduates, when they graduate high school, they do not meet the minimum standards to get in to our military. We're having significant problems right now with recruiting and retentions of soldiers. I'll tell you this, we were just directed last year that we could no longer chapter out soldiers who didn't meet the body fat and A.P. physical fitness test requirements. We're starting to retain those, but yet you want to tell me, with all due respect, general, that now -- that this doesn't affect readiness when we have openly trans-genders soldiers who will meet every physical criteria and are deployable, but yet, you want to push them out. That affects readiness. And I will tell you this too, we are looking at losing an asset of $2.2 billion at a minimum because we have 6,500 openly trans-gender members serving right now who we're going to throw out, and it cost us right now on average about $340,000 per soldier to educate those."

I think your data is very, very skeptical. I don't believe that you are correct. Ninety percent of the young people graduating from high school today, it is a large percentage but it's not 90 percent. But, let me say this. I'm very passionate about this for a couple reasons. One of which is because we've used our military as a test bed for nothing but social experiments and it's time to stop and focus on readiness. The second thing is, we don't recruit people and shouldn't recruit people with any kind of physical or mental illness that would require them to go through some kind of surgery or some kind of major rehabilitation program."

The military -- that is completely garbage with all due respect. And these people are willing to fight and die serving our country. I want to point out this is one that I proudly serve with, Sergeant Shane Ortega. There is not a finer soldier that I want guarding my back right now, but this soldier is one being faced with getting put out of our military. That's a shame."

So a big court decision was handed down in the case of an evangelical Christian football coach who was fired for praying with his players. In an exclusive interview, Coach Joe Kennedy, who we spoke with when this case broke is back here tonight now that the court has ruled against him. His next step in the major religious liberty fight right after this."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So a big setback tonight for an evangelical Christian football coach fighting for his right to pray on the field. It started in 2015, when a Seattle-area high school told Coach Joe Kennedy to stop praying on the 50 yard line after the game. He refused. They fired him. He sued to get his job back, and accused the school of violating his free speech. But the ninth circuit court, which is known for its record of liberal decisions, does not agree and they wrote this, when Kennedy kneeled and prayed while in view of students and parents, he spoke as a public employee, not as a private citizen, and his speech therefore was constitutionally unprotected. Here now in an exclusive interview for The Story is Coach Kennedy and his attorney Hiram Sasser from the First Liberty Institute. Thank you very much to both of you for being here tonight. Coach Kennedy, let me start with you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Do you understand the argument that they're making? Where they say, you know, you're in a public school logo jacket as the football coach there. It's public property. And that they feel that you are not just representing yourself, you're representing the school, and therefore that crosses the line between public and church. Church and state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY",
      "utterance": "Right. Yeah, well, I really tried to meet with the school halfway with everything. They didn't want me to pray with the kids and I said, you know, that's fine. Your rules. But I'm not going to give up my beliefs just because it made somebody feel uncomfortable. So I agreed that I would just do it by myself on the 50 alone the way it first started out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Why is have to be on the 50? Because I know they said to you that you could go out after when everyone is gone, you can go out there, or you could go to a separate spot and pray after the game. So why did that solution not feel right to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY",
      "utterance": "Well, even before I accepted the coaching job, I made a covenant with God that, hey, I'm just going to give you the glory on the 50 yard line. And I don't know where I got it. If I saw the Seattle Seahawks or one of the other football teams doing it, but I said, hey, that's where we fought the battle so I'm going to give you thanks right there for what those young men just did."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But there's a huge crowd that gathered around him. And the students come out and the parents come out. We showed the picture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "We could show it again. So they're saying that others might feel that they might be looked upon negatively by the coach if they don't join in. That's part of their argument. Why does that not hold water with you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SASSER",
      "utterance": "Because he was fired for praying, actually, by himself. It was two games later. He was by himself. He kneeled down and he prayed for 15 seconds by himself, silently, and that's why he was fired. It's totally outrageous. The argument that the ninth circuit has adopted is basically that if you do anything that's religious at all that someone else can see, that somehow you're working on behalf of the state and you're conveying a religious message. So that means you can't wear a Yakama, you can't make the sign of a cross. God forbid, you pray for a player who's injured at a time during the game. So a lot of people can learn more as the case goes on at firstliberty.org. But the most important thing is that Coach Kennedy complied with all of their initial requests, he prayed by himself. And one of the great things about this that we really enjoyed is President Trump's support in this case. He tweeted out his support. And we look forward to receiving additional support from a lot of people who we've heard are outraged by this decision."

      "utterance": "So speaking of football, here's a story that echoes the one that we opened the show with tonight. Buffalo Bill running back LeSean McCoy said this about the suggestion that Colin Kaepernick is being blackballed by the NFL for taking a knee during the anthem. Here's our quote of the night from LeSean. There's a lot going on with the whole Kaepernick situation. In this country, you can believe what you want. Freedom of speech. If the guys want to stand, they can stand. I think that maybe they can choose a better platform to state their beliefs. One thing I've learned about this, just here -- people here in America that they're followers. There's some that you may ask about different topics, but they'll say what they heard, not what they actually know, even with the Kaepernick situation. He goes on to say that he believes that Kaepernick is not a good enough quarterback for the teams to take him on with all the distractions that he brings to the table. These days, speaking your mind and not going along with the herd can get you shamed by the masses on social media, but LeSean McCoy says he doesn't care. That's \"The Story.\" We'll see you back here tomorrow night at 7. Tucker Carlson is up next. END Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
