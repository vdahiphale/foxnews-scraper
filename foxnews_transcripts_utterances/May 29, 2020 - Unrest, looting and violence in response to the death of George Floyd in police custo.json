And, look, I understand a lot of people are watching what's happening in Minneapolis and they're very shocked, some of them are very older. And some of the looting and the violence that we are seeing. However, I think that this conversation goes a little bit deeper. That this trauma that you see in the African-American community are being expressed right now it's not as a result of police brutality. It's a result for year over year racial injustice and discrimination. And I see what was similar to Freddie Gray, is also a shot you can see George Floyd somewhat in a similar position that Freddie Gray was when he when he died seven days later after he was put in the back of that van. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think charges that have come from your district attorney are pretty much to pacify the protesters and pacify those of us that are wanting to see a stiffer charges.

It was a reporter that actually had to ask him that, and he knew that charge of third-degree murder was a slap in their face. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Tonight, a Friday evening release of the phone call transcripts between the then incoming National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

These were the calls that were so concerning, they required unmasking to find out who it was who was saying these things, which now that we see them, would have been fairly obvious. And Comey, of course, voiced his concern in the January 5th Oval Office meeting with the President, even suggesting that the contents of these calls merited withholding information sharing from the incoming administration with regards to Russia.

And for four years, there was no impediment to that. There were no obstacles. Nobody was pushing back on it, despite the fact that they were predatory in what they were doing, and the Trump administration came in, and I suspect Xi is surprised by the election like many in America were, and even more surprised when the Trump administration identifies China as the number one strategic threat to the United States, and treats them, they are not just a competitor anymore and someone we should cooperate with, they're absolutely a predator, economically, politically, and militarily, and we have to be willing to confront them and push back on them with our allies.

In the case of social media companies such as, Face -- Twitter, Facebook, and Google, they wanted that power. They wanted the model of say AT&T, where they say we're just a neutral platform for people to communicate ideas, we don't make judgments about what's being communicated. We don't assess or analyze of the truth or falsity of it. That is why they got immunity, because unlike Fox News or The Intercept, where I work where we make editorial judgments, if we say something false, we can be sued.

Our country has a long history of oppression towards black people, have a long history of police officers and a culture of police officers that is just one that has not been very good.

And what's so sad right now is that you see overwhelmingly, when I talk to Americans across the country, when I talk to police officers across the country, everyone agrees this was a horrible thing. It was despicable. And so, you have something that should be so uniting, that should be bringing us all together, one America, one country, under one God, and we are divided.

And, look, I understand a lot of people are watching what's happening in Minneapolis and they're very shocked, some of them are very older. And some of the looting and the violence that we are seeing. However, I think that this conversation goes a little bit deeper. That this trauma that you see in the African-American community are being expressed right now it's not as a result of police brutality. It's a result for year over year racial injustice and discrimination. And I see what was similar to Freddie Gray, is also a shot you can see George Floyd somewhat in a similar position that Freddie Gray was when he when he died seven days later after he was put in the back of that van. I think charges that have come from your district attorney are pretty much to pacify the protesters and pacify those of us that are wanting to see a stiffer charges. Why? Because it took what four days or 72 hours. And he - and even during the press conference when he said he's been charged with murder and manslaughter, he did not say third-degree murder. It was a reporter that actually had to ask him that, and he knew that charge of third-degree murder was a slap in their face."

I mean, when we were at the state's attorney office in Baltimore City, maybe Marilyn Mosby the state attorney at that time, no, she did not get any conviction, but she at least was sincere in her efforts to take justice. She at least tried and she did not try to use the ignorance of people who do not know the law to her advantage. And he did this - and like he said, four days, Freddie Gray died April 19th. Charges did not get brought until May 1st, and the officers were not even indicted until may 21st. This is an incident to pacify people, and it's an insult. And pretty much it seems like, this is a way to sort of put this officer in protective custody, because we've seen protesters outside his home. And the other thing I want to mention is, some people are saying, oh, this is violence. This goes against what Martin Luther King says. Well, Martin Luther King also said that a riot is the language of the unheard.

And I think there's also wide agreement on what should happen with respect to bringing justice to not just that one officer, but we're looking at all of them. There's no disagreement there. But there also shouldn't be disagreement on what's happening with these riots and the injustice that is occurring against innocent people in Minneapolis because of this. And I'm a little confused that at some people that want to just brush right past that and make excuses for it. That's also not OK. We can live by a very clear system of justice in this country and we should and we should all unite around George Floyd's case. I think that's very clear. And we should also be able to say that that injustice does not justify further injustices against other people, like you said 130 businesses being destroyed, that there's no justification for that."

And if there wasn't a cell phone and people standing around him you, just have to wonder. Would we ever - we've never would have known about this. I guarantee it. And it is the anger that you are seeing in these protests is understandable when you look at some of these other cases and it makes you wonder these are the ones we know about. And I've always been - we want to support our law enforcement. We know that most of them have their hearts and their badges and their work in the right place. These are the people who reflect badly and they should be removed. I don't understand why someone who had the number of complaints against him that this officer had for prior crime scene behavior, why would he even still be on the force?"

The question is always do you attribute it to a systemic problem and that becomes much less clear. You have to use evidence if you're going to make that argument. But the anger for this is clearly justified. I mean the guy was killed and it's just - it's clearly justified. There's no disputing that. There's no disagreement there."

I mean, when he says please let me stand it just - it's incredible that these four people could be standing around him and not one of them nudges the other and goes, \"look, let's get the guy up.\" I mean, it's just unbelievable when you watch what happens. It makes you question things about humanity. And, again, these - I believe, I couldn't live with the world if I didn't believe that these people were the exception. But this is - it's just so inexcusable. I want to ask you about the larger picture, because you write about heroism, about leadership in your new book. And I think back to - I was looking back today at video of the 1967 summer riots and it said, they happened because of unemployment, because of poverty, because manufacturing had moved out of areas and jobs had left those areas. And I think well, here we are again potentially in the summer of 2020 post pandemic."

I'm finding outrage where there shouldn't be any. In certain situations, there - again outrage is justifiable and this is one of them. Whether it's people losing their jobs or whether it's or whether it's the George Floyd, there is justifiable outrage. But you're always still accountable for your actions. You're always still accountable for the story that you put forth into the future. We have to remember that as Americans we cannot forget that basic fact, otherwise, we will decay into cultural chaos. And that's largely why I wrote the book, because we do need to stiffen our spines and come together and agree on these very basic things and agree on what kind of justice should be done for George Floyd, but also what shouldn't be done, and that's really what it's about. And we have to - we're going to have to come together if we're going to get past this pandemic and this economic crisis."

We just got our hands on the official transcripts folks of Michael Flynn's phone calls with the Russian Ambassador Kislyak. So much grew out of these particular phone calls, yet nobody had their hands on what actually was said. K.T. McFarland has just gotten to see them herself for the first time. She's infuriated. She joins me next."

      "utterance": "All right everybody. Tonight, a Friday evening release of the phone call transcripts between the then incoming National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. These were at the heart of then FBI Director James Comey's concerns about Russian collusion. These were the calls that were so concerning, they required unmasking to find out who it was who was saying these things, which now that we see them, would have been fairly obvious. And Comey, of course, voiced his concern in the January 5th Oval Office meeting with the President, even suggesting that the contents of these calls merited withholding information sharing from the incoming administration with regards to Russia. That advice was not taken, we should point out, by Susan Rice or President Obama. Here now K.T. McFarland who was Michael Flynn's deputy at the time, working very closely with him, who is now also seeing these phone calls verbatim for the first time. I would also point out that these supposedly hair raising phone calls required almost zero redactions. There is next to nothing that is even blacked out of this for intelligence purposes before they were released to everybody. K.T. what was your reaction when you got to look finally at what exactly was said between these two individuals?"

I talked to General Flynn before he had this phone call. I talked to him right afterwards. He told me what he was going to say. He told me what he said. This is exactly what's in the transcript. There was nothing wrong there. There was no quid pro quo. There was no special deal cut. And what it shows is that the Obama administration, by putting no sanctions on, just two weeks before Donald Trump was going to be sworn in as President of the United States, they wanted to give him a crisis. They wanted to present President Trump with a crisis on day one of his administration. They could have put these sanctions on weeks before, months before. They waited until right before the inauguration. And, you know, what were they all about - and then when there was nothing there, we didn't take the bait. Then they really got angry and they did the whole Russia collusion delusion Mueller investigation and so."

Here's Michael Flynn on December 23rd saying to Kislyak, \"You know, the strategic goal is stability in the Middle East. That's the strategic goal. And you know between you and I, and you know this and we know this, and you know between Washington and Moscow, we will not achieve stability in the Middle East without working with each other against this radical Islamist crowd.\" Controversial?"

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Make it reciprocal, don't make it - don't go further than you have to, because I don't want us to get into something that has to escalate tit for tat. Do you follow me Ambassador? And he says, \"I understand what you're saying. But you know we might appreciate - you might appreciate the sentiments that are raging in Moscow.\" So this is what he said after the sanctions were put in place and Russia was considering what they would do to retaliate."

He wasn't saying we're going to lift the sanctions the minute we get in or he wasn't saying let's cut a deal right now. He was just saying the obvious Let's not escalate this into a crisis. Let's not have a U.S.- Russia crisis on day one of the Trump administration. There's nothing wrong there. In fact, there's everything right. What would - what did - what were we supposed to say? Let's get into a real crisis, so on day one President Trump and Vladimir Putin can really do get out. Mike Flynn did exactly the right thing and there was never a deal struck. And when I was investigated, interrogated by the Mueller investigation, that's what they kept coming back to. The fact that the Russians didn't retaliate, that we didn't have a crisis, they therefore assumed President Trump had done something wrong. Nobody did anything wrong. The only thing wrong was done by the people who perpetrated this hoax on the American public for three long years. Destroyed people's lives, tried to hobble the Trump presidency right from the beginning."

Kislyak says, \"And I just wanted to tell you that we found that these actions have targeted not only against Russia, but also against the President elect.\" Meaning, all of the investigation that went on beforehand and the suspicions that were that were surrounding all of this. What's your - what are you taking away from that?"

He had - Putin had far more to lose by perpetuating a bad relationship with the United States. I think Putin played us all like a violin. He pretended they were going to retaliate, and they didn't retaliate. And what did Putin accomplish by that? He looked like a great statesman. He managed to embarrass President Obama, calling him petty kitchen diplomacy. And he got brownie points with President Trump. But it all came apart because of the Russia collusion delusion. They decided, the outgoing Obama administration, the intelligence officials and a lot of people in the media who were cooperating with them, they were going to find a scandal no matter what kind of a scandal it was. You know, when Stalin was President of the - Head of the Soviet Union, his super-secret Spy Chief Beria, he said to Stalin. You find me the man I'll find you the crime. And that's what this entire Russia hoax was all about. They wanted to find a crime, whatever crime would do, even when they had to make up."

And then the same police department whose main job is to provide civil order and enforce laws absolutely abandons their responsibility to protect people's lives and protect their property. And not only that, they drive off in the dead of night because there is some pressure by youngsters in the neighborhood who are rioters and hooligans. I didn't see any AK-47s or automatic rifles or pistols, they were carrying things in their hands, to be sure, but it's certainly something that's well within the discipline of a police department to be able to enforce the laws. This is criminal behavior, and when you see what is happening in that precinct, to abandon that, is really outrageous behavior, and abdicating their responsibility. I think we are going to find out, unfortunately, a lot more about this police department, Martha, then we currently know, and I think, eventually, we are going to get some accountability from them. It's really a sad thing. I mean, why wasn't a curfew imposed after the first night? Why wasn't the police out there, you know, en masse, with the National Guard, making certain that things did not get out of hand? And by pulling back, they incentivize the rioters to commit actually more criminal behavior, and that's what we saw here. It's really something that is so unfortunate to see."

And I think for the American people to understand really what has taken place here, there is -- there is a clash of ideology and values between our two countries, but more important than that, because that has always existed. President Xi came into power in 2013 and he declared a new doctrine for China that we had never seen going back to Mao Zedong, and that is he fully intended to dominate the Indo-Pacific reason, the Asia-Pacific region in the sense, and also to replace the United States as a global leader in the world. And for four years, there was no impediment to that. There were no obstacles. Nobody was pushing back on it, despite the fact that they were predatory in what they were doing, and the Trump administration came in, and I suspect Xi is surprised by the election like many in America were, and even more surprised when the Trump administration identifies China as the number one strategic threat to the United States, and treats them, they are not just a competitor anymore and someone we should cooperate with, they're absolutely a predator, economically, politically, and militarily, and we have to be willing to confront them and push back on them with our allies. That was a major, major event for President Xi, and he has been adjusting to this ever since, and I think the Trump administration has been trying to get their sea legs straight during this time frame, as well. But now President Xi sees clear eyed that his ambitions are going to be stifled if he doesn't come out and really take a stand, and that is what he is doing here. It's in Hong Kong, which is the flash point in the front lines of this confrontation between the United States and China, to be sure. He has weaponized COVID-19."

Obviously, there is a lot of confusion in these kinds of scenes when there's protesting and rioting taking place, I certainly understand that it's not easy to be a police officer, but when you do put on the badge and are armed by the state, you have the obligation to uphold core, basic freedoms and rights, which certainly included freedom of the press. And in this case, the officers acted incredibly recklessly. You see there that the reporter is trying to be responsible, trying to be cooperative, and yet he just ended up under arrest while he was reporting. It was a really direct attack on a free press."

With regard to the other story that I want to get your thoughts on, is this battle between the president and Twitter over section 230, which is basically describes the liability factor for social media outlets, which obviously has been a moving target throughout all of the evolution of them. Here is what President Trump said about this this morning. \"Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies and propaganda being put out by China or the radical left Democrat Party,\" he writes. \"They have targeted Republicans, conservatives, and the President of United States.

The irony here is that usually when companies or governments censor speech, when they demand the right to decree what's true and false or move things based on their own arbitrary standards, it's because they seize that power appeared. In the case of social media companies such as, Face -- Twitter, Facebook, and Google, they wanted that power. They wanted the model of say AT&T, where they say we're just a neutral platform for people to communicate ideas, we don't make judgments about what's being communicated. We don't assess or analyze of the truth or falsity of it. That is why they got immunity, because unlike Fox News or The Intercept, where I work where we make editorial judgments, if we say something false, we can be sued. They didn't want to be sued, they said we're not making editorial judgments. The reason they've started to delete more aggressively, to censor and suppress, to declare things true and false, is because that obligation has been foisted upon them, largely by journalists --"

We told you moments ago about the CNN reporter who was arrested with his crew and then released in Minneapolis. We're not sure if there is a connection, but obviously, this is all -- the base of all of this is the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. So, my next guest, joining me now, as we take a look at all of this, is the former safety for the Minnesota Vikings, and he writes about all of what's going on today. He says, \"it's emotionally draining to write this often about unarmed black men losing their lives at the hands of evil individuals. It's even more draining to continue to watch polarization and identity politics being used to divide us following a brother or sister's tragic loss of life. This is definitely a war. I just hope we keep our eye on the actual enemy.\" Joining me now is Jack Brewer. Jack, thank you so much for being here tonight. Obviously, there is a lot unfolding as you and I are speaking. What do you mean when you say \"we have to keep our eye on the real enemy here?\""

      "utterance": "The enemy is evil. We live in a world now where, you know, Satan drives racism. Racism is evil. Racism is of the spirit. Racism, as we can all agree, it's not of the flesh, it's not something that we can necessarily see and touch. But to fight these battles, Martha, we've got to fight against spirit in a spiritual way, and that does not mean blaming it on President Trump, blaming it on the mayor, blaming it on the governor. We have to really do soul-searching right now, and it's going to take repentance. Our country has a long history of oppression towards black people, have a long history of police officers and a culture of police officers that is just one that has not been very good. And so, we have to address those things, and I think most Americans agree. And what's so sad right now is that you see overwhelmingly, when I talk to Americans across the country, when I talk to police officers across the country, everyone agrees this was a horrible thing. It was despicable. And so, you have something that should be so uniting, that should be bringing us all together, one America, one country, under one God, and we are divided. And the reason why we are divided is because we cannot get away from identity politics long enough to really address the enemy, address the sick and evil enemy of racism."

      "utterance": "And now it feels like the country is more divided than ever, and we do all share -- we all share an equal humanity, obviously. Anyone looks at these two individuals on the street and can see what is happening, that one person is lording his power over another person, and essentially strangling him to death. And you know, this we are watching now, Jack, you know, I don't know if you can see this monitor, but we are seeing police cars getting smashed, people throwing things through windows in Atlanta, Georgia, tonight as we speak. As you -- as you answer this. Unbelievable."

      "speaker": "BREWER",
      "utterance": "It's terrible, and you know, a place like Atlanta, where there is so much prosperity for African-Americans, they are so rich in history in a place like that, and to destroy your own land, that is fighting this physically, is fighting it in the flesh, and Martha, we've got to get away from that. I mean, just like yourself, you shouldn't feel like you can't stand up against the oppressions of racism and against those things, because you are a white woman. We can't make all white cops feel like they are evil. That's not right, because there's a lot of people -- they are men of God and women of God that are going out there fighting and scratching to protect and serve their communities. We can't let, you know, something that one or two percent of people are doing and let that just become the reality for the entire country. That's just not true. We all have to stand up against that, but in order to go after this oppression, we've got to lock arms and we've got to repent. We've got to really admit that we've had some issues and we've had some things that we have to get, get through, and I think, as a nation, we can come together and win this war, win this war against evil."
