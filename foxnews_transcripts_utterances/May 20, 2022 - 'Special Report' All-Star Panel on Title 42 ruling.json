What you have is a situation where Title 42 is a World War II law that was put in place to stop the spread of malaria and T.B. when people were coming from Europe at that time. And it's applied here even as CDC says we have vaccines, we have treatments. And what we're really doing, says the Biden administration lawyers, is illegally stopping people who are seeking asylum and have every right to seek asylum.
