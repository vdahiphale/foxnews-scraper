He then hired Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, a name that you have heard a lot of lately to investigate what was going on. Magnitsky was then thrown into a Russian prison.

There are lots of countries that are looking at the Putin Model, the Chinese model. Viktor Orban in Hungary has talked about how liberal Democratic capitalism may be has run its course. In Mexico they just elected a big populist demagogue guy. We look at what happened in Venezuela, which should be a cautionary tale. The rhetoric about how democracy and liberal democratic capitalism is fading in a lot, in many parts of the world these days and I do think that you can make the argument that some of that is happening in the United States too.

He then hired Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, a name that you have heard a lot of lately to investigate what was going on. Magnitsky was then thrown into a Russian prison. He died there after being beaten and denied medical care. Ever since then, Bill Browder has campaigned to punish Russia. And he says his efforts have made him Vladimir Putin's number-one foreign enemy. Bill Browder joins us now from an undisclosed location this evening. Bill, good evening once again to you.

It also has to do with some adoption rules, that's part of the larger picture of it. But they very much want that overturned, and he's obviously very angry with you.

The people that Vladimir Putin, wants to have interviewed by his Russian secret police are Mike McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia. Kyle Parker, a senior congressional staff member who wrote the Magnitsky Act. Bob Otto, a senior official in the State Department. And then, in addition to that, there are three special agents of the Department of Homeland Security who have had been conducting investigations into Russian money laundering in New York buying property. And so, the idea that the White House, the Donald Trump would be considering handing these people over, and me over to the Russians is just appalling, it's effectively treason to hand over patriotic people who've been trying to do the right thing.

The judge says that she has no ties to America and therefore she is a serious flight risk saying that she could hop into any Russian diplomatic vehicle and she would be out of their hands. So the prosecutors say that this 29-year-old allegedly offered to have sex with an unnamed individual in return for a job in the United States and that she gained access to an extensive network of U.S. persons to influence political activities in the United States by living with and at one point and none of the people in this picture are implicated in this so let's take them off the camera.

So where are they headed? Jonah Goldberg on that. And President Obama's return to the spotlight ahead. Plus, cleared of corruption and back on the campaign trail, but this time New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez may have some competition on his hands. His challenger is Republican Bob Hugin and he joins me next."

So less than four months until the 2018 midterms, I think it's about 100 days and the New Jersey Senate race is in a statistical dead heat according to a local poll and it's starting to get some attention because there's a real chance that the traditionally safe Democratic seat could possibly for the first time since 1972 possibly go red. So you've got two-term Senator Bob Menendez who was cleared this year of corruption charges. It was basically the jury in both cases, both trials did not reach a decision, they deadlocked. It's a tight race with Bob Hugin, a former drug company executive and CEO of Celgene. So Bob is here live in just a moment. But first, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor for more on this race. So this could potentially get interesting, Chris, which, you know, it doesn't usually happen in New Jersey."

This is one where you have a person who has money of his own and has a donor base that he can call on to help them out and he can become instantly viable essentially in this race. Menendez is badly damaged. He was not really cleared-cleared in the sense that prosecutors eventually said look, we are dropping what we're doing. They didn't say we think he's just peachy keen. What they said was we can't get there from here and we give up. And that's going to hang over him. And also resentment inside his party toward him for the way he did this. It would have been much better for him for Democrats to have stepped aside and let somebody without the baggage run. He's forcing it and now there is some division there."

The brand in New Jersey right now for Republican is bad so he has to be a different kind of Republican to fit in, in New Jersey, but it has worked in the past. Chris Christie, et cetera.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUGIN",
      "utterance": "Yes. Listen, as you said, I lived the American dream. I was born in Jersey City, raised in Union City. First of my family to go to college. Serve the Marine Corps, served my country. I went to a struggling company, six weeks of cash left and now one of the leading companies in the world fighting cancer. So we're going to make a difference here. And the other thing is, let's be clear. In Washington you never see bipartisanship. Senate ethics committee, Democrats and Republicans, Senator Menendez violated the law, abused the power of his office, disgraced the Senate, it's time for change. It fails."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUGIN",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the people of New Jersey are speaking. I go to all over. They realize that not only has he morally offended them and embarrass them, he's been in Washington for 25 years, 16 years with a Democratic president in New Jersey is dead last. We get the least back from any state in the country of the percentage of what we send and it's headed in the wrong direction. Its failed leadership. We are going to put New Jersey first."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "HUGIN",
      "utterance": "Listen, this race is Bob Menendez against Bob Hugin. I want everybody to come and support me as long as it's about New Jersey issues and the issues that we are fighting for, for all the people of New Jersey."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And what about Chris Christie, would you like him to campaign with you?"

      "speaker": "HUGIN",
      "utterance": "Again, I want anybody who believes in the values that I have from New Jersey. I'm listening to New Jerseyans. It's clear what they want. They want a more affordable state. We need to be supported better in Trenton and in Washington. And it's about Menendez versus Hugin."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I live in New Jersey, which, you know, I think maybe our viewers are aware of. You've got a lot of people who want to leave the state. They are getting taxed out of the state. A lot of businesses. So I would imagine that that's one of the areas that you are going to want to drive home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUGIN",
      "utterance": "Yes. Listen, it's a shame. You want to be able to have your children -- I'm lucky, I have three kids. We raised our kids in New Jersey. My daughter works at Giovanni Yogurt here in New York. Both my sons are officers in the Marine Corps. I want them to be able to come back to New Jersey but it's so unaffordable now people are planning their exit. We got to change. We've got to see the light at the end of the tunnel and say we are going to have Trenton and Washington focus on making New Jersey affordable again."

    {
      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think you're probably right that Barack Obama was, as the kids say, sub tweeting Donald Trump a little bit. You know, he didn't use his name but that people were supposed to take away that association. But it is worth pointing out that strongman politics is ascendant in large parts of the globe. There are lots of countries that are looking at the Putin Model, the Chinese model. Viktor Orban in Hungary has talked about how liberal Democratic capitalism may be has run its course. In Mexico they just elected a big populist demagogue guy. We look at what happened in Venezuela, which should be a cautionary tale. The rhetoric about how democracy and liberal democratic capitalism is fading in a lot, in many parts of the world these days and I do think that you can make the argument that some of that is happening in the United States too. I don't think that Donald Trump is a strongman. I do think he likes a lot of strong men, or says nice things about them, but that's a little different thing than saying that Donald Trump is a strongman."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

I mean, he talked about the rise of democracy, actually, and how the situation for most people has become better in the world in recent decades. He said now you've got -- he said, you know, when he was a kid you had about 60 democracies in the world. Now you have 100 and that this notion that the world is becoming a less great place to live is just simply not true when you look at the economies around the globe. Democracy is going around the globe. The decline in disease around the globe. That it actually is a much more optimistic picture than President Obama wants to paint."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "No. Look, I agree with that and you know, Steven Pinker makes a very similar argument to one of the ones that I make in my book. That, you know, in terms of human prosperity, this is the greatest moment to be alive in all of human history. We actually, right now in this moment are living in the greatest moment of poverty alleviation in the history of humanity. But at the same time, we don't teach people to be grateful for this. We don't teach people to be thankful for this. Instead, we get on the left and on certain parts of the right, the opposite of gratitude, which is resentment and entitlement."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I thought it was interesting when the president -- when President Obama was talking about strongman, you know, and I think about another way of looking at that is that a strongman, you know, some might make the argument, conservatives might make the argument, that the strongman is the government and that the government has grown and grown and grown and encroached on people's freedoms. We have encouraged more people to go into food stamps. We've expanded -- you know, now we are talking about guaranteed income in Chicago so that -- maybe it's not embodied in one human being, but that the government is a fearful strongman for many people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "I agree with that entirely. And I think that this is one of the ironies is when you hear from so many people on the sort of the Democratic left in America, they are constantly saying Donald Trump is a strongman, we don't need strongman. What we need is socialism, which is basically giving millions of bureaucrat's strongman powers over their lives. And I do think that one of the best arguments for Donald Trump's election was this idea that the government establishment, the globalist, whatever you want to call it, were having too much power over our lives and we needed someone to come in and smash all of that up. And to the extent the things that Donald Trump is doing to smash a lot of that stuff up I support a great deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, also when you look at the rise of Kim Jong-un, when you look at what happened with China over the course of the Obama years, the expansion into the South China Seas, the huge expansion of -- their, you know, trade -- their robbing of our intellectual property all of that. You look at Putin moving into Crimea, into Ukraine. All of that happened on President Obama's watch. So it's difficult to argue that the strongman has become more active since he left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "No. I think -- I think one of the reasons why though, that a lot of those things happen was in part because Barack Obama had a theory about how the world works that was in direct defiance of how the world actually works, and so he showed weakness to strongman around the world and strongman did what strongman do."

The changes are scheduled to take effect in 2024. Here is one person's interpretation of what it could potentially look like. According to Axios, \"I don't like this particular version it looks like a hockey helmet to me. You know how goalies paint their helmets. That's what it looks like.\" So here's what they said on Twitter. Russ Bourne says this. \"I think it should have been red, white, and blue to begin with.\" Eric Snyder disagrees. He says it must be left as it is. The original iconic colors the plane stands for freedom and that symbol is highly recognizable around the world. So here's tonight's quote from President George W. Bush on the last flight for Air Force One tail number 27,000 question."
