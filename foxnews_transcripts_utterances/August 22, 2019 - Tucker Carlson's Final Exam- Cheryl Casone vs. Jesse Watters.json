      "sentences": "Well, good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” For the past couple of years, we've reported in some detail -- some horrifying detail -- on how the professional left has totally transformed the City of San Francisco from this country's most beautiful city, our Cape Town, into a cesspool of filth, homelessness and drug addiction. That is not an exaggeration. There are no more junkies in San Francisco than there are high school students. And so you won't be surprised when the city has also become threatening and dangerous. The rate of property crime in San Francisco is the highest of any big city in America. More than five dozen cars are smashed and robbed every single day of the year. It's a disaster. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But don't worry, the city's leaders have a plan to respond to this. And of course, it's not more cops or better enforcement of the law. That would be bigoted. Instead, the City of San Francisco has decided to ban words that suggests San Francisco has a crime problem. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If people aren't allowed to talk about crime, maybe they won't notice crime exists. That's the thinking. So last month, the City's Board of Supervisors decreed that there'll be no more convicted felons in San Francisco. Going forward, ex-cons are to be called, quote, \"justice involved individuals.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, as it happens, the people that committed crimes against are also quote, \"justice involved individuals.\" So in other words, victim and criminal are now morally indistinguishable. That's on purpose. This is woke equality. But there's a problem. Back in Washington, leaders of the Democratic Party apparently haven't gotten the memo on this, and some are still using the term felon, which is the real \"F\" word. So you might want to send the kids from the room as we play the following clip. We warn you, it's ugly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Now, you could laugh this off, but San Francisco, after all are where all the crazy things happen. But thanks for the implications. Language makes thought possible.

You know, the argument is that if you call someone a felon, it's a pejorative term. It's a value judgment. And it might make you predisposed to think of him in a bad way. So instead, you say, he is a person impacted by the criminal justice system. In fact, you're the person impacted by the criminal justice system because the felons keep leading them down to misdemeanors, so they never get put in jail.

I recommend anyone watching, if you're in a Spanish singles bar and you say, \"Hey, do you want to come back to my hotel room and play Progenitor A and Progenitor B tonight?\" Well, okay, but only if I can be Progenitor B this time. The fact is, the abolition of mother and father is actually quite a big thing. And the left is clever about this, they put for big prizes. You know, one of the reasons I despair about the political right is because we get all impressed because, well, yes, we're trying to get a cut in capital gains tax through Congress. Meanwhile, they're abolishing the sexes. They're abolishing the sexes. That's incredible.",

More cases of the disease continue to pop up. Since 2018 in Los Angeles, there have been 150 cases of typhus and 27 typhus outbreaks. A report from a forum in California surveyed 23 private pest control companies, all of them say rat reports have spiked in the last year.

LA Mayor, Eric Garcetti works at City Hall, but has not declared a state of emergency to handle the homelessness. LA City Council Member Joe Buscaino met with the Mayor this week begging him to declare a state of emergency in the city telling us quote, \"These efforts are advancing at an excruciatingly slow pace with bureaucratic roadblocks and red tape at every step of the way.

It's widely known information, but it's not often acknowledged in public. America, it turns out is becoming a low trust society. American adults, 65 or older group in a very different country and their views reflect it, only 29 percent of this group, the older American group believe that quote, \"most people can't be trusted.\" Just 39 percent think that most people are looking to take advantage of them. And 48 percent agree with the statement that quote \"most of the time people just look out for themselves.\" Contrast those attitudes with the attitudes of young Americans. They're radically different. Sixty percent of young people in this country say that most people can't be trusted; 71 percent say that people are trying to take advantage of them; 73 percent think that most people can't be trusted most of the time. It's hard to blame young people for thinking this way. The point of this is not to blame them. They've learned it. As children, they were told that education was the key to success. Now, many have tens of thousands in college loan debt, they'll be paying that off for years or decades. They learned nothing. It gave them no advantage at all. Meanwhile, they grow up in a world where they took it for granted that Facebook would spy on them to make a profit. While companies like Uber employ them and give them no benefits and call it the gig economy and pretend they ought to be grateful to work there. The highest job they can aspire to is wearing some matching t-shirt in some spare, depressing retail Apple store -- that's considered cool. These are kids who spent their whole lives under leaders who are happy to send Americans to die in pointless wars in the Middle East, but barely think about stopping the nation's deadliest drug epidemic. We're having their entire country bought up by private equity then sold off piecemeal to the Chinese. These are kids who exists in a social environment where friends will denounce them over a single disagreement rather than try to live with differing views. They become less trusting because their daily lives tell them that trust isn't worth it. It's for suckers. So this is not a small thing. It has massive implications. Social trust is a critical component of happiness. No country can remain happy without social trust. All humans crave communities where they feel at home where they can trust the people around them. If Americans can't trust each other, and instead hate and suspect each other, there are only two end games, and neither one of them is good. This is something that we should worry about and address directly and try to make better because everything hangs in the balance. Well, Democrats like to tell you that global warming is an existential threat, probably overstated at this point. That doesn't mean there aren't deadly threats out there that could be existential -- super volcanoes and asteroids for example, existential threats. Should we be worried about them?

And they are, in fact, kind of terrifying. For example, the Yellowstone super volcano. A \"New York Times\" op-ed warns that if the volcano explodes, it will obliterate Wyoming and cause years of winter. That's existential. And then there's the giant asteroid threat. Big ones, like the ones that killed the dinosaurs or the ones that Bruce Willis blew up in the movie \"Armageddon.\" We will have three close encounters with giant space rocks in just the next week. And then, in case you're not rattled, yet, The Big One, the earthquake that could shear the entire West Coast of America off and send it into the sea, by which many have mixed feelings, but apparently it's real. Scientists are warning about it constantly. So of these threats, which is the most existential? Which is the gravest? Are they real? Brett Larson has looked into this for us.

Our power went out off and on for a day or two. We were fine. We had candles. We had some canned food. We had some non- perishable food. We were able to get by until things came back to normal. Scientists are always telling us about asteroids that are going to hit us. The volcano you mentioned in Yellowstone Park. These are real things. These are things that could potentially be a problem. But they were talking about this volcano that erupts -- it's erupted three times in 2.1 million years. And the last time it did it was 640,000 years ago. Well, we weren't around 640,000 years ago. And if it's once every 700,000 years, I'm guessing none of us are going to be around in 60,000 years or so.

That is not an exaggeration. There are no more junkies in San Francisco than there are high school students. And so you won't be surprised when the city has also become threatening and dangerous. The rate of property crime in San Francisco is the highest of any big city in America. More than five dozen cars are smashed and robbed every single day of the year. It's a disaster. But don't worry, the city's leaders have a plan to respond to this. And of course, it's not more cops or better enforcement of the law. That would be bigoted. Instead, the City of San Francisco has decided to ban words that suggests San Francisco has a crime problem. If people aren't allowed to talk about crime, maybe they won't notice crime exists. That's the thinking. So last month, the City's Board of Supervisors decreed that there'll be no more convicted felons in San Francisco. Going forward, ex-cons are to be called, quote, \"justice involved individuals.\" Well, as it happens, the people that committed crimes against are also quote, \"justice involved individuals.\" So in other words, victim and criminal are now morally indistinguishable. That's on purpose. This is woke equality. But there's a problem. Back in Washington, leaders of the Democratic Party apparently haven't gotten the memo on this, and some are still using the term felon, which is the real \"F\" word. So you might want to send the kids from the room as we play the following clip. We warn you, it's ugly."

The whole category has disappeared. Criminals under 18 are now referred to as quote, \"young people impacted by the juvenile justice system,\" as if the system and not the kid committed the crime, which is what the left in fact believes. It's your fault, not theirs. Check your privilege, Middle America. Drug addicts, meanwhile, in San Francisco are now called \"people with the history of substance use,\" use not abuse. Get it? Heroin addicts are now the same as insulin dependent diabetics, both use substances. You can't call one better than the other. They're both exactly the same. Now, you could laugh this off, but San Francisco, after all are where all the crazy things happen. But thanks for the implications. Language makes thought possible. When the words disappear, so does our ability to think about the ideas the words represent; when they prevent you from saying the obvious, over time, it becomes impossible to see the obvious. And that's exactly of course, why they do it. Those who control your words, control your mind. We're joined now by a man whose mind is controlled by no one, but himself, author and columnist, Mark Steyn. So Mark, there are no more drug abusers. There are no more juvenile delinquents. There are no more felons."

You know, the argument is that if you call someone a felon, it's a pejorative term. It's a value judgment. And it might make you predisposed to think of him in a bad way. So instead, you say, he is a person impacted by the criminal justice system. In fact, you're the person impacted by the criminal justice system because the felons keep leading them down to misdemeanors, so they never get put in jail. So they are out on the street to rob and burgle you again. But plain speaking, oddly enough, is only reserved for particular targets. For example, you can still call someone a serial gang rapists if he happens to be the next Republican nominee for the Supreme Court. But other than that, we have this immense cleansing of language. And they're playing for big game here. I noticed about a decade ago, the government of Spain, removed the words \"mother\" and \"father\" from its birth certificates and replaced them by Progenitor A and Progenitor B. I recommend anyone watching, if you're in a Spanish singles bar and you say, \"Hey, do you want to come back to my hotel room and play Progenitor A and Progenitor B tonight?\" Well, okay, but only if I can be Progenitor B this time. The fact is, the abolition of mother and father is actually quite a big thing. And the left is clever about this, they put for big prizes. You know, one of the reasons I despair about the political right is because we get all impressed because, well, yes, we're trying to get a cut in capital gains tax through Congress. Meanwhile, they're abolishing the sexes. They're abolishing the sexes. That's incredible."

Harry Reid, about two years later stood up on the floor of the Senate, and actually used the phrase undocumented Americans without irony.

The victim says Mr. Vincent told her he was trying to save her life, but he was clearly a danger. Yet even after viewing the video, a local judge told James Vincent to wear an ankle monitor and he was free to go. In other words, a home detention device for a man without a home. When Mr. Vincent's story and face hit local news, police got numerous reports of other incidents involving him, including from a woman who says he attacked her with a knife back in February. Vincent was then rearrested. And there's this video also in San Francisco, where the owner of a truffle shop makes a homeless man leave. A fight ensues. The homeless man puts the shop owner in a chokehold right near the front door of his shop. The owner's 13-year-old son grabbed a baseball bat and ran outside.

But in Los Angeles, the rats can be deadly, and we showed you that in last March, we showed you conditions on the streets of Los Angeles that have brought medieval diseases back to life, like typhus and since our report, the rat problem is even worse. More cases of the disease continue to pop up. Since 2018 in Los Angeles, there have been 150 cases of typhus and 27 typhus outbreaks. A report from a forum in California surveyed 23 private pest control companies, all of them say rat reports have spiked in the last year. Just two weeks ago, a Work Safety Inspector found that employees at City Hall in Los Angeles are exposed to heaps of trash and bodily fluids from homeless encampments lining the streets not far from LA's Skid Row. LA Mayor, Eric Garcetti works at City Hall, but has not declared a state of emergency to handle the homelessness. LA City Council Member Joe Buscaino met with the Mayor this week begging him to declare a state of emergency in the city telling us quote, \"These efforts are advancing at an excruciatingly slow pace with bureaucratic roadblocks and red tape at every step of the way. If a natural disaster left thousands homeless, we would declare a state of emergency.\" The city has spent millions of dollars cleaning up the streets, clearing encampments, but when they clear a spot, new people just move right in and pop their tents providing safe harbor for a flourishing community of rats infested with disease. Los Angeles is the second rattiest city in the country, but exterminating them could be a lot more difficult because a bill in the California State Assembly wants the state to outlaw super toxic forms of rat poison because it harms local wildlife like coyotes and mountain lions -- Tucker."

Almost all of the gains that we made under the Giuliani and Bloomberg administration have all been evaporated under this Mayor. He is so interested in raising his national profile and being the leader of the so-called progressive movement or the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. He shows little to no interest in managing the day-to- day affairs of the city. And the proof is in the numbers. We have an affordable housing crisis in the city. We have a homelessness epidemic, unlike anything we've ever seen before. Our Police Department lost all respect, all confidence in the Mayor. And where's the Mayor? Campaigning for President. He is at zero percent in the polls. He is a disgrace."

We're told they love the home. In fact, as you mentioned, they're going to buy it. List price point $14.8 million. That's not to say the Obama's are paying full tilt.

Well, here's something that really is an existential crisis, social media is having a devastating effect on America's most vulnerable and particularly on teenage brains. This is real. Researchers in the U.K. found that teenagers who use a lot of social media are far more likely to be highly stressed due to a mixture of less sleep, less physical activity and more exposure to bullying. And in schools, experts are warning that children cannot be deprived of their phones for an entire day because it is too psychologically stressful for them to quit using a device for that long. Jean Twenge is a Professor of Psychology at San Diego State University and author of the book, \"iGen\" and she joins us tonight. Jean so much for coming on."

We are in the midst of a mental health crisis for teens in this country, particularly for teen girls -- depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicide -- they all started rise after 2012 when social media became common and so did smartphones. And this is probably not a coincidence because the people who spend a lot of time on their phones especially those who spend a lot of time on social media, it is linked to lack of sleep and depression, and less happiness -- all of these effects and they are hitting teen girls especially hard."

      "utterance": "It is interesting and sad. What even interesting and sad, a new survey from Pew is disconcerting about what's happening in this country. It's widely known information, but it's not often acknowledged in public. America, it turns out is becoming a low trust society. American adults, 65 or older group in a very different country and their views reflect it, only 29 percent of this group, the older American group believe that quote, \"most people can't be trusted.\" Just 39 percent think that most people are looking to take advantage of them. And 48 percent agree with the statement that quote \"most of the time people just look out for themselves.\" Contrast those attitudes with the attitudes of young Americans. They're radically different. Sixty percent of young people in this country say that most people can't be trusted; 71 percent say that people are trying to take advantage of them; 73 percent think that most people can't be trusted most of the time. It's hard to blame young people for thinking this way. The point of this is not to blame them. They've learned it. As children, they were told that education was the key to success. Now, many have tens of thousands in college loan debt, they'll be paying that off for years or decades. They learned nothing. It gave them no advantage at all. Meanwhile, they grow up in a world where they took it for granted that Facebook would spy on them to make a profit. While companies like Uber employ them and give them no benefits and call it the gig economy and pretend they ought to be grateful to work there. The highest job they can aspire to is wearing some matching t-shirt in some spare, depressing retail Apple store -- that's considered cool. These are kids who spent their whole lives under leaders who are happy to send Americans to die in pointless wars in the Middle East, but barely think about stopping the nation's deadliest drug epidemic. We're having their entire country bought up by private equity then sold off piecemeal to the Chinese. These are kids who exists in a social environment where friends will denounce them over a single disagreement rather than try to live with differing views. They become less trusting because their daily lives tell them that trust isn't worth it. It's for suckers. So this is not a small thing. It has massive implications. Social trust is a critical component of happiness. No country can remain happy without social trust. All humans crave communities where they feel at home where they can trust the people around them. If Americans can't trust each other, and instead hate and suspect each other, there are only two end games, and neither one of them is good. This is something that we should worry about and address directly and try to make better because everything hangs in the balance. Well, Democrats like to tell you that global warming is an existential threat, probably overstated at this point. That doesn't mean there aren't deadly threats out there that could be existential -- super volcanoes and asteroids for example, existential threats. Should we be worried about them? We will tell you just ahead. But first, it's time for \"Final Exam.\" Two of our Fox professionals will show who has learned more useless knowledge this week.

Of course, the Democratic Party is talking about climate, which is -- as we're about to tell you not about to kill anybody, anytime soon. But there actually are some existential threats out there. And they are, in fact, kind of terrifying. For example, the Yellowstone super volcano. A \"New York Times\" op-ed warns that if the volcano explodes, it will obliterate Wyoming and cause years of winter. That's existential. And then there's the giant asteroid threat. Big ones, like the ones that killed the dinosaurs or the ones that Bruce Willis blew up in the movie \"Armageddon.\" We will have three close encounters with giant space rocks in just the next week. And then, in case you're not rattled, yet, The Big One, the earthquake that could shear the entire West Coast of America off and send it into the sea, by which many have mixed feelings, but apparently it's real.

Our power went out off and on for a day or two. We were fine. We had candles. We had some canned food. We had some non- perishable food. We were able to get by until things came back to normal. Scientists are always telling us about asteroids that are going to hit us. The volcano you mentioned in Yellowstone Park. These are real things. These are things that could potentially be a problem. But they were talking about this volcano that erupts -- it's erupted three times in 2.1 million years. And the last time it did it was 640,000 years ago. Well, we weren't around 640,000 years ago. And if it's once every 700,000 years, I'm guessing none of us are going to be around in 60,000 years or so.

It might give now -- well, it's definitely going to give NASA something to study when it goes past us. And this is great. That's great for science. Maybe in 10 years, they'll figure out how to land a probe on it, so we can see what's going on, on these asteroids. But we shouldn't be terrified of these things.
