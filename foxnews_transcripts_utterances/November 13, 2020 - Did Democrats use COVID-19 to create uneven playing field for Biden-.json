She now sounds like Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Where are her cries for election integrity now? Instead of counting every legal vote, which she said she wanted to do then, Pelosi wants to take the election chaos now a step further with a so-called election reform bill, that would make it even harder to verify votes, even more mail-in ballots, less voter identification, and as we have documented for nearly two weeks on this program, there has been widespread reports of irregularities, arbitrarily discarded election laws, dead people -- oh, that's my favorite -- casting ballots. Millions of mail-in votes susceptible, as \"The New York Times\" reminded us, to fraud and abuse. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And now, with razor-thin margins in half a dozen critical states, President Trump, he is now doing what any responsible election official would do, demanding every single legal vote be counted, and it be verified. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } President Trump is not the only person calling for a closer look at the votes. As we reported earlier this week in Pennsylvania, lawmakers now on both sides of the aisle are calling for election audit. And just hours ago, Arizona Republicans sued the state to force a vote audit in that close election. And in Michigan, two state senators also requesting an audit there. In a letter to Michigan secretary of state, they accuse election officials of counting ineligible ballots and counting the same batches of ballots multiple times. They also accuse Michigan officials of under false information and giving it in the process a ballots and processing them and duplicating ballots illegally, and fraudulently backdating mail-in ballots and accepting ballots deposited in drop boxes after the deadline. And of course, blocking election observers from viewing the vote and the whole vote counting process -- which, by the way, is in the statutory language of the law. Something we saw in a lot of states. And meanwhile, down in Georgia, we have an ongoing hand recount. There is only one election monitor, apparently, for every ten table vote counting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, does not inspire confidence in you? It doesn't to me. North Carolina, surveillance footage, you'll love this, showing the husband of a local Democratic candidate repeatedly escorting voters inside the polling location, to cast their ballots. One video actually shows him marking a voter's ballot. Oh, but we were told there is never any fraud. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One of our producers spoke to him today, he claims he did nothing wrong, was just helping disabled voters cast their ballots. Does that inspire confidence in our election process to you? Now, some huge states like Florida, Texas, Ohio, they all did a great job on election night. They should be commended. Many other critical states clearly dropped the ball, not all Americans are having a real hard time trusting, believing, having faith and confidence in the results, and rightfully so. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this week, Daniel Horowitz published an op-ed in \"The Blaze\" detailing nine laws that Republicans better pass if they want to stop any voter fraud. My top five would be, you know, lawmakers need to end the practice of long, extended, never ending early voting. In every election, there are critical late-breaking developments could swing a race. We saw it in 2000. The weekend before Election Day, remember, DU developments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in this election, by the way, some voters were in states casting ballots before the final debate. This has got to stop. All -- you know, the game is not fully played yet. There needs to be an election day, not an election month, election two months, and then, you know, two weeks of counting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And mail-in voting, by the way, number two, that is wrought with problems. And by the way, must only be used in extreme circumstances, when a voter is unable to vote in person. Any mail-in votes have got to be verified with a matching signature. Common sense. There's got to be one standard for signature across all mail-in ballots. And then third, voters should absolutely be required to use a photo ID in order to vote. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, I go to the DNC convention every four years, every time I go, guess what? I need a photo ID. I'm not sure why Democrats think it is unfair to require that same standard at a polling location. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And number four, all these drop-off boxes, ballots, I would say we need to keep an eye on it, 24/7. May be have people from both sides watching it. Number five, as the law already prescribes, partisan election observers, they must be allowed real access to view the voting process from beginning to end, without any exceptions, whatsoever. They've got to actually be able to see it, up front, not a hundred feet away, not 20 feet away, not six feet away. Those people on both sides of the aisle should be able to have a full viewing access to the process. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And needless to say, all states should be implementing the best possible voting technology. One that is safe, one that is secure, one that is easy to use. Easy to set up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, states control their own elections, but certain high standards need to be meet. We owe it to the American people. And let's face it, this past election was a train wreck, and some of the most critical, swinging, voting states. By the way, Jim Jordan warned us this would all happen on September 23rd. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here with the very latest on all these states is Kayleigh McEnany, back with us. All right. So, you gave us a full report on one county in Michigan, 234 affidavits, and we talk about Pennsylvania. Now we've got the hand count in Georgia. Then we have the issue of two different standards of acceptable signature verification in Georgia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I guess one of the leaders of the Georgia Republican Party saying there's only one person able to watch the hand recount for, what, every ten people counting, is that true? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Last night, I showed you some text messages from voters who are in Democrat counties, who were contacted and said, go, correct your ballot. There was a defect in your valid. This was not something available to the other 60 counties in Pennsylvania, mostly Republican counties. Well, tonight, we have an email, first of all, from the secretary of state, her stooge (ph), saying this: At 8:38 p.m. on election eve, to all 67 counties, now you can go fix ballots. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So while they were fixing ballots in Democrat counties, you have the avowed anti-Trump secretary of state sending the equivalent of a Susan Rice smoking gun email to cover her bases.

As President Trump -- this is not about personality here. This is about President Trump changing this nation so that everyone felt that the future was theirs again. Ten million more votes for this man this time around than in 2016, increasing his numbers with every minority group and women, the biggest category for him were married women. It is about knowing that our families will be safe, stopping this obscene use of a crisis and suffering, including the coronavirus, instilling fear, so that they can try to steal an election, all because they are embarrassed, because he's the holder of the secret, because with every success of his, he exposed their failure. Even to the point of the vaccine, Cuomo saying, well, it came out two months too early, in fact, no matter the suffering, they do not care, because Donald Trump showed everybody, not just the Democratic Party, what failure and frauds they were, but the entire system. He showed even with Operation Warp Speed, in less than a year, what you can actually accomplish if you wanted to. That is the problem with the Christiane Amanpour, the extreme. Lastly come about her in these references to Nazism and Hitler, it exposes how little they think of that horrific time of massacre and genocide, to lower it to a point, to use it as a little football during political arguments, how dare they. And they are no different than the Democratic Party, an entity that was willing to do this to the contrary, this is what we should be shocked about, the people of Georgia must act, and put in those two GOP senators. And forget about this suggestion that the president has been victimized. He has not. He never will be. It was inevitable they would do this to him because of what he stood for, and he's able to do it because he can face it down. He will again. I don't know exactly how it will unfold. Donald Trump is not finished saving this nation and getting her back on her feet.",

Of course, that's not going to happen here, that kind of accountability, because all decorum from that network towards this president has been eviscerated. That line you are not supposed to go over has been eviscerated. And by the way, the Kristallnacht, this is what I mean by misinformed. She said and I'm quoting, it was of the Nazi's warning shot across the bow. Really? Two hundred fifty synagogues in Germany and Austria destroyed, 7,000 Jewish-owned businesses destroyed, hundreds of Jews killed that night, and also, 30,000 Jewish men rounded up and bought to concentration camps, we know what happened from there. But Christiane Amanpour in this effort to elevate her sense of self- importance, I guess, calls it a shot across the bow?

Nobody thought they would get to that level. And we have others coming, which we think will be at equal level, may be more, that's possible. We will work to secure an emergency use authorization, which should be coming down extremely soon, and my administration will then coordinate the distribution of the vaccine, and it will be approved, I think again, it will be approved very, very quickly, we hope. The average development timeline for a vaccine, including clinical tests and manufacturing, can take eight to 12 years. Through Operation Warp Speed, we are doing it in less than one year."

Very slim margins. The Trump campaign's legal challenges continue to play out in court. And coming up, we're going to bring you the very latest from all of the details, Kayleigh McEnany is here. We will also outline actions Republicans need to take right now, in every state legislature, to restore fairness, integrity, and confidence in our elections. But, first, let's take a look at an important reminder from Nancy Pelosi. See if this sounds like anybody we know, about counting every legal vote. This is her in 2005."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Every legal vote counted, and accurately. What happened to Speaker Pelosi? She now sounds like Donald Trump. Where are her cries for election integrity now? Instead of counting every legal vote, which she said she wanted to do then, Pelosi wants to take the election chaos now a step further with a so-called election reform bill, that would make it even harder to verify votes, even more mail-in ballots, less voter identification, and as we have documented for nearly two weeks on this program, there has been widespread reports of irregularities, arbitrarily discarded election laws, dead people -- oh, that's my favorite -- casting ballots. Millions of mail-in votes susceptible, as \"The New York Times\" reminded us, to fraud and abuse. And now, with razor-thin margins in half a dozen critical states, President Trump, he is now doing what any responsible election official would do, demanding every single legal vote be counted, and it be verified. President Trump is not the only person calling for a closer look at the votes. As we reported earlier this week in Pennsylvania, lawmakers now on both sides of the aisle are calling for election audit. And just hours ago, Arizona Republicans sued the state to force a vote audit in that close election. And in Michigan, two state senators also requesting an audit there. In a letter to Michigan secretary of state, they accuse election officials of counting ineligible ballots and counting the same batches of ballots multiple times. They also accuse Michigan officials of under false information and giving it in the process a ballots and processing them and duplicating ballots illegally, and fraudulently backdating mail-in ballots and accepting ballots deposited in drop boxes after the deadline. And of course, blocking election observers from viewing the vote and the whole vote counting process -- which, by the way, is in the statutory language of the law. Something we saw in a lot of states. And meanwhile, down in Georgia, we have an ongoing hand recount. There is only one election monitor, apparently, for every ten table vote counting. Now, does not inspire confidence in you? It doesn't to me. North Carolina, surveillance footage, you'll love this, showing the husband of a local Democratic candidate repeatedly escorting voters inside the polling location, to cast their ballots. One video actually shows him marking a voter's ballot. Oh, but we were told there is never any fraud. One of our producers spoke to him today, he claims he did nothing wrong, was just helping disabled voters cast their ballots. Does that inspire confidence in our election process to you? Now, some huge states like Florida, Texas, Ohio, they all did a great job on election night. They should be commended. Many other critical states clearly dropped the ball, not all Americans are having a real hard time trusting, believing, having faith and confidence in the results, and rightfully so. Now, this week, Daniel Horowitz published an op-ed in \"The Blaze\" detailing nine laws that Republicans better pass if they want to stop any voter fraud. My top five would be, you know, lawmakers need to end the practice of long, extended, never ending early voting. In every election, there are critical late-breaking developments could swing a race. We saw it in 2000. The weekend before Election Day, remember, DU developments. And in this election, by the way, some voters were in states casting ballots before the final debate. This has got to stop. All -- you know, the game is not fully played yet. There needs to be an election day, not an election month, election two months, and then, you know, two weeks of counting. And mail-in voting, by the way, number two, that is wrought with problems. And by the way, must only be used in extreme circumstances, when a voter is unable to vote in person. Any mail-in votes have got to be verified with a matching signature. Common sense. There's got to be one standard for signature across all mail-in ballots. And then third, voters should absolutely be required to use a photo ID in order to vote. By the way, I go to the DNC convention every four years, every time I go, guess what? I need a photo ID. I'm not sure why Democrats think it is unfair to require that same standard at a polling location. And number four, all these drop-off boxes, ballots, I would say we need to keep an eye on it, 24/7. May be have people from both sides watching it. Number five, as the law already prescribes, partisan election observers, they must be allowed real access to view the voting process from beginning to end, without any exceptions, whatsoever. They've got to actually be able to see it, up front, not a hundred feet away, not 20 feet away, not six feet away. Those people on both sides of the aisle should be able to have a full viewing access to the process. And needless to say, all states should be implementing the best possible voting technology. One that is safe, one that is secure, one that is easy to use. Easy to set up. Now, states control their own elections, but certain high standards need to be meet. We owe it to the American people. And let's face it, this past election was a train wreck, and some of the most critical, swinging, voting states. By the way, Jim Jordan warned us this would all happen on September 23rd. Here with the very latest on all these states is Kayleigh McEnany, back with us. All right. So, you gave us a full report on one county in Michigan, 234 affidavits, and we talk about Pennsylvania. Now we've got the hand count in Georgia. Then we have the issue of two different standards of acceptable signature verification in Georgia. And I guess one of the leaders of the Georgia Republican Party saying there's only one person able to watch the hand recount for, what, every ten people counting, is that true?"

I do have some other information for you on Pennsylvania, Sean, that I passed along to your producers. Last night, I showed you some text messages from voters who are in Democrat counties, who were contacted and said, go, correct your ballot. There was a defect in your valid. This was not something available to the other 60 counties in Pennsylvania, mostly Republican counties. Well, tonight, we have an email, first of all, from the secretary of state, her stooge (ph), saying this: At 8:38 p.m. on election eve, to all 67 counties, now you can go fix ballots. So while they were fixing ballots in Democrat counties, you have the avowed anti-Trump secretary of state sending the equivalent of a Susan Rice smoking gun email to cover her bases.

If you don't have voter ID laws, something is wrong. If you don't -- if you have a law, you're a lawyer, and partisan observers are not allowed to observe, that's a violation of law or changing the laws, as we saw in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court yesterday.

But this is crazy. I think Kayleigh McEnany is absolutely right. The Democratic Party did use the COVID-19 epidemic as an excuse to have the most liberal voting we've ever had in this -- certainly in the modern history of this country. You mentioned my conversation with my friend, the president of the United States, and I feel that he's resigned, in some ways, to the fact that the playing field is very uneven where it comes -- where it concerns the president himself. He's very frustrated. He's flustered. He's disillusioned. But he's also realistic. You mentioned that -- you know, he used that characterization himself about his own chances. He said he'll do the right thing when the time comes, but he wants every legitimate vote counted. You know, we were talking, Sean, and we were talking, you know, we are all covering the great news about the Pfizer vaccine, and even the enthusiasm, the sudden optimism of Dr. Fauci. But when did the CEO of Pfizer know that their test had come back 90 percent effective? Don't tell me that it was just, you know, when he announced it. He had to know two weeks ago."

Everyone could have checked that, instantly. Back in the summer, in July, I think it was, the federal government announced they were investing $1.9 billion for 100 million doses of an unproven vaccine, out of speck, they gave them the money, so they had the money to develop, knowing that if the vaccine was a bust, they've never get the money back. That was President Trump. That was Operation Warp Speed. And he talked about, you know, not being appreciated for that, he talked about so many things that have been used against him, the Russia hoax, impeachment -- we talked about so many things. And he will speak, and I do think that there is a resignation settling now in the Oval Office. I think there is a recognition that, you know, maybe -- maybe because the deck was rigged or whatever it was, we've lost this battle. But -- this is not the last you've heard from President Trump. I fully endorse your expectations for 2024 run. There's no -- you're not going to keep this guy down. He feels very aggrieved, however, he feels very disillusioned, as I mentioned.

Had the best economy, worst pandemic since 1917 and `18. Within a year, less than a year now, we've got a vaccine, which we will share worldwide. But I happen to believe Americans should get it first. PETE HEGSETH, HOST, \"FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND\": Yes, we're going to -- the worst thing you can do is bet against Donald Trump, considering what has been done against him, considering what they did flooding the zone with mail-in ballots, using COVID-19 as an excuse. We need every legal vote to count and ferociously. I mean, unapologetically going after every single one in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona and Georgia, to get every single vote and uncover the extent to which the left wants to drive a truck through voter integrity. So, it's not over in 2020, before we start talking about 2024. But were he decide -- were it to happen and where he would have a decision, of course, he should run in 2024. It clears the field completely, and then you go to every state legislature, because that's where this is decided, and a lot of them are controlled by Republicans. And there's always that one state senator who kind of talk about voter integrity and election law, but never -- wasn't really a sexy topic. That's topic number one for Republicans today. Stopping the nonsense that you talked about in your open of extending the time frame of no voter ID, of no chain of custody of the ballots, without that, Republicans will keep losing. If they can do to the president, if they're able to, what they've done to him in 2020, they will railroad every single Republican candidate going forward. This is -- Nancy Pelosi, remember, bill number one in the House, bill number one was about expanding this type of voting. Then COVID-19 happened, and they used it. Republicans have to counter attack, the way the president has always counterattacked, keep -- keep his back, right now, and then going forward, follow his lead in exposing what the Democrats and the left do in destroying the idea of one person, one vote, which they are hell-bent on doing, Sean."

Let's be clear, this new, extreme, radical Democratic socialist and even lawless party, they are on a quest for power, at all costs. And they are bowing to destroy anyone and everyone that dares to get in their way, including members of their own party. For example, look at this tweet that was sent out by the real speaker of the House, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, showing her staring down West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin in response to his tweets slamming this whole defund the police movement insanity. Even Nancy Pelosi cannot avoid the wrath of this new crop of progressive radicals, as far left groups now, this week, slam the speaker over her now infamous ice cream stunt, remember, in the spring, calling it an unforced error that hurt the party's messaging and lead unexpected losses for Democrats in the House last week. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, are under more pressure than ever to surrender to socialist extremists inside their party, from policy to personnel, this crop of radicals, they are not interested in any compromise. We know they have no desire for real civility. We watch them the last four years. They want cabinet positions. They want top influence. They want all the power, no matter what it takes. And it's why all eyes are on the state of Georgia. Why this election, January 5th, yeah, it is very important. That would be for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to ensure that, well, they are in office in January. Keep the Senate in Republican hands, as some check, as some balance, because we need to stop this power grab right now, or say hello to, let's say, two new states, four new Democratic senators, Democratic majority in the Senate, possibly in perpetuity. Packing the court, no more Electoral College, and yes, more doom, gloom, dark winter lockdowns, because get this, one of Joe Biden's COVID advisors already scheming to implement a nationwide 4-6 week lockdown that would further decimate the economy and the lives of working men and women. And it's even worse, he's got another advisor, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, he wants any vaccine to be first distributed globally across the world. Guess what, America last instead of fellow citizens here in the U.S. Well, that sounds like, yep, America in last place. Meanwhile, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo continuing to play politics with a life-saving vaccine, suggesting he won't even accept distribution of a vaccine developed under the Trump administration without a separate review process. Here now, author of \"Trump and the American Future,\" former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich. I mean, what they are saying, you're the great historian, you're a professor, what they say that they will do, is predictably going to fail, and it's even -- let's see, Elizabeth Warren, Bolshevik Bernie, AOC, Kamala Harris, well, weak, frail, cognitively struggling Joe, Michael Moore, no Electoral College.

Loeffler faces the most radical Democratic nominee in the entire country in Raphael Warnock, and, of course, David Perdue up against Jon Ossoff, who is solid, complete, 100 percent obedient San Francisco radical fund-raising machine. So I think every time, from here to runoff in Georgia, every single day the left does something stupid is a big gift to Loeffler and Perdue and should remind the American people how vital this is, because you are exactly right, they win, Mitch McConnell locks disaster in the Senate. They lose, and Kamala Harris as president of the Senate breaks the tie, so Kamala Harris and the Democrats get to decide what to do.

As President Trump -- this is not about personality here. This is about President Trump changing this nation so that everyone felt that the future was theirs again. Ten million more votes for this man this time around than in 2016, increasing his numbers with every minority group and women, the biggest category for him were married women. It is about knowing that our families will be safe, stopping this obscene use of a crisis and suffering, including the coronavirus, instilling fear, so that they can try to steal an election, all because they are embarrassed, because he's the holder of the secret, because with every success of his, he exposed their failure. Even to the point of the vaccine, Cuomo saying, well, it came out two months too early, in fact, no matter the suffering, they do not care, because Donald Trump showed everybody, not just the Democratic Party, what failure and frauds they were, but the entire system. He showed even with Operation Warp Speed, in less than a year, what you can actually accomplish if you wanted to. That is the problem with the Christiane Amanpour, the extreme. Lastly come about her in these references to Nazism and Hitler, it exposes how little they think of that horrific time of massacre and genocide, to lower it to a point, to use it as a little football during political arguments, how dare they. And they are no different than the Democratic Party, an entity that was willing to do this to the contrary, this is what we should be shocked about, the people of Georgia must act, and put in those two GOP senators. And forget about this suggestion that the president has been victimized. He has not. He never will be. It was inevitable they would do this to him because of what he stood for, and he's able to do it because he can face it down. He will again. I don't know exactly how it will unfold.

Of course, that's not going to happen here, that kind of accountability, because all decorum from that network towards this president has been eviscerated. That line you are not supposed to go over has been eviscerated. And by the way, the Kristallnacht, this is what I mean by misinformed. She said and I'm quoting, it was of the Nazi's warning shot across the bow. Really? Two hundred fifty synagogues in Germany and Austria destroyed, 7,000 Jewish-owned businesses destroyed, hundreds of Jews killed that night, and also, 30,000 Jewish men rounded up and bought to concentration camps, we know what happened from there. But Christiane Amanpour in this effort to elevate her sense of self- importance, I guess, calls it a shot across the bow?

The worst of it are Twitter and Facebook, the social media platforms, the most egregious offenders. If you don't meet their preset partisan standards, you'll be canceled, you'll be censored. And so, I was pleased to see Alito say, decry what's happening in America, and he cited a Nevada case in which the governor said it is okay to gamble in a casino, but it's not okay to worship in a church. And the Supreme Court wrongfully upheld that decision, but they are going to revisit it now, as you point out in New York, the recent order by Governor Cuomo that essentially says you can shop to your hearts delight at Macy's, but don't you dare go into a mosque or a synagogue or a church to worship. This is a clear violation of the equal protection clause.
