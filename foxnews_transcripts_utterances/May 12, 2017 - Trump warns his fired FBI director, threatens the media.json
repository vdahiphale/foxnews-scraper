And to talk like, well, you better watch out or you might get whacked by tapes, this is -- it was self-inflicted and unnecessary. I agree, there was total grounds for getting rid of Comey. There was sympathy on both sides of the aisle for the mistakes he made and perhaps his unfitness for the job.

If he can't get lawmakers to pass things on Capitol Hill, they're going to go home empty-handed and get beaten in 2018.

It says, \"As they ate the president and Mr. Comey made small talk about the election crowd sizes at Mr. Trump's rallies. The president then turned the conversation to whether Mr. Comey would pledge his loyalty to him. Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge. By Mr. Comey's account, his answer to Mr. Trump's initial question apparently did not satisfy the president. Later in the dinner Mr. Trump again said to Mr. Comey that he needed his loyalty. Mr. Comey again replied that he would give him honesty and did not pledge his loyalty according to the account of the conversation.

And all I can think of when it comes to Comey is that, as strange as the politics are around it, one of the reasons why James Comey got himself in trouble where Democrats had lost confidence in him, the president had lost confidence, a lot of Republicans like me had lost confidence in him, is what we were reading about in the New York Times, which is that he is going to try to win this news cycle. He is going to push back on the president aggressively. It's a two-person dinner and Jim Comey was the only other person in that dinner, and he is now getting the story out about exactly what happened. That's how he plays the game and that's why he became a political actor and not so much the revered prosecutor that you are supposed to be when you run the FBI."

So there is that saying about when you are in a hole to stop digging. And it just seems to me that every day the story gets bigger or the lather gets deeper based on self-inflicted wounds. And had the story -- it's not that it's going to end tomorrow, but why would you want to make it bigger and deeper by bringing up the issue of recordings? For Democrats who already want to make the parallels between this and Watergate, to bring up the issue of tapes is only going to make that that much more difficult. There were plenty of ways to handle this that I think there would have been some blow back for the president, Democrats would have been upset, but would not have created the firestorm. And, again, it's all coming from within, not from without."

      "speaker": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Well, now we have a new rabbit to chase down another rabbit hole. But this is, I think, as Amy says, self-inflicted. Who brought up the tapes? When you hear Spicer saying, oh, this isn't a threat, it's just -- I mean, what is it? All of a sudden you are raising something nobody had imagined and saying you better watch out. That's, you know, that's un-presidential, which is kind of a nice way of saying that that sounds more like a mafia boss than the president of a free republic. People say, well, what people like about Trump is that he is unconventional. Unconventional means stepped outside of the bounds of the behavior that 44 individuals have tried to stay within, starting with George Washington, who tried to set an example of a certain rectitude and dignity. And to talk like, well, you better watch out or you might get whacked by tapes, this is -- it was self-inflicted and unnecessary. I agree, there was total grounds for getting rid of Comey. There was sympathy on both sides of the aisle for the mistakes he made and perhaps his unfitness for the job. But that would have made it relatively easy to get rid of him in a way that would have not stirred up this kind of firestorm. And then when it looks like it's starting to damp down, to start up with you better watch out or something might happen to you I think is simply extending a story that is not going to help the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "More than the process story, Matt, and looking at what was said on all of these fronts and the Russia investigation and the tie in the NBC to Russia in one of those answers about his decision to fire Comey is the sense that it's a cycle. If this explodes and continues to explode, he can't get lawmakers together to pass things on Capitol Hill. If he can't get lawmakers to pass things on Capitol Hill, they're going to go home empty-handed and get beaten in 2018. And if they get beaten in 2018, the House and the Senate will be run by Democrats who will step up the investigations into Donald Trump. I mean, this is like a giant circle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "It's amazing. The thing is that I think that the earliest point in a presidency that we can remember the other side of the aisle is at war. They don't even want to pretend that they can work with each other. And that's to the president's detriment because not everything he can pass is going d to be on a reconciliation vehicle where you only need Republican votes. He is going to need Democratic votes on a lot of other things he cares about, including long-term fixes to healthcare. You're right, it's not only just a problem with Democrats being at war and acting like the election is every day of the calendar year, the secondary piece is when presidential approval ratings stay as low as they are, it makes your own team start to get worried. So there's two things he has got to do. He has got to make sure he has got to get through this investigation, which there is really no credible evidence of any wrongdoing. That's the crazy part of this. We should be able to move beyond it because nobody can find a scintilla of evidence that the president did anything inappropriate with Russia in the campaign. You have to get beyond this controversy and we've got to start focusing on the Trump agenda, which by and large on the big questions is very popular."

    {

    {
      "speaker": "WALTER",
      "utterance": "At the end of the Lester Holt interview, the president says you know what, I want to start talking about jobs and the economy and ISIS and building the wall, which is great. I think everybody would like him to do that. And then less than 24 hours later he tweets out the tapes, and so this makes this that much harder. The other piece, of course, is that a lot of the agenda, though, Matt, isn't particularly popular. The healthcare piece is going to be a big, big, big hurdle for Republicans, not just getting it passed but making sure that voters don't see it as toxic. And right now it's not particularly popular. So getting members, you're right, not just to stick with you when you are unpopular but to stick with legislation that right now isn't that popular, those are two tough things to ask your own team to do."
