So, when I say aloha to you, Neil, aloha in Hawaii is not just a word that we say to tourists who come to our state. It's a word that actually means a deep respect and deep love. And that's what I call on both our leaders here in Washington and people all across the country to remember, that we're all in this together, and that we need to have this deep respect for each other, whether we disagree politically, whether we come from a different place, whether we have a different religion or race, and actually know we can respect each other, even while we disagree and disagree strongly on things.
