This is when I smear the -- when I slammed the media. They enabled and protected him as well as his snotty elitist untested Ivy League (Inaudible) he is surrounded by.

And then Obama lets their leader out so now he's in charge. I don't know, man.

So here we are, 20 years later with a botched exit and when this war started, just for context, I was a freshman in high school. Right? I had classmates, people in my high school that went to fight in Afghanistan. Right? Thinking that they were there to stop the terrorists. Now here we are, 20 years later.

He said the terror -- he said our defenses here in the United States are better, but fully expect in short order Al Qaeda to start hitting our embassies overseas. This is what they did, they declared war on the United States in '96, they hit embassies in Africa in '98, they hit the USS Cole in 2000.

Maybe they are not shooting them dead on the streets, but it's not easy. So Joe Biden is terrified to say anything until he gets up that's going to raise hostilities and he is terrified to do anything because if he sends commandoes to go extract stranded Americans in Kabul or the countryside and things go sideways and a U.S. soldier dies, or God forbid an American citizen dies, Joe Biden has blood on his hands and that's going to domino and the whole country is going to explode.

Especially today if Reuters reports that the FBI found scant evidence that the riots at the U.S. capitol on January 6th was the result of an organized plot. We all knew that.

So, what we were told by our military heads and the president of the United States is that Americans were a bigger threat than Islamic terror. They used those words. They said it was bigger than Al Qaeda, bigger than ISIS and that was recently. So, I see a definite link between the internal loathing of our country by our leaders and this subsequent lack of forethought in this withdrawal. If you're preoccupied with these phantoms of the systemic white supremacy of which there is no proof, that has to take up time and effort replacing intelligent thoughts about war and withdraw. I'm not saying you shouldn't be concerned about these issues, but the military should have been focused, they should've had their eye on the ball, the military heads not the troops.

This is about America leading the world and all our allies have agreed with that. We've made an agreement with the Taliban thus far, they've allowed them to go through, to the (Inaudible) to go through. So, we know of no circumstance where American citizens, or carrying American passports are trying to get through to the airport. Let's put this thing in perspective here.

I haven't heard anything. SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT & ANCHOR: I know. It's how do we, as normal average people know more about this than the president does, or is he being disingenuous. Because to say that there are no Americans having trouble getting to the airport, we all probably know people that are trying to get out were all probably trying to help people. I know some personally. And there is a guy in the New York Post yesterday who said, he's an American, he said you took his passport, his three-year- old and went to the airport on Wednesday was 10 feet away from the U.S. marine and could not get passage into the airport. These are not, you know, things that are not happening. These are people putting their names and their faces to them. These are public reports. I don't understand how our president doesn't know about that or his team isn't telling him about that where the breakdown is, but there is definitely a breakdown there. Our own Benjamin Hall, Steve Harrigan, and many of our reporters who have been on the ground there for months since last fall have been warning about this exact thing. And Steve Harrigan said today everyone he knows on the ground, and if you've been there on the ground knows the reality of what's happening, how does the commander-in-chief not know."

The Taliban does not show up on ways or the GPS. It is amazing how bad he has screwed this up when you consider that this was a popular decision. Think about that. Seven -- let's say 75 percent I think of the population wanted to get out. So, 75 percent of the population could have made this decision. All you had to do was get the exit right and you ended the longest war ever, you would be a hero, but poor Joe couldn't do it. Instead, he pretends the argument is over the decision to pull out not the horrible conduct associated to with the pull out. So, what you end up learning is that he, beyond the decision, he brought nothing, absolutely nothing to the table. That's frightening. We knew that. This is when I smear the -- when I slammed the media. They enabled and protected him as well as his snotty elitist untested Ivy League (Inaudible) he is surrounded by. But most important, they bury the laptop stories so this guy can get an. So, Taliban should be thanking Jeff Zucker, Jeff Bezos, The View, everybody else who wanted that story uncovered. Or yes, uncovered. Sorry. Or is it covered? Never mind. The whole thing is weird. The whole thing is weird because no one answers the one big question we all know what it is. Why the Taliban, why the Taliban? Why them? There was no other alternative over 20 years while we were there? Clearly this is the only choice, so they just, were like, hey, we're the only choice. We're just going to wait you guys out. Is it almost comical that a country this beloved and this desired just handed over the country to 70,000 mountain hillbillies with cell phones? What does that tell you? What does that tell you? Since the '90s, we have made no progress. No progress in creating an alternative to the Taliban. It's mind-boggling. And then Obama lets their leader out so now he's in charge. I don't know, man. It's -- it's -- what we witnessed was a controlled surrender to 70,000 people, we killed more than 70,000 people with ISIS."

Greg, before I move on, the progress has been our counterterrorism operation. Combat operations ended in 2014 and the counterterrorism is denying a haven to Al Qaeda. And not only have we not had a terror attack on U.S. soil, we also haven't had a casualty in Afghanistan for about a year and a half. And to quote Jennifer Griffin, the incomparable Jennifer Griffin, she said \"we were in Afghanistan to stop partners, you know, to stop terrorism from brewing, from growing, and our partners have now been abandoned, they are in hiding. They've disappeared. We don't have eyes and ears on the ground.\" And this, we will talk about later this over the horizon capability is laughable. I will go into it in the next block, but we're going to be flying drones that by the time they get to Afghanistan from the Persian Gulf have very little time to actually do any work. But I keep hearing this word humiliating. That this has been a humiliating week. No, not for Americans. Not for our service members, those who served and sacrificed, those who were there, those who are going into Afghanistan now. It is infuriating and frightening. Every American listening to this garbage from this garbage president has every right to be pissed off. The only humiliating thing is for Joe -- the only humiliation is on Joe Biden and the people who work for Joe Biden in the White House in his administration. Fellow Democrats should be humiliated. And of course, to your point, all the media grifters, and the hucksters, and the swindlers who sold this broken bobble head to the American people. Not only he is a liar, but he is delusional. He's inept, and he is cipher. And he is our commander-in-chief, and that's why we are suffering through this right now."

It started with George Bush and this mission to go Osama bin Laden. That's how we started in Afghanistan. Then it turned into we're going to build a democracy which clearly the people of Afghanistan did not want. So here we are, 20 years later with a botched exit and when this war started, just for context, I was a freshman in high school. Right? I had classmates, people in my high school that went to fight in Afghanistan. Right? Thinking that they were there to stop the terrorists. Now here we are, 20 years later. We have had members of Congress year after year after year, vote for a budget approving more money to Afghanistan, more money to Afghanistan forces for what, to what avail? To what point? Right? Because this is where we are. Where we are now is that Taliban is in control. And guess what. There are at least three presidents that knew that the Taliban was stronger than the Afghan government. The Obama administration knew because they were negotiating with them. The Trump administration knew because they were negotiating with them. And the Biden administration knew because they are currently in negotiations with the Taliban. So, the Afghan government was a failed from the beginning and this is frustrating for somebody who saw this war start when I was a teenager and didn't get a chance to actually have my say in a presidential election until 2008. Some of my classmates didn't get the same right and they went to go and fight in this war."

Again, having a sanctuary in Afghanistan because of the Taliban. That in the press conference, Biden was asked, he said Al Qaeda is now gone in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda is gone. And then a short while later, Jennifer Griffin pressed Kirby, the Defense Department spokesman on that and he reversed course and admitted that Al Qaeda has a presence in Afghanistan. Of course, they do. The United Nations said that they do, and their recent report, actually Al Qaeda has presences in 15 provinces. and I called, and this is, and Jennifer, she was so incredible today said this is the same thing, it's a repeat of what began in the early 90s in Afghanistan with a vacuum being created there. I called Andy McCarthy who prosecuted the blind sheik, and he just walked me through what was going to happen. He said the terror -- he said our defenses here in the United States are better, but fully expect in short order Al Qaeda to start hitting our embassies overseas. This is what they did, they declared war on the United States in '96, they hit embassies in Africa in '98, they hit the USS Cole in 2000. There were other plots against our embassies and that's one of the reasons that our allies overseas are so upset. Angela Merkel called Biden out on it and blatantly said this is just a political move. So, again, terror is coming to the United States. Again, the only question now is how soon."

And the reason why I say that is because I think far before we even pulled out of Afghanistan the moment that the Taliban started to make a resurgence in the country, right, which started in 2006 is when they started to regain territory. From that moment on, we should've expected Al Qaeda to begin to grow. And the moment that we saw former president start to negotiate with the Taliban was the moment we should've realized. And to honest with you I think this is where we, as the American people think -- Greg said earlier this week, is that our leaders in Washington, those that are appointed in elected has been misleading us for a very long time. Because all we've heard is, we're doing great in Afghanistan. We need a surge, and when we get the surge it's all going to work out and we're going to win. But the truth of the matter is in 2006, not because the failure of our troops, our troops had been doing a masterful job, but because of the failure --"

I'm talking with some military folks who have now been able to get civilian and private charter planes that will come in and out of there. They say they cannot get the State Department to approve those flights for clearance to assist our military and to get people out. They say that the administration by their account is in disarray, Jesse. And this extra help that is standing there is just idle while people waits."

We have a deal with the Taliban, no offensive weapon -- no offensive violence against Americans in Afghanistan until we withdraw. Trump struck that deal, Biden is a party to that deal, but when he pulled out in such a sloppy way, we lost all leverage so now the Taliban controls everything that we're doing there. And are we saying the Taliban is just letting everyone through? No. They are blackmailing people, they're beating Americans up. Maybe they are not shooting them dead on the streets, but it's not easy. So Joe Biden is terrified to say anything until he gets up that's going to raise hostilities and he is terrified to do anything because if he sends commandoes to go extract stranded Americans in Kabul or the countryside and things go sideways and a U.S. soldier dies, or God forbid an American citizen dies, Joe Biden has blood on his hands and that's going to domino and the whole country is going to explode. So right now, he's tiptoeing around, he's at the mercy of the Taliban, he's throwing around money like it's crazy and we have a deadline coming up. And after 9/11, who knows what happens."

      "utterance": "I have no idea. I think that today Joe Biden said that terrorism has metastasized around the world. But just months ago, not even just months ago, it was the number -- what was the number one threat was domestic white supremacy terror groups. So now, we know that he was lying about that. Especially today if Reuters reports that the FBI found scant evidence that the riots at the U.S. capitol on January 6th was the result of an organized plot. We all knew that. We saw that with our eyes, but we had to play along with this stupid fantasy delusion of white supremacist phantoms. And so, what happened was you had General Milley, you know, wanting to get at the root of white rage, which does not sound like a general consumed by winning wars, that that was his priority. So, what we were told by our military heads and the president of the United States is that Americans were a bigger threat than Islamic terror. They used those words. They said it was bigger than Al Qaeda, bigger than ISIS and that was recently. So, I see a definite link between the internal loathing of our country by our leaders and this subsequent lack of forethought in this withdrawal. If you're preoccupied with these phantoms of the systemic white supremacy of which there is no proof, that has to take up time and effort replacing intelligent thoughts about war and withdraw. I'm not saying you shouldn't be concerned about these issues, but the military should have been focused, they should've had their eye on the ball, the military heads not the troops. The leaders should have their eye on the ball but they were too busy playing woke and now we're broke."

All of this while her approval rating continues to stay underwater but that doesn't seem to bother her one bit. Shannon, she was standing on the stage wearing a mask, kind of next to President Biden.

But my thing is that in this country, there's so much beauty of freedom for women that she could rise to almost practically the highest place in the country. And yet her voice we have not heard much from her about what is now going to be the reality for women in Afghanistan and girls being turned away from their jobs being told to stay home. We're told the Council of Islamic Scholars is going to decide whether they can go to school or not. I just think we've got to wake up to the reality of what's happening there. And listen, women are mistreated in many places around the country, but Afghanistan, it is showing in just incredibly disgusting pictures day by day. I'd love to hear her voice as the highest-ranking female arguably in the U.S. to talk about what's going to happen to them and how we can possibly right the wrongs that are playing out right now."

So, she's going to go and it's probably good timing to get a little distance literally and figuratively from Joe Biden who's struggling right now so she can go forward her own identity over in Vietnam and get a little space between them and then come back in a couple weeks, and the dust may have settled. But she will have to do an interview when she's there. And she's going to be asked on camera about Afghanistan and that is the test. And the White House communication shop is going to be watching how is she going to handle it?

But this is all before the vaccine. And like when are we going to give up things that have been proven not to work?
