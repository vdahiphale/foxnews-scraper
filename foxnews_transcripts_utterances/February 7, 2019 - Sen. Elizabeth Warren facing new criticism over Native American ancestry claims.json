      "sentences": "Well, the president slamming it, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appearing to try to distance herself from it, as the top three Democrats in the Virginia state government try to dig themselves out of it. And, by the way, that is not near the end of it. Now Republican State Senator Tommy Norment, who is serving as the majority leader, is accused of being the editor of yet another yearbook filled with racist photos and slurs that goes back to the 1960s. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On and on we go.

I'm Neil Cavuto. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } President Trump today accusing Democrats of killing the great state of Virginia, as the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the attorney general, all Democrats, remain engulfed in a scandal over racially charged images, and, in the case of the lieutenant governor, alleged sexual assault. But it's not just Democrats. Now Republican Senator Norment issuing this statement just a few minutes ago: \"The use of blackface is abhorrent in our society, and I emphatically condemn it. As one of seven working on a 359- page yearbook, I cannot endorse or associate myself with every photo, entry or word on each page.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Norment telling The Richmond Dispatch that he did not appear in the photos and that he did not take any of the racially offensive photos, but on and on we go. The photos in question in this case cover the 1968 Virginia Military Institute yearbook, but it follows on the heels of other allegations and other controversial pictures that transcend the parties and now have many people asking, what is it with Virginia? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, keep in mind, this is a crucial state politically. Its 13 electoral votes are highly prized. And in recent years, it has gone very Democratic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } To Democratic strategist Howard Franklin, Axios reporter Stef Kight, and American Majority's Ned Ryun. Stef, I will begin with you here and get your take on this widening scandal or controversy. The pecking order of those who would replace Governor Northam, if he ever were to resign, is getting few and far between right now. Where do we stand?",

If Northam were to go, and then Fairfax were to go, than Herring were to go, of course, it ends up being a Republican. I think right now Democrats are trying to figure out how do they keep political power? And I have heard of them talking about Herring resigning, the deputy A.G. being placed replacing him, and then everybody else resigning, which means she's a Democrat.

I would remind people of a couple things. First of all, if the Virginia voters had known of these facts in October of 2017, do we really think these guys would have won? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I'm convinced that Ed Gillespie would have won. So if people are screaming this will overturn the elections, if the Virginia voters had been fully educated on these facts, I don't think these guys would have won. The second thing to keep in mind, Neil, is this. There are fall elections here in Virginia. Every last state senator, 40 of them, are up for reelection. And the important part about that is all of those se senators will be in place when redistricting happens. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So Democrats... if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And, of course, now that you have Tommy Norment, who is the Senate majority leader, not in the immediate succession plan for governor. But is that a way for the Democrats to step back and say, oh, it's a pox on both parties, certainly not by the numbers, but that this is going to ease the friction on them?

As one person tweeted -- quote -- \"Hey, Delta and Coca-Cola, these napkins are creepy as 'blank.' Pretty sure no one appreciated unsolicited phone numbers in the good old days, and they sure as heck don't want the number of someone who has been gawking at them on a plane for hours today. Not a good look.\" Other people actually kind of like the napkins, but still Delta has now apologized and acknowledge this one kind of missed the mark.

We worked with our partners at Delta to begin removing the napkins last month and are replacing them with other designs.\" I don't know.

And he said, \"I would think he wouldn't.\" When you talk to members of this conference committee, they are very positive right now. Now, here's some new information I have gotten in just the past couple of minutes. They believe that the sweet spot for border wall, barrier fencing, whatever you want to call it, is a little more than $1.3 billion. Now, again, that's only restricted to this fiscal year. The other part of the deal -- you might say, well, why would Democrats go for that? Because they're starting to put restrictions on how that money can be used over this. It will go for some of the fencing, but we're going to put restrictions on there. When you talk with these appropriators, they have to get some bill text by Monday. Keep in mind that the House of Representatives has this new 72- hour rule. They have to get bill text and post it for a full 72 hours. And then they have to move it through the Senate. Now, I talked with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. I said, what happens if they can't get this worked out by a week from Friday? That's the deadline when the government has to be funded again. He says, \"I don't want to see any more short-term C.R.s.\" That's the interim spending bill. He says he's -- quote -- \"hopeful.\" So things are starting to ramp up right now, but I talked also with Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat from California.

What are people in the region thinking? Do they understand the context of why we're doing it? Do they understand that they're going to pick up the burden for that fight to make sure that ISIS is not only destroyed, but stays destroyed, that we cannot let them regain any kind of capability? And I think we're going to have that. I think we're going to stay invested in Iraq. We're going to stay invested in Afghanistan.

And, by the way, that is not near the end of it. Now Republican State Senator Tommy Norment, who is serving as the majority leader, is accused of being the editor of yet another yearbook filled with racist photos and slurs that goes back to the 1960s. On and on we go. So here we go. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. President Trump today accusing Democrats of killing the great state of Virginia, as the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the attorney general, all Democrats, remain engulfed in a scandal over racially charged images, and, in the case of the lieutenant governor, alleged sexual assault."

The photos in question in this case cover the 1968 Virginia Military Institute yearbook, but it follows on the heels of other allegations and other controversial pictures that transcend the parties and now have many people asking, what is it with Virginia? Now, keep in mind, this is a crucial state politically. Its 13 electoral votes are highly prized. And in recent years, it has gone very Democratic. To Democratic strategist Howard Franklin, Axios reporter Stef Kight, and American Majority's Ned Ryun. Stef, I will begin with you here and get your take on this widening scandal or controversy. The pecking order of those who would replace Governor Northam, if he ever were to resign, is getting few and far between right now. Where do we stand?"

And the bigger picture here is also what it's just doing to the party and to Virginia as a state, and we're seeing these two after him now falling under fire as well. And it's creating a lot of controversy. And I think that the next few days, I mean, it's going to be hard for someone like the governor to govern the state in a position like this."

If Northam were to go, and then Fairfax were to go, than Herring were to go, of course, it ends up being a Republican. I think right now Democrats are trying to figure out how do they keep political power? And I have heard of them talking about Herring resigning, the deputy A.G. being placed replacing him, and then everybody else resigning, which means she's a Democrat. She would then become governor. I think they're trying to figure out, how do they hold on to political power? I would remind people of a couple things. First of all, if the Virginia voters had known of these facts in October of 2017, do we really think these guys would have won? I'm convinced that Ed Gillespie would have won. So if people are screaming this will overturn the elections, if the Virginia voters had been fully educated on these facts, I don't think these guys would have won. The second thing to keep in mind, Neil, is this. There are fall elections here in Virginia. Every last state senator, 40 of them, are up for reelection. And the important part about that is all of those se senators will be in place when redistricting happens. So Democrats..."

But is that a way for the Democrats to step back and say, oh, it's a pox on both parties, certainly not by the numbers, but that this is going to ease the friction on them?

And I think that trying to punt to the messaging off to the other party really won't seem to be effective. They might try. And I'm not really sure what their strategy is. I think they're still trying to figure out -- a lot of people are calling for resignations, others trying to say, hey, can we judge them by something that they have done in the past? Not everyone can live in glass houses. But at the same time, I mean, we have seen not even -- I mean, look at what happened with Megyn Kelly. Like, she wasn't even -- you don't have to even wear it for -- her comments about questioning why it was offensive got her show canceled.

This is really about an abuse of power by Congress. The law today protects individual taxpayers from Congress examining them and making them public for purely partisan reasons. If Democrats twist the law and weaponize the tax code for purely partisan reasons, they have set a very dangerous precedent, because if Congress, any Congress, can rummage around in the tax returns of the president, what stops them from doing that for anything they think is a political enemy?"

      "utterance": "Well, they believe seeing the tax returns will help them identify any potential conflicts of interest, perhaps within the tax code. But this is an easy answer. You can protect private taxpayers and still look at that. For instance, few people know that the president and the vice president are annually audited by the IRS. They're subjects to epics reviews and investigation by the FBI. That's already in place."

We have an annual financial disclosure. We can by law say to any president or candidate, look, we want to know more about this.

And so, look, we're going to fight it, because we think this economy can grow even more and wages can grow even more. And so, look, Washington doesn't have a revenue problem, as you know.

The other side said -- quote -- \"Because you're on a plane full of interesting people, and, hey, you never know.\" Coke is in the process, if you don't know, of rebranding itself as the most optimistic brand on social media, and it looks like they bombed this one. As one person tweeted -- quote -- \"Hey, Delta and Coca-Cola, these napkins are creepy as 'blank.' Pretty sure no one appreciated unsolicited phone numbers in the good old days, and they sure as heck don't want the number of someone who has been gawking at them on a plane for hours today. Not a good look.\" Other people actually kind of like the napkins, but still Delta has now apologized and acknowledge this one kind of missed the mark. And Coke issued a statement saying -- quoting here -- \"We sincerely apologize to anyone we may have offended. We worked with our partners at Delta to begin removing the napkins last month and are replacing them with other designs.\" I don't know. I think the new design should say something like, have a Coke and a smile or I would like to buy the world of Coke.

      "utterance": "All right, you don't want to get too excited here, but the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman and top GOP negotiator, Richard Shelby, was saying that he expects a border deal could be done by Monday. And that's after meeting with the president. So you have to think he bounced off some of the ideas off the president. Chad Pergram with the latest. What do you -- what do you make of all this, Chad? Where are we?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER",
      "utterance": "Well, I talked to Richard Shelby after he came back from the White House, Neil. And I'm going to read you exactly what he said here. He said -- quote -- \"It's the most positive meeting I have ever had with the president.\" And then the question was, would the president still go ahead and declare a national emergency if they got a deal? And he said, \"I would think he wouldn't.\" When you talk to members of this conference committee, they are very positive right now. Now, here's some new information I have gotten in just the past couple of minutes. They believe that the sweet spot for border wall, barrier fencing, whatever you want to call it, is a little more than $1.3 billion. Now, again, that's only restricted to this fiscal year. The other part of the deal -- you might say, well, why would Democrats go for that? Because they're starting to put restrictions on how that money can be used over this. It will go for some of the fencing, but we're going to put restrictions on there. When you talk with these appropriators, they have to get some bill text by Monday. Keep in mind that the House of Representatives has this new 72- hour rule. They have to get bill text and post it for a full 72 hours. And then they have to move it through the Senate. Now, I talked with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. I said, what happens if they can't get this worked out by a week from Friday? That's the deadline when the government has to be funded again. He says, \"I don't want to see any more short-term C.R.s.\" That's the interim spending bill. He says he's -- quote -- \"hopeful.\" So things are starting to ramp up right now, but I talked also with Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat from California. She's one of the appropriators, also a member of this conference committee. And she said an old adage which is always true up here, nothing is decided until everything is decided, Neil."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "That's right. And Mitch McConnell, he indicated when I asked him on Tuesday -- now, this is going back a couple of days -- that he thought if there was an agreement, if there was a universal global deal and everything, things could move through the Senate pretty fast. And then, of course, the question is about Nancy Pelosi. What will the left of her caucus be willing to do? What is she willing to do? I have been told that there is a sweet spot right in the middle, just not with Democrats, but Republicans, where you have maybe not the most liberal voices in the Democratic Caucus, and maybe not the most Republican conservative members over on the other side of the aisle vote for this, but it's that sweet spot somewhere in the middle. Keep in mind, Neil, that these freshmen, all these House Democratic freshman, want to get a deal. They want to legislate. And it behooves them to do so. Nancy Pelosi is very mindful of that."

So many of us remember 9/11, but very few forget really what happened and set the stage for it, the bombing of the USS Cole roughly the year before. The commander of that vessel, Kirk Lippold, with us right now. Commander, very good to have you."

      "utterance": "Absolutely phenomenal. It's the fact that the president took time to honor not only Tom Wibberley, but his wife, Patty, was also there, the fact that Tom stood there and honored all the families who paid an unimaginable price in the loss of their loved ones in that dastardly attacked by Al Qaeda. So taking that time at the State of the Union address truly does show the nation that we as Americans will never forget their sacrifice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And somehow -- I mean, no disrespect, Commander, certainly. We have known each other for many years. We forget about what you and your men and women went through, and how that set in motion what would be a horrific series of events and terror, and yet we almost blithely assume, well, it's over, it's gone. No need to worry. When you hear that kind of talk, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIPPOLD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a tragedy, Neil, because, in many ways, USS Cole was rapidly pushed to the side. There was no response by either the Clinton or Bush administrations. They kind of looked at it and said, well, that's a price that we pay for being on the international stage. The Navy really wanted to downplay it in many ways and look forward and move on. So, in many ways, it was -- the attack on USS Cole was lost in the shadow of 9/11. But it's nice to know, Neil, that there are Americans out there serving our nation today who still take the time to make sure that we're investing the intelligence assets, the time and the ordnance to make sure that we hold these terrorists accountable even over 18 years later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, this occurs in an environment where the president, as you know, wants to pull our troops out of Syria, not leaving the entire region, but reprioritizing, I guess, is the way his administration has put it, maybe even using Iraq as a place to keep an eye on Iran. How do you feel about all of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIPPOLD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, Neil, that Americans, like -- including me, want to make sure that we're going through a deliberate process, so that we understand not only action as we start to withdraw from an area like Syria, but also that we understand what the second- and third-order effects are going to be. What are people in the region thinking? Do they understand the context of why we're doing it? Do they understand that they're going to pick up the burden for that fight to make sure that ISIS is not only destroyed, but stays destroyed, that we cannot let them regain any kind of capability? And I think we're going to have that. I think we're going to stay invested in Iraq. We're going to stay invested in Afghanistan. We have national security interests throughout the Middle East and that part of the world, that we need to make sure we stay there and keep supporting those people, as we try to make them understand and appreciate freedom and democracy and hopefully work toward that end."

If you think of those attacks and the death of those 17 soldiers and how, little more than a year later, we would have 9/11 and all the attacks since, it started then. The president didn't forget it this past week. All right, a quick look at the Dow. We were down 220 points. It could have been worse today. I want to emphasize here that everything hinges on whether these Chinese trade talks come off, and they come off well. This, of course, is one of the issues that was weighing on the markets, that they might be bumpy, and they might not be immediate. It's hot and cold with these guys, but, today, it was cold to selling. Tomorrow could be a different story. That will do it here. \"The Five\" is now.
