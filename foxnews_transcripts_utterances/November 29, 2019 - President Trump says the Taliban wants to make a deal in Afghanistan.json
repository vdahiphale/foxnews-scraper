It's five o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" This is a Fox News alert. We're following two separate stabbing attacks with multiple victims overseas. We don't know yet if they're related. First in London, police revealing that two people have died after that attack. It's being treated as a terrorist incident. And breaking in the last couple of hours, a second stabbing incident, this time at The Hague. Details are still unknown on the motive on that one. Let's go to Gillian Turner. She has more for us.

      "sentences": "So, Dana, the million-dollar question for law enforcement and for the intelligence community here is whether these two attacks in London and in The Hague are linked. As of now, authorities don't yet know. The attack in The Hague is still pretty much an active scene. First responders are out in full force as we speak. So, it's really way too early for any kind of analysis. But here are the facts that we know at this hour. From Dutch police, several people attacked by one man on the street and are now wounded, at least three based on the most recent confirmed reports. Police were initially looking for a male suspect they said was about 45 years old and wearing a gray tracksuit. But just a little while ago, the chief of police said that suspect description is wrong. This attack took place on what is a very crowded street, very busy shopping street. It's called [unintelligible] market. Multiple eyewitnesses are claiming the stabbing itself took place inside a store on that street called Hudson's Bay. But again, the police chief said just a little while ago that the attack was on the street. Now, this attack comes on the heels of a knife attack at London Bridge that has left two people dead, three people injured, and the suspected attacker was killed on scene by police. That attacker was taken down by a pedestrian. Initially, police then got involved once the attacker revealed what appeared to be a suicide vest. Police have now, though, confirmed it was a fake. As you mentioned, Dana, no known links to terrorism in The Hague, stabbing as of now. But the London attack has been declared terrorism, the eighth terrorist attack in that city, Dana, in the last two years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We haven't had a successful attack by foreign terrorists on U.S. soil since 9/11, terrorist attacks, nonetheless. But these aren't forever wars, as President Trump likes to call them. We've had troops at least deployed in Europe since World War II, in Korea since the armistice back an armistice back in 1953. I'll make that point. But I just want to say: yay! The president went to see the troops in Afghanistan for Thanksgiving. These are men and women serving this country who cannot be with their families.

It's five o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" This is a Fox News alert. We're following two separate stabbing attacks with multiple victims overseas. We don't know yet if they're related. First in London, police revealing that two people have died after that attack. It's being treated as a terrorist incident. And breaking in the last couple of hours, a second stabbing incident, this time at The Hague. Details are still unknown on the motive on that one. Let's go to Gillian Turner. She has more for us. Gillian, what do you know now?"

      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "So, Dana, the million-dollar question for law enforcement and for the intelligence community here is whether these two attacks in London and in The Hague are linked. As of now, authorities don't yet know. The attack in The Hague is still pretty much an active scene. First responders are out in full force as we speak. So, it's really way too early for any kind of analysis. But here are the facts that we know at this hour. From Dutch police, several people attacked by one man on the street and are now wounded, at least three based on the most recent confirmed reports. Police were initially looking for a male suspect they said was about 45 years old and wearing a gray tracksuit. But just a little while ago, the chief of police said that suspect description is wrong. This attack took place on what is a very crowded street, very busy shopping street. It's called [unintelligible] market. Multiple eyewitnesses are claiming the stabbing itself took place inside a store on that street called Hudson's Bay. But again, the police chief said just a little while ago that the attack was on the street. Now, this attack comes on the heels of a knife attack at London Bridge that has left two people dead, three people injured, and the suspected attacker was killed on scene by police. That attacker was taken down by a pedestrian. Initially, police then got involved once the attacker revealed what appeared to be a suicide vest. Police have now, though, confirmed it was a fake. As you mentioned, Dana, no known links to terrorism in The Hague, stabbing as of now. But the London attack has been declared terrorism, the eighth terrorist attack in that city, Dana, in the last two years."

Fox has not independently verified that. But we are looking at the photos. It's important to note, Dana. ISIS has largely gone underground since the killing of its leader, Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi, a few weeks ago. My terrorism sources are telling me that if this is indeed true, that they signed up these new recruits today, it's a show of strength to try and convince the world that they're still out and about and they can still pull people in."

It does kind of highlight the need to have a forward deployment of U.S. troops in these areas that have been breeding grounds. We know from 9/11 for terrorist activity to prevent these very attacks from happening again. We haven't had a successful attack by foreign terrorists on U.S. soil since 9/11, terrorist attacks, nonetheless. But these aren't forever wars, as President Trump likes to call them. We've had troops at least deployed in Europe since World War II, in Korea since the armistice back an armistice back in 1953. I'll make that point. But I just want to say: yay! The president went to see the troops in Afghanistan for Thanksgiving. These are men and women serving this country who cannot be with their families. And I just think people automatically want to pivot to the political motives, pivot to this. President Trump's trying to wipe away things that have happened in recent weeks, even not months.

But when you're planning a secret trip, you don't have any staff. It is all on you. And you have to go and meet with the press pool, the reporters that will be in, one by one. I set up a sting operation at the Starbucks down the street. And they would come to me and I would say, okay, these are the things you have to agree to. They were allowed to tell their spouse and their editor. And that was it. And then we would -- but what I found is that the press never wanted to leak that because it was such an amazing opportunity and they understood the gravity."

And certainly, I'm concerned about our position in the Middle East, particularly in Syria. But I have a slightly different concern. I'm very worried about betting on the Taliban to restrain ISIS. Now, that's not a reason not to negotiate. I think we all have to stand behind our president as he goes forward. But let's be clear, these are not neutral or good actors. These are very, very dangerous people. We have an elected government in Afghanistan that's largely been kept out of the process. And I just want to be cautious as an American that we not in this search of a deal do something that could be --"

Like even if you look at the Kurds, there's some factions of them that are affiliated with terrorist organizations. Yet we still considered them as allies. So, again, I'm always -- I think it is problematic either way and it's always been. But when I look at the president and what he decided to do, part of the reason why this worked is because the media was after the president. To see -- the fact that you see people talking about him golfing and all this stuff, and they played into this. Those reports were almost shields for the president. That's a tough time after the president has gone on the offense --"

I think the bottom line is this, that the Democratic Party voters, they want to win, and they realize that the socialism, no matter how crazy, you know, the activist and the Twitter activists are, they want to beat the president. But it's still problematic for them because Joe Biden is a weak candidate.

So, the metropolitan police in the U.K. have said, you know, \"This is not in our jurisdiction, not of our thing, we're too busy around the thing.\" But that's not been true in previous cases when it didn't involve a royal family member. When the little girl, Madeleine McCann, went missing -- and that was in Portugal -- the British parents -- remember they went for a dinner. And this become -- an all-out search. And that wasn't in the jurisdiction either. But they went, and they did all of that.
