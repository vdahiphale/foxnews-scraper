      "sentences": "All right, we have a lot of breaking news right now, but I have some 'splainin' to do. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, substituting today, well, for Neil Cavuto. It seems weird saying that, especially when so many of you have gotten used to and actually really enjoyed Sandra Smith and Charles Payne hosting this show, or David Asman, Jackie DeAngelis, Ashley Webster or Ed Lawrence, my other shows here and on FOX Business. My thanks to each and all of them. They upended their entire lives and schedules and family commitments to cover for me and be there for you, as did my incredible staff. But I am back. And I'm betting a lot of you wondered if I would ever be back. That was certainly the case earlier today, when I returned to my FOX Business show and talked about viewers like Lisa, who wrote that she thought I had died and FOX just, well, forgot to say anything about it. Or Melanie, who was convinced I was fired: \"Cavuto has to be out of a job. Now they're calling it 'Your World.' He sure sucked at it, but I hope he's well.\" Not a fan, I guess. Or Janice, who kindly noted: \"Dead or alive, as long as he isn't on my TV, it's a good day.\" Well, sorry about today, then, Janice. Now, once FBN viewers finally saw me, I thought they'd be delighted. Not quite. \"Bummer. Cavuto is back. Time to change the channel. He should have just kept his subs, as they were so much better.\" Actually, I'm convinced that was one of the subs. Another tweeting: \"Welcome back, Neil Cavuto. Glad you're feeling better. Is it me, or did you lose weight? Based on your track record, I'm sure you will gain it all back.\" God protect the workers at the nearest Ponderosa all-you-can-eat buffet. That's actually funny, Ponderosa. There's a theme here, by the way. Virginia tweeting back: \"Neil, come back. We missed your sense of humor,\" and that, \"Most of all, glad to see you're well.\" This from Francesca: \"So glad you're back, Neil. It's that strong Italian heritage. Can't keep us down. God bless.\" And Alex wondered why it was taking so long for someone, anyone to explain my absence: \"What are they hiding? Why is FOX not saying anything?\" Well, I was trying to make this clear on FOX Business, but, first off, Alex -- and I want to repeat it here -- because I asked them not to say anything. They were honoring my wishes. And they were respecting my privacy, though they were getting a lot of heat trying to protect that privacy. Now, I wasn't hiding anything. I just felt that it really wasn't a story. The stories on this show were and are the story. It's about you. It's not about me, just like this show. My opinion doesn't matter. What matters is the news. What matters is you. But this did drag on a long time, so you deserve an explanation from me. I gave it to FOX Business viewers. Now here goes for FOX News viewers. I did get COVID again, but a far more serious strand, what they call COVID pneumonia. It landed me in intensive care for quite a while, and it really was touch and go. So, some of you who wanted to put me out of my misery darn near got what you wished for. So, sorry to disappoint you. But, no, the vaccine didn't cause this. That grassy knoll theory has come up a lot, that I really have to put it to rest. My very compromised immune system did. Because I got cancer and now multiple sclerosis, I'm among the venerable and vulnerable, what, 3 percent of the population or so that simply cannot sustain the full benefits of a vaccine. In other words, it doesn't last. But let me be clear. Doctors say, had I not been vaccinated at all, I wouldn't be here. It provided some defense. But that is still better than no defense. Now, maybe that's not great comfort for some of you. I got to be honest. Frankly, it was not great comfort for me either. This was scary, so scary, I'm talking Ponderosa suddenly out of prime rib in the middle of the buffet line scary. If you don't know Ponderosa, it falls on deaf ears. Anyway, I'm not here to debate vaccinations for you, just offer an explanation for me. I figured I owed you that. I didn't want to become the story. But, for many of you, I did. Now you know my story. Time to get back to far more important matters and stories. And now I will, like what's going on right now in Ukraine and the threat of war that looms large. In just a moment, we will be talking to General David Petraeus on all of this and the White House now saying it is ready to respond immediately. What does that mean? First to Jennifer Griffin on these fast-moving developments. Jennifer, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Everything that has occurred in the past few hours, however, Neil indicates that Vladimir Putin has his sights set on all of Ukraine, not just the Donbass, his televised speech to the nation a chilling, distorted history lesson in which he talks about the mistakes Russian leaders going back to Vladimir Lenin made by separating Ukraine from Russia. It was almost verbatim what Putin said in a seminal 12-page speech back on July 12, 2021, sent to his armed forces entitled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,\" in which he essentially outlined why he did not believe Ukraine has the right to exist as a separate nation. This was a cold and calculated speech in which he blamed past Soviet leaders like Nikita Khrushchev for giving into Ukrainian nationalism. It's the kind of speech that is reminiscent of those delivered on the eve of World War II before Hitler invaded Poland -- quote -- \"For some reason, Khrushchev gave Ukraine separate status,\" Putin said with disdain. \"Why did we have to be so generous and then give these republics the right to leave? Madness,\" he said. Putin has long said that the Soviet collapse is the worst geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. We are now on an escalation ladder. Putin has made his opening gambit, and he will want to see the response from the U.S. and its allies. Expect the separatists in the Donbass to invite Russia's military to move in and help them against perceived Ukrainian aggression. From a military perspective, here's what we can expect to see if a full-scale invasion is ordered by Putin. Electronic warfare will be combined with cyberattacks to paralyze the Ukraine government and military. Anything on the communication, GPS or magnetic spectrum will go dark, followed by salvos of ballistic missiles, waves of attacks that will look like us shock and awe, with warplanes targeting air defense systems, command-and-control. The next wave will include tube artillery and rocket launchers likely in the wee hours of the morning. Then he will insert his special forces, who we have been told have target lists of leading Ukrainian journalists, academics and potential opposition leaders. Expect the Russian forces to take over the radio and TV stations. And right before dawn, the paratroopers will be inserted to secure bridges and critical infrastructure. At first light, the tanks will cross the border and will move in on Kyiv. I'm told Ukraine's military will likely lose half their forces in those first hours. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians will lose their lives in the event of a full invasion, which could begin in the coming hours -- Neil.",

      "sentences": "Amazing. Jennifer, thank you so much. Jennifer Griffin following these fast-moving developments. We should say what worried a lot of analysts was something we got out of Vladimir Putin earlier today, long before he addressed the Russian people, when he talked about he is considering recognizing separatist states in Ukraine. Now, these are Russian-backed renegade states, Luhansk and Donetsk, in Ukraine. And the inference there was clear as a bell, that if there is hardship there or that they are under pressure there, or there's something manufactured even from Russia, Russian sympathizers there, he's going defend them. And that was very, very clear. And that prompted worries. To General David Petraeus right now, also the former CIA director, on when he makes of this. General, thank you for taking the time. What do you think Vladimir Putin does now?",

      "sentences": "It is very, very hard to say what he is planning at this point, other than that he has certainly positioned all of his forces to invade Ukraine, to provide a Russian example of shock and awe, if indeed he decides, if he calculates that that is worth pursuing. I would suspect that, having declared the independence and recognized the independence of the these rump republics that he supported the separatists in taking away, in a way, from Ukraine, that his recognition of them is a prelude to having Russian forces go in there, justified by actual cases that they have manufactured, Russia has manufactured, to claim that the Ukrainians have been shelling them or this kind of thing. I do think it still remains to be seen whether the scenario that Jennifer laid out so superbly does come to pass. He has to be considering two realities, if you will. One is that it would be very swift for Russia to take over part, if not all of Ukraine, indeed, to force its government out of Kyiv, at the very least. But then he has to be wondering, how painful would it be to absorb Ukraine, to swallow, if you will, what Ukrainians have promised would be a porcupine? Again, I have been part of an invasion. This is very similar to what we went through in 2003, when I was privileged to command the great 101st Airborne Division the eve of the invasion of Iraq. We're seeing the uncoiling of the combat forces, the positioning of rocket and missile and air and other combat enablers, as well as, most importantly, if you will, logistics, because, again, it's really logistics that will keep this invasion going without halts, as they get deep into Ukraine, if that order is given. So, again, having seen that, but also knowing, frankly, how difficult it is once you do, in effect, own a country, occupy a country, how difficult it can be if that country starts to generate an insurgency, starts to attract extremist forces, he has to be reflecting on the Soviet experience in Afghanistan and wondering, would this be as painful as that was? Would the West inflict so much damage on the Russian economy, for example? Would the West support the Ukrainian forces that continued to fight on? I'm just back from Munich...",

And he was making it very clear the breakup of the Soviet Union was a catastrophic event that he wants to amend, I think. And I wonder if these breakaway republics go way beyond Ukraine, and he is setting his sights beyond Ukraine, regardless of sanctions, either those already contemplated and those that might be implemented, like, immediately.

He has to be asking, in fact, already, has he -- in the back of his mind, has he made a mistake? He's trying to make Russia great again and astride the world stage and get the eyes of the world focused on him. What he's actually done is make NATO great again. He has given the greatest gift to NATO since the end of the Cold War, a reason to live, and, again, to hear the NATO secretary-general, to hear our vice president, to hear the other leaders from different NATO countries unified in a way that I have never heard at the Munich Security Conference in decades of going there since the time that I went during the Cold War as a speechwriter for the supreme allied commander in Europe. So, again, there have to be some misgivings in there, as confident as he projects an image of being. He has to be calculating, again, what does happen? It's the what happens after we own part or all of Ukraine. And, indeed, do we want to go back into former Russian republics that are now NATO members, that, therefore, enjoy the Article 5 guarantee of an attack on one is an attack on all?",

So, you can follow developments incredibly well just by going through TikTok, Twitter, and other sources of news, in addition to the mainstream media. And what this makes clear is how impressive the forces that have been marshaled on the borders of Ukraine are, in Belarus, of course, as well as in Russia. But, again, whether that final decision has been made, we won't know really until we see the opening salvos, as Jennifer so superbly described, what likely would unfold.",

And now there are growing thoughts here that it's -- if it's limited via sanctions to whom he can sell that, the fact of the matter, he has quite a wide network of people to whom he can. And that currency just reinforced his position, at least economically, oil prices moving up today very close to $100 a barrel yet again.

Parents should have choices about where their kids go to school. Oklahoma - - the governor of Oklahoma has proposed a universal voucher, an education savings account, where parents will decide where their kids go to school. West Virginia did it last year. Florida, Arizona, many other states have been leaders in this regard. So what we're seeing is a broadening out of this, of these issues for more transparency, higher quality, to make sure that we don't have eighth-grade level readers graduating from high school and bragging about how great our graduation rate is, and then empowering parents to make more choices, more informed choices about their students' future. I'm -- the pandemic has been a tragedy for so many people, loss of life, economic hardships, but it has created a -- I think a sustained sense of purpose for parents to be much more engaged in their kids' education.",

And so, first, I think we need to impose sanctions, and they need to be severe, not just on isolated oligarchs, but across -- across the board. We need to make sure that our European allies, who are on the front lines of all this, are supportive of the efforts, particularly Germany. And I think there needs to be a united front. And moments like this is not time to be critical. I think President Biden, after a disastrous policy initiative in Afghanistan, I think, has regained his footing, and America's leading.

      "sentences": "No question. I mean, from the time he was a child, there's a melancholy temperament. He suffers severe depressions. At one point in his early career, it was such a severe depression that his friends took all knives and razors and scissors from his room. But the great thing was that he got through those adversities with a greater strength and with a resilience. Ernest Hemingway once said, everyone is broken by life. But, afterwards, some are stronger in the broken places. And I think he brought that sense of humor, which was such an important part of him, which you see in this documentary over and over again, telling funny stories at the moments of highest crisis. People need to relax. People need to laugh. They need to laugh at themselves. And he would laugh louder than anybody else. And then he brought a sense of empathy with him to the presidency. If you look at that first inaugural, which we just saw part of, then you look at the second inaugural, then the North is finally winning that war, but no triumphant message does he deliver. On the contrary, he says, both sides were responsible. Both sides read the same Bible. Both prayed to the same God. Neither's prayers were fully answered. And then, of course, with malice toward none and charity for all, let us bind up our nation's wounds. It's that ability to look at both sides, I think. It's what we need in this country right now so badly. When I look at this problem with Ukraine, it's a democracy vs. a dictatorship. What is a democracy but a system of government that allows the people to choose their leaders in or out of power? And unless we feel a sense of common American identity -- this is what Teddy Roosevelt warned against, that democracy would be in peril if people in different sections and parties and regions began to regard each other as the other, rather than as common American citizens. So, maybe the hope is, as we're seeing NATO unite against Ukraine's -- Russians -- Russia's involvement in Ukraine, as we're seeing parts of our country come together, you're seeing the two sides of the Republican and Democratic Party coming together, maybe it'll teach us that we have to preserve our own democracy right now. And maybe it's the thing we have needed to start beginning to pull together. That would be the best thing of all this. And you provide solace, weirdly, by looking at the Civil War.",

      "utterance": "\"What are they hiding? Why is FOX not saying anything?\" Well, I was trying to make this clear on FOX Business, but, first off, Alex -- and I want to repeat it here -- because I asked them not to say anything. They were honoring my wishes. And they were respecting my privacy, though they were getting a lot of heat trying to protect that privacy. Now, I wasn't hiding anything. I just felt that it really wasn't a story. The stories on this show were and are the story. It's about you. It's not about me, just like this show. My opinion doesn't matter. What matters is the news. What matters is you. But this did drag on a long time, so you deserve an explanation from me. I gave it to FOX Business viewers. Now here goes for FOX News viewers. I did get COVID again, but a far more serious strand, what they call COVID pneumonia. It landed me in intensive care for quite a while, and it really was touch and go. So, some of you who wanted to put me out of my misery darn near got what you wished for. So, sorry to disappoint you. But, no, the vaccine didn't cause this. That grassy knoll theory has come up a lot, that I really have to put it to rest. My very compromised immune system did. Because I got cancer and now multiple sclerosis, I'm among the venerable and vulnerable, what, 3 percent of the population or so that simply cannot sustain the full benefits of a vaccine. In other words, it doesn't last. But let me be clear. Doctors say, had I not been vaccinated at all, I wouldn't be here. It provided some defense. But that is still better than no defense. Now, maybe that's not great comfort for some of you. I got to be honest. Frankly, it was not great comfort for me either. This was scary, so scary, I'm talking Ponderosa suddenly out of prime rib in the middle of the buffet line scary. If you don't know Ponderosa, it falls on deaf ears. Anyway, I'm not here to debate vaccinations for you, just offer an explanation for me. I figured I owed you that. I didn't want to become the story. But, for many of you, I did. Now you know my story. Time to get back to far more important matters and stories. And now I will, like what's going on right now in Ukraine and the threat of war that looms large. In just a moment, we will be talking to General David Petraeus on all of this and the White House now saying it is ready to respond immediately. What does that mean?

      "utterance": "Everything that has occurred in the past few hours, however, Neil indicates that Vladimir Putin has his sights set on all of Ukraine, not just the Donbass, his televised speech to the nation a chilling, distorted history lesson in which he talks about the mistakes Russian leaders going back to Vladimir Lenin made by separating Ukraine from Russia. It was almost verbatim what Putin said in a seminal 12-page speech back on July 12, 2021, sent to his armed forces entitled \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,\" in which he essentially outlined why he did not believe Ukraine has the right to exist as a separate nation. This was a cold and calculated speech in which he blamed past Soviet leaders like Nikita Khrushchev for giving into Ukrainian nationalism. It's the kind of speech that is reminiscent of those delivered on the eve of World War II before Hitler invaded Poland -- quote -- \"For some reason, Khrushchev gave Ukraine separate status,\" Putin said with disdain. \"Why did we have to be so generous and then give these republics the right to leave? Madness,\" he said. Putin has long said that the Soviet collapse is the worst geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. We are now on an escalation ladder. Putin has made his opening gambit, and he will want to see the response from the U.S. and its allies. Expect the separatists in the Donbass to invite Russia's military to move in and help them against perceived Ukrainian aggression. From a military perspective, here's what we can expect to see if a full-scale invasion is ordered by Putin. Electronic warfare will be combined with cyberattacks to paralyze the Ukraine government and military. Anything on the communication, GPS or magnetic spectrum will go dark, followed by salvos of ballistic missiles, waves of attacks that will look like us shock and awe, with warplanes targeting air defense systems, command-and-control. The next wave will include tube artillery and rocket launchers likely in the wee hours of the morning. Then he will insert his special forces, who we have been told have target lists of leading Ukrainian journalists, academics and potential opposition leaders. Expect the Russian forces to take over the radio and TV stations. And right before dawn, the paratroopers will be inserted to secure bridges and critical infrastructure. At first light, the tanks will cross the border and will move in on Kyiv. I'm told Ukraine's military will likely lose half their forces in those first hours. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians will lose their lives in the event of a full invasion, which could begin in the coming hours -- Neil."

      "utterance": "Amazing. Jennifer, thank you so much. Jennifer Griffin following these fast-moving developments. We should say what worried a lot of analysts was something we got out of Vladimir Putin earlier today, long before he addressed the Russian people, when he talked about he is considering recognizing separatist states in Ukraine. Now, these are Russian-backed renegade states, Luhansk and Donetsk, in Ukraine. And the inference there was clear as a bell, that if there is hardship there or that they are under pressure there, or there's something manufactured even from Russia, Russian sympathizers there, he's going defend them. And that was very, very clear. And that prompted worries. To General David Petraeus right now, also the former CIA director, on when he makes of this. General, thank you for taking the time. What do you think Vladimir Putin does now?"

    {
      "speaker": "PETRAEUS",
      "utterance": "It is very, very hard to say what he is planning at this point, other than that he has certainly positioned all of his forces to invade Ukraine, to provide a Russian example of shock and awe, if indeed he decides, if he calculates that that is worth pursuing. I would suspect that, having declared the independence and recognized the independence of the these rump republics that he supported the separatists in taking away, in a way, from Ukraine, that his recognition of them is a prelude to having Russian forces go in there, justified by actual cases that they have manufactured, Russia has manufactured, to claim that the Ukrainians have been shelling them or this kind of thing. I do think it still remains to be seen whether the scenario that Jennifer laid out so superbly does come to pass. He has to be considering two realities, if you will. One is that it would be very swift for Russia to take over part, if not all of Ukraine, indeed, to force its government out of Kyiv, at the very least. But then he has to be wondering, how painful would it be to absorb Ukraine, to swallow, if you will, what Ukrainians have promised would be a porcupine? Again, I have been part of an invasion. This is very similar to what we went through in 2003, when I was privileged to command the great 101st Airborne Division the eve of the invasion of Iraq. We're seeing the uncoiling of the combat forces, the positioning of rocket and missile and air and other combat enablers, as well as, most importantly, if you will, logistics, because, again, it's really logistics that will keep this invasion going without halts, as they get deep into Ukraine, if that order is given. So, again, having seen that, but also knowing, frankly, how difficult it is once you do, in effect, own a country, occupy a country, how difficult it can be if that country starts to generate an insurgency, starts to attract extremist forces, he has to be reflecting on the Soviet experience in Afghanistan and wondering, would this be as painful as that was? Would the West inflict so much damage on the Russian economy, for example? Would the West support the Ukrainian forces that continued to fight on? I'm just back from Munich..."

And they welcome any support that we will give them, in addition to what we have already provided to them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "General, I wonder if this is bigger than Ukraine. I mean, the Russian president made it very clear, in addressing the Russian people, that there's a long history here. And he was making it very clear the breakup of the Soviet Union was a catastrophic event that he wants to amend, I think. And I wonder if these breakaway republics go way beyond Ukraine, and he is setting his sights beyond Ukraine, regardless of sanctions, either those already contemplated and those that might be implemented, like, immediately. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETRAEUS",
      "utterance": "Well, if he goes into the former Russian republics of the Baltic states, he's going to bring NATO into it. Now, I'm sure that he does not want to do that. He has to be asking, in fact, already, has he -- in the back of his mind, has he made a mistake? He's trying to make Russia great again and astride the world stage and get the eyes of the world focused on him. What he's actually done is make NATO great again. He has given the greatest gift to NATO since the end of the Cold War, a reason to live, and, again, to hear the NATO secretary-general, to hear our vice president, to hear the other leaders from different NATO countries unified in a way that I have never heard at the Munich Security Conference in decades of going there since the time that I went during the Cold War as a speechwriter for the supreme allied commander in Europe. So, again, there have to be some misgivings in there, as confident as he projects an image of being. He has to be calculating, again, what does happen? It's the what happens after we own part or all of Ukraine. And, indeed, do we want to go back into former Russian republics that are now NATO members, that, therefore, enjoy the Article 5 guarantee of an attack on one is an attack on all?"

    {
      "speaker": "PETRAEUS",
      "utterance": "I don't, no. No. I think he has very clearly positioned his forces. If you listen carefully to what President Biden, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Tony Blinken and others have said, there's always a qualifier. They say that he has ordered his forces to prepare, or they have plans to invade, or they have positioned those forces. All of that is absolutely true. Again, this is also the first TikTok war. So, you can follow developments incredibly well just by going through TikTok, Twitter, and other sources of news, in addition to the mainstream media. And what this makes clear is how impressive the forces that have been marshaled on the borders of Ukraine are, in Belarus, of course, as well as in Russia. But, again, whether that final decision has been made, we won't know really until we see the opening salvos, as Jennifer so superbly described, what likely would unfold."

Well, the currency for anything that Vladimir Putin wants to do comes in oil prices, and they have been rocketing. They were up again today. And now there are growing thoughts here that it's -- if it's limited via sanctions to whom he can sell that, the fact of the matter, he has quite a wide network of people to whom he can. And that currency just reinforced his position, at least economically, oil prices moving up today very close to $100 a barrel yet again. We are on top of that, and on top of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who raised eyebrows when he complimented something going on in San Francisco. It wasn't what the government was doing there.

The number of students going to charter schools is up by more than 10 percent. Catholic schools, which had been in steady decline prior to the pandemic, even though there's a bunch of economic hardship and a lot of people had struggled to make ends meet, have seen an increase. Parochial schools have grown. Public schools have gone down because many school districts have had this attitude, holier than thousand, that we're the smart people, you're -- you just have to follow what we tell you to do. And it was OK when things -- when we had a -- people -- when parents weren't that engaged. But, during the pandemic, everybody became the math teacher of their kids. And they had to learn social studies. And they saw some of the -- some of the work that was being done. They saw the lack of connectivity, so their children couldn't learn. The learning losses have been really severe. And rather than focus on how do we regain our footing to make sure there's rising student achievement, again, many of these schools, not all, have -- have embraced this very liberal kind of ideology and have imposed it on schools. And it shouldn't be in there. Politics should have nothing to do with K-12 learning."

Parents should have choices about where their kids go to school. Oklahoma - - the governor of Oklahoma has proposed a universal voucher, an education savings account, where parents will decide where their kids go to school. West Virginia did it last year. Florida, Arizona, many other states have been leaders in this regard. So what we're seeing is a broadening out of this, of these issues for more transparency, higher quality, to make sure that we don't have eighth-grade level readers graduating from high school and bragging about how great our graduation rate is, and then empowering parents to make more choices, more informed choices about their students' future. I'm -- the pandemic has been a tragedy for so many people, loss of life, economic hardships, but it has created a -- I think a sustained sense of purpose for parents to be much more engaged in their kids' education."

Russia is an economic basket case. And they can't sustain this over a long haul without higher oil prices. And so, first, I think we need to impose sanctions, and they need to be severe, not just on isolated oligarchs, but across -- across the board. We need to make sure that our European allies, who are on the front lines of all this, are supportive of the efforts, particularly Germany. And I think there needs to be a united front. And moments like this is not time to be critical. I think President Biden, after a disastrous policy initiative in Afghanistan, I think, has regained his footing, and America's leading. And we will see if we continue to show resolve. Just sanctioning folks that are -- or prohibiting people investing in the runaway areas of Eastern Ukraine is not going to cut it. There needs to be much stronger actions. And I'm -- my guess is that they're working on those now."

And then we mark it up 15 percent. Then we have a $3 fill fee through our pharmacy partner Truepill, and then $5 for shipping. And that's with generic drugs. With brand drugs, we're starting to have those negotiations now, because the pharmaceutical manufacturers, the people who are creating and selling the drugs, don't like the current system either, because it paints them as the bad guys, when, in reality, these pharmacy benefit managers, the -- are the middlemen that really distort all the pricing with rebates and other things that they do. So, we truly can disrupt this. Now, are they going to respond? Are they going to try to match or beat our prices? Of course, but that's not necessarily a bad thing for patients out there either. But we have got so much momentum right now, that it's truly working.

That said, my greater goal than running for office when it comes to politics would get people to -- would be to get people to disaffiliate with any party. In my opinion, it's not -- it's not the voters for Donald Trump or the voters for Joe Biden that are the issue. It's just the structure, the fact that we have two parties, and everybody bandwagons to their team. And that's very disruptive. And so, to me, the best thing we can do is disaffiliate, don't be one side or the other, look at individual issues, and try to have an impact. And I think that's where my focus is going to be going forward, just trying to change the game and help as many people as I can. And I think, as an entrepreneur, I can do that. And not to keep on going back to Cost Plus Drugs, but just the response that we have gotten, so many people have to ration their medications or make a choice between rent or food or medicine.

And while that hasn't happened yet, it -- the events of the last few hours may be putting a Biden-Putin sit-down in jeopardy. What's going to happen next, according to Jen Psaki, is a very narrowly targeted group of sanctions. She said this. President Biden will soon issue an executive order that will prohibit new investment, trade and financing by U.S. persons to, from or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine. This E.O. will also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine. It is Presidents' Day. The president chose to be here, instead of Delaware, as expected. And we understand that he's been working the phone and meeting with advisers.

So it's obviously not time for a summit with him. And I don't think the limited sanctions against people in these two provinces in Eastern Ukraine are enough. I think this is the time for President Biden to say, we're going to hit Putin and Russia hard with the kind of extremely extensive sanctions that we have threatened them.

And we can't let it happen, or we will go back to a very unstable world. The Europeans are on the front lines there. They have to act. But the U.S. has a real interest in this as well.

There were factions in the North that -- some wanted emancipation right away. So wanted never to do it. They were conservatives, moderates, radicals. So what did he do? He had the humility, which doesn't mean humbleness -- what it means is the acknowledgement that you need help -- to put himself with a Cabinet of all these people who represented these different factions, many of whom were more educated, more -- more kind of celebrated, and each one of whom thought he wanted to be president, instead of Lincoln."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODWIN",
      "utterance": "No question. I mean, from the time he was a child, there's a melancholy temperament. He suffers severe depressions. At one point in his early career, it was such a severe depression that his friends took all knives and razors and scissors from his room. But the great thing was that he got through those adversities with a greater strength and with a resilience. Ernest Hemingway once said, everyone is broken by life. But, afterwards, some are stronger in the broken places. And I think he brought that sense of humor, which was such an important part of him, which you see in this documentary over and over again, telling funny stories at the moments of highest crisis. People need to relax. People need to laugh. They need to laugh at themselves. And he would laugh louder than anybody else. And then he brought a sense of empathy with him to the presidency. If you look at that first inaugural, which we just saw part of, then you look at the second inaugural, then the North is finally winning that war, but no triumphant message does he deliver. On the contrary, he says, both sides were responsible. Both sides read the same Bible. Both prayed to the same God. Neither's prayers were fully answered. And then, of course, with malice toward none and charity for all, let us bind up our nation's wounds. It's that ability to look at both sides, I think. It's what we need in this country right now so badly. When I look at this problem with Ukraine, it's a democracy vs. a dictatorship. What is a democracy but a system of government that allows the people to choose their leaders in or out of power? And unless we feel a sense of common American identity -- this is what Teddy Roosevelt warned against, that democracy would be in peril if people in different sections and parties and regions began to regard each other as the other, rather than as common American citizens. So, maybe the hope is, as we're seeing NATO unite against Ukraine's -- Russians -- Russia's involvement in Ukraine, as we're seeing parts of our country come together, you're seeing the two sides of the Republican and Democratic Party coming together, maybe it'll teach us that we have to preserve our own democracy right now. And maybe it's the thing we have needed to start beginning to pull together. That would be the best thing of all this. And you provide solace, weirdly, by looking at the Civil War."

But, at the end, the union was restored and emancipation secured. So, I think right now that projecting that strength is absolutely critical, and we have to do it at home and abroad.
