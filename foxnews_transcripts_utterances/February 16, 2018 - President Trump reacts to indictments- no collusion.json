Thirteen Russians and three Russian entities have been charged with an elaborate plot to interfere with our 2016 presidential election. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the announcement earlier and there is a lot to break down. Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge has all the details.

But then it really kicked off and picked up steam in mid-2016 when they took about five dozen people and specifically tasked them with the Russian interference in our election.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We begin with the breaking news today in the Special Counsel's Russia probe. Thirteen Russians and three Russian entities have been charged with an elaborate plot to interfere with our 2016 presidential election. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the announcement earlier and there is a lot to break down. Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge has all the details. Catherine."

      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Well, thanks, Kimberly. I was at that news conference at main Justice Department headquarters here in Washington when they released this 37-page indictment. The charges are against 13 Russian nationals. Three Russian organizations for allegedly defrauding the United States but specifically, the illegal use of social media to interfere in the election and in this particular case to support the candidacy of Donald Trump, and to disparage Hillary Clinton. One of the key things we learned today is that this operation really predates the confirmation of either of the leading candidates in the presidential election. It began in 2014, which is when it was seeded in St. Petersburg, Russia by an individual who is closely aligned with the Russian president. But then it really kicked off and picked up steam in mid-2016 when they took about five dozen people and specifically tasked them with the Russian interference in our election. Here's the deputy attorney general from earlier today."

      "speaker": "ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL",

      "utterance": "I have read the indictment twice now. And it's important to note that anyone who is conducted to the Trump campaign is unidentified in the indictment. They are referred to simply as members, volunteers, or supporters of the Trump campaign. Since that announcement today, the president has put out a tweet and it reads in part, Russia started their anti-U.S. campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for president. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong. No collusion. The deputy attorney general made clear today that at least on this digital piece, they found the Russian interference but they did not find any American was willingly cooperating with the Russians to amplify that effort. But the deputy attorney general was silent on other outstanding issues that may remain in the Russia case, Kimberly."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, couple of things. One such a surprise in partly, that because, while there are lots of leaks in other parts of the government, the Bob Mueller investigation, it pretty is air tight, like nobody knew it was coming. In fact, when the press conference was announced, it's going to happen at 1:15. Pretty much nobody knew what it was about. Some people speculated that Rod Rosenstein was going to resign, obviously that didn't happen and actually today's development probably ensures that Rod Rosenstein is not in any danger of being fired any time soon. I think it also proves that Mitt Romney was right. Remember in the campaign when he said to President Obama that the Russians were geopolitical enemy and Obama dismissed it, turns out that in 2014, this is when all of this started. We do know that everybody has been saying that the Russians try to do this all the time."

      "utterance": "Sure."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "So it's possible that maybe the Obama administration was monitoring it in 2014 and didn't think it was that big of deal. But it certainly ramps up. As, Juan, has said before, there is frustration on behalf of the Democrats that the president seemed to not have done more at the time. I think it's a solid indictment. I also think that it proves that Russian meddling was not a hoax. And so because the global threat hearing that happened this week -- there was a focus on this about what is happening in 2018, hopefully now and the president says in his statement today or the press secretary's statement that this is a time for everybody to work together to figure out a way to push back against the Russians. Also, for those of you Twitter box in St. Petersburg who are tweeting me during the election, I could say it but I won't. I won't. But it really - - it was a horrible thing to go through.

Greg, I just want to talk to you a second about, neither the president coming out right away with his own communication strategy in terms of tweeting about it and putting the postmark back to 2014 saying, look, this does not invalidate the authenticity, legitimacy of my campaign, my election as United States President.

They are the globe's trolls. And the thing is, we have to be very stoke about this because every time we get emotional about this stuff. And we have been emotional about this for a year, screaming at each other about whether the Russians did this and were we involved or were we colluding? They were winning. This was the whole point.

I'm not going to say that there was no collusion yet. I mean, there is still no evidence of collusion according to this indictment. So, what they did was basically information warfare. They set up a bunch of bots. It was only in the tens of millions of dollars. Not that expensive. And they buy a bunch of ads on Facebook. And when you think of how sophisticated it was, it wasn't that sophisticated. It was rudimentary. They would hire a person to dress up like Hillary, put a little blonde wig on and wear a prison jumpsuit and stand at a Trump rally.

Look at Colorado, et cetera, but again, maybe not knowing that you are dealing with Russians who are interfering.

But the interesting thing to me is I grew up in the 70's. I remember how cold warriors were so mocked by the left academia, media, Democrats over the Russian threat when they were eight time larger than they were now.

The FBI's Miami field office should have received that information up the chain of command as a potential threat to life to follow up and investigate. It did not happen. Five weeks later, 17 students and teachers are now dead. And former student 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz is charged with 17 counts of first degree murder. FBI Director Christopher Wray apologizing, quote, we have spoken with victims and families and deeply regret the additional pain this causes, all those affected by this horrific tragedy. And Republican Governor Rick Scott up in Tallahassee who was at the school Wednesday within hours of the massacre quickly sent out this very terse statement, quoting here. The FBI's failure to action against this killer is unacceptable. Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn't going to cut it. The FBI director needs to resign. Also getting word from the sub-sentinel who interviewed Broward County school superintendent Robert Runcie, that the crime scene, the three story behind me which is known as the freshman building and most of their classes are there that's why so many of these victims were just 14-years-old, they will never have to return to that building, any of the survivors.

It's not like this is something that is unfamiliar to us in terms of school shootings. And people usually do indicate and show some signs and make some overtures whether through communications, social media or otherwise, or do something where they tell somebody what they are about to do. So there are opportunities to be able to try to prevent something like this from happening. And when you think about it, like this should have been chased down. They should have and could have done better in a situation like this. Because quite frankly, all the elements were there, the statements, the intention, the ability to carry it out. The specifics of it in terms of being, you know, school shooter, somebody who was coming from a troubled background.

Number one, I said this before when you tell somebody, if they see something, say something. Then you better do something because we're taking a risk. When you see something and you say something, you're taking a risk. That person could come back and get you. And if the law enforcement is not there after they implore you to do, this then what good are you at that point? And, you know, I know like you said, it is really hard to chase down leads, because 80 percent of the time, probably 90 percent of the time they're just losers in a basement. And we know this working in television, we have all had threats. We have all dealt with law enforcement. I have been in situations where the threat is absolutely real, where the person comes to the city. I have had threats. We all had them that were nothing. But the point is, it is hard, but that's why they do the job. We're not allowed to do this. We're not allowed to go pursue threats because we would go to jail. It's up to them. If I knew that there was a kid on my street that was getting 20 local calls that had a large gun or putting in 20 calls that was planning on doing this, I can't stop him myself because I could go to jail. So I need law enforcement to do this. So I -- it's hard to find sympathy. I understand that there are mistakes. And it's a shame they were wrong on this one."

I had the greatest seats right in the center, and my husband kept saying, \"We can switch.\" And I said no, but I'm glad we did switch at the very end. It's a wonderful play. If you're coming to New York, get tickets so can you see it."
