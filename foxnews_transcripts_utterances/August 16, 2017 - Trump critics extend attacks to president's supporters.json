And he is smearing 60 million people. And a lot of people that are like him believe or not. Because I think he was one of the people predicted that Donald Trump would win and he was sympathetic to those people. I think he is finding a lot of energy and mileage out of this. But you aren't going to win in the hearts and minds by calling people racists. And especially if that person who you are attacking doesn't think they are racist. So, you should actually -- if you really feel that way, you should ask them how they feel instead of simply smearing them. Ask them if they are racist. And if they say, no, they aren't, then go well I think you are instead -- and then have the conversation. But just to smear people, and this will never happen. I'm just saying that this is how it would happen in an actual dialogue. But when you start from this point of smearing people, you are eliminating debate and you are increasing the likelihood of violence. Michael Moore increases the likelihood of violence by smearing people because he's saying, I can't have a conversation."

He made a great statement 48 hours later but then now it's escalated into, you know, a further national upset, and people are really deeply hurt and offended by it. And, you know, that makes me feel bad, it's very sad to see. Because, you know, we are better than this as a country, we've come so far, we would love to celebrate all the things we have in common and the values that we stand for as a country, welcoming so many from all different walks of life and all different religions and nationalities.

And then there was a decision that started -- I just read a piece that on Sunday night -- there was a call to the CEOs that said, what do you think? And by this morning, the President was like, okay, we'll just end it right here. It's not necessarily great going into a fall when you need a budget and tax reform and other things like that.

You know, a lot of these businessmen are very skittish. The first hint of controversy they're going to bail anyway. The Trump's business savvy guy and I think he recognizes it now. And I'm very glad Trump did not discuss Nazis today. Very glad. Sometimes let's say, you have an argument with your girlfriend or your boyfriend and you really want to win the argument. And sometimes you win the argument but you lose over the long-term? And, you know, there is no doubt about it. Donald Trump got to bloodied up. He may have won the battle with the press the other day but he definitely left with a lot of scars. Technically he was right, both sides were violent, one side was most -- much more morally repugnant than the other side and that's what the media was expecting him to condemn and he fought back on that. He was more focused on the physical violence instead of the ideals that one side was putting forward. So, the Saturday and the Monday comments I thought were fine and I understand them and they are terrific. But then, the press conference yesterday was very high risk. Takes a lot of courage to go in their swing when you're talking about neo-Nazis, talking about neo-Nazis, not the best territory you want to fight on in an argument. It's kind of, even if you win, you lose."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, right. But I mean, that's not Trump's style, I mean, he has to defeat the press. And do it mercilessly. So, I think the thing that the business community really had trouble with was the one line in the press conference yesterday when he said, there were some fine people who were marching peacefully in the rally to prevent the removal of the confederate statue. Well, fine people are also marching alongside with neo-Nazis. He really litigated the riot. And, you know, you kind of don't want to really delineate, you know, who the good people and the bad people, it's still kind of a neo-Nazi rally. And I think that's where he got caught up. Now, a traditional politician would have just done what most politicians would have done, kick the Nazi in the face, comforted the nation and moved on. But Donald Trump is not a traditional politician. It's kind of like the Obama birth certificate situation. He pushed that hard, it got a lot of attention in the beginning but eventually became a losing hand for him and then had to stop talking about it. So, I'm glad to see the President now has to stop talking about Nazis, that's going to be a good thing. But I know that Donald Trump is not racist in his heart. You said this the other day, he's not a bigot, he is very generous, he is very compassionate, he loves all Americans. And he gave the media an opportunity to really smear him, because they're going to take whatever he says out of context and uses words against them. So, he has to be very careful. I know Donald Trump likes to punch and he moves forward and he punches like a boxer. But sometimes you want to see the President with a little bit of head movement and dodge and weave. Because he comes out after the round, he's got some cuts."

And there is nobody there protesting against them. That's them defining themselves with those anti-Semitic statements. Carrying the torches, that are so reminiscent of crosses burning on black lawns on the like and they're talking about Jews won't replace us and blood and soil which are anti-Semitic slogans with powerful meaning. So, they are defying themselves. So, the next day, when they show up and now the protesters show up and the protesters are ready because you have these young men who have weapons and torches and the like, then somehow Donald Trump says, oh, that's an equivalence. So, to me, and I think I said this yesterday to you. The people who fight Nazis are not to be equated with Nazis. And people who stand up for American values and say that we despise this kind of action, it's not in keeping with our heritage are not to be equated with white supremacists and neo-Nazis. You know, Bernie Sanders had something really interesting to say today that I think is so important for us at this table to hear.

The media is actually mainstreaming anti-fa, using this kind of crassly, this event to mainstream of violent group. And I think it's really an important. Juan, you're right to call out a violent groups on your side. Both sides should do that. Now, this is where I'm going to get to a point about white, you know, during the campaign, I never tried to Trumpsplain what he did because there are other options available. It's not my place to explain his mistakes. As a president now, I tried to give them the benefit and I tried to analyze and understand the mistakes he makes. Based on my experience, the only obvious answer I have for what he did was pure ignorance. When I woke up on Saturday morning and I saw the pictures of the tiki stuff, I had no idea what that was. I think it was some weird -- like who were these guys going to a luau? No clue. Throughout the afternoon, I never heard of any of those groups. That's ignorance. Because as a right wing libertarian at FOX News, my focusing on anti-fa and all those people that are out there beating up protesters and I never heard of these guys. And my guess is perhaps he had never heard of them either so he saw four groups there. He saw counter protesters spoiling for a fight, counter protesters not spoiling for a fight, racist marchers spoiling for a fight, other marchers not spoiling for a fight. That's how he saw it. He was likely wrong. He was wrong. But do you see what I'm trying to say? It came from an ignorance about what was going on."

By attributing the acts of ghoulish racists to a party or large swaths of America, they steer us away from civility on toward fury. The media has different rules depending on the guy. I remember one network linking the shooting of Stevens Scalise to his voting record. How is that not condemning both sides? And if you point out the past violence of antifa, of course, that now means you endorse Nazis. I don't know how you get there. Anyway, Americans can handle far more than the media's binary thinking.

People are starting to say, I would going to cry and all of that. And you hear in the immediate aftermath from Republicans, I mean, on this network, Charles Krauthammer saying, it was a moral disgrace. Guy Benson saying, Trump lost me in that moment. Kat Timpf saying, she was about to start crying despite her make-up. You hear people saying, well, that was something. And I think that signals to you that it's not just media or far left people but people like would just like, wow, what just happened at Trump Tower? What did he do? So, it was compelling. Now, in response to what you're saying about this Trump, that or whatever, I think when you are at a point where we are talking about race wars, were talking about the country being so deeply divided, I was on TV on one of our shows, \"OUTNUMBERED\" and one of our co- hosts started crying. I mean, anything I say is going to be taking wrong or misinterpreted, I'm going to be called a racist. I just want to talk to you. It's just that kind of emotionally powerful.

Of course you denounce absolutely what happened and what these people stand for, there is no place for it in any society, in any country, in any place whatsoever. Okay? So, that's very simple. And I think trying to further explain it is where the President got in trouble and trying to say, oh, there was violence as well from the other side. They were wrong too.

I haven't seen one legitimate news interview with an anti-fa member and they are all the way out there. They're everywhere. And then Black Lives Matter, they've elevated that group big time and they are responsible for a lot of violent acts. So, you have this kind of tribal collision course in Charlotte where all of these people descend on to one place in a very lackadaisical police department and it's a powder keg. Now, Trump has been called a Nazi for a year by the media. A Nazi commits a crime, now Trump is an accessory to the crime, that's outrageous. And for a decade, the media has pushed that white privilege needs to be eradicated. Now they see speech and certain symbols need to be eradicated. But then you have a lot of these, quote, \"Marginalized groups\" that, you know, they can do anything, they can riot, they can break the law, they can yell and they can scream and they can block traffic. But they're righteous because they have justice on their side. So, when the media creates division, they do that to create conflict because conflict creates results for the left.

I don't think that is appropriate and shouldn't be allowed at all. I guess it's good to get these out. Turnabout is fair play. In four or eight years, President Trump will no longer be President and his supporters will not like it if the next President tries to look back in all sorts of things going back to 2008."

I didn't know she played, I wonder what her handicap is. They talked about grandchildren.
