It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Embattled labor secretary Alex Acosta vigorously defending what's been called the sweetheart 2008 plea deal with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta facing a firestorm of criticism this week after Epstein's recent arrest on sex trafficking charges in New York. The secretary saying today the millionaire is a bad man who deserves to be in jail, but is also standing by his actions as a prosecutor in Florida back then. Acosta claiming state officials were ready to let Epstein walk free before his office intervened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALEX ACOSTA, LABOR SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "The Palm Beach state attorney's office was ready to let Epstein walk free, no jail time. Our prosecutors, as is 2008 article recounts presented the ultimatum. Plead guilty to more serious charges, charges that required jail time, registration, and restitution, or we'll roll the dice and bring a federal indictment. Without the work of our prosecutors, Epstein would have gotten away with just that state charge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Part of the controversial plea deal allowed Epstein to avoid potentially serving the rest of his life in jail, and spend just 13 months behind bars. Epstein was allowed out of jail to go to work for 12 hours a day, and only had to sleep in jail. Acosta saying that's not part of what he negotiated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ACOSTA",
      "utterance": "When we proceeded, the expectation was that it would be an 18 month sentence, and the expectation was that it would be served in jail. And so this work release was complete B.S. And I've been on record as far back as 2011 saying that it was not what was bargained for and it was not what we expected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Acosta was also asked several times to apologize to Epstein's victims, but not directly do so. But here's part of what he said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ACOSTA",
      "utterance": "I understand what the victim say, and I'm not here to try to say that I can stand in their shoes or that I can address their concerns. I'm here to say we did what we did because we wanted to see Epstein go to jail."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Jesse, Alex Acosta has been in the crosshairs because he was the U.S. attorney at the time, but there is new evidence, apparently, that the SDNY has here in New York, and that he decided to try to defend himself today. How do you think he did?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I think he did fine. I think he'll settle the waters to a certain extent. I learned new information. He was the one, as the state's attorney to come in and tell the locals stop with the soft deal. He actually made them step up the stringent deal. And they were going to get away with it if he hadn't come in. Also, it was a female prosecutor on the local level that did it, and he explained that. He was just trying to get him to serve some time because you risk when you go to trial in a case like this the victims will get destroyed under cross-examination. Victims were treated a lot differently back then. He's got a lot of high-priced attorneys. And he might have been able to wiggle out of this, so he did what he could do at the time. Now, the point is why are we talking about Acosta? This is a person, Epstein, who was a serial pedophile. We should be talking about him. We should be talking about his victims. And why is there no interest in Bill Clinton, an ex-president who flew all around the world with a known pedophile without secret service. There's discrepancy over the flight logs. This guy, Epstein, was instrumental in help launching the Clinton global initiative. They were friends personally, professionally. Epstein showered Democrats with tons of donations. Why has the media decided to focus on Acosta? It's just to get a scalp. Because, to me, doesn't seem like they really care about the victims, which was Juan's point yesterday. It's like all these guys. You have Harvey Weinstein. You have Bill Cosby, Epstein, all these guys. Everybody knows what's going on. It's an open secret. But the minute the tables turned, people say, oh, you know, let's get this guy when it's advantageous. Let's turn the tables on this guy and they never really care about the victims at the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "To that point, Greg, I don't know if you saw the press conference, but the first question from the media was not about the victims, and it wasn't about Jeffrey Epstein. It was about Alex Acosta's relationship with President Trump and how was it at the moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. No -- OK, so -- the first -- why is Acosta embattled? Because we live in a media -- in a media world where objective news and the Democratic consensus are exactly the same. So only could a Democratic donors' perversion reflect badly on a Republican. I mean, it is amazing. Here's a super, ultra, pervert who is a Democratic donor, and the story is about this guy, Acosta."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I've said this yesterday, and I still maintain it, 99.9 percent of the people yakking about this guy had no idea who he was two days ago. I thought -- I saw Acosta trending. I thought it was Jim Acosta. I had no idea. So I do find the outrage slightly political. So, to your point, why is Acosta the story? Because Trump is president. If Trump wasn't president, this would not be going on. They're not talking about pre -- what is pre -- what didn't pre go after him or side vans. Why -- what is side vans' role? What about Bill Clinton. This happened in 2007, and we're seeking the scalp of somebody in 2019 because the scalp is directly connected to Donald Trump. That's what it boils down to. Although, I will say this, I'm glad the guy is going away. He probably will go away for a long time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "We'll see. That trial will get underway, eventually. They have the next hearing on Monday. Juan, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, let's just be clear here. I don't think that we need to get political about this. I think that everybody can agree that his behavior is horrific, right? I think that was the language even President Trump with regard to this guy. And, you know, I mean, just put yourself in the shoes of -- not the victim, but the parents. There's a little girl -- this guy is messing around with little girls. I mean, that's just -- it's just awful. And the second thing to say is that I think that the reason that the first question to him was about President Trump is that there's tremendous pressure on him to resign. And the pressure is coming not only from the Democrats, Pelosi, Schumer, and the senate, you also see some Republicans in the Senate. But more specifically there've been reporting that some of the president's intimates, people like Chris Ruddy at Newsmax, even Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff, have never felt that, in fact, Acosta has been a true believer, not doing enough in terms of deregulation and the like, and that this is a threat to President Trump because, again, it involves women and mistreatment of juvenile women, but women, and it hurts the president. And if it's going to become damaging to President Trump, if it's going to give fodder to people who are his critics, well, then Acosta has got to go. That's why they're interested in knowing about his relationship. But, you know, just on the press conference, Dana, I think today we heard his side of the story, and he said, oh, this -- what about these other prosecutors, what about these other people who -- they might not have been any jail time. Look, we heard his voice. We still haven't heard the voices of the young people who were abused. And --"

That's according to reporting in the New York Times. This is about the victims and it's about a miscarriage of justice. It's about a non-prosecution agreement that was struck in secret, and the victims were kept in the dark. And a federal judge, actually, earlier this year, ruled that this secrecy violated a federal law that requires the government to alert crime victims of plea agreements and deals to give them an opportunity to oppose them. That being said, Alex Acosta is the labor secretary. He's expendable. He's utterly replaceable. And in this administration, he has one job and that is to promote job growth in this country, to talk about it when it's great, to talk about how wages are growing at the fastest pace in a decade. And he's not even the face on -- when the jobs report come out."

As his popularity shrinks faster than his own spine, Beto's efforts to sow division only expand. He's like a bitter divorced husband trashing the ex-wife to his poor kids. If he can't be happy, no one can. It used to be the politicians running for office had a number of tools at their disposal, not Beto. He is the tool. Talk about a blunt object. Its only function is to create victims out of brown and black Americans, so that they might look to him, the great white scarecrow, as their savior. But now it's true, confidence is exposed as a farce. For so long his failures were propped up by a bottomless spousal income and assisted by a Vanity Fair cover bestowed on him by a pale liberal enamored that he looked just like them. He was as white, patronizing, slick, and elitist as the magazine, all that's missing was the smelly cologne ads. He's so white, wonder bread could sue him for plagiarism. Now he's reduced to playing for radical scraps, dancing to the fight songs of undergrads in safe spaces, a windup toy for brats and Che Guevara shirts. He'll say anything. So now we're all racist by birth, he shouts, like a hopeless lonely slob at last call desperate for a phone number. I'd say go home, you're drunk. But he might drive.

I mean, with that said, I understand what he's saying. He's a Britain first guy. He's concerned that Trump's approach is America first. And the president is obviously reasserting American dominance in trade and security arrangement and that's upsetting a lot of other countries. But he also had a lot of other great observation such as, if you want to get through to Trump, speak bluntly. Make a personal phone call. And his energy at his rallies were really, really powerful.

So, maybe they're learning to choose other things. But Pearl Harbor is still pretty bad. Fear is the quickest way to get to your pocketbook and they take an issue and they make taxation the only solution. To your point, their demands when you're talking about gasoline can only be endured by the white rich. Let's face it. It's a white liberal rich, the Tom Steyer's of the world that can endure these climate change restrictions, but it's going to harm the lives of minorities. Right. This is the most anti-minority issue, blue collar Americans as well. You're talking about eliminating jobs, restricting modes of transportation, increasing prices on basic living needs like gasoline. These are things that rich white people can just shrug off and go and then feel really good about the fact that they have a Tesla and they could feel really good that they have solar panels, because it's totally affordable to them and then everybody else is like--"

He has a new book out called Panic Attack, Young Radicals in the Age of Trump. I urge everybody to read that book. It's fantastic. Young kids, college kids, old kids, GOATS. Anyway. And now on my podcast, I'm so excited about the One, My Podcast I have Joe Escalante, the original basis and founder of the legendary punk band, The Vandals. And we just talk about the history of punk rock. It is so much fun. We talk about everything, music business. I think you'll enjoy it and that's enough for me."

There was a burglary while he and his friends were out bowling, and these people stole his dog. His dog Lucci, that's a Pomeranian. He begged people to bring him back. He even offered a reward and authorities didn't release details, but he said this. I can't believe it; I just want to say a big thank you to everyone in social media who supported us and raised awareness. I'm so thankful."
