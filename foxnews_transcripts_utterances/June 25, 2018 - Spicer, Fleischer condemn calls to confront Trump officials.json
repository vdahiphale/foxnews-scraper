And I think, we all Americans regardless of where you follow the political spectrum need to push back when Maxine Waters said you should push back on them, create a crowd and you push back on them. I think that is very troubling. The idea of seemingly using force to hurt somebody. You've seen people go and now make this personal, going to their places of business, places of where they eating.

And so, she still is sticking by what she's done now. Senator Schumer, to his credit, the Democratic Minority Leader went on the floor of the Senate and really condemned her. Nancy Pelosi put out a milquetoast condemnation of Maxine Waters. But frankly, Democrats in the House of Representatives where she serves were all need to get asked. Do you agree with Maxine Waters? The press needs to have a feeding frenzy among the left as they always do on the right where they try to ask Republicans. Do you agree with this or that, that somebody else said? It's her turn now."

Sean made the point about Congressman Scalise on the baseball field. And don't forget, during the campaign of 2016, the GOP headquarters in North Carolina was firebombed.

If you don't like what's going on, we need to have a discussion about the policy and why it's going on. Now, granted there's been a ramp up here because there is a zero tolerance of these. You know, so which essentially meant that the laws that were on the books and the decision by the Ninth Circuit Court meant that all of that was going to be enacted. Which says that if you are apprehended, you will be separated because that Court decided that it was not proper to incarcerate the families together. You had to separate the children out. So, this is a policy that has been in place for a long time. It was well in place during the Bush and Obama administrations. And as we showed the pictures are exactly like they were then. So, Sean, I mean that this is what's been lost in this whole conversation, and I can't understand why these same people weren't hysterical back then."

      "speaker": "SPICER",

Where he talked about the fact that after Sarah politely decided to get up not make a scene and leave that restaurant, many people according to John's report got up including the owner and followed her down the street trying to harass her further. I mean, this is now gotten well beyond stating an opinion or free speech. This is now intimidation and it's threatening violence, which I think is crossing a big line. But to your point, Martha, we have a way in a Democracy to decide that we don't like policies of a particular party. We go to an election, we organize, and we vote out the party we don't like, and we vote for the people that we do like. The reality is, is the president -- the president of United States is enforcing the laws on the books. If the people don't like the laws on the books, either vote people out and in that you like, or encourage those in office to change the law. But we don't revert -- resort to violence, and we certainly, don't encourage it. And let me just say this for the people on both sides, it's wrong with your Republican, it's wrong if you're a Democrat, it's wrong if you're conservative. And we can spend the rest of the night debating who started it. But I'd rather engage in a discussion of how to stop it and how to move forward because this is not the right direction for our country right now. We need to understand that we can respectfully disagree on policies, we can be fierce partisans, but we can be civil and respectful of our fellow man and woman."

Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy, and law, and order.\" What do you think, Ari? He got a lot of heat for that today."

Why do you have to let them land, and then, go through a whole court process? And I think there's just something common-sensical about that. On the other hand, we are a nation of laws that is what makes us great. And when people do come and they are in our country, they've crossed that border, under our Constitution, all persons -- not citizens, persons are entitled to due process. And so, we have to go through it. That is what makes us great. And you know, law -- it's said that laws are the restraints that make us free, and that's true, they're a restraint. But because those restraints they make us free, and those restraints come with burdens. And all those burdens is to have a judicial process in place. I hope it's fast, I hope it's quick, and I hope it's fair. And people who don't belong here shouldn't be here. Look, I'm a son of an immigrant, my mother came here."

If you come here legally, your family is never going to be separated. In fact, your family is likely going to thrive because of everything America offers.

So, I think the president understands clearly what's at stake this November, and I think he wants to make sure that the American people and his supporters understand the binary choice that's at stake. It's his agenda, it's continuing to have tax cuts less regulation, a thriving economy, or it's Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who are going to raise our taxes, spend more money.

He hasn't wanted to criticize that in any way but he has -- when he saw that I.G. report he was quite clear that he was horrified by the way that this high-level FBI agent was talking about the cases that he was covered. Here's a quote from Sharyl Attkisson who wrote a column about it in The Hill today entitled What Did Peter Strzok do? And she writes the earth-shattering finding on Strzok confirms a citizenry's worst fears. A high-ranking government intel officials allegedly conspired to affect the outcome of a U.S. presidential election. And here's the chilling part. If it weren't for the I.G.'s investigation requested by Congress, he would likely still be helping lead the Special Counsel's investigation of Trump today. Your thoughts on that, Jonathan."

I challenge anyone to say that you know, with a fair reading of that report that everything is fine. That being said there is no evidence that he liked -- the missing piece is what actions he took as an investigator to put his thumb on the scale.

It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event that you die before you're 40. So you know the question is what did he -- how did he act on that. And the Inspector General found that he could not draw a straight line between those comments and the action that the FBI took. But I think one of the interesting things, Jonathan, is going to be the questions that go around how did you treat the two investigations differently because he was central in the Hillary e-mail investigation as well as being central in the Trump Russia investigation and the treatment appears to be very different."

Once a person is on our soil, no matter how they got here they're entitled to protection. What can he do about it? He can ship judges from New Jersey and North Dakota -- my friends on the bench are not going to be happy at the suggestion -- down to the border and they can start these hearings which are not full-blown jury trials that take months.

MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF POLITICS & PUBLIC SERVICE: Yes. I think President Obama has been very measured, strategic and smart about how he has engaged in the political debate since he has left office. He hasn't been 100 percent silent. He has weighed in on a couple of issues the effort to defund Obamacare, on immigration on a couple of issues like that. But if you look at how he has addressed each of those, it's been very measured. He has spoken or at least tried to speak more inspirational. He doesn't speak about President Trump by name, which is a courtesy the current president doesn't afford him, but he talks about sort of what our values are when it comes to these issues. And I think that's an appropriate place for him to be.

Where the former -- the tradition that the former president stays quiet and doesn't criticize his predecessor. I mean, Barack Obama enjoyed this courtesy from George W. Bush. George W. Bush, when he came in Barack Obama did not in the quite exact way but he did the same thing as Donald Trump is doing. He criticized George W.

      "utterance": "But the camera is a rather dizzying. So let me apologize for that on the right-hand side of your screen but we are waiting for the president to deplane Air Force One and head over to this rally. Just quickly you guys with regard to Harley-Davidson because the president tweeted about this evening as well which has to do with the economy and it has to do with trade. And he urged them to be patient. He said he was disappointed in their decision. I think, you know, the suggestion is that this process is only in the early stages, and for companies to pull up stakes and move at this point is may be a little premature. Marc?"

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Yes. I don' know if that's premature. They are making decisions based on business decisions and base on public policy. I mean, this is the big problem is that, you know, when President Trump imposes tariffs on steel and aluminum, there are more people who use steel and aluminum to make things in America by many fold than there are people in the steel and aluminum industries. And so he is -- actually we're going to lose jobs for the predominant Americans that he went to fight for. So these policies and then you can add in the trade war and all of a sudden there are retaliatory tariffs that we have here from the European Union and even more American jobs are at stake. So you know, just a few month or a year ago he was sitting on the front lawn with it or the South Lawn of the White House with Harley-Davidson executives--"

      "utterance": "So we do expect at any moment President Trump will take the stage in South Carolina, he is there for Henry McMaster as we've been saying she -- he replaced Nikki Haley as South Carolina governor, and now he's himself into a run off a situation for the GOP nomination. So he needs some help. He's running against businessman John Warren who hopes to unseat him as the next governor of the state of South Carolina. And Jonathan Serrie is there and he is watching as we await the president. Jonathan, are the folks getting excited at this point now that the president is almost there?"

      "speaker": "JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "They are. They are. In fact, during the commercial break, they announced that the president was on his way and the crowd began cheering. In fact, I'll step out of the way to give you a review of the crowd. More than a thousand people packing a relatively small gym at airport high school here in West Columbia and they are enthusiastic because many of these people were waiting before the thunderstorm arrived out in the hot sun, humid air and temperatures reaching about 100 degrees just to guarantee a spot to see the president. Mr. Trump is coming to South Carolina to return a favor to Henry McMaster who, while serving as lieutenant governor was an early supporter of his 2016 won for the White House. In 2017, McMaster rose to the governorship when Nikki Haley left to join the administration as United Nations ambassador. McMaster led a five way GOP primary race on June 12th, but failed to pass the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff. And so now President Trump is coming to South Carolina in hopes of pushing McMaster over the edge. Martha, back to you."

The president has gotten involved very early in the primary process across the country and he's doing a number of these rallies, another one later this week. So we're going to be watching very closely as he tries to have an impact on some of the early stages here. We're going to take a quick break and we will take you back to the president live in West Columbia, South Carolina after this."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. There we go. Almost an hour late due to thunderstorms in the South Carolina area. The president has now entered the room to big cheering crowds.
