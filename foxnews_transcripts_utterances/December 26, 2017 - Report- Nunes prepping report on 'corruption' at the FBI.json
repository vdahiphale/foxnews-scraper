The Washington Post says a small group of Republicans, including Representative Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee, are talking about writing a report in the new year, highlighting alleged corruption at the FBI, and focusing on the conduct of FBI officials during the Russian investigation. Politico is reporting something similar that a group of the House Republicans, led by Nunes, has been secretly meeting for months, trying to build a case that shows senior officials that the FBI and Department of Justice improperly, maybe criminally, handled the now notorious dossier. Fox News has not independently confirmed the report, but all of this comes as President Trump continues to attack the FBI. Sources tell Fox News acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is eligible for retirement in March. Three days ago, a number of outlets reported that McCabe would retire in the new year and almost immediately. President Trump took to Twitter repeatedly attacking McCabe on Tuesday. The president took to Twitter again seemingly quoting something \"Fox & Friends\". He wrote that the dossier is bogus and the FBI is tainted. He then added, \"they use this crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump campaign.\" McCabe testified on Capitol Hill for over 14 hours behind closed doors just last week. The Democrats say Republicans are trying to discredit the special counsel's Russia investigation. Republicans disagree.

The 45 percent of filers who are between 40,000 and 200,000 income, basically the middle-class, they pay about 38 percent of the taxes today. They get 52 percent of the tax cut. So, most of the tax cut flows to them. And at the top, the top five percent who pays 60 percent of the tax burden, 59.5 percent today, they get 44 percent of the tax cut.

It's our quote of the night. \"When I think about Christmas, and I think about Senator McCain, I think of giving. The sacrifices John McCain has made for our country and especially the men and women he's served with in the military are incredible. As a prisoner of war in Vietnam he missed six Christmases with his family back home and suffered unbelievable hardship. Today, my friend, Senator John McCain, again, finds himself in a battle, this time it's with cancer. And the treatment he is undergoing is exhausting. I wish him a Merry Christmas today, and I pray he lives another 20 years.\" Senator McCain is expected back in Washington after the holidays. Beautiful quote, indeed. All right.

Good evening, everyone. I'm Trish Regan in for Martha MacCallum. A bombshell report tonight from The Washington Post, revealing House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes has damaging information \"the conduct of FBI officials in the course of the Russia investigation\". This comes in the wake of a series of revelations casting doubt on the fairness of Mueller's probe, including those anti-Trump texts sent by one of Mueller's former top investigators. And news that senior DOJ official and his wife has ties to Fusion GPS, the firm behind the anti-Trump dossier. Meanwhile, Trump's legal team insisting the probe into the president is winding down. Fox's Ellison Barber is live in Washington to get us up to speed here with our top story. Ellison."

The Washington Post says a small group of Republicans, including Representative Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee, are talking about writing a report in the new year, highlighting alleged corruption at the FBI, and focusing on the conduct of FBI officials during the Russian investigation. Politico is reporting something similar that a group of the House Republicans, led by Nunes, has been secretly meeting for months, trying to build a case that shows senior officials that the FBI and Department of Justice improperly, maybe criminally, handled the now notorious dossier. Fox News has not independently confirmed the report, but all of this comes as President Trump continues to attack the FBI. Sources tell Fox News acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is eligible for retirement in March. Three days ago, a number of outlets reported that McCabe would retire in the new year and almost immediately. President Trump took to Twitter repeatedly attacking McCabe on Tuesday. The president took to Twitter again seemingly quoting something \"Fox & Friends\". He wrote that the dossier is bogus and the FBI is tainted. He then added, \"they use this crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump campaign.\" McCabe testified on Capitol Hill for over 14 hours behind closed doors just last week. The Democrats say Republicans are trying to discredit the special counsel's Russia investigation. Republicans disagree. Take a listen."

The Republicans are right, we're seeing more and more of those every day, but you can do both. You finish the investigation, you can see where, as Jason Chaffetz said, where the facts go, and you can also investigate the FBI because what we are learning is very, very troubling.

It's something the president has been pointing to, and I can share some of the tweets with you, he certainly went after Andrew McCabe over the weekend saying that FBI's Andrew McCabe in addition to his wife getting all the money from Clinton puppet, he was using, allegedly, his FBI official e-mail account to promote her campaign -- you obviously cannot do that. He went on to say: \"FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefit, 90 days to go.\" Representative, are you concerned that McCabe had a real conflict of interest there, even if it wasn't real? Just the perception of conflict of interest, really, for many people makes it quite real, and might that have sacrificed his ability to look aggressively into the Clinton campaign e- mail?"

When his wife started to run for the assembly there in Virginia, he decided to recuse himself of everything that was involved in Virginia, but it was only later and I believe. And I have to check my notes, but after he got a promotion, he rescinded that and said OK, I will oversee that, even though it involved Hillary Clinton, the e-mail scandal. Hillary Clinton had come to Virginia, had done raiser more than half a million dollars, ended up in his wife's campaign account. I mean, that is but just one of the factors that you have to look at and say what in the world is going on?

If they, for some reason, were coerced to plead guilty or didn't lie as they have acknowledged they did, fine. But I think, that part of the investigation has to go forward. No, we're talking about the credibility of the FBI. I'm speaking to it in terms of two guilty plays. The same issue that Trish Regan raised."

    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",

And Alan Dershowitz has said to me, look, once you get a special prosecutor in there, there's no telling what they're going to come up with. And his concern, his fear is that they're going to go after a guy like General Flynn who has a few skeletons in his closet and clearly has lied before, including to our own vice president."

      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, frankly, he had the highest defense intelligence post in the United States. He is a respected man who's made some very serious mistakes. I think you cannot just throw out anything he would say willy-nilly. Let's hear what he has to say. Obviously, he got a sweetheart deal, there's a reason for that. We have to know why and for what reason he got that agreement. But I agree with Representative Chaffetz, we need an investigation of the FBI, but the two, I believe, go on different tracks."
    },

      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "So, the inspector general had turned up with some things that so far aren't looking very good on the FBI's part, Jason Chaffetz. I guess, the question is, and then there was an interesting op-ed in \"USA Today\" about this very issue, how much longer until we really know what's going on at the FBI? And as the clock, in fact, ticking on the FBI if more things, like the texts, we saw turn out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Look, I give a lot of weight to what Michael Horowitz and his team, the Inspectors General, there at the Department of Justice are doing. They have 450 employees, they have tens of millions of dollars at their disposal, they've embedded already within the bowels of the Department of Justice. You don't have, you know, a starting factor where they have to go and familiarize themselves with this. Michael Horowitz and his team have been looking at this the better part of nine or ten months. I do anticipate that they'll be ready to go at the end of March. They've been silent, you haven't heard any leaks. They did go back and informed Mr. Mueller that there were some nearly 10,000 texts between somebody who is supposed to be in-charged, having an affair supposedly with somebody, exchanging 10,000 texts that showed not only bias but maybe flat-out collusion, making that aware of them. Again, the inspector general, I think, will have the most definitive report and it will be soup to nuts, everything from Director Comey, the tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton and the attorney general, all the way through to the firing of Mr. Comey. And then, it'll segue into what was going on or not going on with this Russian investigation. I think it's a very important part of the investigation."

The president tweeting out this morning, \"Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate has been terminated as part of our tax cut bill, which essentially repeals over time Obamacare, and Democrats and Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new health care plan.\" Then, the president played golf with Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia along with PGA Tour Player, Bryson DeChambeau, and former PGA Golfer, Dana Quigley. High-level congressional negotiations begin the first weekend in January -- that's when the White House says the president has invited the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan to Camp David to discuss next year's congressional agenda.

There are a couple others that the House Republicans are talking about, welfare reform, an entitlement reform, and then there's a general effort to step up military spending and reform our national security apparatus. So, at least five big topics that people are going to be pushing next year. And as Rich said in his report from Mar-a- Lago, the administration has had a year and has it to come up with an infrastructure plan, and is not because they haven't tried, it's because it's very difficult to do. Let's roll the tape back. 2009, Barack Obama said we're going to pass an $800 billion stimulus bill with shovel-ready projects -- didn't give is economic growth. President Trump during the campaign talked about spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure, the same fundamental problem is there: how do you do this in a way that stimulates the economy and provides long-term economic growth for the country without adding to the deficit? And it's hard to square that circle."

So, you've got to have some -- money has got to come from somewhere, right? And so, this might be something that the Freedom Caucus embraces. I mean, people within his own party are going to be maybe not so enthusiastic about this. But the Democrats, Karl, I mean, this should be music to their ears. They're going to spend money."

But again, there's, there's, you know, the devil is in the details, are you going to get -- as Republicans in the House and the Senate to vote for anything that adds dramatic amounts of money to the deficit. Are you going to -- the question of, are you going to pay people who work on these infrastructure projects union wages? Or you're going to -- which is called prevailing wage? Or you're going to allow it to be set without those kinds of -- it's called Davis-Bacon a lot of provisions? There are lots of complicating factors, and we know how difficult it is because we've already seen it once with infrastructure. The president came out forcefully in favor of reforming the way that we fund our air traffic control system. We are unusual in the world. Most major industrialized countries, what has happened is the government has given the responsibility of air traffic control over consortium run by the airlines and the airports and paid for by the airlines. It's taken out of the books; private capital pays for it. And the president came out forcefully for using this approach in the United States. It's past the house, but it's not gone anywhere in the Senate. That's one way in which you could get private money into this by basically saying we're going to move this --"

Let me ask you about, though, that the politics of all this, because as I said, the Democrats should love it, right? They should love it because they've always been pushing for infrastructure. But, you know, politics makes strange bedfellow -- and suddenly, we got Bernie Sanders out there talking like he actually likes tax cuts. Let's roll the tape.

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, look, the Democrats are -- he at least faces the reality. The reality is that the Republican tax reform bill passed without a single Democratic vote, does three things: It gives most of the benefit to the middle-class, it gives the benefit to the people who make between $40,000 to $200,000 a year. The Joint Committee on Taxation, you and I are probably the only two Americans -- the only two people in the country besides Dr. Larry Lindsey who read the report. But Dr. Lindsey was a colleague in the White House looked at it and had a very interesting analysis. The bottom 50 percent of all filers pay two percent of the tax burden and they get 4.5 percent of the benefit of the tax cut bill -- when you look at the individual taxes only. The 45 percent of filers who are between 40,000 and 200,000 income, basically the middle-class, they pay about 38 percent of the taxes today. They get 52 percent of the tax cut. So, most of the tax cut flows to them. And at the top, the top five percent who pays 60 percent of the tax burden, 59.5 percent today, they get 44 percent of the tax cut. So, this is geared more to the middle-class. The people in the middle-class get two times the benefit of the top five percent and three times the benefit of the top one percent. So, this more at the middle- class."

I wish the left would get its talking points straight on this one because they don't like to admit that. You and I have talked about it before and we can save this for another day, but there was a bit of a giveaway to the private equity industry, and I do worry that the Democrats are going to pound that one and it could prove challenging politically in the future. But you are absolutely right, sir, it is a tax cut to the middle-class and that should help them a little bit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "That's right. Now, look, the reason that the middle-class tax cuts end in 10 years and the corporate tax cuts are made permanent is because of the so-called bird rule. The rule in the Senate that says if you pass a tax bill, you can't allow a negative impact on the deficit after ten years. And the object is, is that just as what the 2001 and the 2003 bush Tax cuts, if they're middle-class tax cuts, like this one is; if they're made - - if they go for only ten years, what's going to happen at the end of ten years is Congress is going to make it permanent just like they did with the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts of the Bush administration."

You know, the Democrats didn't want to have us believe that there was an opportunity here to make the country better through tax reform, but the fact is, the reason the Democrats unilaterally voted against tax reform is they know it's going to increase GDP above 4 percent.

This is the first president that ever stood up and said I'm going to do something about this."

Nobody has had the guts to do it. Now we're seeing more countries following suit. What does this signal to the world? What does it signal to anti-American sentiment among many players there at the U.N.?"

I really applaud there national security strategy that they put out because they look at the world the way it really is. And therefore, let's design strategies to deal with that, that real world is out there. They look at this peace process 22 years, the congress mandated the move of our embassy to Israel, and they're asking themselves, what do we've got to show for that? And the answer is allowed nothing. So, he's taking a totally different approach. And listen, they're recognizing -- the reality is that the Middle East today has fundamentally changed. The Middle East peace process is no longer the number one security in the Middle East. It hasn't been for a number of years. What are the security issues? In fact, it's not even in the top three, Trish. The first one is Iranian aggression and maligned behavior. The second one is the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, and the third one is radical Islam which is in every country in the Middle East trying to undermine the governments in the Middle East. Those are the top three security issues."

      "utterance": "We should have crushed ISIS very early on when they showed their ugly head in 2014, 30,000 stronghold. Obama did not do that. It was not a major priority, and he didn't want to risk some kind of military escalation. Huge strategic error. They became the largest and most iconic world terrorist organization ever created. We all saw their barbarism. Trump comes in with the national security team and crushes them in a matter of months. That should have been done two years ago and that's a sad situation."

And whenever they form a safe haven like they did in Syria, whenever that pops up, we have to crush it and we have to go after it immediately because from that safe haven is the recruitment, becomes the internet caliphate that they've established. That we're now for the first time also, by the way, Trish, having some success at taking down these messages and all of their transnational information that they put on that internet and have been so hugely successful at. We've got to stay on top of this, guys."

Well, let me start with Lawrence here, because, you know, I'm no athlete, but I'm guessing like if you haven't played in six years, it might be kind of difficult to go and suit up and do it again."

      "utterance": "Right, your time is up. And T.O. had multiple issues in the NFL. He was a great wide receiver at one point at time in his career, but he's old now. And the combination of his problems off the field as well as his performance going down as he got older was part of the reason why they didn't renew his contract. So essentially, that's the same thing that happened to Colin Kaepernick. It wasn't just that he kneeled. It was a risk-reward ratio where he's kneeling brought negative attention to the league as well as his performance decrease until they sever ties with him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REAGAN",

    {
      "speaker": "WENDY OSEFO, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "You know, I think that Terrell Owens right now, he's just suffering from being passed up twice in a row for the hall of fame. Quite frankly, he's a great wide receiver. He has the second most touchdowns, second-most passes and yards. But at the end of the day, you know, the facts of the facts, off the field, he did not do well and that's not good. But when we've talked about Colin Kaepernick that's a whole another argument. We have seen a litany of quarterbacks be injured, and he hasn't even been given a tryout. Right now, the Texans, yesterday, played their fourth string quarterback and, you know, Colin Kaepernick could have done that and better. So, I think that it's two different issues. Terrell Owens, his time has definitely passed, but Colin Kaepernick he's in his prime, you know. We have Aron Rodgers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REAGAN",
      "utterance": "But Lawrence, if you're running a team and you have the option of having Colin Kaepernick, you have to weigh those off, right? Because you're going to attract all kind of attention that maybe you don't want."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the deal, when it comes to football, it's just not about your performance on the field. You know I love my Dallas Cowboys, but we're not worth $4 billion because of our performance on the field. It's about the brand. And when you have someone that brings negative attention to the brand, whether you agree with the kneeling protest or not, it has brought negative attention to the NFL and the ratings are suffering. So businesses are making that based on that decision."

    {
      "speaker": "OSEFO",
      "utterance": "That would make sense if everyone in the NFL was squeaky clean. The NFL has had a history of people with domestic violence issues, with drug issues. You're trying to tell me that Colin Kaepernick who's fighting for social justice, he is the black sheep? No. If they used a complete same standards for everyone then that would make sense."

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "OK. That's my point. If you're good and as well as you take a stand, then the league may have some flexibility with you, but his performance didn't also matches his activism. And so, the teams says it's not worth the risk."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSEFO",

You know, Lawrence, you got a point. This is business at the end of the day and you have to think about the risk. So good to see you both. Thanks so much. Coming up next, everyone, an NFL player with a positive message this holiday season for Arizona senator John McCain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REAGAN",
      "utterance": "Finally tonight, an NFL player pens a touching letter to Arizona Senator John McCain for Christmas. Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, writing a tribute and thank you to the 81-year-old who is battling brain cancer. Fitzgerald writes that while he's not a political guy, he's developed so much admiration for McCain over the years. It's our quote of the night. \"When I think about Christmas, and I think about Senator McCain, I think of giving. The sacrifices John McCain has made for our country and especially the men and women he's served with in the military are incredible. As a prisoner of war in Vietnam he missed six Christmases with his family back home and suffered unbelievable hardship. Today, my friend, Senator John McCain, again, finds himself in a battle, this time it's with cancer. And the treatment he is undergoing is exhausting. I wish him a Merry Christmas today, and I pray he lives another 20 years.\" Senator McCain is expected back in Washington after the holidays. Beautiful quote, indeed. All right. We'll see you back here tomorrow night at 7 p.m., and you can catch me every weekday at 2 on \"The Intelligence Report\" on the Fox Business Network. Have a terrific night.
