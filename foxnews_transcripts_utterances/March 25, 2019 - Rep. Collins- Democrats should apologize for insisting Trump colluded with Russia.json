Presidents are motivated by a lot of things. They want to write a good book with a big retainer after they got of the presidency, they want to remembered by history, they want to win reelection. You don't probe a president's motive and intentions if he acts within his constitutional authority. When George H.W. Bush pardon Caspar Weinberger -- we know why he parted him. He pardoned him because he was afraid Weinberger would come around and points his finger at him and by pardoning him, he ended the investigation. But special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh didn't suggest prosecuting it because the president had the right to pardon. And if the president pardons, if the president fires, that's the end of the inquiry. Nobody is entitled to look at the intent of the president or the motive of the president. You look at his actions, if his actions are lawful, that's the end of the matter.

This president was shown not to be colluding. He was shown not to be obstructing. There are things that the Democrats said they had proof of, they didn't have proof of. And I think it's time for an apology from many of them, instead of calling for more investigation. They ought to be in front of the camera and say, you know, I apologize. I said there was collusion, but we didn't have any proof. This goes back to a problematic problem at the DOJ which the Senator Graham talked about today that needs to go back to the understanding of how we got there. We got there because we had a corrupt cabal of Strzok, Page, McCabe, and there are others and Baker, who are enabling this investigation to go at a person instead of the problem, and I think that's something we need to look at."

Maybe he needs to understand, as the old song says, I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But his problem is he's running for president, and he's now has nothing to run on. They lost their first love. Their first love was Mueller. They thought everything was going to happen to that. It didn't happen because nothing was there. The President was right.

When we started looking into the fact of how this started with the DOJ, coming through the e-mail investigation, to the original Russian investigation, through then, the eight days in May in which Mueller was appointed. I think what we ought to understand here, the only person -- people that are getting, you know, that are -- the Russians got what they wanted, but they didn't get it out who they wanted it from. They didn't get it out of the Democrats who are continually bringing this up, dragging the American people through something, making them doubt something that happened in November of 2016. And that was that Hillary Clinton got beat. President Trump is the President. They don't like it. And so they want to keep this going at all possible -- that's the real sadness of this.

You know, we've got a Mueller report now, there are the headlines of that and we'll see the report later that actually shows there was no collusion, the biggest lie that's been told in a long time. We show that there was no obstruction. But what we have shown is actually proven, is that you had bias, that you had special treatments, that you had two layers of justice at the department, one for Hillary Clinton, one for candidate Trump and then President Trump. These are the kind of things that when people see truth, they understand it. What they don't understand is continuing running after the same old thing that has always been proven wrong."

So, let me ask you this, you just heard both sides of this equation and the investigations that Democrats are committed to continuing and what Republicans want to look into. Are you interested in the origins of all of these, are you concerned about what happened in the highest levels of our intelligence agencies in pursuing an investigation against President Trump in the early stages, and not giving him a heads up, that they had real concerns that there might be somebody who was infiltrating their campaign?"

And as I think President Trump has said he wanted it too. The American public paid for that report and they ought to see the report and we need to see that our elections are fair, that they're open, and they're not interfered with Russians, as they were in 2016. There's no question that the Russians were involved in our elections. They tried to influence the elections. They tried to do it for the benefit of the -- of the winner, of the Electoral College. And so, we need to make sure that our elections are --"

So, that was -- what my question was to you, in terms of that conclusion, which is clear, that the Russians did try to influence our elections, do you think that -- it would've been a wise idea to give the candidate a heads up about that, and does it make you curious about the origins of this investigation that he wasn't given one?"

Here now, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst and host of \"LIBERTY FILE\" on Fox Nations, which is great news. Good to see you tonight, judge."

      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "I think Senator Graham hit the nail right on the head. The origin of this was corrupt FBI agents knowing the standard for getting a search warrant on anybody in the America, in the FISA court, is far lower than the standard of getting a search warrant in a criminal investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Which was amazing in and of itself right there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Correct. I don't know the American people knew this until the scandal exploded. Second thing they know is whatever they told the FISA court, would never be revealed because of its secrecy; even if somebody was ultimately indicted, defense counsel wouldn't get the application. So, they knew, this court which grants 99.9 percent -- I've never heard of this in my career except for this court -- of all search warrant applications would grant their warrant would never reveal what they told the court, would grant the warrant on the flimsiest of evidence, and their behavior would never be made public. They never imagined that all of this would come under scrutiny. So, this is not only their corruption, it's a system that has corrupted them by allowing these FISA applications to be made under the pretense of a national security investigation and then magically transferred into a criminal investigation, so slowly that nobody can tell you when and where the transfer occurred, and it's all kept secret."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

You have put together a letter and you are asking to prosecute James Comey for instigating the Mueller probe.  You've been listening to what the judge had to say. Congressman Gaetz, let me start with you. What do you want to get? What's your information you're looking for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Well, the Russian investigation was a national tragedy and Congressman Biggs and I want to see something good come of it. The reason that this was something that distracted our country, tore people apart was because it was based on a lie. And this lie was fueled by a secret court process where we still don't have full clarity as to what justified the surveillance that kept this going for 22 months in the absence of evidence. So, Congressman Biggs and I want to see full transparency of what was presented to the court, with hopes that will allow us to legislate some solutions so that this never happens to another president in the United States again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, Congressman Biggs, that's exactly what the president said today. He said, he doesn't ever want to see this happen to another president of United States again. So, in terms -- do you think the president will authorize the release of all of the documents that were looked at by the FISA courts judges that they approved?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. ANDY BIGGS, R-ARIZ., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Well, at one point, when we requested this before, he indicated that he wanted to release this information but was held back. I think, now is the time to do it. I think his instincts are to do it and I hope that his staff around him let it come out. Because think about this: you've got Carter Page, who's a civilian.  There's a FISA warrant issued against him simply based on some information that comes -- that's cooked up for political purposes. That can't happen in America. That can't happen in this country. So, we need to get to the bottom of it, find out where the corruption was, how we got FISA warrants issued. How Bruce Ohr met with Glenn Simpson, who produced this document more than 60 times after the election. This stuff has got to come out. And so, Congressman Gaetz and I, and some of our other colleagues were really pushing on this. I believe the president wants to do this. I'm hoping he will."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, we heard, Congressman Gaetz, we heard that Andrew McCabe say before Congress that the dossier was essential to get in the FISA warrant, but that it wasn't all they had. We also know that one of the other sources that they used was a piece that was written by Michael Isikoff and was published in Yahoo! News, but that the majority of the information that was in the Isikoff piece came from the dossier. So, that boils us down to basically having only the dossier. Is there any information that you have that there was anything else in that FISA application that would be substantive in terms of opening investigations to these private citizens?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Only the conversations of George Papadopoulos that occurred in a London bar, but even Andrew McCabe indicated that in the absence of the dossier, the Papadopoulos meeting would not have been enough to continue the investigation. So, this investigation was fueled fundamentally by a lie, and where Republicans or Democrats are in charge in the future, it should never be possible to use political opposition research as the basis for counterintelligence and criminal investigations. And so, we think the only way to get to a solution is to turn all the cards face up on the table and to truly understand how the senior levels of the Department of Justice where politicized."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, you know, just going back. It's interesting to kind of go back to all of this. You think about who was in charge at that point. So, you have the FBI who's raising these questions under the direction of James Comey, under the direction of Loretta Lynch, who was the attorney general then. You have Sally Yates also sort of in the mix here, and President Obama at the top, obviously, as president of the United States of all of those organizations. So, Congressman Biggs, who would have been involved in these discussions to say: you know what, we're in the middle of these presidential election, we have some very big concerns and we need to start an investigation into then citizen candidate Donald Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, ostensibly, James Comey was the linchpin for all of this and Loretta Lynch's basically walked away from it. Sally Yates, who had an interest in it, everybody you just named. President Obama had to have been briefed on this, I've got to believe that. We need to get to the bottom of that. But then, we've got some other people involved ultimately were Bruce Ohr is running go-between with the FBI. You've got Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who were sitting there who have an intense bias and hatred towards the president. They're involved in this.  And given these documents on the table, are going to allow us to follow some additional lines of investigation to find out who was causing these problems and who caused this investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "And Remember, Page and Strzok were saying the White House wants to be kept up to date on all of this. So, there was clear involvement from senior White House officials in the Obama administration"

Here now: Howie Kurtz, Host of \"MediaBuzz\" and Author of \"Media Madness: Donald Trump, the Press, and the War Over the Truth.\" Howie, good evening, great to have you with us this evening.

I'm going to update to two black eyes because the media had been so heavily invested in the Mueller investigation and the notion were, for many of the fervent (INAUDIBLE), that it could end the Trump presidency, that their news judgment was badly distorted. Now, Martha, I'm not saying that a criminal probe with 37 indictments shouldn't have been covered or some of the investigative stories weren't inaccurate, even if it didn't rise to the level of indictable offenses. But the coverage was so massive and non- stop, and overwhelmingly negative. And some of the wild commentary: he's convicted, he's a traitor, he's Putin pawn; some of his family members are going to jail. Just have really, seriously damaged the profession's credibility."

You know, you just have to sort of wonder if it changes the tone at all in terms of how the president is looked at. And where that responsibility lies. Do you think that people will trust reporters anymore?"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think half the country already heavily distressed reporters and even others who are not necessarily fans of this president have to see how badly the story was overdone, overhyped, overwrought. Now, do I think these calls for some serious self-examination and soul searching by the profession? Absolutely. But you know, some of us who went up against the media tied, and I've been saying it running for two years that this story was a little bit out of control and the coverage, you know, you get kind dismissed as being a cheerleader for Trump. It was never about that. It was about being a cheerleader for a fair journalism. But I'm not expecting a lot of self-examination. It's a very insulating (Ph) kind of defensive profession."

But today, he said, \"At least The New York Times and the Washington Post, both of which have much to answer for in promoting the bogus collusion tale, did not downplay the Mueller findings this morning and it shows the banner headlines that say that Mueller finds no Trump-Russia conspiracy or collusion.\" So, you know, perhaps there is some road to redemption and we all -- you know, nobody stands apart. We all have to be held to the same standards and we take those standards very seriously. It's interesting that Michael Avenatti sort of came back into the story today as well.

I wish they would take Chris' advice and pivot and move on. Because the reality is it's very sad, they were almost salivating waiting for this evidence and now that it hasn't come, they are in denial. How horrible would it have been for our country if Mueller had found that president of the United States had conspired with a foreign power to undermine our democracy? Every American, whether Republican or Democrat, should be celebrating this outcome. If you -- even if you don't like Donald Trump, you should be happy that the president of the United States didn't conspire with Russia and there seem to be people -- the Democrats can't seem to make that pivot and show that celebration. You show those headlines from the Washington Post that Brit had tweeted out. The Washington Post and the New York Times put on their banner headline, \"There's no collusion.\" Where are the Democrats saying that? There is nobody out there saying that. And so, they can't let go of this false collusion narrative --"

I think by the way, even if the report said there was collusion but there was not prosecuted collusion, Democratic candidates running for president were going to have to run on more than that because really you are running for 5 percent of Americans that can be convinced.

He writes in a new op-ed that Mueller did not finish the job. Alan Dershowitz is a Harvard Law professor emeritus writing the introduction to the upcoming publication of \"The Mueller Report,\" which is his next book. Alan, good to have you here tonight. So, explain why you think it was not OK that after two years Robert Mueller declined to be definitive on the issue of obstruction."

    {
      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL",
      "utterance": "His job was to determine whether or not to charge the president, whether or not the president was guilty of obstruction. He heard arguments on both sides. He's supposed to be the decider. He is not a law professor writing law review articles on the one hand, on the other hand, he is not a hedge fund operator who wants to hedge his bets by selling short and selling long. He is supposed to make the decision. He was paid to do that. He should have to give have of the salary back, and especially the problem was he turned it over to two people. He turned it over to Attorney General Barr who is an honorable, decent, terrific guy and gave him 24 hours to make a decision that Mueller could have made over a two-year period. And then he turned it over to Rod Rosenstein who was completely conflicted. If President Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, then Rod Rosenstein was a conspirator because he urged him to fire him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Let me ask you this. Because one of the things that he would've needed to establish is intent, and a lot of people are talking about the fact that he didn't actually interview the president. The president submitted response to questions. So, it's a good point, you know, how Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein would've been able to determine intent when Robert Mueller felt that he could not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I disagree. I don't think intent is relevant. When the president act according to his constitutional mandate, you can't go behind his act. Presidents are motivated by a lot of things. They want to write a good book with a big retainer after they got of the presidency, they want to remembered by history, they want to win reelection. You don't probe a president's motive and intentions if he acts within his constitutional authority. When George H.W. Bush pardon Caspar Weinberger -- we know why he parted him. He pardoned him because he was afraid Weinberger would come around and points his finger at him and by pardoning him, he ended the investigation. But special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh didn't suggest prosecuting it because the president had the right to pardon. And if the president pardons, if the president fires, that's the end of the inquiry. Nobody is entitled to look at the intent of the president or the motive of the president. You look at his actions, if his actions are lawful, that's the end of the matter. You only look at intent after you have concluded that the acts are unlawful and the acts were lawful. So, there was no reason to look at his intent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So if Robert Mueller had said that he saw that there wasn't obstruction of justice in the act of firing, then at that point an investigation would determine, perhaps what the intent was and if there was a corrupt intent in that obstruction, but as you obviously rightly point out, constitutionally the president had every right to make the moves that he made, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Sure. Compared to Nixon. Nixon destroyed evidence personally, told his people to lie, paid hush money to potential federal witnesses. None of those are within his constitutional authority. Those are act which are criminal. So, then you look at the intention."

Look, I have been right from day one and almost all the other pundits and professors have just been dead wrong. It's time for them to fess up, it's time for CNN to issue an apology. CNN banned me from their air because I was being too fair. I was trying to assess --"

I'm a liberal Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton but you have me on the air. CNN wouldn't have me on the air because they only want the one-sided presentation.

The House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff said there was absolute non-circumstantial evidence that the president and his campaign had colluded with the government in Russia. So now you have this report that says that that is how it happened. He's facing calls to step down because of how strong the claims he made were and the fact that they appear to be not true.

He did that repeatedly over a two-year period. He said he had evidence of those crimes. And as you pointed out, Martha, Bob Mueller came back and said that's simply wasn't true. Bob Mueller said there wasn't -- it wasn't that there wasn't sufficient evidence to charge collusion, he said there was no collusion. So --"

      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not just us, Martha. It's not just Republicans, it's Americans who are concerned about the integrity. Again, this is not just an issue of judgment. This is an issue of integrity, of not telling the truth over a two-year period of essentially yelling fire in a crowded theater to the American people about a false collusion narrative that simply was not true where there was no evidence even though he said he had it. And I think one of the things that is most troubling, Martha, is as you can see from that, Adam doesn't feel bad about what he did. And in fact, now he wants to double down on it. He wants to continue the investigation into Donald Trump for Russia related crimes, even though the special counsel with the benefit of 20 prosecutors, 40 federal agents, unlimited time, unlimited money, and unlimited resources has said there are no -- there is no evidence. So why they want to --"

      "utterance": "Well, I guess that raises a really important question, which is what, you know, what measures can the House judiciary committee take to demand that he substantiate what he charged. And then if you believe that this is continuing to exacerbate the success that the Russian government did have, which was to pit everyone in this country against each other for two whole years which was extremely successful, how, you know, how can he be held accountable for that if what you say is true?"

The Democrats dug this hole. We're not going to take the shovel out of their hands. Do they think that the chairman of this the committee that handles all of our intelligence community assets, our most sensitive national security measures saying untruthful things about the president, about evidence against the president for two-year period is something that he should be held accountable for?"
