That's like here I am, take me. We have to get smart on gun-free zones. When they say it says this is a gun-free zone that means that nobody has a gun except them.

We give them a little bit of a bonus. But the NRA is ready to do things people like to blame them and they do have power and all of that. But they want to do -- they actually came up with certain of the rules and regulations that we have now. But we're going to have to toughen -- I told them and said, we're going to have to toughen them up. We really do have to have offensive measures, also. I know people don't like talking about it.

      "sentences": "All right. You have to give the president a lot of credit because instead of engaging in the same old tired back and forth, repeating the same talking points, the politicians, the media use after these tragedies, he is actually trying to come up with solutions, solving the problem. Here's the bottom line. We have a choice in all of this. Do we keep having the exact same political debate that we have had ongoing since Columbine that's not going to change anybody's minds or do we actually fix the problem? Do we want to protect our children? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, after 9/11, well, we fixed the problem of aircraft security and I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. I'm sure people in this room are as well tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Predictably, the left and the liberal media that are talking about getting rid of the Second Amendment, or talking about confiscating guns like Australia for a minute, let's take politics out of all of this. Let's just focus on the issue, how do we keep our kids safe in school? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president saying he wants solutions and that's why he sat down with students and parents and teachers and governors and state and local officials. He talked and he listened. And by the way, he wants to have a positive impact. This is a simple truth. The left and the media can talk all they want about banning certain types of weapons used by these evil maniacs. But the thing is you could never stop the evil that exist in some people's hearts. And if you take away and you ban one weapon, these killers, those with evil intent will use something else. We have already seen this happen. Let's go back to the Virginia Tech shooting, the deadliest shooting in the history of this country and in that case the shooter used pistols. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what the left, the media cannot seem to comprehend or don't want to comprehend is that evil exists in this world there are murderers, there are rapists. There are child molesters, there is evil. And, by the way, if they don't use a rifle in the case of these school shootings, then it's going to end up being a handgun the next time. And then after that, if it's not a handgun, it's going to be another type of weapon or tool. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember the Boston bombers, they used explosives that were made from every day products that are readily available. Other terrorists have used trucks, vans, and cars. Others have used knives. Are we going to ban everything? And as much as the left and the media want to think that the government can fully stop these killers with regulations and laws, they cannot. Because people that have this evil, they will always find a way to cause pain and suffering and inflict maximum carnage. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The only thing that comes with banning weapons is that you will infringe on the rights of constitutional law abiding American citizens that have the right to protect themselves and their families. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What's missing are real solutions to protect these innocent kids. You know, speakers of the White House, in this listening session, they brought up a lot of great ideas and solutions that we have been discussing on this show. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In the case of the Florida school shooting, there were warning signs all over the place about Nikolas Cruz. We knew that he was mentally ill. We knew he was unstable. We knew he was capable of doing something. The students all seemed to know it and the same goes for the teachers. There are reports that police were actually called to Cruz's home 39 times over a 7-year period. That's a pretty good indicator. Cruz got into trouble at school. He threatened students. He wasn't allowed to carry a backpack at the school. And he was eventually expelled from the school. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } 'The Miami Herald' reports that school officials actually sent out an email warning teachers about Nikolas Cruz. And then, of course, you have his social media footprint, had you pictures with guns and knives and disturbing photos. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then, of course, the FBI they were called and warned specifically twice about Nikolas Cruz and they did not follow up. Now, in other words, every bit of evidence to indicate that this was going to happen was right there in front of us. People saw something, said something, and nothing happened, they did nothing. We're also learning two new disturbing pieces of information tonight. And according to that report, the school security cameras were on a nearly half hour delay which slowed down law enforcement and their ability to capture Nikolas Cruz. And the Broward County sheriff saying the armed security officer on campus didn't enter the building when the shooting was taking place. And instead, the officer took a defensive position outside of the school. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is why we need solutions. We need ideas. We need to fix the problem. We need to protect our kids. And here's the thing. We already know what works. And there are things that we use every day in office buildings and airports and courthouses and other government buildings and other facilities. The key if you want to solve the problem is security and it's not really that hard. Every school in this country needs to have a comprehensive threat assessment that can be done by retired or former police or retired former military, special ops. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These schools are soft targets. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We need to harden the perimeters around these schools. And for those of you worried about the cost, really? Are we going to be cheap when it comes to defending our kids? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Because I also guarantee you, these former officers and veterans, they would line up and volunteer to help their community to keep our kids safe. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These assessments need to include ways to secure the perimeter, control every point of entry. And from there, if these experts determine that it's needed, you need to put an ID system in place, zero exceptions. They need to know everybody that goes into that school. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I work in two office buildings in New York. One for radio, one for TV. If you don't have a work ID, you are not allowed entry. Visitors are vetted through a security system. And you must show your ID. And then you usually checked in case you have any metal objects going in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And from there on a case-by-case basis, if some schools need it, they should have metal detectors and other security measures. And finally, you have to have an armed security presence at every school in America and you can hire -- right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Retired veterans and police officers. Schools can no longer be soft targets. You have to have people there who can fight back and challenge and confront any potential threat. And when you think about the statistic that was brought up at the White House listening session yesterday, the average shooting -- school shooting lasts only three minutes. It takes police on average six to eight minutes to respond, which, by the way is incredibly fast. But why not already have somebody on the scene that is armed, that is trained and ready to respond and save lives at a moment's notice? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We take potential security threats against politicians. Look at the security at the Oscars for these prima donna celebrities at the red carpet. They have every ounce of security you could ever dream of. Why wouldn't we do the same thing for our children? And, in addition, right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in addition, to all of that, we also need a much better way to identify and help these kids that are obviously in trouble. There has to be a system put in place to spot kids that we think are disturbed. We need to help them, get them the help that they need. And we have to put a focus on social media whether it's someone physically monitoring it or easier, somebody reports what's going on in the case of this particular kid, Nikolas Cruz. Also on this stage earlier today, the NRA CEO executive vice president Wayne LaPierre. He was here at CPAC. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He delivered a fiery response to liberals in the media that are trying to blame his organization for what happened in Florida. LaPierre also challenged them to do more to protect schools and to protect our kids. Here's what he said.",

Meanwhile, predictably the Democrats, the abusively biased news media, they are playing the same old blame game, hoping to score cheap political points in their push for gun control. And also new tonight, on this very stage, NRA CEO, executive vice president Wayne LaPierre blasted critics for trying to blame his organization for the tragedy in Florida. And then you've got the fake news network CNN proving they are incapable of having a fair, intellectual fact-based debate about guns in America and pro-Second Amendment speakers like Dana Loesch who is here with us tonight. Was shouted down, called a murderer and worse, and a student now accusing today the fake news network of actually scripting the questions. Now, it's not the first time CNN has done this.

      "utterance": "We have to harden our schools, not soften them up. A gun-free zone to a killer or somebody that wants to be a killer, that's like going in for the ice cream. That's like here I am, take me. We have to get smart on gun-free zones. When they say it says this is a gun-free zone that means that nobody has a gun except them. Nobody is going to be shooting bullets in the other direction. And they see that as such a beautiful target. They live for gun-free zones. I think a concealed permit for having teachers and letting people know that there are people in the building with gun, you won't have, in my opinion, you won't have these shootings, because these people are cowards. They are not going to walk into a school if 20 percent of the teachers have guns. It may be 10 percent or may be 40 percent. And what I would recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus. But the NRA is ready to do things people like to blame them and they do have power and all of that. But they want to do -- they actually came up with certain of the rules and regulations that we have now. But we're going to have to toughen -- I told them and said, we're going to have to toughen them up. We really do have to have offensive measures, also. I know people don't like talking about it. But we need offensive as well as defensive. We have to be totally defensive. But if we don't have offensive measures, within these schools, we are just -- you are just kidding yourselves, folks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. You have to give the president a lot of credit because instead of engaging in the same old tired back and forth, repeating the same talking points, the politicians, the media use after these tragedies, he is actually trying to come up with solutions, solving the problem. Here's the bottom line. We have a choice in all of this. Do we keep having the exact same political debate that we have had ongoing since Columbine that's not going to change anybody's minds or do we actually fix the problem? Do we want to protect our children? Remember, after 9/11, well, we fixed the problem of aircraft security and I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. I'm sure people in this room are as well tonight. Predictably, the left and the liberal media that are talking about getting rid of the Second Amendment, or talking about confiscating guns like Australia for a minute, let's take politics out of all of this. Let's just focus on the issue, how do we keep our kids safe in school? The president saying he wants solutions and that's why he sat down with students and parents and teachers and governors and state and local officials. He talked and he listened. And by the way, he wants to have a positive impact. This is a simple truth. The left and the media can talk all they want about banning certain types of weapons used by these evil maniacs. But the thing is you could never stop the evil that exist in some people's hearts. And if you take away and you ban one weapon, these killers, those with evil intent will use something else. We have already seen this happen. Let's go back to the Virginia Tech shooting, the deadliest shooting in the history of this country and in that case the shooter used pistols. And what the left, the media cannot seem to comprehend or don't want to comprehend is that evil exists in this world there are murderers, there are rapists. There are child molesters, there is evil. And, by the way, if they don't use a rifle in the case of these school shootings, then it's going to end up being a handgun the next time. And then after that, if it's not a handgun, it's going to be another type of weapon or tool. Remember the Boston bombers, they used explosives that were made from every day products that are readily available. Other terrorists have used trucks, vans, and cars. Others have used knives. Are we going to ban everything? And as much as the left and the media want to think that the government can fully stop these killers with regulations and laws, they cannot. Because people that have this evil, they will always find a way to cause pain and suffering and inflict maximum carnage. The only thing that comes with banning weapons is that you will infringe on the rights of constitutional law abiding American citizens that have the right to protect themselves and their families. What's missing are real solutions to protect these innocent kids. You know, speakers of the White House, in this listening session, they brought up a lot of great ideas and solutions that we have been discussing on this show. In the case of the Florida school shooting, there were warning signs all over the place about Nikolas Cruz. We knew that he was mentally ill. We knew he was unstable. We knew he was capable of doing something. The students all seemed to know it and the same goes for the teachers. There are reports that police were actually called to Cruz's home 39 times over a 7-year period. That's a pretty good indicator. Cruz got into trouble at school. He threatened students. He wasn't allowed to carry a backpack at the school. And he was eventually expelled from the school. 'The Miami Herald' reports that school officials actually sent out an email warning teachers about Nikolas Cruz. And then, of course, you have his social media footprint, had you pictures with guns and knives and disturbing photos. Then, of course, the FBI they were called and warned specifically twice about Nikolas Cruz and they did not follow up. Now, in other words, every bit of evidence to indicate that this was going to happen was right there in front of us. People saw something, said something, and nothing happened, they did nothing. We're also learning two new disturbing pieces of information tonight. And according to that report, the school security cameras were on a nearly half hour delay which slowed down law enforcement and their ability to capture Nikolas Cruz. And the Broward County sheriff saying the armed security officer on campus didn't enter the building when the shooting was taking place. And instead, the officer took a defensive position outside of the school. This is why we need solutions. We need ideas. We need to fix the problem. We need to protect our kids. And here's the thing. We already know what works. And there are things that we use every day in office buildings and airports and courthouses and other government buildings and other facilities. The key if you want to solve the problem is security and it's not really that hard. Every school in this country needs to have a comprehensive threat assessment that can be done by retired or former police or retired former military, special ops. These schools are soft targets. We need to harden the perimeters around these schools. And for those of you worried about the cost, really? Are we going to be cheap when it comes to defending our kids? Because I also guarantee you, these former officers and veterans, they would line up and volunteer to help their community to keep our kids safe. These assessments need to include ways to secure the perimeter, control every point of entry. And from there, if these experts determine that it's needed, you need to put an ID system in place, zero exceptions. They need to know everybody that goes into that school. I work in two office buildings in New York. One for radio, one for TV. If you don't have a work ID, you are not allowed entry. Visitors are vetted through a security system. And you must show your ID. And then you usually checked in case you have any metal objects going in. And from there on a case-by-case basis, if some schools need it, they should have metal detectors and other security measures. And finally, you have to have an armed security presence at every school in America and you can hire -- right? Retired veterans and police officers. Schools can no longer be soft targets. You have to have people there who can fight back and challenge and confront any potential threat. And when you think about the statistic that was brought up at the White House listening session yesterday, the average shooting -- school shooting lasts only three minutes. It takes police on average six to eight minutes to respond, which, by the way is incredibly fast. But why not already have somebody on the scene that is armed, that is trained and ready to respond and save lives at a moment's notice? We take potential security threats against politicians. Look at the security at the Oscars for these prima donna celebrities at the red carpet. They have every ounce of security you could ever dream of. Why wouldn't we do the same thing for our children? And, in addition, right? And in addition, to all of that, we also need a much better way to identify and help these kids that are obviously in trouble. There has to be a system put in place to spot kids that we think are disturbed. We need to help them, get them the help that they need. And we have to put a focus on social media whether it's someone physically monitoring it or easier, somebody reports what's going on in the case of this particular kid, Nikolas Cruz. Also on this stage earlier today, the NRA CEO executive vice president Wayne LaPierre. He was here at CPAC. He delivered a fiery response to liberals in the media that are trying to blame his organization for what happened in Florida. LaPierre also challenged them to do more to protect schools and to protect our kids. Here's what he said."

The elites don't care not one whit about America's school system and school children. It's a bizarre fact that in this country, our jewelry stores, all over this country are more important than our children.

This was all about creating political theater. As a matter of fact, it did nothing to solve the problem. Fake news CNN also has another serious problem on their hands. Colton Haab, he's a Stoneman Douglas High School student. He actually saved lives during the shooting. And is he reporting that CNN actually tried to script his questions at last night's town hall that he didn't end up participating in because he wasn't going to be a part of that farce.

Here's the headline,' 'CNN's long history of allowing Democratic town hall plants' and here are just a couple of the many examples she found. 2007, CNN YouTube debate. Quote, undecided voters literally included a member of the LBGT Americans for Hillary Clinton steering committee. A John Edwards supporter that asked questions about abortion. A log cabin Republican that was really backing Barack Obama. A concerned mother that was a union activist for United Steelworkers that it endorsed John Edwards and former intern for Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman. We know that the former DNC chair, former CNN contributor Donna Brazile leaked town hall questions to the Clinton campaign. So, they had advantage over Bernie Sanders in that case. All right. Ready to debate this, we have two segments, stay with us. Joining us now on stage, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch who was there last night.

This was an arena full of survivors, victims' parents and other community members. There were over 7,000 people that were in this arena, Sean. And when we entered you kind of entered like you were Floyd Mayweather going into the ring. I mean, literally, you came in from part of the arena and walked through between all these people. And you got up on stage. It was pretty chaotic. It started even before I got up on stage to talk.

And, Sean, we also found out, it was reported this morning that the parents had reported this murderer to police before. There is a report out there. The records have been discussed in media, where they said they told police he had threatened people with a gun before. He has held a gun to other's heads. Now, I'm not a member of the FBI.

I was watching a politician weak ineffective politician last night I will tell you the name but I don't want to embarrass anybody. He was talking about no guns no, this, no that. He is surrounded by three guys carrying guns. When are they going to give up their guns? They are not going to give up their guns, but he wants everybody else to have no guns, all right? And have you plenty of them."

Well, the President has now shown leadership. He is trying to find solutions? Keeping our schools and kids safe. Joining us now a big warm CPAC welcome to the counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway. Wow. All right. So, is there have been a lot of school shootings, like a lot of issues. Everybody talked about opening ANWAR and nobody did it until President Trump did it?"

And for the President of the United States, to hold back-to-back sessions yesterday and today, today public safety, school safety with elected officials, with commissioners of the police the sheriffs and educators you have the mayor of Parkland, Florida has been a remarkable woman throughout this. For him to do this yesterday and today. And yesterday to have the parents and students there and those who suffered over the years including the mass shooting in Florida. Sean, this the man who always is listening? He has listened to the angel moms and dad. He listen to the Obama care victims, he listen to the coal miners and the families and the business owners coming to the White House and how they would spend the tax savings they would get from any cut. Big business, small business, to inspiring entrepreneurs, to young people all across this country whose future is more prosperous, more safe because of him. He has now taken this all the way into, I think, a scourge on our society. And there are many. For the President of the United States to welcome these people into his house yesterday. They were in the state dining room, and to just listen, he didn't make it about himself as politicians often do. He didn't interrupt them. He spoke very little. Very sparingly. He and the vice president had took into account all of the -- I think the emotion and grief, but also the purposefulness."

So there is a lot of hypocrisy here and the lectures that come from people that themselves have security and armed guards is a little -- falls flat, at least on my ears and most people here."

If god forbid you ever find yourself in any administration building, I don't know where or have this would ever would happen and there is an active shooter. Would you or would you not want retired, armed, military, retired armed police on site so you have a fighting chance? I think we owe that to America's children as a simple fundamental basic front line of defense."

      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "The president made that point again and again today. Second consecutive day he had the cameras rolling and the microphones open the entire time. Unrestricted, unrehearsed and unfiltered and I would say quite unexpected. He made that point today that we need to harden our target and our schools need to be places were, a would-be mass murderers believes the he or she is not going to have their way there. That if they know they can't easily get in and do their damage they will think twice about that. And he made that very clear. He came in really tough today about that, because he want to make sure we solve this once and for all. These are necessary conversations and not easy solutions. I think we should give the President and Vice President and others great credit for having that conversation."

      "utterance": "Really missing the essence of what yesterday really was about. If you listened very carefully to the people in that room. And they had the floor. They came there with ideas. They came there with certainly with controversies. I think that the disagreement in the room yesterday over policy from this effective family reflects very much the disagreement across this country. That disagreement needs to be heard. And the different ideas need to be aired. And what I believe is that they still have I think many people in the media trying to get the story. I think there are still too many trying to get the President. And it's unfortunate what happened after a day like yesterday where even some of his fiercest critics say it was a very positive event. It was a very good thing for him to have hosted at the White House. At the same time, anybody who came away yesterday and took one little snippet and tried to manipulate anybody's words is really being disingenuous as to the tone and content of the entire event and being quite disrespectful to the people who were in the room and who are really the ones speaking."

The one and only Matt Schlapp, Fox News contributor, investigative reporter Sara Carter, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. This is a big deal, especially in light of Devin Nunes now saying he wants an answer from Obama officials for 10 questions, specifically related to the phony bought and paid for Russian dossier that Hillary tried to manipulate the American people with."

I don't want to go in that direction until we verify it yet. There is quite a few people involved here. Now with David Kramer this is significant and important, because he was a state department official. Remember, he was the guy who went to get the dossier for McCain and he brought it back. The FBI already had the dossier. We know that the FBI had obtained that dossier earlier that summer. He goes back. He gets the dossier. And he is pleading the fifth, because he doesn't want to answer one question in particular."

And then they brought it Comey even said in January of 2017 to the President-Elect, it was salacious and unverified, but in October they went before a FISA court and the bulk of that FISA application was that phony Hillary Clinton bought and paid for dossier and they never told the FISA Judge that it was Hillary Clinton bought and paid for. They put a footnote in, it may be political."

      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEAGL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "It's arguably six different felonies for doing that the Kramer thing is interesting, because he appeared before the intelligence committee December 19th and he said I know who Steele's sources are and the committee said who are they? He said I'm not going to tell you. So they slap him with a subpoena to make him tell them and now he invokes the fifth. Why would he do that? Maybe he didn't know the sources and didn't tell the truth which is why he may be invoking the fifth. It's hard to know sources Sean that don't even exist. If he knows the sources and he is invoking the fifth to protect them. That is an illegal use of the Fifth Amendment privilege."

Other people say, he is a nationalist.
