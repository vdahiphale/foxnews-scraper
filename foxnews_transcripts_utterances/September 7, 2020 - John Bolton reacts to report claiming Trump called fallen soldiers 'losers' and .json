Take a look. I've got a friend, Dr. John Patroski (ph) who was formally the head of the Political Science Department at the University of Missouri (ph), taught at Stanford before then. He's got a little bit - he's retired so he's got a little bit of time on his hands now so he is now taking the Real Clear Politics average and averaging it by week and this is an interesting thing you pointed out to me.

That was just after the Republican Convention. The week of the Republican Convention, 49-41. The week before that, just before the Democratic Convention, 50-42 so the race has tightened a little bit because here, what you're dealing with is not just simply the average of the last several polls. You're looking at the average of each day aggregated together during that week so the race has tightened a little bit and each side has placed a bet, Martha. Each side has placed a bet. Joe Biden's bet is Trump botched COVID, and I'm normal.

Trump's bid is Biden is weak, starting with law and order. We are not finished seeing that Biden's judgment is bad and Biden is weak from the Trump campaign and then his closing argument, I'll do better at restarting the economy which interestingly enough, he has had an advantage even in June when he was behind in the Real Clear Politics average by 11 points.

Happy Labor Day and welcome to the real kick off of the election season. We've got 57 days ago now and in many ways today is the starting gate. This is when we expect that voters will really begin looking at the lay of the land in the country and evaluating their two options. We're going to talk to some of those voters who are undecided, slim margin of them this time around but we're going to talk to some of them later this hour, all from battleground states. So stick around for that tonight, it's going to be interesting. So President Trump and Joe Biden, both out on the campaign trail today.

      "utterance": "Well, we're going to watch - we have 57 days, and I thought Bill Stepien, the new campaign manager for President Trump said something that I suspect his counterpart of the Biden campaign would agree with him. It matters who wins virtually every single day because the movement in this race could - won't be large but it could be significant. Take a look. I've got a friend, Dr. John Patroski (ph) who was formally the head of the Political Science Department at the University of Missouri (ph), taught at Stanford before then. He's got a little bit - he's retired so he's got a little bit of time on his hands now so he is now taking the Real Clear Politics average and averaging it by week and this is an interesting thing you pointed out to me. Think about this. This is the week of August 31, last Wednesday, 49-43. The week before, 49 Biden, 41 Trump. That was just after the Republican Convention. The week of the Republican Convention, 49-41. The week before that, just before the Democratic Convention, 50-42 so the race has tightened a little bit because here, what you're dealing with is not just simply the average of the last several polls. You're looking at the average of each day aggregated together during that week so the race has tightened a little bit and each side has placed a bet, Martha. Each side has placed a bet. Joe Biden's bet is Trump botched COVID, and I'm normal. I'm not him. You won't have to wake up in the morning and worry about my tweets. Trump's bid is Biden is weak, starting with law and order. We are not finished seeing that Biden's judgment is bad and Biden is weak from the Trump campaign and then his closing argument, I'll do better at restarting the economy which interestingly enough, he has had an advantage even in June when he was behind in the Real Clear Politics average by 11 points. That was an issue that the President Trump still had the advantage on. And we'll see these two campaigns fight this out, each one of I'm trying to press its arguments but having as we've seen in the last couple of days to respond to advances President Trump has had to do and responding to changing conditions. You noticed nobody at the Democratic Convention mentioned law and order. Nobody at the Democratic Convention talked about the violent protests racking Portland but the last week we've now seen Trump, we've seen Vice President Biden come out, we've seen Senator Harris come out. On Sunday, they put Val Demings, a former police chief as a member of Congress who was considered for Vice President, put her on the Sunday talk programs to say well, we Democrats don't like violent protests either."

Couple of areas you know, it is so interesting to me how slim these areas are that this vote can be eked out in one way or another and everybody of course is watching the African- American vote, the Latino vote, which is grown in certain states that are battleground states in places like Arizona for example. When you take a look at this, the president has his work cut out for him. Arizona Hispanic voters, Biden 69 Trump 23. North Carolina black voters Biden 88 Trump 5 percent but you know you can see that there's a clear effort. We saw it at the convention and I think we'll continue to see it in advertising and probably in topics in these debates that the Trump team is trying to just shift those numbers a little bit. How do you think they're doing at that Karl and how much would make a difference? How small amount can make a difference?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well look, this is what we're talking about when we're making a bet, what president Trump is betting is that he can get those numbers among Latino and African-American communities back to where they were in January and February where he looked like he could take the 28-29 percent among Latinos and the 8 percent among African-Americans that he got in 2016 to like 34-33-35-36 among Latinos and 13-14 or 15 among African-Americans, particularly young African-American men. And if he does that, that's a huge change because each one of those is a vote, out of the Democratic column and into Trump's column and if you've won Michigan by 11,000 votes or Wisconsin by 22,000 or Pennsylvania by 44,000 and you suddenly start to do, you go from 8 to 13 or 14 among African-Americans. You start to grow your margins and if you go from 28-29 to 34-35 among Latinos in a place like Arizona, you really as a Republican really stand a much better chance up here in the state."

Three states really stand out. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all don't begin the process of verifying and matching and seeing which ones they have to throw out for various reasons until Election Day and those are all battleground states, Karl."

What he thinks of John McCain which I thought was largely accurate and what he happened to say in Paris on the day before Armistice Day, the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day, getting ready to go visit French President Macron. And according to what that article said the president made disparaging remarks about our soldiers, the people buried at the Aisne-Marne cemetery in connection with the decision for him not to go to the ceremony that was planned that afternoon and that was simply false. I don't know who told the author that but that was false and I recounted that in my book, room where it happened and reaffirmed that in response to questions, the next day."

    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, she's just flatly wrong. Look, I can tell you exactly what it was. We were in the Ambassador's residence in Paris. We were supposed to be having a 10:30 meeting to brief the president for his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at 11. The president was late, which was frequently the case. I don't think the entire fair lasted more than 10 or 15 minutes and the main issue was whether or not weather conditions permitted the president to go out to the Aisne-Marne cemetery. The people I recall being there were John Kelly, one of his aides, Mike Pompeo, myself, Jamie McCourt, our ambassador to France. We had this discussion, it was mostly John Kelly presenting the logistical reasons why the trip couldn't take place and the president assented to the recommendations that he not go. He didn't protest that he really needed to go. He just sort of took the facts as they were, a very straight weather call. After that meeting just for what it's worth, we then went to the Elysee Palace for the President to meet with Macron. That lasted until about 12:45. The two presidents were joined by the two first ladies for lunch, just the four of them that lasted into the afternoon. The president then went back to the embassy and a dinner that night for the heads of state who were attending and that was the schedule that day."

And he says that the rank and file is supportive of him, he believes but that some of the leadership at the Pentagon who did not like some of the decisions that he made with regard to standing by the Kurds or with drawing down troops in Afghanistan is where the divide is and that perhaps that's why they are putting out these messages and putting his comments in light that makes him look terrible.

I was simply responding to what I thought was the main point of the Atlantic article, that at the critical point Saturday morning when the decision was made not to go to Aisne-Marne that he made the disparaging remarks and he did not. Now with respect to what people at the Pentagon think and I think this is important, this afternoon at this press conference, the President of the United States said the following that the top people at the Pentagon aren't in love with him because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.

Analysts on both sides of the Pacific say greater conflict may be inevitable, given the two nations ideological systems, nationalist sentiments and trajectories - one a super power on the ascent, the other trying to preserve its reach.\" Joining me now Dr. Michael Pillsbury, Director for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute and author of 'The 100 Year Marathon.' Dr. Pillsbury, always good to have you with us. Thank you for being here tonight so this I think is something that's very important for voters to evaluate because you know eventually I believe that COVID-19 will eventually be over.

You know, he's saying things that he's never said before but he's actually saying them - obviously, the Biden campaign's very smart about the polls. They see this figure of 9 out of 10 Americans see China as a threat so he's got to say something tough on China but this New York Times article is just beautiful. It deserves a prize in my view.

He wanted to open our relationship with trade with China even further and kind of bring them into the fold, believing that more sunshine in this communist leadership would eventually kind of bring them around. That was the original thinking but that is not what has happened."

President Reagan was also for cooperation with China but Joe Biden distinguished himself. The problem I think he faces Martha is also the Hunter Biden problem. The Biden campaign is saying well, Ivanka Trump has a jewelry boutique in China and President Trump's ties come from China. That's hardly the same thing as Hunter sort of walking off with $1.5 billion of investment funds. So this is also a problem for the Biden campaign I would think."

Let me explain how the vaccine is being developed. It's -- there is a safety board, a data safety monitoring board of non-government people that are only going to be the ones looking at the data. The data is a black box, the president no one in the government has any idea about the data as the safety trials going on.

He says that the fact that the Russia distribute before completing the trials, completing those phase three trials, means that even if the vaccines effectively one have proof and people will be reluctant to take it.

I would rather have a drug that was developed by the FDA and approved by an FDA clinical trial in the United States than from any other country. There's zero question, there is no -- those safety measures being cut, there's no cutting corners here at all. It's a matter of statistical power. It will be determined to be effective if it has enough events that dictate the statistical proof that's necessary to give the vaccine. This is all nonsensical, I don't know if it's all politically driven or what, but this is just something that's very harmful to the public. We don't need more fear. Everyone should be very confident that there is nothing being shortchanged here in the development of this vaccine and if it comes - if it comes which it seems to be on track before the end of the year but no one can predict with any accuracy, we already are producing those as there is going to be roughly 100 million plus available doses before the end of the year and this is fantastic news. There is no need for someone in the public eye to be commenting and undermining the confidence of the American people. This is not a political issue, the development of a vaccine.

So, I hope you will all come back and let us know what you're thinking in a month or so as we get through this. I really appreciate you being here on this Labor Day. Many thanks to you all."

Coming up, President Trump urging Iran to spare the life of this wrestler who now faces two death sentences in connection with an antigovernment protest. Activist Masih Alinejad has spoken exclusively with his mother. Her message to America is next. Stay tuned."

      "utterance": "The case of a star wrestler in Iran is now getting the attention of President Trump who has been influential in a number of releases. Navid Afkari was convicted of stabbing a security guard to death during a protest that he was part of in 2018. He now faces two death sentences. But days after President Trump called on Tehran to spare his life, suddenly a confession surfaced from the wrestler on Iranian state TV. In it, he reportedly said, quote, \"I hit twice, once, and then again.\" The U.S. State Department says they believe that Afkari's confession was forced. And now his mother is speaking out exclusively to my next guest."

Masih, it's good to have you back tonight. What is your take on this and what do you think of this confession that now surfaced?"

      "utterance": "As you heard the voice of this frustrated mother, she doesn't know what to do. But she said that clearly, her son is innocent and her -- I mean, his only crime is to participate in Tehran protest, protesting peacefully against the government. But first, they arrested him and after that, they arrested his brother Vahid as well. Why? Because they wanted Vahid to talk against Navid Afkari. And then they arrested another brother, Habib, to put more pressure on them. So, that didn't work. So, that's why they forced them all to do false confessions which actually Iranian national television is very popular to do and accused them of killing a security forces guard which is totally alive. So, they are going to kill them and that is what they try to convince the society. But right now, the Iranian people are furious. And they all believe that Navid is innocent."

      "speaker": "ALINEJAD",
      "utterance": "Let's -- it is very, very important for all politicians to speak up against this cruel verdict against Navid Afkari and other political prisoners. And I have to tell you, when you talk to the families, they beg everyone to help them. These people do not have any voice inside Iran. They don't have any media. Last November, the government in Iran killed 1,500 people. And one of the fathers spoke up, right now Father (Inaudible) is in prison. So, you see, right now, a lot of people inside Iran are actually calling not only the president of America. They are calling the leaders of the European countries to do something and take action. A lot of European governments have relation with Iran. They go and visit Javad Zarif, the Foreign Minister of Iran. Right now, they have to take an action. Otherwise the regime easily, easily will kill these innocent people. I think Iran is the only country that if you protest peacefully, then they are going to kill you and they arrest your family members to keep them silent. So, this is a tipping point --"

Twitter is filtered but you see the president of you know, the supreme leader of Iran, the president of Iran, the foreign minister of Iran, but the young generation, they are trying to bypass the filtering. And they are on Twitter. Twelve million people use the hashtag don't kill and don't execute protesters."

Masih Alinejad, always good to have you with us. That's it for tonight, Monday, September 7th. Happy Labor Day, everybody. We'll see you back here on Tuesday night as “The Story” continues.
