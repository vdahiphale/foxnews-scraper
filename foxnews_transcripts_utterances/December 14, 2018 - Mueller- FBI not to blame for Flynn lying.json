Mueller's latest filing comes as a judge demanded to see all the documents surrounding that meeting and force the Special Counsel to turn them in by 3:00 today. The filing disputed the notion that Flynn was misled in the meetings. Saying, he, \"Agreed to meet with FBI agents, without counsel and answer their questions.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Adding this stinging line, \"A sitting National Security Advisor, former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General and a 33 year veteran of the Armed Forces does not need to be warned that it's a crime to lie to federal agents.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, nowhere in the filing does Mueller deny that Andrew McCabe told Michael Flynn, it'd be better not to have a lawyer there. And1 it was pretty clear from James Comey's own lips that the meeting and the questioning was actually anything but business as usual when asked what he knew about the agents just showing up at the White House that day in January of 2017, he said this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Something is going on that we don't know about, and we still need to find out. And it's interesting to note. I remember, you know in one of the only statements that General Flynn made after this started to unfold, he said, \"I have a story to tell.

They skipped the protocols and went directly to him circumventing counsel on the White House.

Her 23-year-old male roommate was later arrested at a train station 65 miles away holding a suitcase and a cello. Sarah Papenheim's mom says her daughter and the suspect bonded over music and started sharing an apartment about a year ago. But Sarah told her mom the roommate had recently become unstable and angry. The mother says days before Sarah was killed, some mental health professionals came to the apartment but Sarah, quote, \"shooed them away because she was afraid he would think she called them.\" Police have not disclosed the motive but Papenheim's family believes it happened after Sarah decided to leave the apartment to live with her boyfriend. She was apparently gathering her belongings at the time of the attack. Sarah Papenheim was born in Minnesota, raised in California and because of her talent as a drummer she caught the attention of Prince's former band mate and legendary musician Gary \"Jelly Bean\" Johnson, who said after her death, I'm quoting again, \"I liked her because she hit the drums just as hard as guys did.

Mueller's latest filing comes as a judge demanded to see all the documents surrounding that meeting and force the Special Counsel to turn them in by 3:00 today. The filing disputed the notion that Flynn was misled in the meetings. Saying, he, \"Agreed to meet with FBI agents, without counsel and answer their questions.\" Adding this stinging line, \"A sitting National Security Advisor, former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General and a 33 year veteran of the Armed Forces does not need to be warned that it's a crime to lie to federal agents.\" But, nowhere in the filing does Mueller deny that Andrew McCabe told Michael Flynn, it'd be better not to have a lawyer there. And1 it was pretty clear from James Comey's own lips that the meeting and the questioning was actually anything but business as usual when asked what he knew about the agents just showing up at the White House that day in January of 2017, he said this."

Bush administration for example, or the Obama administration. The protocol, two men that all of us have perhaps increased appreciation for, over the last two years. And in both of those administrations, there was a process. And so, if the FBI wanted to send agents into the White House itself to interview a senior official you would work through the White House counsel, and there'll be discussions and approvals, and who would be there. And I thought it's early enough, let's just send a couple of guys over."

But the defendant never corrected his false statements.\" The filing also includes a memo that appears to be written by then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe who set up the White House interview. According to the memo, Flynn explained that he had been trying to build relationships with the Russians.\" Although parts are heavily redacted, the memo suggests Flynn knew any conversations with the Russian ambassador were monitored by U.S. intelligence. \"He then, stated that I probably knew what was said.\" Though Deputy Director McCabe seemed to discourage Flynn from having a lawyer present for the short notice interview and was not warned any false statements could be prosecuted. The special counsel said the circumstances of the defendant's interview are not mitigating. The incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee weighed in a short time ago."

He described Flynn as having, \"A very sure demeanor and did not give any indicators of deception. Flynn struck Strzok as bright but not profoundly sophisticated.\" This comes as the former FBI director James Comey will answer questions behind closed doors Monday on Capitol Hill.

Now, it turns out that Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who had interviewed Flynn back in January of 2017 was interviewed himself by the FBI on August and he recalled some of those details. By the way, the original report that the FBI agents wrote about that interview, again, on January 24th, 2017. The original report on that was not released today. It's possible that the prosecutors gave it to the judge under seal. Probably a good idea if they did, but we didn't get to see it."

      "utterance": "You know, I think the reason this case keeps getting so much attention is it's just -- there's something weird going on here. December 2016 is this conversation between Flynn and the Russian ambassador. Mid-January, there's a leak about itself as a big crime. There's a leak about it, Flynn denies it. And on January 24th, the FBI agents come to interview him. We learn today, they did not think he was lying. In March, James Comey goes to Capitol Hill and he tells lawmakers that the agents didn't think Flynn was lying and that they shouldn't expect any sort of charges against Flynn. In May, Comey is fired. The new Special Counsel Robert Mueller comes in. In August, all of a sudden there's a new report about this January interview. And then, on December 1st, Flynn pleads guilty to lying. Something is going on that we don't know about, and we still need to find out. And it's interesting to note. I remember, you know in one of the only statements that General Flynn made after this started to unfold, he said, \"I have a story to tell. And when that time comes, I will tell it.\" Jonathan Turley, your thoughts on that. And also on the fact that I'm not sure why there's this effort towards you know, the mitigation when the recommendation is for zero time in jail."

It's doubtful that he would get any jail time in any circumstance. Now, I think we have to be a little cautious with General Flynn. We don't know about some of the other things investigated. He had some very curious ties in these Turkish discussions. And there's been a lot of suggestions of rather a sort of seedy types of plans that went on. We don't know the truth or falsity of those facts, but there's a lot more to be told. But what we do know is that for some reason, they were hunting for Flynn. You know, they say quite clearly, \"We intentionally didn't remind him that he's got to be careful in what he says to us, and yes, that can be a crime.\" Which they did with other witnesses. They skipped the protocols and went directly to him circumventing counsel on the White House. And then, when he finally did say something that they thought was not accurate, they didn't raise it, they just repeated it, they didn't correct it. And so, the question is, why would they be hunting for Flynn at this point? That's what's not explained in any of these filings."

But you -- but even there, you know the fascinating thing in the -- in what we saw today is Flynn tells the agents, \"Will you already know what I said to the Ambassador?\" Which is seems to be a referral to the fact that he knew that he was being surveilled or there was a wiretap on that phone. So that begs the question again, did he really intentionally lie when he assumed that everything that he was saying was being listened to by the FBI."

She's it's a high-wire act what she's been through, brilliant. Or David Bossie who helped win the campaign and who wrote the book Trump's Enemies. If Trump is going to survive these attacks from the House, he's going to counterpunch and he's going to need someone like Bossie that would know how the lead that.

We -- there had been -- when Donald Trump named Ivanka Trump to senior staff she was the 19th son or daughter of a president to be hired at the White House. It's very common. And the early secretaries of the White House were what became the job chief of staff. They were almost all sons of the President up into modern times.

Our state has not exactly been a bastion through the years of non- corruption, let's put it that way. There's been a lot of things that should be getting investigated. It's not the idea of that.

Papenheim a very promising drummer was studying abroad at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. On Wednesday, she was in her apartment, a mile from campus when neighbors called police to report fighting and screaming. Minutes later authorities found Papenheim stabbed to death. Her 23-year-old male roommate was later arrested at a train station 65 miles away holding a suitcase and a cello. Sarah Papenheim's mom says her daughter and the suspect bonded over music and started sharing an apartment about a year ago. But Sarah told her mom the roommate had recently become unstable and angry. The mother says days before Sarah was killed, some mental health professionals came to the apartment but Sarah, quote, \"shooed them away because she was afraid he would think she called them.\" Police have not disclosed the motive but Papenheim's family believes it happened after Sarah decided to leave the apartment to live with her boyfriend. She was apparently gathering her belongings at the time of the attack. Sarah Papenheim was born in Minnesota, raised in California and because of her talent as a drummer she caught the attention of Prince's former band mate and legendary musician Gary \"Jelly Bean\" Johnson, who said after her death, I'm quoting again, \"I liked her because she hit the drums just as hard as guys did. So, I nicknamed her 'thumper.'

All they have to do is look at back at what they did to my husband 10 years ago to see what they are doing to President Trump now. The same prosecutors, the same political assassins I'd like to call them, are trying --taking legal fundraising contributions and legal request for fundraising and turning them in to something that is, you know, they're trying to say are crimes. They're non-existent crimes.

They are trying to figure out where the money went. They know that 60 something million dollars was spent on inauguration.

And all that's left of my husband's case are the three fundraising requests that they are trying to say are now crimes because he asked for campaign contributions and never ever received them. And so, this is the same thing. You know, political fundraising is a first amendment right as deemed by the Supreme Court. And these prosecutors are trying to rewrite the law and say that just because somebody gives you a campaign contribution, and they hope someday you might talk to them about the legislation that's somehow a crime."

They were successful going after my husband and locking him up and throwing him away the key. And because no one stopped them from doing that to my husband now they are going after a bigger target. They've been emboldened because they got away with it with my husband and they, you know, undid an election. Going after somebody that they didn't like for some reason and use every means within their power to do it."

A day that I'll never forget. But the investigation was going on before that. And you know, they will keep at it. Once they set their sights on you, they will keep on. Until they have you sitting in jail for 14 years."

So, I think that they just keep digging and digging and they keep putting pressure on people that are close to the president just like they did to us. They find your friends and your associates. They find people that are close to you that are, that have committed wrongdoing that's unassociated with you and they put pressure on them to say whatever they want them to say."

He dances, he can talk, he was even billed on the Russian state TV as one of the most advanced robots that they have the technology to produce. But if you look closely, we have a shot of the back of his neck. You can see his hair and his neck. Then, there is the gap. That what I first noted in the video. That looks like a real person. It is. Just your average vlog (Ph) dressed up in a robot suit, folks. Here now for ladies night, Lisa Boothe, Susan Li, and Jessica Tarlov. Jessica, let me start with you. I mean, I remember years ago I went to Russia during college and we were near Kiev. And they took us to the economic achievement museum and the agriculture museum. One of the agricultural museums have like a bunch of hay, you know, sort of like, with ribbon wrapped around it. It was very odd. And now this is their latest technological achievement."

It's super embarrassing but it's also Russian state TV where I feel like these things happen every day. And this one was just funny enough that it caught our attention. But this is, it seems very Putin."

      "utterance": "The robot with the dance move. I would say it's disappointing, comedic at the same time. And I'm such a geek because I've been covering artificial intelligence all week with the China trade dispute and artificial intelligence is a real threat for the future. You heard that from Google CEO this week, Sundar Pichai."

And then it turns out the reason why it's so life-like because it's actually a human being in a costume. So, I find this incredible and it's also super embarrassing for Russia because they are billing it as we are so technologically advanced. And then it just sends a thing with a Halloween costume."

She's the American in the crew. And so, this is what she did at an award ceremony for a fashion. And she got a lot of heat for it. They don't mess around with this sort of protocol things in England."

Your child is with you and I get that. But Meghan Markle's pregnancy has been, so much has been made of it that it was announced, that it was leaked out that it was twins. So, I do feel like she was actually going for making a bit of a statement. Like here I am. She surprised them by showing up at that event. She wasn't supposed to be there in a very chic dress as usual and was saying hey, I'm here. It's legit. You know, Harry and I have these two coming and that's what I came here to do."
