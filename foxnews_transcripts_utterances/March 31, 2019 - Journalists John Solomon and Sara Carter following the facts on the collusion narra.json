I think one of the great signs that I saw coming of an industry that was straying so far from neutrality was when Twitter started and you would see these reporters make these extraordinary expressions of opinion. I would have been fired at the \"Associated Press\" if I ever said any of those things 20 years ago and it just opened up a bottle of champagne, the cork popped out and all of a sudden, journalists felt they could just say whatever they wanted. And I learned when I came and no one cared about my opinion, they want to hear about the facts you have in your notebook, I think we strayed so far from that.

I've interviewed President Trump. Sara has interviewed him. He's answered all these questions. It has been unequivocal what he said about what happened in Russia, what didn't happen. I'd like to know, what did Barack Obama know? When was he briefed on the FISA? Or was he briefed on the FISA? Why wasn't he interested in Russia collusion before the election, but after Donald Trump won, he seemed to be very excited about it. These are questions that haven't been asked. Hillary Clinton -- the question we have to ask her, how much did you know about Glenn Simpson and Christopher Steele's operation? What was going on?  Were you being briefed? Did you get any help from a foreign government because you're a former Secretary of State with enormous contacts around the world? Were foreigners helping your campaign like we've just heard in Ukraine recently?

I mean, there's a model for this, too, outside of the Justice Department.  After 9/11, we didn't want 9/11 to be repeated. I now hear a lot of people say, \"We don't want this shenanigans ever to be repeated.\" We did a Special Commission and we looked -- and we aired everything. The FBI had to say, \"Yes, we missed that. We missed that. We didn't connect those dots.\" We have to have the FBI come out and come to recognition what it did wrong here. And the only way to do that is to have a public hearing or to have a prosecution of people so that we can make sure that the people who are ever tempted to play with the laws and to play politics with the intelligence community will never take that temptation again.",

I think one of the great signs that I saw coming of an industry that was straying so far from neutrality was when Twitter started and you would see these reporters make these extraordinary expressions of opinion. I would have been fired at the \"Associated Press\" if I ever said any of those things 20 years ago and it just opened up a bottle of champagne, the cork popped out and all of a sudden, journalists felt they could just say whatever they wanted. And I learned when I came and no one cared about my opinion, they want to hear about the facts you have in your notebook, I think we strayed so far from that.

You interview the people. You look at them in the face. You ask for documents. You find what their motive is. Do they have a motive for telling you this? What is that mode? Sometimes the motive may be selfish. It may still be the truth, but we need to know what the motive is. That's what we always did. I saw it changing. I saw it shifting. So many journalists in a lot of different newsrooms that I worked in would never leave their desk. They always wanted to have friends, especially in Washington, D. C. There was a big bubble here where people felt that, you know, it was better to be friends with the administration especially under Obama -- President Obama -- people really wanted to be friends with the administration -- go to their parties, go to their dinners.

We wanted to talk to you for a second. We can't tell you much because most of what we know is classified, but we will tell you this, if you keep digging, you will find out that the United States intelligence community was used for a political opposition research project and we are deeply concerned.\" I said, \"Well, why are you concerned?\" \"We need these tools.

Apparently, there's a lot that had been going on inside the FBI. Look at Andrew McCabe. Focus on some of these characters.\" It was the same thing that happened to John. I started focusing in and just really taking a step back, saying \"What's going on here?\" And the more we started to investigate, little by little, we started peeling back what we call the onion, right, the layers of the onion.

The court was kept in the dark. What happens with Carter Page? Carter Page is working for the FBI as an informer in another Russia case and they don't tell the court when they then put a FISA warrant on him. History repeated itself because the FBI has not learned the lessons of how to play fair in that court --"

My own view is they ought to abolish the FISA Court system if they're not going to oversee it. These judges have some answering to do and I want the American people to know that impeachment clause there, that's not just for a President or a Vice President or other senior officials in the administration, that's for judges, too. And I'm not saying they should be impeached. I'm not saying we need a hearing on impeachment, but there ought to be a hearing to figure out what the hell took place where Congress really does have legislative oversight here because Congress created them and there seems to be other disinterest in this."

Rosenstein oversees Mueller who is one of his close friends, even though Rosenstein recommended Comey's firing. Okay, so we got that. The Mueller investigation goes wherever it has to go, 13 countries, a Madam in Manhattan, but all this other stuff going on over here. It's like he's a horse with one eye patch. He just keeps running in circles over here. Everyone say, \"Hey, the Hillary campaign, you've got the DNC, you've got this dossier. You've got foreign individuals involved. You've got all kinds of things taking place over here, you might want to look.\" \"No, that's not part of my responsibility.  I'll go after Manafort for tax fraud, for mail fraud. We're going to go after this one and that one for false statements. We've got Flynn. We've got Flynn where we want.\" What about this?

There are serious issues that need to be looked at that have been shunted aside for a very long time. If the Attorney General doesn't feel he can do that with the independence he needs, you can always go that way, but the Justice Department is very good at solving very simple issues. I mean, there's a model for this, too, outside of the Justice Department.  After 9/11, we didn't want 9/11 to be repeated. I now hear a lot of people say, \"We don't want this shenanigans ever to be repeated.\" We did a Special Commission and we looked -- and we aired everything. The FBI had to say, \"Yes, we missed that. We missed that. We didn't connect those dots.\" We have to have the FBI come out and come to recognition what it did wrong here. And the only way to do that is to have a public hearing or to have a prosecution of people so that we can make sure that the people who are ever tempted to play with the laws and to play politics with the intelligence community will never take that temptation again."

There are a lot of people that are concerned that you know, Attorney General Barr won't be able to get an independent enough prosecutor to really handle this. I know that's some people's concerns. I have seen more and more people lean towards a second Special Counsel which I know drives everyone nuts because it can take forever. It's so wide in its scope. It's very frustrating. I think it's frustrating for so many people that were closely involved in this, people that want to see justice that they really are demanding that something be done. I think the most important thing is that Attorney General William Barr not sweep any of this under the rug, but go at it full force on the offensive - - on the offensive both with the FBI and the DOJ, allow Michael Horowitz to do his report.

We are beginning to see significant evidence that the Clinton campaign and people in Ukraine were collaborating. Certainly, Ukrainians wanting to help Hillary Clinton get elected and use their official powers in Ukraine to get that done. The evidence is starting to spill out. There is an investigation launched in Ukraine that is trying to get information to Attorney General Barr. If that happens, there is a whole new avenue and I think all of this will tie together neatly. A British foreign national named Christopher Steele, some people in Ukraine colluding to this false story in the United States election cycle."
