I mean, you get tax cuts, you get judges, you have ISIS and the economy is roaring. And you know, it's been a great year. And now all these companies are giving $1,000 bonus checks to their employees - a bunch of them. You have Wells Fargo raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and Boeing is going to invest $300 million in the employees, so that's good. But there is obviously a huge risk going into the mid- terms. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi should send chills up the president's spine. The House I think is a real risk. And they have to spend a lot of money. But you know what, Republicans have a lot of money. They raised $10 million on October, $42 million cash on hand. The DNC only has $5 million cash on hand. So they are in a lot of trouble. If they think it's going to be a wave with that money?

So he is talking about re-jiggering people inside the White House to better preparing himself. And the question is, who will he bring in? And what changes will be made because we have got a number of people including Dina Powell, for example, leaving the White House -- people walking out. The question is, who stays and what do they do to try to gird themselves? But I think with regard to the tax plan, I mean all he has to do is look at the polls."

And one of the guys that was talking to me today said that the 12 Republicans who voted against tax reform, because their constituents are so mad that their taxes are going up, that those seats are vulnerable.

However, let's see how this does at the beginning of the year, what else he is be able to accomplish that can help take it into the mid-term election to give them some positive momentum. And the other thing is, don't forget, you know, the campaigner. The campaigner and chief, and that Donald Trump is very good at getting out there and really boosting enthusiasm, and turnout.

Yesterday, president Donald Trump played -- he paid a Christmas visit to our brave wounded service members at Walter Reed National Medical Center.
