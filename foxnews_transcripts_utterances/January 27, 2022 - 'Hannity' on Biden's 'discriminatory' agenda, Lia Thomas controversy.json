Joe Biden continues to see his dismal approval numbers crater even more, including in one key battleground state. So how low can Joe go?

      "sentences": "I'm not allowed. I can't do it. I'll get -- they're going to yell at me and everything, and I won't get my ice cream cone. Anyway, so right off the bat, Biden is excluding all potential candidates who are not African-American women. But ask yourself, isn't this agenda in and of itself discriminatory? Imagine that we put out a poll, he said, okay, next time I'm on vacation, you get to pick -- the fill-in for this show and they have what two categories only can you choose from, you decide. Would that be fair? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Anyway, picking candidates based on race and gender it's not only extremely divisive but likely unconstitutional. The Supreme Court in its own jurisprudence has ruled that classifications based on race are subject to the strictness of scrutiny and has found that discrimination based on race unconstitutional. And as law professor Jonathan Turley has pointed out, the president will only consider a black woman for the next nomination, a threshold gender and race condition that the court itself has found unconstitutional for schools and unlawful for private businesses. So the question is, is it okay for Joe to do it and why is he doing it? Is it -- you know, it's not because he's deeply concerned about racial justice. We know that's a lie because remember, he did work with Robert the former Klansman Byrd. He wanted to stop the integration of schools because he was worried about schools becoming in his words racial jungles. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No. Joe Biden is being bullied into the decision by the new extreme left. They're using the Supreme Court pick as another way to flex their power, show their strength, it's identity politics on steroids. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In short, Biden was forced to make this decision. For example, far left New York Congressman Jamaal Bowman tweeting out: Mr. President, you promised us a black woman on the Supreme Court. Let's see it happen. Congresswoman Pressley added, quote: It is time for a black woman on the Supreme Court. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this all raises the question how much was Breyer forced out? Is he retiring on his own terms, on his own timeline? Apparently not. We're also learning tonight that South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn -- Jim Clyburn single-handedly helped save Joe Biden's candidacy after poor showing in -- poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It sounds like Jim Clyburn is admitting that he had a quit and a pro and a quo with old Joe, in terms of, okay, Clyburn would save Joe's faltering campaign and use South Carolina and his popularity which is huge in South Carolina, in exchange, extract a promise from Joe only to put an African- American female on the Supreme Court. Is that the only deal they made? Is there more to that deal? What other deals might be out there? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And furthermore, ask yourself, if far left Democrats and the mob and the media are so concerned about racial diversity on the court and so concerned with racial and gender justice, why are they so hell-bent on smearing Clarence Thomas every chance they get? You know, remember over at MSDNC, who's just recently referred to as Uncle Clarence. Listen to the ladies on the hard-hitting news show on ABC, \"The View\", actually suggesting that Justices Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett are traitors to their race and their gender for not being far-left activist judges that they want. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Now, these important decisions should not be made solely based on race or based on gender. In fact, it's disrespectful to the nominee to do so. But because Biden's presidency is frankly imploding, even Democrats in the media mob are now admitting it. He's now desperate to try and placate his Democratic base that he's losing in droves, as new numbers now show him at an absolutely low dismal approval 34 rating in the key state of Georgia. Look at this poll from \"The Atlanta Journal Constitution\". if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, they didn't like me.

Joe Biden is failing on policy, failing on messaging, failing everywhere in between, as Gallup finds Biden crashing when it comes to key character traits like leadership, government management and good judgment during times of crisis. I'd also add cognitively as well. Empty rhetoric, empty promises, empty shelves and empty suit, that's pretty much sums up the Joe Biden presidency. And now, he's so desperate for a political win, he's willing to go all out and try and appease the radical extreme left who are now pulling the strings and have been pulling the strings of this failed presidency. For Democrats, Joe Biden, it's politics first, it's you the American people, we're dead last. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here for reaction, Leo 2.0 Terrell, along with \"FOX and Friends\" weekend co-host, Pete Hegseth. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right.

Now, while deferring to the national governing body of each sport, in this case, the U.S. Swimming for an official policy, now the NCAA deferring this policymaking only has led to more confusion.

Joe Biden continues to see his dismal approval numbers crater even more, including in one key battleground state. So how low can Joe go? Full coverage straight ahead. And far left failures all across the West Coast are now more undeniable than ever. Comedian Adam Carolla will join us to sound off on all of this California craziness. As goes, California, so goes the rest of the country. And more controversy tonight's surrounding trans athletes in women's sports. Are female athletes being treated unfairly? Caitlyn Jenner will be here and will react to new developments surrounding the University of Pennsylvania's women's swimming team. All of that tonight. But first, we go to the U.S. Supreme Court where Joe Biden today reaffirmed his commitment to using race and gender as the basis for deciding who to nominate to fill Justice Breyer's soon-to-be vacant seat. Here's Joey earlier today."

I'll meet with the potential nominees and it's my intention -- my intention to announce my decision before the end of February. I have made no choice at this point. Thank you all so very, very much for being here. I'm not going to take any questions because I think it's inappropriate to take questions with the justice here. He's still sitting on the bench."

      "utterance": "I'm not allowed. I can't do it. I'll get -- they're going to yell at me and everything, and I won't get my ice cream cone. Anyway, so right off the bat, Biden is excluding all potential candidates who are not African-American women. But ask yourself, isn't this agenda in and of itself discriminatory? Imagine that we put out a poll, he said, okay, next time I'm on vacation, you get to pick -- the fill-in for this show and they have what two categories only can you choose from, you decide. Would that be fair? Anyway, picking candidates based on race and gender it's not only extremely divisive but likely unconstitutional. The Supreme Court in its own jurisprudence has ruled that classifications based on race are subject to the strictness of scrutiny and has found that discrimination based on race unconstitutional. And as law professor Jonathan Turley has pointed out, the president will only consider a black woman for the next nomination, a threshold gender and race condition that the court itself has found unconstitutional for schools and unlawful for private businesses. So the question is, is it okay for Joe to do it and why is he doing it? Is it -- you know, it's not because he's deeply concerned about racial justice. We know that's a lie because remember, he did work with Robert the former Klansman Byrd. He wanted to stop the integration of schools because he was worried about schools becoming in his words racial jungles. No. Joe Biden is being bullied into the decision by the new extreme left. They're using the Supreme Court pick as another way to flex their power, show their strength, it's identity politics on steroids."

It sounds like Jim Clyburn is admitting that he had a quit and a pro and a quo with old Joe, in terms of, okay, Clyburn would save Joe's faltering campaign and use South Carolina and his popularity which is huge in South Carolina, in exchange, extract a promise from Joe only to put an African- American female on the Supreme Court. Is that the only deal they made? Is there more to that deal? What other deals might be out there? And furthermore, ask yourself, if far left Democrats and the mob and the media are so concerned about racial diversity on the court and so concerned with racial and gender justice, why are they so hell-bent on smearing Clarence Thomas every chance they get? You know, remember over at MSDNC, who's just recently referred to as Uncle Clarence. Listen to the ladies on the hard-hitting news show on ABC, \"The View\", actually suggesting that Justices Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett are traitors to their race and their gender for not being far-left activist judges that they want. Take a look."

But to the mob, the media, there's only one standard for Democrats and then another standard for far left judges and then one standard for the rest of us. When it comes to selecting judges, respecting the rule of law, judicial philosophy, the commitment to upholding the Constitution should be the main factors determining who you're going to pick. Now, these important decisions should not be made solely based on race or based on gender. In fact, it's disrespectful to the nominee to do so. But because Biden's presidency is frankly imploding, even Democrats in the media mob are now admitting it. He's now desperate to try and placate his Democratic base that he's losing in droves, as new numbers now show him at an absolutely low dismal approval 34 rating in the key state of Georgia. Look at this poll from \"The Atlanta Journal Constitution\". By the way, they didn't like me. They actually said in their year-end edition about me in 1996, it was a great year for Atlanta. The Olympics came and Sean Hannity left. I left to come to FOX News. Anyway, it's no secret why Stacey Abrams wanted to be nowhere near Biden when he was in Atlanta earlier this month. Joe Biden is failing on policy, failing on messaging, failing everywhere in between, as Gallup finds Biden crashing when it comes to key character traits like leadership, government management and good judgment during times of crisis. I'd also add cognitively as well. Empty rhetoric, empty promises, empty shelves and empty suit, that's pretty much sums up the Joe Biden presidency. And now, he's so desperate for a political win, he's willing to go all out and try and appease the radical extreme left who are now pulling the strings and have been pulling the strings of this failed presidency. For Democrats, Joe Biden, it's politics first, it's you the American people, we're dead last. Here for reaction, Leo 2.0 Terrell, along with \"FOX and Friends\" weekend co-host, Pete Hegseth.

Tell that to Condoleezza Rice, Candace Owens, Larry Elder and Leo Terrell. It is insulting. It is insulting because it makes the mindset that we all think alike. Black people have different views, and the comment to pick a black female is racist. It's the number one reason why I left the Democratic Party because two years ago, Joe Biden said, if you vote for Trump, you ain't black. The Democrats the left wing have divided this country, Sean. You say they played every election cycle. They're planted 24/7. And one final point, this is not going to convince black people to vote for Joe Biden and the Democrats, we hate crimes.

But that's what it should be. But we should expect nothing other than this from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and let me tell you why. This is the least merit-based presidency in American history. As Donald Trump pointed out, Barack Obama pulled up twice failed presidential candidate Joe Biden because he felt like he needed a white guy with experience and some foreign policy experience even though he's always wrong. So Barack Obama wins, Joe Biden goes along for eight years. Then, Joe Biden when he stumbles into the nomination because he promised a black female to a black congressman in a state he otherwise never would have won, he wins South Carolina and moves forward after really not being seen as a viable candidate. Then, he says I need to pick somebody. Who should it be? A black female, it's going to be Kamala Harris, even though she couldn't pull over one percent. So, no one in -- currently in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue got there because of merit. So why would we expect that this would be anything other than a box checking identity politics, politically correct, left-wing giveaway based on race from the guy who sat in front of Clarence Thomas when he said, this is a high tech lynching from the guy who said they're going to put you back in chains?

You could play that montage all the time, back in the early `70s up until now. Joe Biden is a racist. But they wanted him in lieu of President Trump and look what has happened to this country in the last 12 months. We have lost our direction because of Joe Biden.

That's why our movement is working to invest in our communities, eradicate root causes of gun violence and keep everyone safe. But remember, Bush is one of the you know same far left Democrats that repeatedly called to defund the police, even as crime is spiking in major Democratic-run cities and states all across the country. So how are we going to keep everyone safe and secure if we don't let police have the money to do their jobs and continue to cripple their funding, never mind their stupid bail laws? Now, Bush herself spends tens of thousands of dollars on private security. I'm sorry she has to go through that. Sadly, I've had to live that -- that at points in my life as well. But don't her constituents in St. Louis, don't they also deserve the same safety and security? Defund, dismantle the police doesn't work. No bail laws don't work. You know, coast to coast, we're seeing the same exact thing. Democrats they like to attack the police and crime gets worse, including in New York where the state Republican Party slamming failed far left Governor Kathy Hochul again today -- this week, defending weak bail laws that put dangerous and violent criminals right back on the street. Now, the party said in a statement, quote, at least now, it's crystal clear that she stands firmly with criminals over New Yorker safety. Carjackings, New York, they're up over 350 percent in just the last three years. Carjackings are up over 500 percent in Chicago since 2014. And as we've been showing, theft, crime are brazen. Take a look at your screen. Here's a theft in broad daylight at a New York City Rite-Aid where the alleged shoplifter isn't concerned at all about getting caught and keep looking out. In Seattle, see this guy believed to be a homeless man hauling a 70-inch TV right out of a Target last month. He reportedly has been arrested nearly two dozen times for stealing in just the last few months. Why isn't he in jail? In Houston, a suspect was taken into custody following a standoff after allegedly shooting three police officers, thankfully, all are in stable condition expected to recover. Now, we'll continue following the story. This is lawlessness plain and simple, the natural consequence of far left Democratic rule. Here with reaction, Donald Trump Jr. You know, we had -- the riots at the summer of 2020, 574 of them, dozens dead, thousands of cops injured, billions in property damage arson and looting. Okay, where's that committee, Don? Because they don't have a committee looking into that.

They do nothing towards the criminals, the places that are seeing the greatest spike in crime are the places with the most restrictive gun laws. But they don't want to actually enforce those laws because that would be offensive to the actual criminals. What you see is outright lawlessness. Whether it's there, whether it's at the border, whether it's Joe Biden and his family the Democrats only talk about law-abiding citizens. They don't actually care if their people follow those same laws. It's ridiculous and we're seeing it on a grand scale, Sean. And you know all throughout the summer of 2020, I couldn't understand it. Your father kept begging cities like New York and cities like Portland. As the law required, he would authorize the use and the calling up of the National Guard. Then, it becomes the chain of command goes to the governor or the mayor of a particular state or city and every single time almost, even on January six, he approved 20,000 troops, up to 20,000 troops on January 4th, and Nancy Pelosi didn't call him up and Muriel Bowser didn't call him up and nobody wants to ask why didn't they?

Yet all the perpetrators of those crimes, all of the cities that were -- that those things happened in, all of the legislators that were in charge were all Democrats. That's literally the only common bond during that 18 months of total chaos in America, was that Democrats were a part of all of the disaster. So, when it's not conducive to the narrative, you don't hear about it. When it is, they can try to weaponize it against conservatives. You've seen that across the board, right? Joe Biden was going to be an elder statesman. He was going to be tough. He was going to be all of these things. The reality is he's divisive. He's got his own racial past. The family is corrupt. He is incompetent and inept. And literally, all of the things the left were screaming about and candidly lying about Donald Trump exactly exemplify Joe Biden, whether it's incompetence, whether it's disasters. Remember, he was going to come in and fix all of these things. He's fixed exactly zero, Sean. In fact, he's made everything worse. Our border is a disaster. The Russians are about to invade Ukraine. We're getting in this hawkish policy where we're talking about sending troops into war because we've been out of war for all of three or four months after the disaster in Afghanistan. I get to read reports saying that intelligence is saying that Russians may be launching a cyber attack on America, I don't think so. I imagine that's our people lying to us to try to instigate us getting into another war to distract from the incompetence. Do you think our posture in Ukraine has anything to do with his corrupt son raking in millions over the year? And this is the way to cover it up, that favors are being called in. No one is even asking the question because it's obvious. Like everything else we've been told over the last five years, all we're getting is lies and diversion.

Now, following a vote last week they agreed to quote take a, quote, sport by sport approach to transgender participation. Now, while deferring to the national governing body of each sport, in this case, the U.S. Swimming for an official policy, now the NCAA deferring this policymaking only has led to more confusion. Many of these governing bodies have no official guideline at all. Meanwhile, her continued domination of the sport is sparking widespread outrage. Now, Piers Morgan writing in \"The New York Post\", calling the NCAA to, quote, stop this woke insanity now. The father of another Penn swimmer lamenting, quote, in an anonymous interview with FOX News that her teammates are realizing they'll never have a chance at winning podium -- winning the podium so long as she continues to compete given the physical disadvantages that they face. But this woke ideology doesn't stop with athletics. As we're now learning tonight, Chicago public school teachers are now being forced to undergo training in which they were told that sex is a social construct, not rooted in biology. Now, Olympic gold medalist and former California gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner, FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce join us for reaction. Caitlyn, I noticed in the Piers article, you were quoted as saying some really interesting things to me, and we've known each other for a long time. And you said the NCAA is kicking the can down the road. In the case of Lia Thomas, she said, you don't care about her testosterone levels now for the last year or two, but you care about it for the first or years of her life, and you even mentioned that you wouldn't play in a woman's all woman's golf tournament because you can still out drive all girls by a hundred yards and you have no testosterone.

I feel sorry for the girls on the Penn team because they have to be so woke and say, oh, this is great, we're down deep inside, they say they're saying this is wrong. And a couple of them anonymously because they can't come out and parents have now come out, but they have to do it anonymously and say this is wrong. And it is wrong and I'm very disappointed in the NCAA. They did kick the can down the road, and but we have to deal with this issue. We have to protect women's sports. They work so hard for equality.

This is about fair play. It's about decency. It's about being fair with your fellow competitors or with your neighbors. This is about the nature of doing what's right in the midst of whatever your work is and if that's going to give you an advantage. And you must know, and I don't know Lia. I'm sure she's a wonderful woman. At the same time, she knows every single meet that it is not an even playing field. She knows that every single time she blows out women's records at every moment and that is what we're talking about here. So there is a small section of bullies who want no one to speak about this. But I can tell you, as Caitlyn has refused to participate in certain women's sports because she knows of her physical difference and her -- the ability to do better because of that physical difference having grown as a boy and then as a male, and now we know, I've got several transgender friends who also agree that this is outrageous. We also don't know of those athletes who have refused to do this because they don't make the news. So I just want to tell everyone watching that this is not about the transgender community. There is -- this is not universally what is wanted. In fact, it harms the nature and the argument about who people are in general. Let me tell you, if someone's going to be unfair as a transgender woman, they're going to be unfair as the man that they were. They're going to be unfair as a person.

I'm kind of used to it, Sean. And to be honest with you, a lot of those comments that people make with nobody around, I don't know if they really believe that kind of stuff. They may. But that's okay. I mean, honestly, I can take it. I'm about -- you know, Sean, I'm a patriot. I love this country. I love our freedoms, you know? And I -- and I love the trans community, but we have to do what's fair and we have to do what's right. So, you know, Lia Thomas grew up as a biological boy, a couple of years ago was on the male swim team. A couple of years of, you know, hormones and testosterone depressants doesn't change a lot of things, you know? Hands are big, cardiovascular system big. You see pictures her back is huge. She can run -- I mean, she can swim really fast and it's just not fair. It's not fair."

That there -- it does no good for the community to be bullies or to not speak the truth about the nature of what's going on.

Earlier this week, well, aging classic rocker Neil Young gave the music streaming service Spotify an ultimatum, drop their number one podcast the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" or take Young's music off the platform. Now , Young was apparently upset about what Rogan was saying about the vaccine on his podcast. Spotify, they sided with Rogan. Good for them. Now, you'll have to listen \"A Heart of Gold\" somewhere else from now on. Here with reaction is the author of \"Everything Reminds Me of Something,\" host of the \"Adam Carolla Show\", he's also taping two comedy specials on Sunday, February the 6th that the I think it's a Brea Improv in California and it has featured guest appearances, William Shatner, Dennis Quaid. You get tickets, pre-order the book, just go to adamcarolla.com. Adam, good to see you. Thanks for joining us.

I like -- I don't know Joe Rogan, but I like his work, I like the fact that he makes you think, and if you don't like it, you don't have to agree with it. Why are people have a hard time if somebody doesn't toe the line on this topic or that topic?"

But I find it interesting coming from rockers and comedians and artists because their job is to push back against the man and Neil Young should know the man isn't Joe Rogan. The man is Dr. Fauci, the man is Governor Gavin Newsom, the man is the CDC, the man is the WHO, the man is Biden. That's who the man is. You're an old rocker. You're supposed to push back against the man. Joe Rogan is pushing back against the man and you're pushing back against Joe Rogan."

Now, we have vaccine mandates. Now, whether you're vaccinated and have a booster or have natural immunity, you're still getting COVID. Everybody's getting. How can we run out of tests, therapeutics and we don't have any antivirals? Why did -- how could they be so behind the curve on this?"

What do you guys been right about? You close the beaches down. You close the schools down, cloth masks were going to save us all, the vaccine was going to be effective, natural immunity wasn't effective, what have you been right about? That's really the question. I put Joe Rogan's batting average up against CNN's batting average any day of the week. They thought ivermectin was horse paste."

But one thing that has been working are monoclonal antibodies. Now, for Regeneron, I know was do working wonders on the delta variant. Now they say GSK sotrovimab is working on the omicron variant, but there's none available. We ran out. Every doctor, Adam, I talked to says these antiviral pills the ones by Pfizer are amazing, but you can't get them anywhere. And people are still having a hard time getting tests. How did they run out of tests, now we're in year three of this pandemic?"

      "speaker": "CAROLLA",
      "utterance": "Well, basically what they decided is you need to do what they want you to do and what they want you to do is get vaccinated, and that's why they've always pooh-poohed any therapeutic. I mean, look at the theme. Anytime a therapeutic has come around they pooh-poohed it. The thing that's funny is guys like Neil Young who back in the day would have been on the side of natural immunity are now on the side of big pharma and pushing against natural immunity. So the whole thing is upside down."

That's driving the media and Democrats nuts. Democrats in the Old Dominion, not happy. One liberal state delegate questioning Youngkin's faith for banning critical race theory.

Almost every day, someone on the other side of the aisle either gets up and either subtly or comes right out and suggests that if you don't agree with them on policy, well, then you're not a Christian. You're a sexist. You're a bigot. You're a racist. I'm tired of it. My constituents are tired of it, because when these claims are made, they're not just made against Governor Youngkin. They're not just made against us, they are made in part against the people that elected to send us here. If you're going to question the faith or the intentions of anybody that happens to disagree with you on policy, then you don't get to lecture us on compassion, tolerance or an open debate.

The reason why my inbox is full and my phone has been ringing off the hook with people all over the country thanking me for what I said is because this isn't just in the political realm. This is where they go to work. This is when they take their kids to school. This is when they turn on the TV and watch a football game. And we have tons of Americans all over the country that have been repeatedly told that if they don't buy into whatever the latest progressive talking point is today, that somehow this makes them a bigot or a bad person and quite frankly, they expect those of us that they elect to represent them to stand up and defend them not because they need it but because they deserve it."

And every conservative I know wants nothing to do with ignorant people. This is a big lie that has always perpetuated. I'm glad you spoke up. Are you going to continue?"

      "speaker": "FREITAS",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely, because like you said, this is not just about the narrative. The narrative is frustrating enough, but this is less and less becoming about Republican and Democrat. This is becoming about reasonable versus unreasonable. And when your entire narrative is believe the way I do or you're a bigot, and your policy position is do what I want or I will punish you through government, I'm sorry this is not the country that I fought for. Everybody in this country deserves the right to be able to live their life the way they want, to be able to pursue happiness in accordance with their definition of it, not some progressive politician thinks they know best and they deserve to know that there's going to be people that stand up and defend them."
