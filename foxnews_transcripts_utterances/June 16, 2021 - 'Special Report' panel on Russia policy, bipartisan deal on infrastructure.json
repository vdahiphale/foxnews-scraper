When we give them the Nord Stream pipeline, when we eliminate the sanctions against the people involved in that, when we set these arbitrary red lines that will obviously not be honored when it comes to Russian cyberattacks, when we engage in restarting the Iran deal or any other number of foreign policy decisions, what is it that America is getting in return? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I realized that the criticism of Donald Trump's administration was that his approach to foreign policy was far too transactional. There's some validity to that. I think that American interests include an ideological interest in favor of freedom. But there's also a transactional element to foreign policy, and one that we ought to respect. This is not in any way a situation that I think redounds to the American benefit. And if the outcome of this is that we have a stern talking to about the potential death of Alexei Navalny, we have some warnings that are given to the media and the like from Joe Biden and we have them oing and eyeing over his gift of American made aviators. We're not really emerging from this having achieved anything in the American interest if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But you know, Russia has the power, you know, in terms of distracting and disrupting everything from the hacking to involvement in Middle East peace deals, you know, aid to Iran, to Syria. Even in terms of Eastern Europe, Europe, with Belarus. And what's been going on in the Ukraine. So, I think they wanted to just kind of say, here is what our American interest are. Here are lines that we are setting now in this conversation, especially on cyber security. I think that was probably the number one was in Biden's words at the press conference, he said he let Putin know that the U.S. has tremendous cyber capability if that's the game he wants to play. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think again, it's the cybersecurity, it's human rights, no revoking the Magnitsky Act (PH) on Russian oligarchs.

And my question about their foreign policy in this early going, really is what are we getting back in return? When we give them the Nord Stream pipeline, when we eliminate the sanctions against the people involved in that, when we set these arbitrary red lines that will obviously not be honored when it comes to Russian cyberattacks, when we engage in restarting the Iran deal or any other number of foreign policy decisions, what is it that America is getting in return? I realized that the criticism of Donald Trump's administration was that his approach to foreign policy was far too transactional. There's some validity to that. I think that American interests include an ideological interest in favor of freedom. But there's also a transactional element to foreign policy, and one that we ought to respect. This is not in any way a situation that I think redounds to the American benefit. And if the outcome of this is that we have a stern talking to about the potential death of Alexei Navalny, we have some warnings that are given to the media and the like from Joe Biden and we have them oing and eyeing over his gift of American made aviators. We're not really emerging from this having achieved anything in the American interest"

You know, the build up to this was big. Foreign policy experts were waiting for this, like, you know, get around the T.V., get a bowl of Cheez-its and watch this thing. But what happened, did it -- did it deliver?"

    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",

And as you know, overall, I think the Biden administration has made it very clear, they view all world affairs at this point as a matter of democracies versus autocracies, China would be number one on that list. But you know, Russia has the power, you know, in terms of distracting and disrupting everything from the hacking to involvement in Middle East peace deals, you know, aid to Iran, to Syria. Even in terms of Eastern Europe, Europe, with Belarus. And what's been going on in the Ukraine. So, I think they wanted to just kind of say, here is what our American interest are. Here are lines that we are setting now in this conversation, especially on cyber security. I think that was probably the number one was in Biden's words at the press conference, he said he let Putin know that the U.S. has tremendous cyber capability if that's the game he wants to play. And I think again, it's the cybersecurity, it's human rights, no revoking the Magnitsky Act (PH) on Russian oligarchs. And then finally, I think you have to think about the global stability, you know, stay out of our business."

You have the guy in front of you who tried to sow the seeds of discord in our democracy. Did you bring it up? How about the indicted? How about the people Mueller indicted, the Russians under indicted -- under indictment? I wonder if that came up.

But it is an aspect of his character that only seems to come out more in this day and age. Unfortunately, all these questions are very valid, and ones that ought to be answered responsibly by the president. I think they would be directed at the president, any party engaged in this kind of interaction. Unfortunately, I don't think that we got any real answers from Joe Biden. I don't think we're going to get any real answers from this administration. Because unfortunately, this meeting only redounded to the benefit of Vladimir Putin. It did not benefit us in any clear way. I have no idea what we got from this. Putin got ambassador's back, he got to laugh at the press leaving the room, he got to assert that there were certain areas that were off limits and on limits when it came to the ransomware attacks and the likes as Trey said. And unfortunately, I think that that is really an example of weakness when it comes to our approach to this. We never should have had this meeting in the first place given everything that's happened in recent months."

Look, we hold the aces in this, let's just -- I mean, I'm not trying to be, you know, overly boastful about the United States. But our economy is 15 times the size of Russia, Canada has a bigger economy than Russia. Their economy is basically a gas station, you know, based on oil and gas and that's a declining asset in the modern world. So, when he does something, he is just basically a disrupter. And what you have, the President of the United States holding all the aces in the conversation saying, is here -- here's the deal, Mr. Putin, we'll see where this goes.

      "speaker": "TREY GOWDY, FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "It is. The devil is going to be in the details, Bret. It reads to me like they are agreeing to split what we all call infrastructure from what the Squad calls infrastructure. So, notice the prior criticism was that the word \"infrastructure\" was being used to cover lots of other things. So we're going to split the two bills. But if they require Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin and all the other Democrats to vote for both bills, then what have Republicans gained? You still get the whole bill, you just get it on two separate days instead of the same day. So I'm not real sure what Republicans gain from this. But, look, infrastructure is always popular. It's usually bipartisan. But it is usually defined as roads and bridges and airports, and not daycare."

And, again, as you just said, quite rightly, it's the liberals who are saying, wait a second, why are we making a deal? Why are we compromising at this moment when we should be making an all-out effort to deliver on what is a popular plan? The infrastructure deal at the moment, is like almost two thirds of the country thinks it's a good idea and about a third of Republicans. But I think the whole notion that the president, Biden, holds in mind is it can be popular -- even more popular if he can assure people he's made every effort to achieve bipartisanship."

BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  There are so many repeats here, shades of the Obamacare discussion that happened in 2009 when President Obama was desperate for a while there to get just one Republican vote or one non-Democratic vote to support his plan in order to have that veneer of bipartisanship. Meanwhile, the progressive flank of the party at the time was pushing them to use their far more significant legislative advantage to really press forward with the policies that they wanted to achieve. I think in this instance, President Biden similarly had wanted to have a veneer of bipartisan to this plan. We'll look into the details of what this proposal looks like, but I still feel like the progressive flank is a lot more powerful now than it was back in 2009 in directing the future of the party, and that's going to be a really tough in the for the White House to crack."
