I respect the FBI, which of course, there is (Inaudible) home and hotel. He said I choose to believe our intelligence agencies. And I repudiate Russia or any other foreign government to interfere and meddle on our Democratic process. He said simply accepting the denial of Mr. Putin is unsustainable. None of that was any accident. He rehearsed for this, very much wanted to send a message to the President. And not only is he is own man, but that he is trying for reasons of his own reputation, to kind of distance himself from the guy who he worked for.

An unprecedented amount of transparency. So we know a lot about these people. What we know about them is that they do have a different approach than the judicial activism that has brought some of the more revolutionary social progressive changes that the court has brought.

And so he opened the door to this entire line of conversation himself during the campaign. Secondly, there are cases that are in the pipeline now that it is not a stretch to believe would make it to the Supreme Court that will deal with these issues head-on. Does it mean that any of them could outlaw abortion across the land? I think that is unlikely. Could it throw it back to the states and now we are back to a case where women in some states have this right and women in others don't? That's an open legitimate question.

We are not talking about what it really has to do which is more about funding abortion versus whether Roe (ph) and also we are not even looking at big important issues like what he or she would think of overturning Obamacare provisions, things like that.

She is also part of a group that has a bunch of Catholics in it. And the way that it has been portrayed is a super nefarious group outside of Vatican control. The Vatican, the pope just appointed one of its members, the auxiliary bishop of Portland in 2014. So it's clearly not a group that's that renegade. It's not the (INAUDIBLE) cover religion in this. You should cover religion. And it is a very important issue not just of the candidates but also in how they -- how they allow religious liberty to thrive in a land.

He was trying to take apart the Obama era EPA regulations and he accomplished a lot of that. And I think that fueled the investigatory desires of journalists to try to take him down and outside groups to try to -- and people within the EPA to try to take him out for that very reason. He made himself a very easy target. But he would not have been the same level of target if he had a different job within the administration."

I think this was driven primarily by Scott Pruitt's actions, buy his alienation of many on his own staff who then went to the press who did some really good investigative journalism. If you supported Donald Trump because you believe that he was going to drain the swamp here in Washington, D.C., you should be appalled by Scott Pruitt. Scott Pruitt was the swampiest person D.C. has seen in quite some time."

I think I had a chance to talk about it on \"The Ingraham Angle.\" I think that was a mistake. But, you said that this was a win for the resistance. And so my question is, you are saying it was some kind of coordinated effort by the media for ideological reasons because if most of those stories were true, partisan sources always come to reporters with dirt on people they don't like?"

She deleted text articles and impeachment were drawn up against her. There was the mishandling of the Colorado mine crisis which flooded the Animas River. There was the Flint water crisis. And yet you didn't see The New York Times and Washington Post pushing a drumbeat against her. I am not saying that that means that what Scott Pruitt should not be covered. But I think what readers and viewers would like is to see more evenness in how things are covered. If you really care about the swamp, cover it no matter who is in charge."

So, he had lost support among his own side and among journalists and commentators on his side."

So, there is not just the issue that the resistance had a very coordinated campaign which actually was covered by the media when it started in March and it actually started from the time he began. He lost the support of his own people. He also handed the ammunition to his critics. It's a multilevel story.

She is a reporter whose phone e-mail records were searched by the Justice Department as part of a leak investigation that led to the indictment of a former Senate intel community official who was having an affair with her. The paper is reassigning her from the Washington bureau to New York. Executive editor Dean Baquet said, \"we are troubled by Ali's conduct, particularly while she was employed by other news organizations. For a reporter to have an intimate relationship with someone he or she covers is unacceptable.\" He said the Times is also bearing some responsibility. Watkins said she regretted putting the paper in a difficult spot and, quote, should handled aspects of my past relationships and disclosures differently. The Times investigation found the 26-year-old reporter told BuzzFeed and Politico only that she was dating a man in the intelligence community, not naming the official at the committee she cover. And didn't tell Politico when she started dating a second committee staffer after a breakup, nor she told the Times the government had seized her records last February. Baquet said the Times can a place that allows for second chances. Brian Ross is leaving ABC News after a major blunder about President Trump and the Russia probe. This was back in December. The network suspended Ross for a month for reporting that Trump had directed Michael Flynn to contact Russian officials during the campaign when it actually took place after the election, nothing wrong with that. Ross who apologized at the time says he doesn't plan to leave investigative reporting. He won numerous awards in his 24 years with ABC but has made other high-profile mistakes. There was a moment of silence in newsrooms across the country to remember the five people who were killed at the Annapolis Capital Gazette by a crazed gunman who hated the paper for writing about his past conviction. The newspaper said in an editorial that anyone expecting national consensus to come from the death of five community journalists in Annapolis will be sorely disappointed. We can only hope they will agree with this simple statement. This madness must stop, says the paper. Ahead, is Jimmy Fallon, the only late-night host who hasn't been savaging Donald Trump, now turning on him? (INAUDIBLE) is up next on the latest warfare between the president and the press."

Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote they're looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism, but then again so are many others.

Jimmy Fallon's show, he wanted to just to be kind of fun and lighthearted and just funny, a good time for viewers. And so now there might be indications that he's saying it's working for Stephen Colbert. Let me bring in on to my show."

      "utterance": "OK. Before we go to Adrienne, I think people should actually hear what was said. Sorry for the technical difficulties. Let's roll that again."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I go on the show. I agree. Do whatever you want with my hair. Go ahead. Let's go. And that was it. What is it, a year and a half, two years later he's now apologizing because he humanized me? And he really hurt himself. So I said to him today on social media, I said Jimmy, be a man. Just relax. Just relax."

      "speaker": "JIMMY FALLON, THE TONIGHT SHOW",
      "utterance": "When I saw that Trump insulted me on Twitter, I was going to tweet back immediately. But I thought I have more important things to do. Shouldn't he have more important things to do? He's the president. What are you doing? You're the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So Fallon loving the attention. And by the way, this is serious stuff because the Tonight Show used to be number one (Inaudible) replaced by Colbert with a more overtly political and anti-Trump brand of humor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean look, I think that what we might be making too much of this. I mean Jimmy Fallon, to the point that you made earlier, was the one host that was still willing to have Donald Trump on, didn't have him on and got flack in Hollywood. There is a huge -- the resistance that the Democratic Party has formed. A lot of it is you know really a (Inaudible) on the west coast and east. So it's not a surprise that he would say you know I regret having him on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Regretted playing with him, his hair."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "Yeah, and humanizing him. I don't know. I think it's much ado about nothing. And I think that there is probably some pressure from a lot of the -- his audience base."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But here is why it's not entirely much ado about nothing, because millions of people watch these shows and a lot of people who are not political junkies get their political fix from these shows, and the videos playing online. So I think it's not as important as Alan Dershowitz, but."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Adrienne Elrod, Emily Jashinsky, thanks so much. After the break, Michael Cohen scrubs any mention of Donald Trump through his Twitter account, and the pundits try to figure out what does it mean."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "A Fox News alert. Four out of the twelve boys trapped inside a cave in Thailand have now been led to safety. The boys and their soccer coach entered the cave 15 days ago. President Trump tweeting a short while ago, the U.S. is working very closely with the governor of Thailand to help get all the children out of the cave and to safety, very brave and talented people. Complete update coming at the top of the hour. Michael Cohen's off-camera sit-down with ABC's George Stephanopoulos unleashed a tidal wave of speculation about whether the President's long time personal lawyer is now turning against him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "And this is where he also stiffened (Inaudible). He actually straightened up in the seat and then said this. I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone's defense strategy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "The one thing we know about Michael Cohen is that it seems like he'll throw anybody under the bus. Is he trying to send a message to President Trump by saying don't try to railroad me. Don't try to throw me under the bus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "They're still going to back the truck over him, whether he's a nice person with a (Inaudible) family or not. The President's still going to back the truck over him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Mollie Hemingway, a lot of talk about buses and trucks there. Obviously, Michael Cohen is sending a signal to Donald Trump that he'll no longer take a bullet for him, but since no one in the media knows exactly what he's saying (Inaudible) of speculation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, not even true. That's a reasonable thing to say. I mean he spoke a great deal and he's under a great deal of stress. He's under investigation. But what was interesting that I thought came out in that interview, was that he said once again that contrary to what was reported by so many media outlets he was never in Prague. He never colluded with Russia with treasonous collusion. That's the entire reason why we know him and why he's under investigation. And yet nobody pulled that out. But then they are trying to read these tea leaves about everything else he said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And lots of different, conflicting interpretations about who is going under the bus, who is not going under the bus. But let's move from speculation and reporting, because based on my reporting I can say that Michael Cohen in preparing for that interview chose his words and phrases very deliberately and wanted to send a message to President Trump. It's kind of taken a direct shot at him on things he doesn't normally talk about. For example, he said I don't agree with those who demonize the FBI. I respect the FBI, which of course, there is (Inaudible) home and hotel. He said I choose to believe our intelligence agencies. And I repudiate Russia or any other foreign government to interfere and meddle on our Democratic process. He said simply accepting the denial of Mr. Putin is unsustainable. None of that was any accident. He rehearsed for this, very much wanted to send a message to the President. And not only is he is own man, but that he is trying for reasons of his own reputation, to kind of distance himself from the guy who he worked for. And then the -- there was a sort of a second round of this when Cohen changed his Twitter page and removed all the references to Trump, kind of like on Facebook after a breakup or something. Do you think maybe we are overdoing this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, what is interesting about that too is usually when you leave a job you do update your LinkedIn profile and what not to indicate that you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "So everyone had all this -- oh, he said he's no longer the President's attorney as of June 2018, which is also just his job status. He's no longer the President's attorney. So it's perfectly fine to note it. But again, I think we should be thinking of the larger story. The larger story is that we were told for many years by many people in the media and by anonymous sources that there was treasonous collusion with Russia to steal an election. Do we have anything that supports that at this point? We have had so much activity from Special Counsel. We have Cohen under fire. We have various other people under fire. But what they are allegedly under fire for still has nothing to do with that overarching story that led to all of the drama that we have had in recent years. I think journalists should take a step back and think about that, and think about how well they've covered that story and how well they're being honest as it seems to sort of fall apart."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, Cohen (Inaudible) involvement in writing a letter to try to get a Trump Tower in Moscow project restarted, didn't really know anybody there, and so it didn't get restarted. He does have you know some exposure on the payment to Stormy Daniels, the $130,000 hush money payment for which he was reimbursed by the President. But one of the reasons, Mollie that he wasn't appearing on camera and it was on the record but off camera interview with Stephanopoulos is that he didn't want to have to say again and again and again, I can't comment about the investigation. So all this showing a lot of strategy really (Inaudible) Rudy Giuliani on Sunday's shows today, saying (Inaudible) the President wants to testify but we the lawyers are holding him back.
