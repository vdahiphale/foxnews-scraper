When a president makes a phone call to a foreign leader, there's a team of people in the Situation Room of about four or five intelligence officers who are typing every word the president and his counterpart say. That's how a transcript gets created.

There are a lot of people who rushed to judgments or always want to win the race to be wrong first in all this, but there are in fact two people who think this allegation is significant enough. One is the actual whistleblower, and one is the I.G. That should be of concern. First of all, the president's tweet is odd in that it actually confirms the story. There's nothing that he alludes to that says the story is fake. He actually confirms that this happened basically. The question is whether or not the actual substance of what he said was so terrible. And we just simply do not know. And the problem is that just as President Trump is not exactly a reliable defender of himself on this, he says inappropriate things all the time and has a long record of it. Adam Schiff isn't reliable either. He's gotten way ahead of the facts for the last two years on the Russia probe and lots of other things, and I think we do have to wait for the facts to come in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Story came from \"Washington Post\" report about a whistleblower who allegedly told the inspector general the intelligence community about concerns -- urgent concerns -- he had about the president. According to the report, \"Trump's interaction with a foreign leader included a promise that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community. It was not immediately clear which foreign leader Trump was speaking with or what he pledged to deliver. One former official says the communication was a phone call.\" The president tweeting about the story. \"Another Fake News story out there -- It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem! Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \"heavily populated\" call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\" So let's start there with our panel, former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and Jonah Goldberg, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. OK, Ari, your thoughts on this story?"

    {
      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Bret, mark me down as curious but highly skeptical. And here's why. When a president makes a phone call to a foreign leader, there's a team of people in the Situation Room of about four or five intelligence officers who are typing every word the president and his counterpart say. That's how a transcript gets created. And that transcript then is shared around the administration as widely or as narrowly as the call requires for people to know that the president talked about. If there is something indeed that scandalous, that morally objectionable that the president said, it would have leaked. Somebody along that line would've said something before. And the fact that only one intelligence officer has seen this enough to file a whistleblower report and none of the others who have seen it filed a report, it just makes me highly, highly suspect, especially all the other false accusations against this president before. This sounds like another one."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Leslie, we saw some early reporting in President Trump's administration about phone calls he had with various leaders about the specifics of those phone calls from transcripts or actually hearing those calls. So this, I guess, falls into that line."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes. So when the president talks about fake news, this is very different than some of the other fake news accusations he's made. There is a transcript. There are written assists to the conversation. We don't know how many certainly within his country. But the statute is very clear. There obviously seems to be a disagreement between the acting director, Maguire, and the inspector general, who did find this of an urgent nature. And the statute is clear, if that is the case, then he, acting or otherwise, is supposed to provide that information to Congress. So in a sense, he has broken the law. And if there is nothing so damning here, then why isn't Congress being provided with this information right when they requested it? That would be the proper chain of command. It's unprecedented that this is happening, and it's perverting the process, not to follow the process as it has been laid out in the statute and been followed prior."

      "utterance": "I don't know whether the White House is directly involved because we can't get an answer to that question.

    {
      "speaker": "JONAH GOLDBERG, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, that's debatable. I believe both the Bush administration and the Obama administration also contested this idea of the statute actually compelling the disclosure of executive privilege stuff. There is, according to a lot of constitutional scholars, a solid argument that the president could have done something absolutely terrible or said something absolutely terrible, and he's still within its constitutional prerogatives to keep that secret. So the law is going to be disputed in all that. And I take Ari's point, and I generally agree that we should be very skeptical about all of this. There are a lot of people who rushed to judgments or always want to win the race to be wrong first in all this, but there are in fact two people who think this allegation is significant enough. One is the actual whistleblower, and one is the I.G. That should be of concern. First of all, the president's tweet is odd in that it actually confirms the story. There's nothing that he alludes to that says the story is fake. He actually confirms that this happened basically. The question is whether or not the actual substance of what he said was so terrible. And we just simply do not know. And the problem is that just as President Trump is not exactly a reliable defender of himself on this, he says inappropriate things all the time and has a long record of it. Adam Schiff isn't reliable either. He's gotten way ahead of the facts for the last two years on the Russia probe and lots of other things, and I think we do have to wait for the facts to come in."

    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. That's paramount. That's of vital importance for presidents, no matter what your party is, no matter what era you're the president. And presidents need latitude. They need the latitude in a conversation with a foreign leader to be able to say things that they think might move a foreign leader in America's interest, in their direction. So take for example, as a hypothetical, Bret, let's say he was talking to the North Korean leader, and he said if you were able to make peace, you're going to be the richest guy in the world. We can make you rich because all that business is going to come in. Is that an inducement, is that a bribe, is that something a whistleblower would say you can't do that, or is that a legitimate use of presidential diplomacy to try to achieve a goal for our country? Presidents have an enormous latitude when it comes to intelligence-sharing and diplomacy, properly so."

I think that we all are. So I think when he says it's personhood, it's personkind, not mankind or womankind, he's speaking not only to the sensitivities of certain people in the community in Canada but throughout the world.

    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Well, two points, Bret. Number one, in terms of Israeli politics and what comes next, it is now a game of maneuvers. In order to get 61 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, you start cutting deals with everybody left, right, center, up and down. And political ideology in Israel becomes real flexible. People start forming alliances with groups that they hate if it will get them there 61 votes, and that's what's happening behind the scenes now. Both parties are doing it, Blue and White among with Likud, Netanyahu's Likud, Benny's Blue and White. In terms of what the implications are, especially in America, if anybody in America is thinking getting rid of Netanyahu is going to lead to a different Israeli defense policy or foreign policy or security policy or that they will renegotiate the deal with Iran or they will be a coming out for a two-state solution, forget it. There is little difference between Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu when it comes to security positions. Bibi is seen as tougher, he's been reviled by the press. But any American who expects a big difference on those foreign policy issues, this election is not about that."

    {
      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "I think his exact statement was our relationship is with Israel and not just Netanyahu, and I think that's the exact correct thing for Donald Trump to say. And one of the reasons why I agree with almost everything Ari says about this, one of the reasons why this is so hard, though, to form this coalition is that the Blue and White Party is actually basically just an anti-Netanyahu coalition. It is not really -- it is still -- it's got liberal members, but there's a broad consensus around a lot of these policies in Israel. There's just an enormous amount of Netanyahu fatigue. We don't see that in America because Bibi Netanyahu, particularly among Republicans, is very, very popular, but he's been around for an enormous amount of time in Israeli politics, longest-serving prime minister, and a lot of people are just sick of him. He's got some corruption issues. I think some of that is unfair. And so it just makes it very difficult for Benny Gantz to agree when his singular issue was getting Netanyahu out of their to serve under another Netanyahu prime ministership."
