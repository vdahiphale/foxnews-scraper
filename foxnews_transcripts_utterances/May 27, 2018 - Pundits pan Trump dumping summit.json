So really it wasn't a factor for me. And when I finally got confirmation that he was an investor and not only an investor, but the single largest investor, having put $125 million into the company.

I first got to know the Senator during his 2000 Presidential campaign, when I and other reporters would talk to him for 8 or 10 hours a day on his bus trips. He didn't have much money and he would answer questions until we ran out of questions, and then we would talk about sports or movies or whatever. The press cast McCain as a maverick, both when he was running against Bush and during the Bush administration. The pundits wrote off McCain's second campaign in 2007 when he was broke. But once he won the nomination and he was running against Obama, the coverage turned more negative, not just of his conservative positions, but in questioning his temperament. The media's maverick label faded as McCain took on the Obama administration and journalists rediscovered that he was in fact a conservative Republican. But McCain emerged as a sharp critic of Donald Trump, the press started admiring him once again. But McCain has had his low moments. His passion for campaign finances reform came after he was ensnared in the (Inaudible) banking scandal. His reputation for honesty was tarred when he apologized for betraying his principles and not calling for the removal of the Confederate Flag from the state house in South Carolina, because he didn't want to lose the primary there. McCain really enjoys (Inaudible) reporters as I learned. But he can get pretty angry when he doesn't like an article, as I learned first hand as well. Now as he fights his last battle, the media shouldn't paint John McCain as a saint, but should report fairly on his courage, his compromises, and his contradictions.

Joining us to analyze the coverage: Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor; Sara Fischer, media reporter for Axios; and Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist and former Hillary Clinton advisor. Mollie, North Korea had been using such harsh rhetoric. The president may have had little choice but to cancel this thing. But it took only hours for The Washington Post to run editorial. Trump impulsively blows up the North Korea summit. Is it worth the attention?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "It is interesting too because The Washington Post had repeated multiple times, there is no way that Donald Trump would walk away from the summit because he needed a victory so bad. So, once he did walk away from it, then the coverage shifted to he is a bad negotiator. It seems that no matter what he does, he will get negative coverage and that's a disservice because this is a really important story to get right with so many nuances and details and other countries involved. A little less Trump focus might be helpful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So many nuances, absolutely. Adrienne, media skeptics like to say this is another example of Trump's foreign policy being erratic. But does the North Korean which is infamously mercurial about these things, bear a lot of the responsibility? The incredibly harsh attacks on John Bolton, Vice President Pence, and making threatening noises. There wasn't like this happened in a vacuum."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADRIENNE ELROD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's not like this happened in a vacuum. But again, I think the media had every right to be skeptical of this and to have skepticism in their coverage in the way that they handled the situation because Donald Trump from the very beginning, it almost seemed like it was too good to be true, right? You know, the fact that he was able to get this meeting quickly and then all of a sudden like both sides started, you know, squabbling back and forth and then we ended up where we are now. So again, I think the media had every right to view this initially with skepticism and certainly have the right to provide skepticism when the meeting was improperly canceled."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Skepticism is fine. I'm talking though about negativity. And so Sara, all of this is fair amount of (ph) criticism. But many in the media didn't like it when President Trump was using incendiary languages like \"little rocket man.\" But then the media didn't like it when he scheduled the meeting with Kim, saying enough preparations had not been laid. And many in the media didn't like it when he canceled the meeting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA FISCHER, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "He can't win here. I mean, when it comes to Trump's negotiation tactics, the media has to take a 10,000-foot view and say, look, this is the way that he does negotiation. This is the way he has been doing it throughout his entire business career. So to take one perspective when something looks like it's going to go one way then to take another, you really got to take a step back and say, look at how this is a big part of his deal making."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Great point about he has negotiated this way his whole life. Sometimes, it works. Sometimes, it doesn't work on political stage. But let me read to you this controversy that is really kind of exploding this morning. Presidential tweet saying, the failing New York Times -- let's put it up on the screen -- quote, a senior White House official who doesn't exist, as saying, quote, even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed. Wrong again! Use real people, not phony sources. Well, audio was leaked to journalist named Yashar Ali, showing that the person here Trump said didn't exist is actually a senior White House official conducting a fully authorized background briefing on Fox News. Because he was at the briefing, he is not going to name this person. We won't name him. But I think it's a fair question. What about the president saying the person doesn't exist? And what about somebody who agreed to abide by the rules of the background briefing leaking it to another reporter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "I mean, you have to check in the next situation. Reporters are not supposed to be leaking any sort of audio information if there is something that they agreed to would be a background meeting. But at the same time, this reporter may have felt that they needed to leak it because the president was coming out and saying that this official doesn't exist. We now clearly know that it does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I know you want to get in. Let me just put up a graphic showing what the officially unnamed senior White House official said. The audio contains this as well. There's really not a lot of time. We've lost quite a bit of time. June 12th is in 10 minutes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "So The New York Times wrote a story saying that Donald Trump is at odd with his aides. Donald Trump says June 12th would be difficult but not impossible, where his aides say impossible. The problem is that no aide said it was impossible. The aide did say there is not a lot of time. The ball is in North Korea's court. That's not a distinction from what the president is saying. So that overall narrative is false. And instead of dealing with the fact that The New York Times did a horrible job of characterizing what this official said, they say, well he exists. Well, that's not really the issue. White House officials exist. White House officials get background briefings. Did The New York Times say something correct or incorrect when it said that Donald Trump was at odds with his aides? It's a simple thing. They just need to show him saying it was impossible. They were unable to show that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Clearly the Times overstated the situated. There was nothing that said impossible or anything close to it. But are you letting the president off the hook for saying phony sources, made up sources? Was the person who the White House sent out to brief reporters in person (INAUDIBLE)?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, there was a person who briefed people on background who did not say what The New York Times said he said. Now, should he have said, you mischaracterized the real person? Perhaps. But the problem is that the news media really have to be accurate. They don't do a good job of understanding anyone in the Trump administration and it loses credibility. This actually was a major part of the story. They are saying that aide is at odds with the president. They don't have the evidence to support that claim."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Adrienne, there is a pattern here. President Trump often says with stories he doesn't like, phony sources, these people don't exist, the media made them up. Well, you can argue about the way the newspaper wrote it and others have now picked it up in naming this. This is somebody who's name is well known to the American public. The president said he doesn't exist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Look, this is Donald Trump's erratic behavior on full display. Whenever he is frustrated with the way the media is covering any sort of story that he's involved with, he immediately calls it fake news, and he tries to disparage the source, the entity that is reporting this. In this case, he took a standard knee jerk reaction approach and was wrong because this was a background briefing. This was somebody in his administration. It's almost like he didn't get --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "By the way, you can say the source was wrong. You can say the source was bias. You can say the source had an agenda. Often those things are true. I just think it has been shown that this was at least a real person. Let me turn to the other huge story because the president is demanding a Justice Department investigation, as you know, as we mentioned, about New York Times' report on an FBI informant having penetrated the Trump campaign and then going on a tweet storm about the criminal deep state and a major spy scandal and attacking Obama intelligence chief, James Clapper."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I mean if you look at Clapper, he sort of admitted that they had spies in the campaign yesterday inadvertently. But I hope it's not true. But it looks like it is. A lot of bad things have happened. We now call it \"spygate.\" You are calling it \"spygate.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So the media consensus, I would take it is fair to say, Mollie Hemingway, except on the conservative side is that the president crossed the line in essentially ordering Justice Department to look into the FBI informant and in fact there is going to be an IG, a Justice Department GI follow (ph) this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, I think that is an interesting thing to say, that this should not be looked into. Obviously, if the FBI is spying on a campaign, that's something that the American people need to know about. They need to understand what protocols were followed, how well they were followed, what was going on, what in the world make them think that this was an OK thing to do. You just have to do that to restore trust and credibility in our law enforcement and intelligence apparatus. Also, the president does have constitutional authority over the judicial branch. And the judicial branch -- sorry, over the Department of Justice."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Whether it is improper, it is very much a matter of political dispute. But Adrienne, this was based on New York Times story. It does seem to me the president has the right to demand accountability about what was at the very least an undercover effort aimed at his campaign. Would you disagree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "I disagree because he was actually -- his campaign was the entity that was under investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "So of course now he is the president, a little bit different bogging (ph) here. But the FBI was using its standard protocol process to send in an informant to try to gather information under an entity that was under investigation. This time it happened to be the president's former campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Sara, what is really interesting here is how President Trump tries to write the media headlines. So, he tweets that this is spying in the campaign. And then as we heard, he brands it spygate, and then he tells reporters, well, you are calling it spygate, except most of them weren't. But now some of them are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "At the end of the day, his branding techniques are what he uses to get the message out. If he thinks that this informant is a spy, then he is going to label it spygate to make sure that his followers kind of agree with his side. But at the end of the day, it is a splashy headline. Now, all the media is picking up on it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He knows that it's short, it fits in a one-column headline like he knows the media can't resist. Now, President Trump quoted you in a tweet this week, Mollie, you said on the air that everyone knows there was a spy and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting there was a spy. So, that became spygate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, I mean, it is true that former intelligence officials including Clapper and Comey have said, yes, but we don't call it a spy. We were doing this, but we don't call it a spy. Actually in the case of Clapper, he did say, I don't like the term spy, but we were using spies. You know, I forgot exactly how he put it, but he did acknowledge that they were doing this. This is scandalous by any measure. And to pretend that this is not a big deal, that the previous administration was doing this against an opposing party's political campaign, the idea that journalists shouldn't be clamoring to cover every detail of this, really find out what in the world happened, or to say -- I mean if this is a standard protocol, that is also scandalous. I don't think people know that we have an FBI that as a rule of standard operation spying on political campaign --"

Why charges against the disgraced mogul feel like a cultural milestone."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "We are now in the coverage of the political sniping over an FBI informant who infiltrated the Trump campaign. Adrienne Elrod, I want you to pick up what Mollie Hemingway was saying before the break. The arguing here and I think the media sometimes lose the thread is either the FBI routinely hire this informant because of Russia contacts by the two Trump advisers, Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. Or whether the Obama administration did this for political purposes. We don't fully know, do we?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "I think this is where we start again getting into dangerous territory here. The Department of Justice was conducting an investigation completely separate from what President Obama was telling the Department of Justice to do. Two separate situations here. So, again, the Department of Justice felt it was the right thing to do, to send an informant into an entity which was under investigation. This is not because President Obama said, hey, please send in a spy to cover President Trump's campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "We do have a text. One these texts that have come out during the investigation showing that people in the Department of Justice were told that the White House would be running things. We don't know exactly what that means. But we have no way of knowing precisely what President Obama knew. Who in his top here knew what, when they knew it, how much involved they were. And these are again like why I am so shocked that we don't have more journalists just thinking this is a huge story, let's dig into it."

Why there were national security letters used against them? Why there was at least one human informant sent in to spy on the campaign? And this, by the way, the idea that this is not spying, secretly collecting information on behalf of the government, that is something we call spying."

This holiday weekend, journalists gave rise to a cultural movement by exposing the sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein. What does it mean that he is finally facing criminal charges himself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Less than a year after The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed a long list of horrifying sexual assault and misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein, launching what we now call the \"Me Too Movement,\" the disgraced movie mogul was arrested on Friday and charged with rape and a criminal sex act, two different cases to alleged victims. He's pleading not guilty, complete with as you see there, a New York perp walk. Joining us now from New York is Kat Timpf, National Review writer and Fox News contributor. Kat, regardless of what happens in this particular trial, most of them were famous allegations against Weinstein from Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd and dozen of others are barred by statute of limitations, what is the cultural impact for everyone to see those pictures of Harvey Weinstein being led away from the court in handcuffs?"
    },

      "speaker": "KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly think that a lot of people really enjoyed watching that pervert be led away in handcuffs, myself included. And this is something that people have made a lot of jokes about. When you think about it, it really is powerful because this is certainly a moment that I know a lot of his victims never thought that they would see come. You always see powerful men getting away with these kinds of things historically. And it seemed like that is changing now. He actually potentially faces some real legal consequences here for his actions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think you're putting your finger on it. And it is impossible to overstate the impact of those stories about Weinstein and how it spread across Hollywood, the media, Silicon Valley, the corporate world, you name it. But is it also a sort of a vindication of investigative journalism as practiced by the Times and Ronan Farrow, bringing down someone and Weinstein who as you say was seen as untouchable and wielded so much power through the media and bullied people through the media, that nobody thought he would actually be charged and led away in handcuffs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I absolutely think that it's a vindication and perhaps go out to everyone who was involved in helping expose it. I also think it represents a huge cultural shift. In the past, men used to be able to get away with assaulting or abusing women if they were powerful men and they had influence. Now, we are seeing a lot of people particularly in the media willing to believe the stories of women, actually listen to them and share those stories and that is eventually leading to getting justice for these victims."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You know, Jodi Kantor, one of The New York Times co-authors of this investigative piece, has tweeted, quoting various things that Weinstein had said or told alleged victims in the past. One phone call and you are done. I have ears and yes everywhere. I am Harvey Weinstein and you know what I can do. And then she writes, not anymore. But I will ask this question. Is there a little bit too much of a celebratory tone to some of these stories and tweets because as much as you might have enjoyed, I might have enjoyed seeing Weinstein brought down and again now to a fair trial, this is also a tragedy that ruined lives, deeply affected the lives of many young and aspiring actresses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yeah, absolutely. Although it is great to see him get arrested, the pain that I am sure he has caused to so many women is something that never goes away. And that's why you have to at least look at the fact that at least he is going to be facing some consequences. And also, hopefully this could send a message to other men out there that, hey, maybe you used to be able to get away with this kind behavior, but times are changing, and you can't get away with it anymore."

He says he's going to withdraw his troops from Syria but then he pulls back. You have one group of commentators and analysts who say you know he's strategic and he's unpredictable, and others say he's erratic.

But there are multiple -- things that these threats that we faced at the time are very similar. And changing the paradigm in Washington and in foreign policy is very similar, and that Reagan kind of upset the apple cart as far as detente and foreign policy towards the Soviet Union. And perhaps Donald Trump is doing something similar, but we'll see how it works out with North Korea."

But what's striking to me is that you know I heard echoes in the 1980 campaign. A lot of press said that Ronald Reagan was a war monger that he was going to lead us into nuclear war. We heard some of that too when Trump and Kim Jong-Un were at odds and trading nuclear threats."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

Some very aggressive speeches and some tweets and rocket man and how big is your button happened in between there, now again, that is not Reagan style, looking back. But he was saying that communism was going to be on the ash heap of history. The Soviet Union was the evil empire.

And that is he's a counter puncher. He is the hard scrabble streets of New York in real estate development. And you know he's taking it to a much different level as far as attacking the press. I think maybe to the detriment overall of our discussion, but politically, he's used this to hammer the media and has picked up you know his base to say you know that's fake news."

And if that's his thinking and mentality, then that tells you something about some of the actions he has taken along the way. But I think it's strange that it's taken this long to hear this anecdote. And I just think that there is not a lot here that we didn't know. I think it's disturbing if you think about that's really his motivation.

But you know I'm inclined not to fault some of the people who wrote about her too much (Inaudible) at Fortune Magazine, the New Yorker because she was outright lying to them. She was bald faced lying again and again to them. And they didn't necessarily to have any reason to think that they were dealing with a pathological liar and a fraudster."

      "utterance": "It's such a wet kiss, the filmmakers don't even mention McCain's battles with President Trump. And they showcase the praise for the Republican senator who is battling brain cancer, from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. McCain has also had a famously warm relationship with the fourth estate."

      "utterance": "McCain is a war hero who refused early release as POW in Vietnam, but also a controversial figure in the Republican Party, especially given his strong opposition to Trump, who he bashes in his new book, and for voting against repealing Obamacare in that dramatic late-night vote. I first got to know the Senator during his 2000 Presidential campaign, when I and other reporters would talk to him for 8 or 10 hours a day on his bus trips. He didn't have much money and he would answer questions until we ran out of questions, and then we would talk about sports or movies or whatever. The press cast McCain as a maverick, both when he was running against Bush and during the Bush administration. The pundits wrote off McCain's second campaign in 2007 when he was broke. But once he won the nomination and he was running against Obama, the coverage turned more negative, not just of his conservative positions, but in questioning his temperament. The media's maverick label faded as McCain took on the Obama administration and journalists rediscovered that he was in fact a conservative Republican. But McCain emerged as a sharp critic of Donald Trump, the press started admiring him once again. But McCain has had his low moments. His passion for campaign finances reform came after he was ensnared in the (Inaudible) banking scandal. His reputation for honesty was tarred when he apologized for betraying his principles and not calling for the removal of the Confederate Flag from the state house in South Carolina, because he didn't want to lose the primary there. McCain really enjoys (Inaudible) reporters as I learned. But he can get pretty angry when he doesn't like an article, as I learned first hand as well. Now as he fights his last battle, the media shouldn't paint John McCain as a saint, but should report fairly on his courage, his compromises, and his contradictions.
