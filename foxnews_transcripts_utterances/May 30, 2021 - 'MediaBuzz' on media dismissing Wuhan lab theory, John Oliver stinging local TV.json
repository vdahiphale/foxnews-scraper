But the international, not just Dr. Fauci, international scientific community was saying quite the contrary. In addition to that, Howie, both the father and grandfather of COVID-19 were both animal-born as most viruses are. So that would seem scientifically the most logical.

I think even the fact that the media are admitting that they got it wrong now is really reflection of how they want to be able to keep pushing propaganda and they're worried that the more people realize that they manipulate stories and this is just one of many that they manipulate for political gain, that it decreases their credibility and makes it less likely they can push their propaganda in the future. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They need to radically reform how they're approaching stories.

It was trashy Trump talk, surely not worthy of serious journalistic attention. The liberal Vox ran this piece 14 months ago. The conspiracy theories about the origins of the coronavirus debunked. Debunked, nothing to see here. That story got an editor's note this week. Now, more than a year later, finally, belatedly, the press is taking seriously and argue about the origins of COVID-19. The headline on The Washington Post column of the Wuhan lab leak theory suddenly becomes credible. Look, it's a difficult thing to investigate given Beijing's tight control over Chinese society, but most news organizations didn't even buy. Nobody is buying Wuhan's lab theory, The Guardian declared last year. That's the reason, if President Trump said it, the media dismissed it. If conservatives embraced it, liberal pundits mock it. This just speaks volumes about our media establishment. Now, nothing has been proven, but the circumstantial evidence is growing.

      "utterance": "I think it's a good example of what plagued the media throughout the Trump presidency, which is that they viewed their job not as reporting facts in all of their complexity, but doing whatever it took to oust Donald Trump from power. And so for them, they viewed the entire coronavirus pandemic, which was a global pandemic that came out of China as Trump's fault. And so when Trump or other people like Mike Pompeo or, you know, even people who weren't in the Trump administration were talking about the troubling facts surrounding how this virus was unleashed upon the world, they felt that that was too close to blaming China. You know, however culpable China might be, they wanted to blame Trump, and so they couldn't have anything, any coverage, any reporting of the facts that would do anything to move away from their hatred of Donald Trump and their desire to blame him for a global pandemic, however insane that was, and to most importantly get him out of power."

      "utterance": "There's so much that I have to say on this. First of all, one of the reasons I believe that the media was reporting that this didn't come out of a lab was two-fold. Donald Trump was saying without scientific evidence when he was president that it came out of the lab. But the international, not just Dr. Fauci, international scientific community was saying quite the contrary. In addition to that, Howie, both the father and grandfather of COVID-19 were both animal-born as most viruses are. So that would seem scientifically the most logical. Now, we're finding out it might be -- it might be the lab. I don't think this was to take Donald Trump down. I don't think coming out of the Wuhan lab or coming out of China is racist, but I do feel that the rhetoric -- and we've seen an increase in attacks verbally and physically against the AAPI community, based on some of the rhetoric that came out of the president and former administration where you don't want and the left didn't want, not China, China was to blame, the government of China, but not the people of China."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, just to clarify, President Trump didn't say flatly that it had come from lab. He said he believed there was a strong likelihood that there was some evidence of that. Mollie, it is fascinating to see so many media outlets playing catch up now and there were exceptions. A New York magazine ran a lengthy piece examining these questions last January. But even so, you have these liberal hosts and pundits, we showed a few of them, saying, but this is being pushed by the right as if that invalidated the theory all together."

But actually, what we're dealing with when people are talking about this theory, we knew a year ago. And so the change is in how people are covering it and it is clear had that it was done for partisan political reasons and that's not good. I think even the fact that the media are admitting that they got it wrong now is really reflection of how they want to be able to keep pushing propaganda and they're worried that the more people realize that they manipulate stories and this is just one of many that they manipulate for political gain, that it decreases their credibility and makes it less likely they can push their propaganda in the future. They need to radically reform how they're approaching stories. They need to very much emphasize the importance of putting facts first and politics last. You're not seeing that with The New York Times where they are, you know, where the reporter who is saying it is racist to investigate facts, which is absurd, is elevated. And they actually fired one of the reporters who was working on -- who has worked more recently we've been talking about with the lab leak theory."

Facts matter. It's most important. I was always told that a journalist doesn't make themselves the story, they report the facts, and then they let the viewers, the readers, the listeners form their opinions based on that. We have a blur between opinions and facts now, Howie. Sadly, that's the world we live in. But I do want to speak to the politics. It's not just the media that made politics and not just out of China or Wuhan, the lab or the origin of the virus, but the virus itself, how dangerous it was and whether we wear a mask or we don't wear a mask. And quite frankly with a medical epidemic, shame on us, left or right, anybody, because it really harmed not only individuals who were sick and they may have long-term effects or died, but certainly our health care workers and the health care community.

Actually, the investigation has been going on from one administration to the next for over a year. And quite frankly the reason he's even putting more into this within 90 days as so that we get to the truth, but like you alluded to earlier, Howie, very difficult when the Chinese aren't going to let us into that lab. We may never know the truth. And as to your question regarding what the bit that you just played and the politics surrounding this, look, you know, I said it before, the media shouldn't politicize this, but the media also in the supply/demand kind of way, economics 101, is a reflection of what they're being given, isn't it?

You know, early on, they had so many false things that they were saying. Of course, that did so much to destroy people's trust in the World Health Organization. But we need our reporters to not just regurgitate whether it is that Donald Trump is a traitor who colluded Russia to steal the election or that it is insane to wonder if the Wuhan Institute of Virology that researches coronaviruses might have had a lab leak.

What you see with these types of things and the New York is a great example of this, is starting with a decision that someone is guilty and working backwards to find a crime. You had this experience with the special counsel and how the Department of Justice handled it. The attorney general of New York who is part of this probe literally told people to elect her and she would go after Trump. This is not American. This is not how you're supposed to do things in this country. The media love it. But I think probably 80 percent of the country looks at this and says, come on, really, are we really doing this?

You are so right to point out that grand jury that is investigating the Trump Organization isn't the same as going after Trump. But just like with that special counsel probe. It's all one in the same. The idea that certain people in the establishment have is that they don't just need to destroy Trump. They need to destroy literally anyone who had any support for him or were tied to him. There were a lot of people that had their lives destroyed by that special counsel probe even though nobody found a single American who colluded with Russia to steal the election, which is the whole point of it, likewise with here.

There are few there defending her and saying that no one should be telling her what to say or do when she tries to talk about the socialist policies she thinks Democrats are pushing forward.

The Republicans were all too happy to point to the Squad, the very liberal faction of House Democrats, for remarks they have made, supporting Palestine versus Israel with the latest rocket battle in the Middle East.

And we see this over and over again with the vile, reprehensible, anti- Semitic remarks of the squad. And yet the left and the media and the Democrat Party don't want to be tied to these comments by the squad.

But to understand how the media covers the squad you first have to understand that the media oftentimes when talking about Israel and Palestine, they really do have a myopic black and white view when we all know if you ever visited the region that it's actually 50 shades of gray. Because you can't be pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian, right? And I think because it's all about ensuring that, you know, Israel is a state and it should be allowed to be a state but there also has to be self-determination and human rights for Palestinians that live in that region. Now sadly, that's not where the squad is. But to say that the media is treating them like media darlings, I wouldn't go that far. Because like I said once again, I think this particular issue is really 50 shades of gray and not black and white as many in the media try to make it out to be."

      "utterance": "All right. Gayle, when Marjorie Taylor Greene talks about the Holocaust or, you know, lasers controlled by a Jewish family, reporters run to Republicans and Republican and said what's your reaction, do you condone that. I don't see the press asking Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi to respond to some of the squad's harsh rhetoric towards Israel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TROTTER",
      "utterance": "No. And this is yet again another example of professional malpractice by the media. They're not fair and balanced. They don't make sure that they hold sides account to the same value or standards and you couldn't have said it better. That they're not asking the same types of questions of Democrat leaders like Schumer and Pelosi and they're not hammering them with headlines about this all the time. Instead, they're running headlines to try and deflect from it. And you see this over and over again. And this is just the latest example of this professional malpractice by the mainstream media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Richard, the other day, four House Democrats released an open letter condemning rhetoric by some of the squad members. We talk about apartheid by Israel and so forth. Quote, \"these statements are anti-Semitic at their core and contribute to a climate that is hostile to many Jews.\" So, again, people may agree with that, then they may not agree with that. But it was a blip, and hardly got any coverage. And I'm wondering if there's just a natural tendency to shy away from taking on members of the Democratic left, particularly on the volatile issues of the Middle East."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Listen, I don't think there's an effort to shy away. Like I said, I think the media is missing the story on how they cover Israel and Palestine. Now let me say this. We must reject anti-Semitism in every form it comes in. But we also must reject xenophobia and Islamophobia in any extreme or form that it comes in. Now what we're seeing here is when Marjorie Taylor Greene releases language about the Holocaust, right, that is very, not only inflammatory but it's wrong. And I think there's a distinction between that and the squad members calling out Bibi Netanyahu's government for their occupation, for the blockades and for the eviction of innocent Palestinians. And I think when we mix those two things together, we make a big mistake and I think the media oftentimes does that too much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, the one time that you see coverage, is where you have Bernie Sanders and members of the squad pressuring the Biden administration to talk more about the rights of Palestinians and President Biden having to grapple that. Before we go this was talked about naturally on CNN. And I want to play for you an exchange with Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer that shows you how for some people this is a very personal subject."

      "utterance": "When have you that kind of family history, you know, it's impossible not to -- I think it's a good thing to share it with the audience. Let me get a break here. Coming up, the journalistic disappointment over Democrats failing to pass the January 6 commission and the rather questionable effort to paint Donald Trump as an irrelevant force online."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "The media have utterly embraced the Democratic push to create an independent commission to investigate the capitol riots. And most journalists were clearly disappointed when it failed with the Senate failing to overcome a Republican filibuster threat despite six GOP lawmakers defecting. So, Gayle, look at the way CNN covered this. There's a Chiron on Anderson Cooper's show, if we can put that up. GOP to choose between Trump and the truth. Now, given that there are other investigations, including by the Justice Department, why have the media turned the January 6 commission into such a crusade."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TROTTER",
      "utterance": "It's a transparent attempt to impeachment 3.0, and this is a partisan drive to create a drip of headlines that will go through the midterm elections in 2022, and it's really this effort to push a narrative that they want to continue on and on and like you said, the media cheered the first two impeachments and everything was breathlessly reported and they want to this impeachment 3.0. So now only they finally benefit from the eyeballs that go their media platforms but also to push for the preferred political preference as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Richard, what happened on January 6 was utter attack on our democracy. I want to find out everything I can about it. And I get that it's become politicized and Republicans want to move on. But shouldn't the coverage reflect at some degree by creating such a commission, independent commission, and bipartisan commission would benefit Democrats politically by keeping a spotlight for the rest of the year on Donald Trump's role in the violence of January 6."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think you can only have that view if you don't see January 6 as a day that lives in infamy. It's not about political party. It's about the fact that a group, an angry mob broke into our capitol. And just like the 9/11 commission, after when terrorists came here and knocked the World Trade Center and attack the Pentagon, a report and a bipartisan commission on what happened and how we can prevent it should be something that's like a bible to how we do national security in this country just as the 9/11 commission. And the fact that Republicans are putting politics over this ideal of getting to the bottom of what happened --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "And the best way to answer your question, Howard, is I think the media coverage of this has been fair. Because this is not about political party once again, it's about ensuring that the capitol is safe and protected and, yes, will there be some political implications for the Republicans, absolutely. But has everything to do with the fact that the president, former president, rather, has had terrible rhetoric and incited some of this insurrection."

The Washington Post the other day, let's put up the headline, Trump is sliding toward online irrelevance. Now, Gayle, if you ban Donald Trump from Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, yes, his online interactions go way down. Wow. But the idea that he's still not at the center of Republican Party politics, that all these media narratives don't revolve around him, January 6 commission, the New York grand jury we talked about earlier, the midterms 2024, it seems pretty far-fetched."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TROTTER",
      "utterance": "They protest too much. They want to make him irrelevant. Their effort is to either make him irrelevant, to prove that he's irrelevant or to push people towards that. But the fact is, the Hill reported last week that a majority of Republicans want President Trump to run again in 2024. So, their effort to push President Trump out of the headlines and to drive, this is another narrative they're trying to drive."

      "utterance": "All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TROTTER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think Fowler, back in just briefly. Trump's statements since big tech has illegally banned me, tens of millions of our supporters have stopped using these platforms because they've become boring and nasty, your thought?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Listen, Trump is the elephant in the room for the Republican Party. The reason why we can do a segment on Marjorie Taylor Greene or a segment about Matt Gaetz has everything to do with the fact that Donald Trump still runs this party, whether or not he's on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter, he is the leader of this party. His rhetoric has controlled this party. And anybody who says that they're trying to silence Donald Trump is missing the fact that every single story about the Republican Party circles around Donald Trump, whether or not he's in the headlines or not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And I think the media kind of like that. I don't know about tens of millions of people leaving the platform. Gayle Trotter, Richard Fowler, thanks very much for joining us. After the break, Andrew Cuomo's curious defense of his brother advising him after Chris Cuomo's apology and Rick Santorum ripped CNN over his firing. Stay with us."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",

      "speaker": "RICK SANTORUM, FORMER SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CNN",
      "utterance": "I think it does show that the left is intolerant. They're worried I'm sure that their viewership which is obviously very left, they're going to pay a price. And I hear from a lot of liberals, in fact many CNN contributors who talked to me afterwards who were very, very concerned about, you know, the cancel culture that's now hitting them at CNN."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "We're back with Susan Ferrechio lightning round. Wouldn't CNN likely have kept the former senator if he apologized for saying Native Americans contributed very little to American culture rather than saying he misspoke?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "I think he did say later saying he misspoke, essentially saying he shouldn't have said what he said and that he didn't mean to be insensitive to Native Americans. I think it's just another case of selective outrage where if you say something and you're conservative, you get canceled, but if you're liberal you're excused and it's OK. And I think that's what Rick Santorum is complaining about on CNN. If you get rid of all your conservative voices on CNN, then can you really describe yourself as a network that's trying to be fair or impartial or trying to get viewpoints in from both sides."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "The governor went on to say, I talk to journalists about situations all the time, they tell me their thoughts and their advice. Now even if that's true, And I don't know if it is, they're not related to him and they're not joining damage control calls with the governor and his top staff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, who is surprised by any of this? Cuomo appeared on his brother's show regularly. You know they have a close relationship. You know they must talk constantly about everything. So, I, for one was not the least bit surprised to hear that Cuomo was talking to him about this absolutely critical issue, where he could be forced out of office, frankly. People are calling on him to resign over these allegations of sexual harassment. So, it doesn't surprise me at all. And who knows what he's talking about, whether the media are giving him advice or if they're interviewing him and talking to him and he interprets that as advice, we'll never know unless somebody in the press steps forward and says, yes, I also consult with Cuomo. Journalists should not be doing that. And it gets back to the problematic situation with the Cuomo brothers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, CNN president Jeff Zucker has said that Cuomo, Chris Cuomo made a mistake and he's human. All right. Tennis star Naomi Osaka said she won't talk to the press at the French Open because she just got fined $15,000. She's going to face more fines because she says it's better for her mental health and she doesn't like the questions reporters ask. Excuse me. Hasn't positive media coverage made her a worldwide celebrity who earned almost $50 million last year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "This is really interesting because she has completely circumvented the media and making this announcement. Because you can. Now you can use your own social media account to communicate with your fans. And it raises a question, how important is the media to the sports world anymore if they can just conduct their own interviews and talk to fans through their own social media outlets, and of course, connection to the fans is through the media and these interviews as well. So, she makes tens of millions of dollars a year. Now she is facing $15,000 fine. She is also citing mental health as part of the reason. And she's laying the marker down for other report -- other media sports fans and sports stars to think about skipping past the regular press interviews and just communicating with fans themselves through their own social media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But again. She mostly got positive coverage. She makes all that money because the media help her make her famous. I always liked her. The head of the French Tennis Association calls this a phenomenal era and they are even talking banning her in the future. I hope that doesn't happen. Susan Ferrechio, great to see you this Sunday. Thanks so much. Still to come, John Oliver's expose on how to buy off local TV news. It's serious business and totally hilarious. You've got to see this."

Well, HBO's John Oliver just exposed it with a hilarious scam, creating a totally bogus product called a sexual wellness blanket and paying for segments on ABC stations in Salt lake City, Austin, and Denver.

It's using this feel of monogenetic I was talking about, and also a technology that's been around for a long time that was pioneered in Germany about 80 years ago. So, this is full of cutting-edge technology but it just looks like a blanket."
