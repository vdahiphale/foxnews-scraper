      "sentences": "Stop. Happy Tuesday my friendly friends in friendsville. Breaking news to report. Did you know what's destroying America? Adjectives. Yes, it's true. Words like cruel, rough, sharp, gentle, sleek, slippery. Sounds like last night and hammers hot tub. Anyway, adjectives are bad, which is also an adjective. So how bad is bad? Sorry. Well, Dana Milbank, some old crank from the Washington Post commissioned a report that counted adjectives in the coverage of our last two presidents. And he found that Joe is the target of way more negative words than the previous president, who you remember the evil orange monster from Planet Hitler. So what's the proof? Milbank actually had a firm count adjectives in articles comparing what Biden received in the first 11 months of 2021 to Trump in the first 11 months of 2020. They call this sentiment analysis. Hmm. The authorities did the same thing to my diary after I burned down that men's big and tall store. The conclusion, the media is meaner to Joe than Trump. That makes about as much sense as a chicken in a thong. It's like me at a wet market selling bad nachos. No one should buy it. Still, according to the firm's V.P., the media are serving as accessories to the murder of democracy. And those murder weapons are adjectives. So in short, a bias writer at a bias paper commissioned a biased firm to study media bias and surprise he thinks the media is biased against Joe Biden. How convenient. Here's Milbank, regurgitating the data on CNN.",

      "sentences": "The last four months, however, Biden has been at where Donald Trump was or lower than where Donald Trump is, in terms of media sentiment. I mean, it's not bias. It's the actual words we're using. So we are as negative as a collective media on Joe Biden, if not more so, than we were to Donald Trump at a time when he was trying to overthrow democracy. And I think that's a tremendous indictment of our whole industry. You know, it's not foolproof, but it gives a pretty good number and we never had such a number before.",

      "sentences": "Yes, they never had such a number before. Because this is the first time you did it. And you were the one who commissioned it. What a circle of jerks. So as usual, the media's lies are like Stelter's man boobs. They just keep getting bigger and bigger. And this analysis has more holes in it than the ceiling of the spare room that I rent out to college students. I'm dressing this thing up. It's obvious to anyone alive the past five years that the media is treatment of Trump was way worse, with or without adjectives. They are obsessed with Trump and they still can't let him go. No one's asking Alec Baldwin to do a Biden impersonation. Although no one's asking Alec anything unless they're behind bulletproof glass. Looks great, though. For example, only 19 percent of Biden's first 60 days have been negative. Impressive when you consider he was unconscious for 50 of them. Now that rank best among presidents of the last three decades. Trump's for 60 days received a 62 percent negative rating. The fact is the press didn't just report on Trump, they led the resistance covering every protest and every March, Trump was treated worse than Charlie Sheen at a blood bank. Pretty good. But you should -- you should -- you should already know this. And if you don't, you're probably some drunk guy and underwear dancing on a bar counter.",

But since the public could see his incompetence with their own eyes, there was no spin between the Afghan disaster and the viewer. The implosion was right there for all to see, but what Milbank twists as media bias is a somber realization that the horse they backed broke its ankle going into the first turn, and is too old to put out to stud. It used to be they could cover for Joe. Literally, they let him live in a basement like a millennial with a liberal arts degree. While he was running for president we only heard from him when Dr. Jill went down to do laundry. He was the first to campaign standing next to a washer dryer in a litter box. And then when that story about his laptop came out, they buried it faster than the guy in the trunk of Henry Hill's car. A good fellow's reference. And speaking of Hunter, because no one really is. This week, the White House flag the art industry as a corrupt enterprise due to lack of transparency, and unpredictable pricing. Meaning that you could charge someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for crappy art and get away with it. So what does that sound like to you? Yes. The White House is blasting art industry corruption as they allow Hunter to sell his artwork to anonymous buyers for a half million. Why is it that a story? Doesn't have too many adjectives? Sleazy, gross, infantile, coke fueled? All of the above? But it's just another cover up just like all the others. And remember the institutions that swayed the election, actually bragged about it in Time Magazine as tech, the media and other groups came together to drag Old Joe across the finish line. That meant not reporting on the riots and the rising crime denouncing any mention of the Hunter laptop or the big guys links to China. I wonder what the President has to say.",

Journalist, Erin Aubry Kaplan, who is black describes building a little free library box in her front yard. Cute, right? Creating a self-operated community exchange of books for neighbors and visitors and the occasional woodpecker. And it all seemed to be going perfectly until a young white couple was spotted browsing the little library. Kaplan says the experience filled her with astonishment and resentment, quote, \"What I resented was not the specific couple, it was their whiteness and my feelings of helplessness at not knowing how to maintain the integrity of a black space that I had created, \"end quote. Sorry, \"The library was my lawn. But for that moment, it became theirs.\" But it's not the whole point of a library? Not that I know. I haven't been to a library since the incident in the periodical section. I cleaned up after. The author was able to link this evil white couple to Jim Crow laws and burning crosses, all for looking at the books that she set out presumably for everyone to look at, except of course whitey. And that naturally got in the Times. Just grab any topic even a tiny library and link it to racism and it pays. Then again, maybe she's onto something. Maybe we need more specific libraries.",

Words like cruel, rough, sharp, gentle, sleek, slippery. Sounds like last night and hammers hot tub. Anyway, adjectives are bad, which is also an adjective. So how bad is bad? Sorry. Well, Dana Milbank, some old crank from the Washington Post commissioned a report that counted adjectives in the coverage of our last two presidents. And he found that Joe is the target of way more negative words than the previous president, who you remember the evil orange monster from Planet Hitler. So what's the proof? Milbank actually had a firm count adjectives in articles comparing what Biden received in the first 11 months of 2021 to Trump in the first 11 months of 2020. They call this sentiment analysis. Hmm. The authorities did the same thing to my diary after I burned down that men's big and tall store. The conclusion, the media is meaner to Joe than Trump. That makes about as much sense as a chicken in a thong. It's like me at a wet market selling bad nachos. No one should buy it. Still, according to the firm's V.P., the media are serving as accessories to the murder of democracy. And those murder weapons are adjectives. So in short, a bias writer at a bias paper commissioned a biased firm to study media bias and surprise he thinks the media is biased against Joe Biden. How convenient. Here's Milbank, regurgitating the data on CNN."
    },

      "speaker": "DANA MILBANK, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST",
      "utterance": "The last four months, however, Biden has been at where Donald Trump was or lower than where Donald Trump is, in terms of media sentiment. I mean, it's not bias. It's the actual words we're using. So we are as negative as a collective media on Joe Biden, if not more so, than we were to Donald Trump at a time when he was trying to overthrow democracy. And I think that's a tremendous indictment of our whole industry. You know, it's not foolproof, but it gives a pretty good number and we never had such a number before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, they never had such a number before. Because this is the first time you did it. And you were the one who commissioned it. What a circle of jerks. So as usual, the media's lies are like Stelter's man boobs. They just keep getting bigger and bigger. And this analysis has more holes in it than the ceiling of the spare room that I rent out to college students. I'm dressing this thing up. It's obvious to anyone alive the past five years that the media is treatment of Trump was way worse, with or without adjectives. They are obsessed with Trump and they still can't let him go. No one's asking Alec Baldwin to do a Biden impersonation. Although no one's asking Alec anything unless they're behind bulletproof glass. Looks great, though. For example, only 19 percent of Biden's first 60 days have been negative. Impressive when you consider he was unconscious for 50 of them. Now that rank best among presidents of the last three decades. Trump's for 60 days received a 62 percent negative rating. The fact is the press didn't just report on Trump, they led the resistance covering every protest and every March, Trump was treated worse than Charlie Sheen at a blood bank. Pretty good. But you should -- you should -- you should already know this. And if you don't, you're probably some drunk guy and underwear dancing on a bar counter."

But since the public could see his incompetence with their own eyes, there was no spin between the Afghan disaster and the viewer. The implosion was right there for all to see, but what Milbank twists as media bias is a somber realization that the horse they backed broke its ankle going into the first turn, and is too old to put out to stud. It used to be they could cover for Joe. Literally, they let him live in a basement like a millennial with a liberal arts degree. While he was running for president we only heard from him when Dr. Jill went down to do laundry. He was the first to campaign standing next to a washer dryer in a litter box. And then when that story about his laptop came out, they buried it faster than the guy in the trunk of Henry Hill's car. A good fellow's reference. And speaking of Hunter, because no one really is. This week, the White House flag the art industry as a corrupt enterprise due to lack of transparency, and unpredictable pricing. Meaning that you could charge someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for crappy art and get away with it. So what does that sound like to you? Yes. The White House is blasting art industry corruption as they allow Hunter to sell his artwork to anonymous buyers for a half million. Why is it that a story? Doesn't have too many adjectives? Sleazy, gross, infantile, coke fueled? All of the above? But it's just another cover up just like all the others. And remember the institutions that swayed the election, actually bragged about it in Time Magazine as tech, the media and other groups came together to drag Old Joe across the finish line. That meant not reporting on the riots and the rising crime denouncing any mention of the Hunter laptop or the big guys links to China. I wonder what the President has to say."

Yes, the op-ed was titled, Is my little library contributing to the gentrification of my black neighborhood? Now, there's a complaint you'll only see in the New York Times. Journalist, Erin Aubry Kaplan, who is black describes building a little free library box in her front yard. Cute, right? Creating a self-operated community exchange of books for neighbors and visitors and the occasional woodpecker. And it all seemed to be going perfectly until a young white couple was spotted browsing the little library. Kaplan says the experience filled her with astonishment and resentment, quote, \"What I resented was not the specific couple, it was their whiteness and my feelings of helplessness at not knowing how to maintain the integrity of a black space that I had created, \"end quote. Sorry, \"The library was my lawn. But for that moment, it became theirs.\" But it's not the whole point of a library? Not that I know. I haven't been to a library since the incident in the periodical section. I cleaned up after. The author was able to link this evil white couple to Jim Crow laws and burning crosses, all for looking at the books that she set out presumably for everyone to look at, except of course whitey. And that naturally got in the Times. Just grab any topic even a tiny library and link it to racism and it pays. Then again, maybe she's onto something. Maybe we need more specific libraries."
