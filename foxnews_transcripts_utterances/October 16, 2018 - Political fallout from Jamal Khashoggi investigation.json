I think he should take the test himself and just troll here if that is the case, because it is possible. Going to Jim Messina's complaint, though, I think it is pretty clear why she did this now. She wanted to rip off this band-aid as soon as possible. This is an embarrassment. It's an embarrassment for her. It's an embarrassment for anyone in the media who tried to pretend like today's news was good news for her. She wants to get this off the front burner as soon as possible so that when they 2020 race heats up it is already old news, because there is no good spin on it. And secondly, if you see the way that she did it in the video, she is pitting herself against Trump. She is telling Democratic voters, either believe my ludicrous bed or you are with Trump. She took a shot at FOX News in her tweet. She is appealing, ironically, to tribal politics."
