Remember, this goes back to 2016 when three black Oberlin students went in to Gibson's bakery to buy wine with a fake I.D. When they got turned down, they stole the wine. And when the son of the bakery's owner confronted them the students knocked him down and beat him up. Initially, the students claimed they were racially profiled but later admitted yes, they did steal the wine and no, there was no racism.

Unpredictable actions and bold leadership can lead to unprecedented outcomes as we all remember from that historic event. We will see you back here tomorrow night.

Today though, he didn't attack Joe Biden, not once. It seems perhaps that he does not have to because some of those closest to Biden appear to be doing it for him. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and “The Story” tonight, a new question that is increasingly front and center as we investigate tonight. Why does team Obama not want Joe Biden to be president? It is tough to ignore the red flags on this. Just look at what they are saying or not saying in the case of President Obama is not endorsed his self- described brother and V.P. of eight years. Now, look at this. Obama's top deputy and close friend, David Axelrod said this. \"After his last shambling week, the new question is, 'Can Biden hang on?\". He goes on to remind readers that Biden has twice failed to survive Iowa. He says his schedule right now is to light. And Axelrod points out the flip-flop on the Hyde Amendment, and the initial excuse that he misheard a question about it. He says it's not a good look where Biden's age is concerned. And he points out that Biden's attempt to make it clear that he and former President Obama are best buddies has seen here in this tweet by the Biden campaign. Axelrod responded to this. \"This is a joke, right?\" As not just David Axelrod and the now silent former President Obama on this. Former Obama White House communications director Jen Psaki said this."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So, that's just two people. But then you've got this. Obama veterans message Joe Biden's pledged to work with the GOP they say is delusional. A recent New York Times piece talked about how there is deep affection between the former president and the vice president. But notes that former top officials have unkind things to say. Ben Rhodes saying that in The Situation Room back then, Biden was \"something of an unguided missile\". Then you've got Robert Gates, the then defense secretary saying that \"Biden was wrong on every foreign policy and national security issue for four decades.\" That's from his book and quoted in The New York Times piece. So, Biden is the clear front-runner right now which raises the question what's going on here? My panel members tonight have all served President Obama or his administration in some form. Laurie Watkins was President Obama's deputy political director in Florida. Robin Biro is a former Obama campaign regional director. And Marie Harf was a State Department spokesperson in the Obama administration. Welcome to all of you. Good to have you here."

What I am not quite seeing out of the Biden campaign yet is discipline. I will agree with David Axelrod that his campaign schedule is too light. I understand he's had some family commitments that were important. But you get right back on the road and you get out there, and you got to do what you got to do, which is engaging and meeting with voters."

I served, of course, on the camp, on the Obama-Biden campaign. And I myself haven't made up my mind. Joe Biden was lovely to me and my family several times. But he's not just going to walk right into this. He has to fight and each -- earn each and every single vote, Martha. And he's just not there."

      "utterance": "Yes, it's interesting. All of us who worked on those Obama-Biden campaigns as all of us did have a lot of affection for him, and a lot of respect for him. But we also have to remember that the last campaign they ran together was eight years ago. And I've been traveling this country over the past month talking to voters. I'm now working for another presidential candidate Seth Moulton. And as we talk to voters what I'm hearing from Democrats is that they are ready for the next generation of leaders to step up. They want to look forward, not back. They are looking for those new leaders, and I think that explains a lot of what you're hearing from people. They're ready for that next generation to really take the mantle of the party."

So, these polls honestly a lot of its name I.D., they don't mean a ton when it comes to who's going to be ahead in February. And I'm actually very proud that we have a very diverse group of candidates running alongside the person I'm working for. But leaders of our party like Joe Biden and others. But there's a lot of months between now and February, and I do think a lot of candidates are in it for the long haul."
    },

      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, Seth's knew getting into this race pretty late in the game that he probably wouldn't make the first debate. But I think what he's also realized and what I've realized talking to voters over this past month is that these DNC debate metrics aren't what's going to decide the nominee, it's actually, voters on the ground. And between now and next February, so much can happen in politics."

No, we are winning in every single state that we polled. We're winning in Texas very big, we're winning in Ohio very big, we're winning in Florida very big. We do very little polling because I'm not a huge believer in polling. I think you go out there and you fight, and you don't really need polls, you have to -- you need ideas."

So -- no date yet on when that will happen. Also, today as we showed you a moment ago, Donald Trump Jr. was back on the Hill answering questions the Senate side. So a lot of cooperation it appears in some respects in terms of what they have been pushing for. Then you have a separate hearing on the Mueller report today. House Republicans on the Intel Committee drilling for answers on the origins of all of this Russia probe. A lot percolating on that front, surveillance of the Trump campaign, how did all that work?

And we're going to start to get you know some more testimony and more information with regards to that as he continues to dig in. And we're learning tonight that the DOJ will talk to top senior CIA officials about that, also top counterterrorism officials.

There's been so much focus on the FBI and the Department of Justice, Martha. But a lot of the questions that relate to the origins of this go to the CIA. It was Alexander Downer who was John Brennan's CIA counterpart at one point in time for Australia that supposedly had this random conversation with George Papadopoulos that served as the predicate. There's a lot that Attorney General Barr I think has said doesn't jive with respect to that and that's why John Durham is looking at the issues that the Democrats aren't willing to look at. You know, it's funny Martha. We all waited two years for Bob Mueller to come out and say very clearly no collusion, no conspiracy by Donald Trump, but you wouldn't have known that in the hearing today. The Democrats repeatedly said there was collusion, there was conspiracy, but somehow Bob Mueller and his team of nearly 60 FBI investigators and FBI agents somehow just missed it. Well, you know, one of the interesting things to me is that Horowitz's report can't really look at people who used to work at these agencies. It's an Inspector General report of current people at the intelligence agencies. But John Dunham -- John Durham could -- he can and his investigation will be talking to them so you got to wonder what's going through the minds of some of the people that you just mentioned like John Brennan for example. I want to play something for you that just came in this evening. This is an interview that ABC's George Stephanopoulos did with President Trump in the Oval Office talking about whether or not candidates should listen to foreign governments who are volunteering information about the opponents.

So, unfortunately, we've had to do this multiple times. There's been excuses laid out multiple times and it's unfortunate. You know, yesterday, you know, we were able to -- along the UFA, along with the uniformed UFOA which is the Officers Union was able to get a bus of first responders to go down there to send a message.

So I think you know, people worrying about fraud is you know misleading because it's so difficult. You would have to have so many moving parts involved to make fraudulent claims and then the other thing that we heard unfortunately yesterday was, you know, the dollar amount. You know, that we have 22 trillion-dollar deficit at this time and going forward, you know, who pays for it and how will they pay for it and you know, all I can simply say is, you know, is this where we want to plant the flag of fiscal constraint?

Remember, this goes back to 2016 when three black Oberlin students went in to Gibson's bakery to buy wine with a fake I.D. When they got turned down, they stole the wine. And when the son of the bakery's owner confronted them the students knocked him down and beat him up. Initially, the students claimed they were racially profiled but later admitted yes, they did steal the wine and no, there was no racism. A police investigation also found that allegations of racism were baseless.

You know, just watching that young woman with the mega phone and you think about the fact that the facts matter. You can't just glom on to a story and make it what you want it to be to perpetuate some idea that is absolutely untrue."

      "utterance": "-- that they slapped against the media companies. Sometimes the only way to win is to hit people in the pocketbook. And that's what they are doing here. Fake allegation is more powerful than the truth a lot of the times. And especially a racial allegation. They are so damaging to someone and the left is quick to play the race card and they will pounce. And now people are changing their behavior because they don't want to be accused of racism. How about the next owner of another bakery and there is stealing going on and they don't want to be accused of profiling so they do nothing. What sense does that make? Some police departments are now pulling back from tough enforcement in certain neighborhoods."

      "utterance": "They don't want to be accuse much of police brutality, same thing with Me Too. Now male managers don't want to mentor women or be in the same room as female colleagues because they don't want false accusations. It's gotten pretty crazy."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, the bottom line is that you have to understand the facts of THE STORY. As I said you can't just make it into what you would like it to be. And the fact that Oberlin is saying that their expressions in this matter were free speech is -- you know, how about stepping up --"

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, you are rewarded for running up the score because in tie breakers they look at point differential where you are in the later round. So that's fine that they scored a lot of goals, they're better. And the fans want to see goals. But I think they got hit for the excessive celebration. When you are up nine-nothing or 13-nothing and you're doing elaborate joint team celebrations, you know, maybe that's a little un-sportsmanlike?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. No. I mean, I'm a big believer in sportsmanship. And I think the lesson is that you just sort of keep it in. You score your goals. You know, at the end go crazy."

      "utterance": "So, before it was history this was THE STORY on June 12th, 1987. President Ronald Reagan challenged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall that divided communist east Germany from the western enclave in East Berlin. The east Germans with strong support from Moscow erected the wall to keep its people in. Serving as a dramatic back drop near the historic Brandenburg Gate. Reagan delivered that famous line to the large throng that was gathered on the western side of the wall. Tonight's quote from President Reagan on this very day 32 years ago delivered a stark warning."

      "speaker": "RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship. The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship and affront."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Powerful words. That speech served as a reminder that despite Gorbachev's repeated statement calling for a new relationship with the west, the United States wanted more action and fewer words from Moscow on this in the bid to further dampen the Cold War tensions. On November 9, 1989 the barrier came down to the delight of east and west Berliners alike. The two Germanys were officially reunited on October 3rd, 1990. Unpredictable actions and bold leadership can lead to unprecedented outcomes as we all remember from that historic event. We will see you back here tomorrow night. But we will be in Tempe, Arizona, 6:30 start for the Town Hall with 2020, presidential candidate, Julian Castro. Bret and I will see you there. We look forward to it. Tucker Carlson coming up next.
