Meanwhile, Eric Swalwell didn't drive across state lines. But what did the fabricating fart bag do with state secrets? When he did the bang, bang with the Fang, Fang. That whole story stinks to high heaven, partly because Swalwell just had cabbage for dinner. All right, I'll stop. But, of course, Kyle Rittenhouse did not -- did not take a gun across state lines. You think a party that has a reputation of stealing elections would know where state lines are drawn. But good liars know that correcting the lie makes people stop trusting you.

      "sentences": "So, their best argument that Rittenhouse should have been convicted is speculation about a hypothetical event that didn't happen. Their implication, those who defend a white Rittenhouse wouldn't defend a black version of Rittenhouse. It's mind reading, but above all, it's stupid. A black man Andrew Coffee IV was acquitted of attempted murder charges last week after 12 Jurors found he had reason to believe he was being attacked during a SWAT team raid. And there is no mass outrage from conservatives over that because as long as you view this through the prism of self-defense, there is no racial angle. With Kyle, all the attackers were white. And I'm thinking actual white supremacist, rarely support an unjustified shooting of white people. And if Rittenhouse were black, those defending Rittenhouse would not only defend him, they might elect him to office. But the people who bring up the so-called Black Rittenhouse would smear him if he indeed existed. Black Rittenhouse would now be the face of white supremacy. Just like Larry Elder who is black. Remember a white person in a gorilla mask attacked him and the media barely noticed. There was Condoleezza Rice and then Winsome Sears, who posed with a gun, and is black, but as a white supremacist for being elected as a Republican. Nothing says you have a grip on the race issue like calling black people white. There is confused as a guy and assless leather chaps at a sports bar. Was I embarrass? The bars have the same names. But what -- but that's what happens when you rely on one prism to look at life. Race, it takes all the real thinking off the table. I mean, if Kyle Rittenhouse were black, it wouldn't be you who disowned him, it would be the left because they're operating solely on lines of race and race must adhere to a specific ideology. And so, the meltdowns get worse.",

Of course, CNN reports is nothing more frightening in America than an angry white man. The writer, a racist, states, \"A vision of white masculinity allows some white men to feel as if they can rule and brutalized without consequence.\" So, does that vision include the white guys who are trying to kill Rittenhouse? I doubt that. But if that's true, why do they still have white men working and running CNN? Shouldn't they step down those racists? Meanwhile, a Virginia University Chemistry Department says the Rittenhouse acquittal hampers the progress of science. I guess it could if someone tries to defend themselves from attackers with a Bunsen burner. But the -- but the people who Rittenhouse killed in self-defense, how did that hurt science? Were they trying to split heads or split atoms? The University of Massachusetts hosted segregated processing spaces after the verdict, because to solve their deliberate racial division, they want more racial division. It's not just for their admission standards anymore. You see how one filter creates this idiocy. Race. How long before we see a math problem on a test that asked, how many times do 10 white supremacist go into 50 black peaceful protests? And it can never be done in reverse.

San Francisco's most prolific shoplifter was finally charged after stealing 40 grand's worth of stuff from the same Target store over the course of 120 visits. They put her picture on the wall and she stole that too. But you know what? Kudos to her for always reusing her own bag.

Them ask why -- so why do so many Democratic politicians promote vaccine mandates that cause working people to lose their jobs? It's a good question, expect to be kicked off Twitter for that. Even unions are abandoning their members who don't get the shot. We haven't seen unions care this much about shots since they killed Jimmy Hoffa. Kat doesn't even know what that means. And as one teacher who's on unpaid leave for not getting vax pointed out: I've always thought the Dems would be sympathetic to the working class. Now, it seems like conservatives are the only ones investigating the safety of the vaccines. Meanwhile, Disney World has paused forcing employees to get the jab after Governor DeSantis signed into law legislation restricting vaccine mandates. But a spokesman says more than 90 percent of Disney cast members have already been vaccinated, including of course, Goofy, against rabies. And Mickey Mouse against the Hantavirus. And of course, Cinderella against athlete's foot. You shouldn't be, you shouldn't be trying on other people's shoes, you idiot. Tulsi, I think, I know how you feel about vaccine mandates.

Meanwhile, Eric Swalwell didn't drive across state lines. But what did the fabricating fart bag do with state secrets? When he did the bang, bang with the Fang, Fang. That whole story stinks to high heaven, partly because Swalwell just had cabbage for dinner. All right, I'll stop. But, of course, Kyle Rittenhouse did not -- did not take a gun across state lines. You think a party that has a reputation of stealing elections would know where state lines are drawn. But good liars know that correcting the lie makes people stop trusting you.

Their implication, those who defend a white Rittenhouse wouldn't defend a black version of Rittenhouse. It's mind reading, but above all, it's stupid. A black man Andrew Coffee IV was acquitted of attempted murder charges last week after 12 Jurors found he had reason to believe he was being attacked during a SWAT team raid. And there is no mass outrage from conservatives over that because as long as you view this through the prism of self-defense, there is no racial angle. With Kyle, all the attackers were white. And I'm thinking actual white supremacist, rarely support an unjustified shooting of white people. And if Rittenhouse were black, those defending Rittenhouse would not only defend him, they might elect him to office. But the people who bring up the so-called Black Rittenhouse would smear him if he indeed existed. Black Rittenhouse would now be the face of white supremacy. Just like Larry Elder who is black. Remember a white person in a gorilla mask attacked him and the media barely noticed. There was Condoleezza Rice and then Winsome Sears, who posed with a gun, and is black, but as a white supremacist for being elected as a Republican. Nothing says you have a grip on the race issue like calling black people white. There is confused as a guy and assless leather chaps at a sports bar. Was I embarrass? The bars have the same names. But what -- but that's what happens when you rely on one prism to look at life. Race, it takes all the real thinking off the table. I mean, if Kyle Rittenhouse were black, it wouldn't be you who disowned him, it would be the left because they're operating solely on lines of race and race must adhere to a specific ideology. And so, the meltdowns get worse."

Of course, CNN reports is nothing more frightening in America than an angry white man. The writer, a racist, states, \"A vision of white masculinity allows some white men to feel as if they can rule and brutalized without consequence.\" So, does that vision include the white guys who are trying to kill Rittenhouse? I doubt that. But if that's true, why do they still have white men working and running CNN? Shouldn't they step down those racists? Meanwhile, a Virginia University Chemistry Department says the Rittenhouse acquittal hampers the progress of science. I guess it could if someone tries to defend themselves from attackers with a Bunsen burner. But the -- but the people who Rittenhouse killed in self-defense, how did that hurt science? Were they trying to split heads or split atoms? The University of Massachusetts hosted segregated processing spaces after the verdict, because to solve their deliberate racial division, they want more racial division. It's not just for their admission standards anymore. You see how one filter creates this idiocy. Race. How long before we see a math problem on a test that asked, how many times do 10 white supremacist go into 50 black peaceful protests? And it can never be done in reverse. I wonder what the angry white male has to say."

Yes, in the lands of syringes and poo, they stole everything in plain view. Several high-end San Francisco area stores were looted this weekend. Roughly 25 cars pulled up at south of Nordstrom's before about 80 people ran and grab some merch and fled. Only a few have been arrested. The previous night, a bunch of thieves ransack retailers in San Frans' Union Square, including Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Bloomingdale's, and Yves Saint Laurent. I give them credit for having great taste. They wouldn't be caught dead at a nearby old navy. A crap -- of course, crap like this has become more common ever since shoplifting charges of 950 bucks or less, were lower to misdemeanors in 2014. But God forbid, you go into a restaurant without wearing a mask, then, they call the firing squad. But some good news. San Francisco's most prolific shoplifter was finally charged after stealing 40 grand's worth of stuff from the same Target store over the course of 120 visits. They put her picture on the wall and she stole that too. But you know what? Kudos to her for always reusing her own bag. Her arrest only happened after Target demanded the district attorney launch an investigation. California's D.A.'s work less than Mayor Pete. And if you think that's nuts, check out her interview with local media after her last shoplifting spree."
