Big tech trying to permanently silence conservatives in America and control what you are allowed to see and hear, Republicans are furious, threatening retaliation after Facebook's oversight board upheld its indefinite ban on former President Trump. They are warning, if it can happen to him it can happen to anybody. But this story is much bigger than just one person, it's about tech oligarchs manipulating the political conversation and debate. Republicans say it's time to take action.",

But in that argument you realize that ship has already sailed, we're not -- we understand it. This isn't about going up to a street corner and shouting, all right? Social media platforms are so huge that when you get kicked off it, it's not like you can go start one -- start a new one up in your backyard. That would be like starting a phone company in the 1990s or 1980s because they won't let you use the telephone. So I think the people that are OK with this, it's pure partisanship. They are not conservatives, so this isn't a problem. It's like when people laugh about when you talk about media bias or you talk about bias in the academia or you talk about bias in the entertainment industry. The left, the Democrats and the people in the press, they don't care because it doesn't affect them. But one day, it will affect them when they find out that they're not left-wing enough. And I'm telling you, these social media platforms in places like Google, they do control the narrative. If you ever try to search for a story that you are looking for specifically that had a conservative idea in it, good luck, because the algorithms do not help you. And also I do think that -- I do think Twitter really suffers from not having somebody like Trump on there. It's like Van Halen losing David Lee Roth, or you know, maybe it's more like the Sugarcubes when Bjork left and the band just collapsed. There's nothing interesting on Twitter anymore. We have a Trump-sized hole we need to fill. And I don't necessarily believe from the desk of Donald Trump is the right way to do it, because it feels like a memo from your uncle, whereas he was America's cab driver when he was on Twitter.

But you can't do that, but the way it's set up right now under the law, they are not considered a utility. Could they be? I mean, is at the direction to go? Because, actually, you could probably get to some bipartisan consensus. Bernie Sanders at one point said he didn't think this policy was a good one. He could see the principal danger here, so it's possible you could do that. In the meantime, this is what's going to happen, tons of fund-raising from both sides.",

Big tech trying to permanently silence conservatives in America and control what you are allowed to see and hear, Republicans are furious, threatening retaliation after Facebook's oversight board upheld its indefinite ban on former President Trump. They are warning, if it can happen to him it can happen to anybody. But this story is much bigger than just one person, it's about tech oligarchs manipulating the political conversation and debate.

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Look, I mean, you're going to get the argument -- the predictable argument that this is a private company, so it's not a speech issue. But in that argument you realize that ship has already sailed, we're not -- we understand it. This isn't about going up to a street corner and shouting, all right? Social media platforms are so huge that when you get kicked off it, it's not like you can go start one -- start a new one up in your backyard. That would be like starting a phone company in the 1990s or 1980s because they won't let you use the telephone. So I think the people that are OK with this, it's pure partisanship. They are not conservatives, so this isn't a problem. It's like when people laugh about when you talk about media bias or you talk about bias in the academia or you talk about bias in the entertainment industry. The left, the Democrats and the people in the press, they don't care because it doesn't affect them. But one day, it will affect them when they find out that they're not left-wing enough. And I'm telling you, these social media platforms in places like Google, they do control the narrative. If you ever try to search for a story that you are looking for specifically that had a conservative idea in it, good luck, because the algorithms do not help you. And also I do think that -- I do think Twitter really suffers from not having somebody like Trump on there. It's like Van Halen losing David Lee Roth, or you know, maybe it's more like the Sugarcubes when Bjork left and the band just collapsed. There's nothing interesting on Twitter anymore. We have a Trump-sized hole we need to fill. And I don't necessarily believe from the desk of Donald Trump is the right way to do it, because it feels like a memo from your uncle, whereas he was America's cab driver when he was on Twitter. It was like this on-going assessment of your daily life that I actually kind of miss."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

Well, they said uphold the band, but instead now, they are back -- you know, go back and they say, well, you know, in your rules it doesn't say you can have an indefinite ban. You either have to either do it or not. And so, we are kind of right where we were compared to, for example, Twitter, which just said ban, done. There is no oversight for it."

      "utterance": "There is no discussion about it. And so, I think when it comes to Washington, D.C., what will it do? You know, Greg brings up the phone company, and I think it's a really good point. If you can't just cut off somebody's phone service because you don't like what they have to say, or even if you are crank calling people like we know somebody on this panel used to do all the time after school -- and I try to myself, I wasn't a very at it. But you can't do that, but the way it's set up right now under the law, they are not considered a utility. Could they be? I mean, is at the direction to go? Because, actually, you could probably get to some bipartisan consensus. Bernie Sanders at one point said he didn't think this policy was a good one. He could see the principal danger here, so it's possible you could do that. In the meantime, this is what's going to happen, tons of fund-raising from both sides."

And Facebook, I think this oversight board is just a way for Mark Zuckerberg to not have to take responsibility, so he's just delegating it to some other faceless blob, so they don't really do anything. And I also remember when Dana went to the Facebook campus because for a while, they were paying lip service to conservatives. They acknowledged that conservatives were being frozen out of at least their platform and obviously that -- you know, that was just for show. That is not happening anymore. So if you are looking at the Florida model, maybe you have to end qualified immunity for big tech companies."

And then, in the next year, I don't think they are going to be able to do it. The issue here is why they talk about climate change in these root causes is because you can't fix it. Not in your lifetime. They don't expect her to do anything but repeat these platitudes and these catchphrases that we've heard for years from the Dems. The Dems have two clubs in their golf bag to beat you with, race and climate. They don't have to rely on data. So instead what they do is they do, if you want to be harder on immigration, tougher on immigration, you are a cold-hearted bigot who hates the earth. That's what you do because then you don't have to actually talk about facts. Remember the game 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon where you can link every actor to Kevin bacon? Great game. Now, we have two games, 6 degrees of the climate apocalypse or 6 degrees of Hitler. You are either going to get one or the other from a Democrat.

There was a need to get vaccines made, and have them quickly pass through the FDA, so you can save lives.

But what is the difference between the people who are fleeing at places where they are living and those places that are not having anybody try to flee? It is rule of law and governance. That's a big difference. And obviously, there are some countries that are going to be able to adapt as slowly. But to Greg's point, he's absolutely right. And the administration admits this.

In El Salvador, the strong man there has decided he is going to replace judges on his own equivalent of the Supreme Court and put in friends there. And that way, he will get decisions that are more in his favor. And now, the administration has said, you know, an independent judiciary is very important. Really?

Juan, I mean, if it's really about the climate, is she going to argue that the sea levels are rising so high that coastal villages are fleeing to higher ground? Because that's not happening and that would be a lie, or is she saying it's now 10 degrees hotter in Guatemala and people are fleeing north to colder climates? Also not happening. But if it is, just explain it like that. And Greg nailed it, climate change and racism is just a lazy deflection from having to actually argue on the substance.

There's a guy today, a third- generation of restaurant owner who can't find enough people and they've had to close early. They are not able to grow their business. They're not even able to keep the business that they have. And this after trying to stay in business over this past year. So, it's just adding insult to injury. I think the governor of Montana has done a really bold thing and a smart thing and it's innovative. He has said that they're no longer going to do the enhanced unemployment benefit. They are going to do a $1,200 payment if you come back to work, but no more of that enhanced unemployment. And I think that, you know, if that works -- it can maybe work in Montana. I don't know if it will work everywhere. But that would actually help people be able to employ folks. The other thing I mentioned, Greg, is there was a job fair down in Atlantic City.

I think that what we've got here is tens of millions of Americans who did get the enhanced benefit who are already back to work.

It just going to take two hours to get through lunch because there won't be enough servers and busboys and chefs to keep these businesses afloat. So, people do a very simple cost-benefit analysis. If I go out and look for a job, I will bring home less money. If I sit home and accept this unemployment insurance and some of the benefits from the various COVID relief packages, I will make more money. That's what people do. It's not condescending. It's not taking a dim view of human nature. It is basic economics.

And I'm going to use that White House voice I used to have and get everybody organized, because it's so frustrating. Part of this also has to do with camps being worried about liability. So, maybe one of the things is if you want your kids to go to camp and the camp wants to open, work with your lawyers and figure out a way to have a waiver that says, I got my vaccine or kids got the vaccine, if it's available to them, and we're not going to sue you if anybody comes out of here with COVID."

I got my burrito right here from Summer Salt in Union Square. And I also have burrito insurance. So, if I've had too many Coronas, or cervezas, or whatever I drink on Cinco de Mayo, and I dropped my burrito, I can get a free burrito through DoorDash or Cholula's. You just use the code burrito town and DoorDash will send you a $20.00 coupon for a free burrito. So, I think this is a good deal. Again, do not feed this to your dog like this also like Liz Warren. unwrap it and then feed it."

I got to recommend them, especially if you are a city dweller, you got to get your kids these books. This is about Roadie the Ranch Dog by Scott Haynes. And this just delightful to go through this book and see what it's like to, you know, move cows, get the -- you know, have the dogs and the pickup and all that. So, you can find them on his Web site, I believe. I thought that -- yes, it's here. RoadieRanchDog.com. I love them. It's great books. There's five of them. Don't miss them."

Look at two-year-old Dorian. That's right. He's trapped in that wooden barrel. It was an antique that he was playing with while visiting his grandparents. His mom went to the emergency room. The doctor did an X-ray of the barrel. Then they use the power saw to create a hole in the bottom of the barrel so that his legs could come through. Once his legs were through, they pulled him out the top."
