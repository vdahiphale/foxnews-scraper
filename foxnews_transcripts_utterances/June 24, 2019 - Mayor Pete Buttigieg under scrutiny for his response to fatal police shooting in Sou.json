That to me -- like, why would you do that to the president, unless they wanted it out there? And I guess that is possible. So I think it wasn't so much strategic and the response, but possibly the right response because the result is that the Iranians are thrown off. They don't exactly know what's going on.

There might be opportunity for President Trump, especially after showing some restraint and not going through with the military strike because the more belligerent that Iran acts and the more hostile activity is that they take part in, like the blowing up of the tankers, or the increased uranium enrichment targeting, or drones, doing things like that, the more they might push these neutral allies into our corner. So I actually think the maximum pressure campaign is working and forcing Iran's hand acting -- you know, forcing them to act sort of obliterate and hostile, so there might be opportunity. And now we see the Trump administration saying, hey, we want to sit down. We want to talk. Mike Pompeo says he's going to go to the Middle East, talk to some of our allies there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Additionally, looking out to our Asian, European partners and trying to build a global coalition.

They're basically goading him into doing something. Now the second point that gives me hope, this feels a little bit like the North Korea scenario, which produced hostilities, if you remember. You may not agree with it, but the fact is we're in a better situation than we were before. It's because Trump offered two paths. The first path is you can go this way and it will be bad for you, which is the, quote, obliteration. Or you go this way and it's going to be great for you, right?

It can't be a small margin. It can't be like a million votes. You have to beat him handily in the Electoral College because this guy is a felon. This guy is a cheater. This guy is a willing polluter.

      "utterance": "Well, I'm less interested in that as I am, the actual decision and what's happening in Iran and the policy they're in, although I can talk about the others as well. But let me say this. Iran is trying to get leverage, right? So they're trying to ratchet things up. The squeeze on the sanctions has put pressure on the regime and they're trying to get some attention. So they're actually walking right up to the line. Like what is the threshold for U.S. pain and action? And they walked right up to the line, right? So it wasn't the $130 million drone. Would have it been -- had there been people on that drone? Now, as I understand it the plans that the president was going to possibly execute had been drawn up way back when the maximum pressure campaign was first organized because they knew that Iran would try to retaliate in some way. There's not a lot of other ways that Iran can ratchet it up further without crossing that line, is what I'm hearing the president say. His giving him another chance. I am quite shocked that the whole process story leaked, unless they wanted it to leak. That to me -- like, why would you do that to the president, unless they wanted it out there? And I guess that is possible. So I think it wasn't so much strategic and the response, but possibly the right response because the result is that the Iranians are thrown off. They don't exactly know what's going on. And now they have this opportunity. They could come back to the table. I don't necessarily think they will. The other thing about maximum --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. So, Jesse, that's (INAUDIBLE) makes a good point. So the U.S. is trying to increase pressure by putting personal -- almost personal sanctions on Khamenei and the foreign minister, but, you know, we don't have a whole lot of options because the deal had these sanctions in it and we just pulled out of the deal and said we're putting on sanctions, so we already had sanctions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "The line about everything was kosher when have this deal in place is a lie, Juan. After the deal was sign, you know what the Iranians did? They started launching ballistic missile tests against U.N. Security Council resolutions. They started sending shipments to North Korea with illicit goods. They started sending millions of dollars to Hamas in Hezbollah. And they started putting the Iranian revolutionary guard outpost in Iraq and Syria. So to say that everything was contained and everything was going down this great road and it's Donald Trump who ended up making the Iranians act badly, that's just not true. The Iranians have always hated us. They always will hate us. And they will always act like bad guys. And Donald Trump as Maxine Waters said, is not the one provoking Iran. Maxine Waters actually tweeted it our drone, an American drone, her drone, was in Iranian airspace and we're provoking them to react. I think that's ridiculous that the left is now trying to blame America for the evil that the Iranians are doing. And let's just remember this Iran nuke deal, not ratified by Congress. It was sold to the American public with lies. We bribe them with all these pallets of cash in the middle of the night. This is not a great deal to then say, oh, we're fine now. I think what's going on now, I agree with Dana, they're trying to see how far they can get. They're trying to split the Europeans from the Americans. And I don't know if it's working. I actually think it has the opposite effect."

    {
      "speaker": "LISA BOOTHE, GUEST CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, and I think that's the potential here, right? There might be opportunity for President Trump, especially after showing some restraint and not going through with the military strike because the more belligerent that Iran acts and the more hostile activity is that they take part in, like the blowing up of the tankers, or the increased uranium enrichment targeting, or drones, doing things like that, the more they might push these neutral allies into our corner. So I actually think the maximum pressure campaign is working and forcing Iran's hand acting -- you know, forcing them to act sort of obliterate and hostile, so there might be opportunity. And now we see the Trump administration saying, hey, we want to sit down. We want to talk. Mike Pompeo says he's going to go to the Middle East, talk to some of our allies there. Additionally, looking out to our Asian, European partners and trying to build a global coalition. So I think, in hindsight, President Trump showing that restraint strengthens our position in trying to get some of our allies to come over and help us and forcing Iran to the negotiating table."

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "-- four decades of the same crap, it's like being in a relationship that goes nowhere. But I'm hopeful. I see two possibilities that give me hope. Number one, the threat by Iran to down a drone. You know, it's expensive. It costs us money, but that once removed from killing people, right? I said this on Thursday -- I think it was Thursday. I said it's stuff versus stuff. In the modern world, we should be really happy that we're not hurling bodies at each other, that this has become a thing about a drone and it's -- they're going to hit another one of our drone, that should upset us, but it's not taking down a plane of people. If the media saw that as being pro-war, how stupid is that to assume that the fact that technology might reduce bloodshed is seen as pro-war? That is idiotic. And to that point, you asked about who is pushing Trump into military action. It's not the hawks. It's the media who mock him for his indecisiveness. They're basically goading him into doing something. Now the second point that gives me hope, this feels a little bit like the North Korea scenario, which produced hostilities, if you remember. You may not agree with it, but the fact is we're in a better situation than we were before. It's because Trump offered two paths. The first path is you can go this way and it will be bad for you, which is the, quote, obliteration. Or you go this way and it's going to be great for you, right? You're going to have a great economy. And he says I'll meet with you, no preconditions because he doesn't see meeting as a zero-sum gain. It's not like -- if you meet with me, America is gonna suffer. He doesn't see meetings that way because he's a salesman. He'll meet with anybody. So I do think to your point, will there be a meeting? I think so. It will be long-term. Hell, it's been 40 years. What's another five years?"

This is like what you said in the beginning, if Trump tweets something that he's never going to leave, then Mar say he's not going to leave. Then he asked him about leaving and he says I'm just joking. And then they run story about the president might not be joking, he could be serious. When in fact, it's Hillary and the left who hasn't accepted the last results of the election. Remember, they called him an illegitimate Russian hacker for two years. And then you have all the holdovers like Yates and McCabe and Comey trying to constantly undermine him from within. But I think the strategy for the media, Greg, is that they're trying to give the Democrats voters a shot of adrenaline and say, you guys need to beat Trump by a larger margin. It can't be a small margin. It can't be like a million votes. You have to beat him handily in the Electoral College because this guy is a felon. This guy is a cheater. This guy is a willing polluter. And if it's really close he's going to say there's fraud. He's going to say you guys cheated and he's going to stay in office, so I think that's the strategy."

So you actually benefit yourself by not overreacting to it because he'd be probably be less inclined to want to do it. But it's not just Hillary Clinton that can't accept the results of the election for 2016. You have Stacey Abram who is still saying that she's governor of Georgia. She lost by 55,000 votes in 2018. And you have people like Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, all these Democrats that know better that are saying that somehow she would have been the governor of Georgia despite the fact that the 2018 midterm elections in Georgia saw near presidential levels in turn out. So clearly, nobody was suppressed. There was a tremendous amount of people that turned out. She just lost. They didn't vote for her."

The community event was so poorly produced to have him on a little lectern, detached, emotionless, sounding wonky and not really responding passionately to the anger and the pain from his own community was just awful. He needs to get out on the streets. He needs to get in the neighborhood. He needs to hug people; he needs to see their tears and respond and immerse himself in the anguish. And there is an opportunity here, I mean he needs to nationalize this issue, if he wants any hope for rebounding from this. He needs to make this a core issue. He needs to talk about it at the debate. And that's the only shot he has. But he did handle a few things well, you know he's talking about bringing the DOJ in, appointing an independent prosecutor. He has taken a little ownership of it, but it's such a murky situation, because of the body camera and the fact that the victim's body was transported not by an ambulance, but by a police vehicle. But at the same time, the guy allegedly threw a knife at the officer, was rummaging around cars and has a rap sheet with weapons and cocaine charges, so you don't really know what the truth was."

Are we going to do that like all of those types of things people, actually we are not for that? That's it. Is there something that we should do as a country to try to get a handle on this, because is it a slow moving train where you are going to have to bail out banks again, because they're going to have all these people in debt and the government put forward a bill in 2007 for people that went into public service and said, if you have student loan debt, we'll try to help you figure out a way to pay.

And what's hilarious about this, it's actually an elitist proposal, because as you mentioned, the higher earners are the ones that make up a disproportionate amount of the student loan debt.

I mean to my mind getting hit by a foul ball is pretty rare in the first place. You know I mean you're more likely to get hit by a power ball. I mean you - to me you could have a chance of getting hit by lightning, but you still go outside. I still go to the baseball game. I just worry that there are people who will say that they treasure being right there with the players and don't understand. It's really dangerous."

Cricket, hockey, all account for much more fan deaths and injuries than baseball and you know they don't even include golf, because I looked up the golf stats. Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els and Tiger Woods have hit fans in the eye, head, face and neck recently. I mean all of those other sports seem much more dangerous than baseball, so it's good to have perspective."

But Greg as a fan if you go to these games and we see this happen, you go to hockey games, you go to baseball games, you see a puck fly in air, it hits someone. Baseball seems to work - don't you sort of assume that risk when you go to a game. GUTFELD: I think it's not - that is not the real risk. The real risk is always in the restroom. That's why I don't go - I don't go to professional sports because of the conditions of their bathroom. As somebody who lived grew up in the Bay Area and if you're at home and you had been to Candlestick Park to see the San Francisco Giants or the 49ers and remember the trough, when you're six years old or seven years old and you've got to use the trough where your head is at the knee of grown men--"

You know it's not easy being 300 pounds and trying to feel the heat. There you go. All right, nice catch.
