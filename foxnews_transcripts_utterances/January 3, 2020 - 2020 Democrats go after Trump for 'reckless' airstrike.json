      "utterance": "Thank you, James. Got to know each other well. A friend of mine who was on television before I knew him and he kept saying, you know, he might not know the Bible as well as I do, or frankly, as well as a lot of people. But he's a leader, and he loves God. And he's a great Christian. And he said, “I love him, and I want him to do a terrific job,” and I think hopefully I've more than exceeded expectations. Robert Jeffress. Right? Thank you, Rob. And I hope I have. Cissie Graham Ledge, when you talk about a great family, that's a great family, the granddaughter of Billy Graham and the daughter of Franklin. And I appreciate everything that Franklin has done over the last two weeks. Right? He fought very hard for us. And it's a special woman and it's a special family. Thank you very much. Michael Tate. Everybody knows Michael Tate. Thank you, Michael. Great job. Jensen Franklin. Thank you, Jensen. Great. Alveda King. Jack Graham. Jack Graham. Thank you. Thank you, Jack. And Miami Zone, a man that everybody knows. I think they might know him better than they know me. Is that possible? Yes. Alberto Delgado. Alberto. I especially like to thank Paso Maldonado, Paso Maldonado. What a great guy. What a great guy, what crowds. I think I'm going to come to a Sunday service one of these days, is that all right? We have a lot of fun,. But I want to thank you very much for welcoming us here to El Rey Jesus church, the largest Hispanic congregation in the United States of America. And as you all know from those unemployment numbers, the best in the history of our country. The best. We'll go over that very soon, we're delighted to be with more than 5,000 Christians, including so many extraordinary Hispanic and African American faith leaders who are lifting our nation to incredible new heights. Things are happening like they've never happened before. There is no better place to begin the new year than right here with so many friends and families, pastors and patriots who believe in the power of prayer, the majesty of creation, and the love and grace of Jesus Christ. Thank you. In 2016, Evangelicals, Christians helped us, and they went out. Evangelical Christians went out and they worked so hard and they produced numbers like they've never produced before. And based on what Paul told me, Cissie told me and everybody told me, we're going to blow those numbers away in 2020. Going to blow 'em away. Hi Charlie. Charlie Kirk. Hi, Charlie. He could be a pastor and be a very good pastor.  Every day since I've been fighting for you and we really have -- we've achieved results that nobody thought was possible because things were looking very bleak for a long period of time. Things were looking very bleak. Even a thing like Merry Christmas remains to go around in the summer. I'd say, we're going to say Christmas again. We're going to say Christmas again. And now they're all saying Merry Christmas again. Right? They're all saying, you go to these big department stores, three years ago, four years ago. And that have the snow and that and the red and the white. They'd have everything. But they wouldn't say Christmas. I said, \"Where's Merry Christmas?\" And they said, \"We can't say it.\" They're all saying it again. They're saying it proudly. Evangelical --"

And he also talked about the news overnight, that the United States took an airstrike, took action against General Soleimani. He was basically the second-in-command there in Iran and he is no more. We're going to take it on the table here at The Five. Now get The Five going. Pete Hegseth is with us, Lawrence Jones, Marie Harf, and Emily Compagno. But, Pete, let me start with you. When you first heard this news, you must have been quite happy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Pete Hegseth",
      "utterance": "Yeah, elation. I mean, this is a name that most Americans probably don't know. You know, you know a name like Baghdadi, you know a name like Osama bin Laden. But Soleimani was a name that maybe flew under the radar because you're used to hearing about the Quds Force of the IRGC or the Iranian regime, and not necessarily an individual name. But those who follow the nefarious nature of Iran understand how evil this man is and how are our nation's war fighters have been targeted by him and his forces, not just in Iraq, but around the globe. Hundreds killed and maimed because of him. But it's not just the particular personal nature of the guys in our hospitals here in this country who are recovering from the wounds specifically from him. But it's a strategic way in which he's tried to advance the evil motives of the regime in Tehran. I mean, ultimately the Quds Force, the name of the Quds Force, is the Jerusalem Force. I mean, the Iran -- that's what it stands for in English. Their goal is the capture of Israel and Jerusalem. So, when you look at Iran needs Iraq to get to Syria, to get to Lebanon, to get to Israel. Iraq has always been important to Iran. The ability to meddle there and try to put a Shia Iranian regime in charge has been central to their goals. They propped up Bashar al-Assad. Now, they were putting their top general there to try to connect those dots even further. And President Trump said, if you're going to try to take our embassies, if you're going to try to threaten our people, we've already declared you a terrorist organization, which we did, intentionally, in April of 2019, which no other mission [unintelligible] had done. You pop your head up one more time and your days are limited. And that's precisely what happened. God bless the courage of our president to do it and the war fighters who had the skill to make it happen."

      "speaker": "Dana Perino",
      "utterance": "It was quite skillful. And also, it seems like, Emily, that there was an imminent threat apparent. We don't have the details on this yet, but we hear from the Pentagon that they had some sort of intelligence that there was going to be an attack directed by Soleimani against hundreds of Americans."

      "speaker": "Emily Compagno",
      "utterance": "Right, which is why the Secretary of State has continued to maintain all day that it was a decisive defensive strike, especially with his statements that he has been connecting with world leaders who he says agree with us in that measure. And I agree with everything that you said wholeheartedly. I think for 40 years we've seen U.S. presidents struggle with essentially the question of whether Iran is a country or a cause. And this answers the question of how we're going to proceed. And with those that are saying, \"Well, this is a whole new war.\" It's not. It's a new chapter in an ongoing war. And up until now, we have fought it in the realm of economic sanctions and precision strikes with proxies. Now we have erased that line between the proxies and of the country. And I think we've not only delivered a blow to that terrorist regime, but also to the fact that up until now, they've been trying to bully the world into treating them like a country. They're not. And so, therefore, from here on out, as you said, we've -- we will treat them as such."

Anything that the New Delhi attack and I don't know, if in the control room if we still have since we started off here with breaking news, the soundbite from the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. I would like to play that because, of course, we have Marie Harf, who works at the State Department here. Let's play that now."

      "speaker": "Mike Pompeo",
      "utterance": "President Trump made the decision, a serious decision, which was necessary. There was an imminent attack. The orchestrator of the primary motivator for the attack was Qasem Soleimani. He's got hundreds of American lives, blood on his hands. A military commander who was actively engaged in plotting to kill Americans in the region. The Iranian leadership understands that President Trump will take action. We made very clear that these responses would be swift and decisive. We've now demonstrated that. We don't seek war with Iran, but at the same time, we're not going to stand by and watch the Iranians escalate and continue to put American lives at risk."

      "speaker": "Marie Harf",
      "utterance": "My question I have today when we're looking at this news is, why now? And we've heard that there was an imminent threat on the horizon. We need to see more information about that, because the Bush administration and the Obama administration both debated taking out Soleimani and they calculated that the risk of doing so and the consequences that would come from that, whether it was basically having us kicked out of Iraq, which the U.S. likely will be now. That's certainly where it's trending. Whether it was a wider regional instability, a wider conflict with Iran, that there's always a calculation that goes into these decisions. Is this strike worth the risks? And to --"

    {
      "speaker": "Marie Harf",
      "utterance": "But there are two administrations that had very different policy goals, both of whom separately concluded that to do so would cause wider instability. So, I agree that he was an evil person. There are a lot of evil people in the world. We need to know what the Trump administration's plan is for what comes next. What is -- how are they going to get back to the negotiating table? How are they going to handle possible retribution, which could come in ways we see, and could come in ways we don't, from cyber-attack. It's not funny, Pete. I have friends too over there."

He said, \"We took action to stop a war, not to start a war, and that we weren't advocating for regime change or anything. But the threat was imminent.\" And Democrats have told us for months that the president needs to listen to our intelligence agencies. Right? The president listened to our intelligence agencies. And we don't know exactly what was in that briefing. But it was enough that the president felt the need to act. This is a bad guy."

As ISIS emerged after the Bush administration, during the Obama administration, now ISIS has declined. And of course, all of us would like to be able to have everyone come home, but only if we can prevent ISIS from resurging."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Pete Hegseth",
      "utterance": "I think you mentioned risk threshold. There is a different risk threshold here. Because ISIS was allowed to emerge, we ended up partnering with Iran and Soleimani under the Obama administration to try to push them back, which only empowered the Iranian militias more, so they were able to take over Baghdad. Now, they're landing their top general in Baghdad to attack our embassy. Hello. The alarm bells are going off saying our risk threshold has been passed. They're going to attack Americans."

The implication is \"I'd rather have the correct commander in chief,\" meaning Hillary Clinton, \"and the wrong actions.\" And it sums up precisely how everyone who isn't a supporter of this -- the haters of the president view him. It doesn't matter what he does, we're going to dislike him. The reality is, though, the commentary there is true. He made the right call. He made a call based on advisors around him who believe this is an imminent threat, and specifically because he saw a policy action taken under the Obama administration where sovereign American soil where there's a consulate or an embassy was threatened and not taken seriously, dismissed by an Internet video by the national security advisor later on. Ultimately, he said, \"If you're going to try that,\" -- and we know what Iran does. Iran, 40 years ago, used the American Embassy in Tehran as the launching-off point for their Islamic Republic. Embassies are meaningful to them. It's sovereign American soil. He said, \"This will not happen again. And as a result, I'm going -- I see the signs in front of me and I'm going to compensate. I'm going to send the Marines. I'm going to send the 82nd Airborne,\" which he did, by the way, knowing they had intelligence on Soleimani -- that looked like a bit of a bigger reaction than people thought as a result. But they knew what was coming next. So, this was something that as intentional because he didn't -- imagine if he hadn't acted, the amount of negligence he'd be charged with --"

      "speaker": "Dana Perino",
      "utterance": "And so that's just that's going to happen, and presidents can't worry about it. Right. They have to be able to make decisions based on the information that they have, the responsibility that they have and the timing and then history will figure that out. Right. That's not for them to worry about right now. The other thing is, if he if there had been an attack based on something that the president knew about and he didn't act in doing it, then what do you think of all the 2020 Democrats would have said instead. That would have been a much different conversation because they would've said how much tougher they would be. So, it's kind of difficult when these things are happening in the middle of a presidential election to the point that Ilhan Omar, the congressman from Michigan, said Minnesota, excuse me that said that maybe President Trump was just trying to create a distraction. I think it could arguably say that from September to now the biggest distraction in America has been impeachment. That was actually a distraction and I also think that there is more strategy behind this because of something you pointed out, Pete, that in April of 2019 the Trump administration designates Soleimani and his group as a terrorist organization. So they've now I think that that probably you will look back and find is the history is written about this time that there was a lot more strategy to it than we thought but it can't you can't plan everything out and so, yes, we need to know anything right now."

    {
      "speaker": "Emily Compagno",
      "utterance": "And I think that the point I'd like to make is the fact that when people say that this is the escalation, what if the Iranians have been doing they have been steadily escalating and become more bolder with their aggressive actions against us right. Starting with oil tankers and then the oil processing facilities and then U.S. positions and then an all-out attack in Kirkuk that killed a U.S. contractor and then an attack on the U.S. embassy. So, I also don't understand why all of a sudden out of the blue, we question the U.S. intelligence community when apparently, especially in domestic matters, they are to be absolutely believed at all points. It's only because of Trump's involvement that all of a sudden, we're not to believe them, we're not to trust them when they have the intelligence community has come out. They strongly indicated that a major attack necessitated preemption with this risk. So why now all of a sudden do we need more information? If--"

So, he actually was trying to be the moderate here and not, you know, Tulsi Gabbard saying, \"This is an act of war.\" I mean, Tulsi's way out there on issues related to Iran. Anyways but, you know, I think that what Democratic voters want to see is a strong statement. And so a statement like Mayor Pete's, which I do think didn't say a whole lot, wasn't -- I think Pete actually having served in Afghanistan could have made a much stronger statement for why he believes this is putting us on the course to conflict.

I'm not sure I would put that mistake in his opinion on this, but I do believe that the other candidates could have struck another tone. But again, the progressive side of the Democratic Party is not going to be for them. They look at this just as war, period. Even though this guy was a bad guy, they see it as war.

It was an assassination.\" Criticizing Trump's policy. And she suffered for it after she did the same with Medicare For All, support for her deflated. And I think if people see through this. Already, we're seeing a waning for her. But you can't be, as a candidate, all things to all wings of the party, especially that party.

That's why one of my favorite things about this was Trump's American flag tweet right afterwards. I mean, it's a reminder that this is an action taken in advance of American interests. We can't rely on Iraqi guards standing outside our embassy. Guess what? We've been training them for 16 years and they still let the Iranians through to trash our embassy. We can't rely on allies who've never been full partners, as much as we'd like them to be, in the war against radical Islamic terrorism. If we're going to defend ourselves, it's going to be us. As it pertains to Iraq and the future. I mean, we killed an Iranian general in Iraq trying to destabilize the country. We've spent that much time, blood, and treasure investing it. I say -- I mean, listen, if the Iraqi parliament votes to say we don't want the Americans there anymore, as far as I'm concerned, fine, fine. And I say hand them all guns and let 'em shoot each other. And I know that sounds sort of, like, barbaric and backwards. But I think there are a lot of people out there in America that say if you're not satisfied yet, if you won't follow through and defend yourself yet, then at what point do we decide it's not in our interest. We can do some from further away and work with allies that are still there, like the Kurds, but pouring money and pouring weapons and pouring investment into places where people don't want it or they're not capable of keeping it, is something this president ran against. So, this action should not pull us closer to war, but instead its weakness invites challenge. This is strength, which I think sends a signal. The right signals we want to run to read right."

Look, I do believe that Bernie is sincere in his belief system; and so, there's a certain authenticity that comes across when he's talking about these issues.

But this year, it's all about to the Democrats beating Trump, and so far, that has been able to carry Biden nationally for some reason. But as you said interestingly, maybe people are sick of that concept being rammed down their throats because we are seeing him falter in the realm of money and in these early states polling.

They find her trapped all the way down there and they it took them two hours to dig and dig and she finally got her out. She's healthy, she's back with her owner and we obviously extend our gratitude to these brave firefighters. I'm so grateful to them that they always save animals, too. It's not just people."
