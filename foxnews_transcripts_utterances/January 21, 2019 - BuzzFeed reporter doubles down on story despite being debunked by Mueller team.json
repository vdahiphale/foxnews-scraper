But perhaps most disappointing of all was when the Head of the March for Life, Jeanne Mancini rushed into virtue signal, tweeting. \"The reprehensible behavior shown in the video in no way represents the 46 years and millions of people who have peacefully and respectfully gathered in Washington D.C. to stand up for the unborn\". Well she and Father Martin and some others later backed off when they all realized that there was another side to the story. It turns out when you look at an hour's worth of video covering the entire incident a few things emerge. The students had gathered to listen to a group that calls itself the Black Hebrew Israelites, I've never heard of them before.

Lives have been threatened just like lives on the Duke Lacrosse team, the UVA Fraternity Brothers or Brett Kavanaugh. They're all treated as disposable, kind of like collateral cultural damage. The question is, though, how will we as a society hold the real thugs accountable, and that's the angle. Here now Glenn Greenwald, Co-Founding Editor and Columnist for \"The Intercept\" that covers a lot of media issues. Glenn, why was this such a potentially juicy narrative for the media? I happily was not focusing on this over the weekend. I was with my family. But I started seeing it blow up, and I was wondering, this is really a wild story. I wonder if there's any other video and then, of course, other video came up. GLENN GREENWALD, CO-FOUNDING EDITOR \"THE INTERCEPT\": So I didn't comment it all over the weekend, because it was immediately clear to me that these snippets of video would make it impossible to know with any confidence what actually took place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And maybe that's my lawyer background, maybe it's yours as well, even in the controlled courtroom setting, where there's due process and all kinds of controls to make sure evidence is presented authentically and without distortion. It's very difficult to know who's telling the truth and who isn't, what happened and what didn't. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so when you start having this kind of trial by Twitter mob, it's just obvious that there's no way to have any confidence about what took place. Having said that, and I think that's dangerous. I do think that even the full video reveals some things that I do think are disturbing in the students actions, even when it's true that some of the worst things said about them are clearly false. There's some of them at least who were doing things like mocking the Native American with tomahawk chants, mocking the way in which he was singing. They were 15 years old, but at the same time, I don't consider that exemplary behavior. I think there is a question about why this captured so much media attention. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think one of the reasons is, is that a lot of our politics is very racially polarized. And you can blame the left and I think sometimes that's legitimate. But a lot of President Trump's rhetoric is responsible for that as well--",

Tonight Donald Trump Jr. will be here in moments to react to the BuzzFeed bombshell that kind of fizzled out in spectacular fashion a lot more. But, first, the tale of the tape that's the focus of tonight's angle. The left-wing smear and the \"Never Trump\" smear squad is at it again. With this piece of video from Friday-- A smattering of nasty Trump resistors set out to destroy the lives of a group of Kentucky High School students in D.C. for the March for Life. Well they're from Covington Catholic High and our scene in the video purportedly confronting this Native American activist at the Lincoln Memorial. They were immediately denounced by left-wing loons, the media and various know- nothing celebrities as basically just MAGA headed racists. S.E. CUPP, HOST OF CNN'S \"SE CUPP UNFILTERED\": A mob of MAGA hat wearing high school students. Clearly, these boys are not getting a good education because it makes little sense to angrily chant build the wall to a population with literally zero illegal immigrants."

These actions are not catholic, not Christian and not acceptable\". Well, in record time the school administrators and the Diocese of Covington also issued statements condemning the students' actions and they reserved the right to expel them. But perhaps most disappointing of all was when the Head of the March for Life, Jeanne Mancini rushed into virtue signal, tweeting. \"The reprehensible behavior shown in the video in no way represents the 46 years and millions of people who have peacefully and respectfully gathered in Washington D.C. to stand up for the unborn\". Well she and Father Martin and some others later backed off when they all realized that there was another side to the story. It turns out when you look at an hour's worth of video covering the entire incident a few things emerge. The students had gathered to listen to a group that calls itself the Black Hebrew Israelites, I've never heard of them before. But, for anyone, I guess, who's traverse Times Square, the routine of these activists is pretty predictable. They use racially charged rhetoric in an attempt to provoke reactions and then they capture it all on video. And this is what they were doing to the Covington High School students."

      "utterance": "Well, contrary to the early reporting on this story, it became clear that the students didn't confront anyone. All they did was stand their ground as they were being verbally assaulted. Now why wasn't that the focus of the media story? Like, imagine if a couple of white pastors started yelling racial epithets that say black students on MLK Day. You think that would be a story? You bet it would be, and it should be. But let's face it this is different, because the Covington students had marched for the unborn. And the other sin they committed was daring to show up wearing red MAGA hats in D.C. So they were cast as a bunch of troublemakers. The Native American activists initially claimed he was surrounded by the kids, but other video shows it was he, Nathan Phillips, who initially approached the students banging that drum in the face of Nick Sandmann, the student. Well, Phillips, the activist, claims he did so to defuse the tensions between the Black Hebrew Israelites and the students. Well, does it look like his defusing tensions to you? The Covington students started singing school chants, but not Sandmann, who despite someone yelling and beating a drum in his face, did not say a word. The Covington High School junior in a statement wrote yesterday. \"I believe that by remaining motionless and calm, I was helping to defuse the situation. I realized everyone had cameras and that perhaps a group of adults were trying to provoke a group of teenagers into a larger conflict. I'm being called every name in the book, including racist, and I'll not stand for this mob white character assassination of my family's name\". Well, the left isn't used to people standing their ground, are they? Not the way the Covington teen stood his. I think a lot of them get a perverse thrill when they drive their political targets out of restaurants or when they show up at their homes or in some cases even physically attack them, just for - what the clothing, they're wearing clothing with messaging that the left-wing activists don't like? But these people - I'm going to stop calling them activists. They're not activists. And they're not simply professional rabble rousers. They're more like - I don't know - they're more like domestic terrorists. And yes, that's how I characterize them, because they're used to operating with total impunity because they usually get cover from a complicit media, and sometimes even from local officials who do nothing as Trump supporters are literally taking a beating as they did during that 2016 - June 2016 campaign event in San Jose for Trump. These Trotskyite trolls, incapable and uninterested in actually winning the war of ideas are instead at war with the First Amendment and the free expression of others. And by the way, who caused this caustic environment? This is the environment we live in today where leftist hacks engaged in these guerrilla tactics. Trump? I mean, the President responsible for the booming economy, including the good low unemployment for young people and for minorities? Or how about the guy who defied all the skeptics to get Criminal Justice Reform passed? Look, he ain't perfect. None of us are. But he did not empower the mob. But meet a few of the people who did."

      "utterance": "Now this Covington Catholic High School episode also reveals something that reared its ugly head during the Kavanaugh battle, blatant anti-Catholic bigotry and an animus even toward catholic education. The left was clearly attempting to spin this nothing story into an indictment, not only of Trump supporters, but of the pro-life cause and the faith that sustains it. If pressed, what they'll you their ultimate goal is. Is to shut down catholic and Christian education and eradicate all vestiges of those moral traditions underpinning them. Here's a smattering of the weekend check it out. Former Chair of the DNC, Howard Dean howled the following. \"Covington Catholic High School seems like a hate factory to me. Why not just close it?\" An LA-based DJ named, Uncle Shoes tweeted, \"Locked the kids in the school and burn that B - to the ground\". Jack Morrissey, a producer who worked on Disney's live-action Beauty and the Beast tweeted this beauty. \"MAGA kids go screaming, hats first, into the woodchipper.\" Erik Abriss of Vulture tweeted, \"I don't know what it says about me, but I've truly lost the ability to articulate the hysterical rage, nausea and heartache this makes me feel. I just want these people to die. Simple as that. Every single one of them. And their parents\". CNN'S Bakari Sellers tweeted out of the Covington student saying this, \"He is deplorable. Some people can also be punched in the face\". My friends you have to know the new rules, if someone is wearing a red MAGA hat, you're that person, well, you're a racist. And if you're a catholic at a pro-life march in red hat, you deserve whatever happens to you. The real thugs, they're not the students, who stood and did nothing. They're the people who jeered the students in-person and online, and the people actually threaten them with actual violence. And by the way, most of these tweets have not been deleted and few accounts have even been suspended, that's only just a few of them. And what does that mean? It's going to happen again and again and again. Though, if you have the right political views, you can actually assault law enforcement on the steps of the D.C. monuments, landmarks, like the Supreme Court. You're good to go, no questions asked."

The Covington students deserve more than an apology. Lucky for them, there was that additional clarifying video that made so many of these malevolent morons eat crow. Still, though, these anti-male, anti-religious zealots have already done their damage. Lives have been threatened just like lives on the Duke Lacrosse team, the UVA Fraternity Brothers or Brett Kavanaugh. They're all treated as disposable, kind of like collateral cultural damage. The question is, though, how will we as a society hold the real thugs accountable, and that's the angle. Here now Glenn Greenwald, Co-Founding Editor and Columnist for \"The Intercept\" that covers a lot of media issues. Glenn, why was this such a potentially juicy narrative for the media? I happily was not focusing on this over the weekend. I was with my family. But I started seeing it blow up, and I was wondering, this is really a wild story. I wonder if there's any other video and then, of course, other video came up. GLENN GREENWALD, CO-FOUNDING EDITOR \"THE INTERCEPT\": So I didn't comment it all over the weekend, because it was immediately clear to me that these snippets of video would make it impossible to know with any confidence what actually took place. And maybe that's my lawyer background, maybe it's yours as well, even in the controlled courtroom setting, where there's due process and all kinds of controls to make sure evidence is presented authentically and without distortion. It's very difficult to know who's telling the truth and who isn't, what happened and what didn't. And so when you start having this kind of trial by Twitter mob, it's just obvious that there's no way to have any confidence about what took place. Having said that, and I think that's dangerous. I do think that even the full video reveals some things that I do think are disturbing in the students actions, even when it's true that some of the worst things said about them are clearly false. There's some of them at least who were doing things like mocking the Native American with tomahawk chants, mocking the way in which he was singing. They were 15 years old, but at the same time, I don't consider that exemplary behavior. I think there is a question about why this captured so much media attention. And I think one of the reasons is, is that a lot of our politics is very racially polarized. And you can blame the left and I think sometimes that's legitimate. But a lot of President Trump's rhetoric is responsible for that as well--"

I wasn't going to - I didn't travel to Washington, I didn't go to stuff like this, but it stupid things. But when you think about the way that people are approaching, whether it's law enforcement, members of the military, things they say to them on a daily basis, get to an inch away from their face and scream and yell, and I mean, horrible things. I mean, maybe people think they deserve it, maybe these people they don't deserve it. But the media never ever, ever roll with that for like a weekend of story - of coverage. But if these kids were wearing those MAGA hats and it reminded me a lot of the Kavanaugh story. It reminded me of like Georgetown Prep. They're all a bunch of horrible people, they're all a bunch of drunks. They don't do - it was it was that stereotype. And it's almost, Glenn, the kind of profiling that the left accuses police of doing regularly. But they're doing it, like everybody's profiling each other like snap judgments, without taking a breath, without saying, \"OK, what - let's look at really what happened here\". And let's look at some of the background on the activists himself who's accused other people wrongly of things in the past. But they didn't do that, because it's a kid with a red hat who looks like he has a smirk on his face. So he must be a racist. That really was the conclusion by the dominant media."

Why isn't that kind of incitement to violence something at least is disturbing? But, again, I think the context here is really important, which is, there are a lot of people in the country who are African American, who are Latino, who are Native American, who are Muslim who feel, I think with good reason, vulnerable and attacked and this is the context for all of these debates.

So why did Mueller's team take the highly unusual step of issuing a statement? Our Chief White House Correspondent, John Roberts, says Rudy Giuliani says his office spoke to Mueller's office on Friday regarding the article and there was ultimate agreement that a significant portion of the BuzzFeed story was false. Giuliani says there are no texts, no e-mails or other corroborating documents. So then why didn't Mueller respond to BuzzFeed when it notified them the story was about to break? Well, because BuzzFeed e-mailed Special Counsel saying it had, \"A story coming\" stating that Michael Cohen was directed by President Trump himself to lie to Congress about his negotiations related to the Trump Moscow project. Not a single word about the Special Counsel. And the Washington Post wrote, \"People familiar with the matter said, Mueller spokesperson Peter Carr told others in the government that he would have more vigorously discouraged the reporters from proceeding with the story, had he known it would allege Cohen had told the Special Counsel Trump directed him to lie\".

Meaning, I had it six days to before the world saw it as opposed to four days after the entire world saw it. This has gone on time and time again. It also happened when Lanny Davis said something along the effective, \"I told my father about the Russia meeting\" and he was there. He was CNN source. He then walked it back and realized it was totally wrong. Their own source did it and yet today they still haven't pulled that back. And the reason is they need it to be true, Laura. They've been pushing this nonsense for two years. They've found nothing. But anytime there's a negative, anytime there's a chance to get Trump, they're going to jump on it. They're basically leftists policing leftist at this point. I love watching some of the CNN commentary. Well, this is going to give us all a - of course it is, because you jump on it each and every time. They cover themselves with the, \"Well, if true, if true\"."

Remember, Laura, all of this stems from the plot that started inside the FBI and the DOJ and the Obama administration to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton, and if she lost, to then figure out a way to frame Donald Trump.  And what you saw from John Jr. tonight was that frustration of how that plot with the complicity of the American media has taken its toll on everybody, including the public and of the republic."
