Unlike her lefty peers in Hollywood, she found a way to shrink the political tribalism, replacing demonization with dialogue, which means it can only upset those who need division to keep their fading name in play -- meaning Tom Arnold. Yes, after I tweeted about the show, saying it's the most honest assessment of recent times that isn't found in your own house, the has-been used his angry, stubby fingers to tweet \"We sure as f aren't going to find it at Greg Gutfeld, Fox News.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now I don't know poor Tom but we all know of poor Tom: A faded relic who lashes out at the mere thought of an ex doing well.

      "sentences": "Yeah, thank you. There are a few reasons why it was very successful. One, ABC did a great job of laying this out. They have been promoting this for over a year and it's been spectacular. The rollout has been very special. And I like having to prep for The Five by watching TV, doesn't get any better than that. I really sweat it all out afternoon. I watched the first half hour and I thought it was accessible to middle-class Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Because like you said, they are struggling with the cost of prescription medications. One of the people had to move back in with her parents because she got fired. The father has a gun in the house. And you know it's a stressful kind of lower middle-class background, which has been different, because over the years, you've seen sitcom families grow richer and richer and richer while the average family in America stays the same. So that was nice that not everybody had a $3,000 suit and lived in a penthouse in Manhattan. Also good was they have the gender bending son and this debate over being a surrogate. And usually those topics in network sitcoms are celebrated. And they are normalized. But in this case, people are struggling with it, and they are grappling with it but they are doing it with humor and they are doing it in an open-minded way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think that's the reality to 90 percent of the American people. The woman's marching sister with the pink hat, the nasty woman is fantastic. And it is very balanced because this is the only time you have seen the conservative protagonist where she is not mocked on network television. And the sister gives it right back to Roseanne. I thought the jokes were relevant and pretty cutting edge. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You have Obamacare jokes, pantsuit jokes, Russian jokes, fake news jokes, even the nonpolitical jokes about the timing were good and the comedy writing is good. But the bottom line I believe is that the message of the show is that people come from different political backgrounds, and you don't have to hate each other. You can talk it out and you don't assume that the other person's intentions are evil. And that's what makes it work.",

I did think it was funnier than Saturday Night Live has been recently, even though the acting a little filtered, but it is on Saturday Night Live as well. But it was at least more honest in its humor. I thought one thing that was really interesting aside from the Trump- Hillary stuff was when they were at the table and he brings home the pack of prescription drugs, and he says I could only get half because that's all we could afford. They make a joke about it, like, OK I'll give you five anti-inflammatory and you could have the antidepressants. But the cost of prescription drugs and health care is actually still a very big issue especially for blue-collar Obama voters who voted for Trump. And I thought that was pretty interesting.

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, thank you. There are a few reasons why it was very successful. One, ABC did a great job of laying this out. They have been promoting this for over a year and it's been spectacular. The rollout has been very special. And I like having to prep for The Five by watching TV, doesn't get any better than that. I really sweat it all out afternoon. I watched the first half hour and I thought it was accessible to middle-class Americans. Because like you said, they are struggling with the cost of prescription medications. One of the people had to move back in with her parents because she got fired. The father has a gun in the house. And you know it's a stressful kind of lower middle-class background, which has been different, because over the years, you've seen sitcom families grow richer and richer and richer while the average family in America stays the same. So that was nice that not everybody had a $3,000 suit and lived in a penthouse in Manhattan. Also good was they have the gender bending son and this debate over being a surrogate. And usually those topics in network sitcoms are celebrated. And they are normalized. But in this case, people are struggling with it, and they are grappling with it but they are doing it with humor and they are doing it in an open-minded way. And I think that's the reality to 90 percent of the American people. The woman's marching sister with the pink hat, the nasty woman is fantastic. And it is very balanced because this is the only time you have seen the conservative protagonist where she is not mocked on network television. And the sister gives it right back to Roseanne. I thought the jokes were relevant and pretty cutting edge. You have Obamacare jokes, pantsuit jokes, Russian jokes, fake news jokes, even the nonpolitical jokes about the timing were good and the comedy writing is good. But the bottom line I believe is that the message of the show is that people come from different political backgrounds, and you don't have to hate each other. You can talk it out and you don't assume that the other person's intentions are evil. And that's what makes it work."

I think on the show, Kimberly has said why isn't there a late-night talk show for conservatives, right. So here we have a sitcom for conservatives for them to say hey, that's a reflection of our values and who we are. I think it's a very nice representation in this sense. I am not sure most Trump people would be accepting of that song, for example. And I loved the joke about Jill Stein because I know people like that. Really people who say I don't know about Hillary so I voted for Jill Stein. You wasted a vote in North Carolina for Jill Stein? Oh, my god."

And I think it's very interesting that you have a lead in a major comedy show that is conservative, and it works. So maybe the television industry should pay attention from those monster ratings, I think it's fun to watch in terms of how the show progresses along and what kind of rating pattern and history and trajectory it's going to be."

There are 50 people in line to try to get the job you want. And it's just those types of things are interesting. And Jennifer Palmieri who was the Communications Director for Hillary Clinton, she was on the 2:00 show today. And she has a new book out. She talked about Hillary Clinton. The book is not just about why she didn't win. But Roseanne Barr, and one of the parts she says I voted for him because he talked about jobs. And it really does come down to that. If you are looking at those very narrow margins in Wisconsin, Michigan, I think Pennsylvania was gone away, but Michigan and Wisconsin for sure.

The President's approval rating, 42 percent this week has barely budged from 44 percent last week. This isn't a new phenomenon. Bill Clinton's approval ratings remained fairly steady during the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1988 as you see here.

The other thing is President Trump hasn't tweeted about her at all, and I think that has probably helped him.

They really put him out there. And I feel like they might be reelecting Donald Trump by pushing this scandal too much because it's creating rebound sympathy for Melania and for the White House in general. I don't know if that's true yet, but it could happen. But Donald Trump, I think the most Americans are like carnival food. If you are at the fairground and you're about to order something and somebody says you know that's fattening, and you go, I factored that into my decision when I am buying this giant bowl of soft serve ice cream. I understand what I am getting. Two scoops. Because reality TV and tabloids, you know more about Trump's character than the previous six Presidents combined. So you just know this when you factored in, I don't know how it's going to affect him negatively."

But I think that what's interesting to me is, is that when you look at the poll numbers, it's like 56 of Americans believe what Stormy Daniels had to say. And by the way, I was surprised at this, 35 percent say they believe that the threat that she described on 60 Minutes is credible. But what's really striking to me is when you ask people, well, what about the women involved. So as I said, about a high percentage of Americans think Stormy Daniels is telling the truth, not President Trump. But among Republicans, it's 45 percent of Republican women who now believe Stormy Daniels. So they are not necessarily shifting away from Trump, but it does I think some damage to people who believe in the leader of the free world, our country, being an honest, forthcoming, moral person. And I have got to think that erodes. I have to think that's not helpful."

So this guy was brought in and, apparently, was supposed to have cleaned things up. I don't know how effective he was in cleaning that up. The president campaigned on taking care of the veterans and was very proud to sign a new V.A. accountability bill, where it was more easy to fire people who were underperforming. And that's a good thing. But I think there were some travel issues with him. He might have run afoul of the administration on some ethical issues with respect to that. And he had to go. The president is not going to keep some guy at that agency that's not 100 percent behind the veterans and can't afford to allow any sort of perception out there that the president is not taking care of the vets that he so deeply values.

And he also -- I think it's very important for President Trump, and what you see as he heads into the second phase of his presidency, on a personnel level, is that he really wants to have people there that he personally trusts. And he really knows this doctor very well now and trusts him and knows that Dr. Jackson will do a great job taking care of the veterans. And the other thing is, what's really strange, is all these weird rumors about the political appointees at the V.A. trying to usurp the secretary and a lot of the crazy things going on, barricading himself in the office.
