Rahm's getting a lot of political mileage out of this.

And now they're essentially just wish casting conclusions on the Mueller report, so they haven't learned anything. So to believe the theories with that all of them that we just played, one must hold the following that, Bill Barr, a longtime acquaintance of Robert Mueller and a George H. W. Bush Republican, twisted the conclusions to favor Trump in the report. And further, one must believe that Mueller, whose office came out to correct the media on another occasion, has chosen to sit on his hands and let Barr apparently just get away with blatant lying to the public. To answer the conspiracy theorists, we thought, we'd invite some people on who actually understand how these things work. So joining me now is Sol Wisenberg, Former Whitewater Deputy Independent Counsel and Fox News Contributor; Guy Lewis, a former U.S. Attorney who served with Attorney General Barr at the DOJ; and Jon Sale, Former Assistant Special Watergate Prosecutor. OK guys, this big breaking news today was that Barr is going to release the report - I guess, latest mid-April or maybe even earlier.

Now, of course, he said he's going to release about 400 pages. And I believe, contrary to what the montage you played of the Democratic speakers, I believe the report is going to help President Trump, from what I've been able to divine. For example, it's going to show all of the notes and information and evidence they turned over and the witnesses they made available to Bob Mueller on the obstruction and collusion questions.

I got to tell you this is a guy - this is an Attorney General, former Attorney General, current Attorney General, who straight as an arrow. We've worked with him. I've worked with him when we were trying Noriega down here in Miami. That guy as the Attorney General was super engaged. He crossed \"T's\", he dotted \"I's\". He cared deeply about making sure we did things right and proper. He followed the law, he followed the facts. I mean the guy was everything - everything that you could want in an Attorney General. And to suggest - here's what really just is hard for me to believe. To put out a straightforward, no nonsense letter, which you read it, I'm sure you read it and others read it. It was so non-lawyer. And it came out and it said basically, look, let me quote from the Mueller report, \"There is no evidence of collusion\". Not there is weak evidence, the evidence is questionable, some could read it one way, another way. There is no evidence - zero evidence. Having been a prosecutor for a long time, I cannot think of a Grand Jury investigation that I conducted that went on for two years and I concluded at the end of that investigation that there was no evidence - zero evidence."

But 36 hours later we get, as Guy referred to, no collusion. Regarding a statement from the President, let me say something, and I would ask Guy to confirm this. When somebody's conduct is being looked at, whether you want to call them a subject, whatever the lawyer's terminology is, prosecutors conduct every single day thorough investigations, they leave no stone unturned and they conclude their investigation one way or the other. They indict no they don't indict without a statement from the person they're investigating. Rudy Giuliani, I'll disclose he's my friend, but he said on one show a few months ago, \"Although, the President said he had no problem giving them a statement, it would be over Rudy's dead body\". Well, Rudy did a heck of a better job and so did Jay Sekulow then a lot of the critics have been very, very brutal to them.

And if I could point something else out, it's not just - Dowd made an earlier statement that they gave them a lot of evidence. They gave them hundreds of pages of contemporaneous notes from Don McGahn to - I forget the lady's name, I think Ann Donaldson or Annie Donaldson - they gave contemporaneous notes of the President.

But tonight, we've learned that Jussie may still get his day in court. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is demanding that the actor pay the city $130,000 to recoup the cost of that fraudulent investigation. And TMZ reporting that Smollett's team says they will not comply, setting up a showdown in civil court. Joining me now is Fox32 Anchor and Reporter Rafer Weigel. Now he's been on this story from the very beginning. Rafer, from what you're hearing is there any chance that Chicago cops are the Mayor let this case go? RAFER WEIGEL, FOX32 CHICAGO ANCHOR: Oh no, not, absolutely not. I mean, this is - right now you got a look at the theater that Rahm Emanuel is getting out of this. I mean I understand that he's upset with Kim Foxx, but there's a lot of people right now looking at Rahm with a bit of a side eye, because he's really raised his profile right now by beating the drum against Smollett. There is a municipal code in the in the city's bylaws that states that you can sue for expenses into a police investigation and if they don't pay him the three of 130,000 - and that's just for the overtime - that's not for the cost of the investment - then they can sue them for three times that amount. Rahm's getting a lot of political mileage out of this. But it is really fascinating, Laura, when you think about the fact that a case that became so politicized, so polarized both politically, racially, captured the attention of the entire world and somehow it got hijacked into a discussion about corruption - only in the City of Chicago would that happen."

Jussie Smollett feels that he won, and let's be honest, he did win. As the Fraternal Order or the gentleman who you had on earlier, I heard him speaking. Kim Foxx did not just drop the charges, she essentially tried to make this case go away. She sealed the court order and the end the other day they tried to expunge the record and erase it completely. And the only reason that I'm told that that didn't happen is, because in order to do that, they would have to unseal the case record. Meaning, reporters like myself, and our Freedom of Information Act request would then be granted and everybody would see the evidence that police had on Smollett, and they didn't want that. So that's why that's not happening."

What do you expect to happen there?"

I mean, you and I talked on Tuesday and what we saw on Tuesday was uncharted territory. We'll now look at what happened this week with the National District Attorneys Association, The Illinois Prosecutors - the IPBA, also slamming Kim Foxx. I mean, I don't mean slamming - I mean, they sliced and diced and just really took her to task for what she did. This woman has ruined herself politically and professionally and is right now she is political kryptonite. And now, right now, we're still trying to figure out why? We're still scratching our heads. I've talked to a couple of people who covered politics here, longtime journos and people inside City Hall, and right now the thinking is that Kim Foxx may have compromised herself in some way so badly that she had to make this case go away. So whatever it is that she didn't want coming out, was probably - was actually worse than the outcome that happened to her now. And it's hard to imagine there being anything worse than that. That's why I don't think we've heard the last of this. This is an investigation into corruption or potential corruption, I should say."

Well, not the drama we were just talking about, but Empire. Project 21 is condemning this and demanding the NAACP drop the nomination. Co-Chair Horace Cooper went after the group on our show on Wednesday. HORACE COOPER, PROJECT 21 CO-CHAIR: He's proving privilege isn't about your race, it's not about your gender.

The measure passed by just two votes despite intense opposition from activists, physicians, and even Hollywood. The bill would ban abortion after a heartbeat is detected as early as six weeks, often before a woman knows she's pregnant. The ACLU has vowed to challenge the measure should Governor Brian Kemp sign it into law. Vice President Joe Biden accused of inappropriate conduct by Lucy Flores, a former Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Nebraska. Flores says that in 2014 the vice president approached her from behind, put his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slow, long kiss on the back of her head. A Biden spokesman says the former V.P. does not recall what she describes but supports her sharing her recollections of the events. I'm Anita Vogel. Now, let's take you right back to \"The Ingraham Angle.\""

Joining me now with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor, \"New York Times\" bestselling author of the brand-new book, \"Will Wilder, The Amulet of Power.\" All right, Raymond, what's the big fuss about girls wearing leggings and a mom upset at Notre Dame?"

A mother of one of the students at Notre Dame wrote a letter to the editor of the university newspaper and in it, she suggested that young women should rethink wearing leggings, particularly at mass. She says leggings on women are an unforgiving garment, and asks \"I wonder why no one thinks it's strange that the fashion industry has caused women to voluntarily expose their nether regions in this way.\" Now, Laura, there was a fierce reaction on campus."

Not only did the big media fail completely this week, but some say it's as bad as it was with WMD and the Iraq reporting. Amazingly, the week began with the media defending themselves. Let's watch."

How is that for value in speculation? And what about this fat-shaming of the president? I thought fat-shaming was a big no-no on the left. And if that's all they have got left, then I would say the fat lady has sung on this whole Trump-Russia bogus scandal. The opera is over. The good guy won. And these guys ought to be shamed for fat-shaming."

That's the team I want to root for. Now, I know at least one person, Jim Acosta, the objective journalist, Jim Acosta. He probably has bobbleheads of these guys in his office."

      "speaker": "HARSANYI",
      "utterance": "First thing, if anyone had said that about Hillary Clinton or Obama, we would have a national discussion about violence. But secondly, yes, you're right. That's why they are clamoring to see the report. They can't wait to latch on to so redacted part or some sentence to pretend that they were right the whole time. You can't spend two years doing this and simply say, oh, we were wrong and move on. Its' obvious they are all in, and there is no way out."

      "utterance": "As the son of the cop that I am, my dad was a career law enforcement officer, this just makes me angry for all the good cops that are out on the streets of Chicago tonight, which is almost all of them, to take the narcissistic, self-entitled, sociopathic waste of cops' time and the taxpayers' money that Smollett pulled and try to turn it into an indictment of the cops just shows how anti-cop MSNBC's legal analyst really is."
    },

      "speaker": "HARSANYI",
      "utterance": "This is the same thing with Trump and Russia, it's that there's a media that wants to believe things and does. They don't show enough skepticism at the very least, even if you give them the benefit of the doubt."

Because of security concerns, we can't tell you exactly where we are going to be, but I can tell you that we will be bringing you behind-the-scenes footage of what the day-to-day operations are like for the Border Patrol agents who are dealing with this emergency overload at our Southern border. From border crossing interrogations to stash house rates, we are going to bring you the unedited reality of a crisis in action. And we'll also speak to the folks in the community who are facing this head-on, while journalists in New York and politicians in D.C. tell them to accept this as the new normal.
