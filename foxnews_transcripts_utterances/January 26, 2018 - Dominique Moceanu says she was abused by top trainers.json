Sometimes, as Mattie Larson just said there, while adults and fellow athletes were literally in the room with them. So, right now, at Michigan State University where Dr. Nassar also has this awful impact on many athletes, the president there has resigned in disgrace for not following up on the clues. And tonight, the entire USA Gymnastics Board has resigned as requested by the U.S. Olympic Committee for their failures in the situation. This is rocking the sport to its core.

Many of them were or would become Olympic gymnasts. And when it came time for Nassar to face justice, 150 young women came forward to confront him. Their stories were horrifying, heart-rending, powerful. Some of America's best athletes giving painful insight into their worst days. Watch."

Simon issued a statement to survivors that read in part: \"I can never say enough that I am so sorry that a trusted renowned physician was really such an evil, evil person.\" Michigan State Athletic Director, Mark Hollis, also resigned today saying, he was not running away, but running towards comfort, compassion, and understanding for survivors. And now, senators from both parties are calling for a select committee to investigate USA Gymnastics in the U.S. Olympic Committee saying that while some justice has been served, many questions remain about how Nassar was able to continue his abuse for so many years.

So, I collapsed in the gym the year before -- actually, the summer before the Olympics. And I collapsed in the gym and my leg was fractured. So, they grabbed me by the back of my neck and kind of shoved me over to the phone and said, go call your parents, maybe your leg is broken. This such cruelty."

Yes! You nailed it! You're so great. Cheering you on. You know, when you hear that, what goes through you? We're showing everybody a picture of the two of you and a tiny little adorable you looking up into the face of this man, what's going through your mind?"

      "speaker": "MOCEANU",

Obviously now, not anymore, and when I found my voice ten years ago, I chose to not participate in the disgusting behavior that I saw within the organization, and also within this huge gushing of love for the Karolyi's, and this facade they portrayed on television -- a big teddy bear, great, living coach. But behind closed doors, the reality was very different."

They have a sign outside: \"thanks everybody for all the great heirs and all the great memories.\" Do you feel -- Larry Nassar, you are not a victim of Larry Nassar's because you overlapped a little bit, as I understand it. But what do you think the Karolyi's knew and understood about what he was doing to these young athletes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOCEANU",
      "utterance": "Well, the Karolyi's knew what we ate, they knew how much we wait, they knew when we train, they knew who they wanted on the world and Olympic team. And to say that they didn't know absolutely anything is questionable. Obviously, we don't know unless they say what they knew. And it needs to be investigated -- and I'm glad that senators are calling for it as to why this happened. And it happened because it was a culture of psychological abuse going on rampant for 30-plus years, and it allowed the most prolific pedophile in our history and maybe in all of history just for this year a countless number of victims but walk through the walls of the sport. And it's really, really awful, but he went unchecked because the Karolyi's wanted to keep him around. He was, Martha, a doctor because said what she wanted to hear. And when girls were injured, he would kind of pretend to patch them up, but really, I don't know if he ever accurately diagnosed anybody."

And that's why they said, I thought he was the only nice adult in the entire place. That's such classic pedophile luring behavior on his part. You know, and this -- I just want to ask you one last question about what Mattie Larson said. She said he would do these treatments, which I can only -- the only way for me to shed light on what I read today is that it's more like going to a gynecologist than it is going to a physical trainer, OK. He would do this in the presence of other athletes and parents and adults?"

He put a blanket over or a towel over and he would position himself with his back toward the athlete or the parent and go-ahead and subject himself to a certain pleasure.

Now, there is a practice of osteopathy that involves this kind of examination at the consent of the patient for some kinds of back ailments. And this osteopathist say, this has nothing to do with that kind of procedure which is done with consent, which is done an operating room. You know, so, I mean, and that -- this is why the judge looked at him and said don't even -- don't confuse yourself for one second, thinking that what you were doing was any kind of legitimate treatment on these young women who had no consent whatsoever in the situation. But I can't think of another pedophile situation where you have witnesses saying there were adults standing in the room while this was happening. I think this makes their case much more difficult, Rachel."

I think the question for the couple that ran this ranch is how much did they know, who knew about it, and how can they prove, as Mark said, that they were totally aware of what happened? And that's going to be a difficult case. However, you do have dozens and dozens of gymnasts that went to this place who are going to be able to testify because this is going to civil court. There have already been lawsuits over this, as to what they saw, how the ranch was run, and what this couple new at the time?"

There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again. America is the place to do business. So, come to America where you can innovate, create, and build. I believe in America. As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also. But America first does not mean America alone. When the United States grows, so does the world. To be successful, it is not enough to invest in our economy; we must invest in our people. When people are forgotten, the world becomes fractured. Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all. The nation's greatness is more than the sum of its production. The nation's greatness is the sum of its citizens, the values, pride, love, devotion, and character of the people who call that nation home."

I'm glad that no one walked out of this kind of speech, though I saw (INAUDIBLE) for those comments that he made in that meeting. But I think this was a very smart trip to make, especially because there were so many CEOs there, so many businessmen, that he could get the feedback -- and women, I'm sorry -- and feedback about how tax reform is working, and that is kind of the high point of this administration thus far. And we have been seeing those gains, we have seen -- been seeing bonuses for many American workers. So, getting that kind of feedback going into the State of the Union, I think it's critical for the president's personal ego, but also for the nation.

Let's put up what she said. \"We need to decide whether we want to remain the world's pre-eminent power -- a strong, cohesive beacon of democracy. Or if we're content to allow our national autoimmune disorder, like a flesh-eating, to devour our body politics.\" She's referring to what she sees as such sharp divisions in the United States, Guy."

And I think that talking about darkness, I'd be surprised if the State of the Union next week reflects that same sort of darkness because there is so much good news, at least on the economic front. When you're assessing the Trump presidency, you have to take a holistic approach sort of look at each thin individually, and the economy -- and the economic news is just terrific. Overall, jobs, the bonuses from these tax reforms, the IMF boosting the global growth projections because of tax reform. A new poll shows 64 percent of small business owners say that the Trump presidency is helping their businesses. There's a lot of stuff and material for Trump to tout on a very major stage, and I expect him to do exactly that."

New polling shows that people feel that he is so much more divisive as a president than President Obama, for instance, especially along racial lines. So, there's still anxiety out there.

Now it appears that they're were also concerned about being too tough on Hillary Clinton during the bureau's investigation into her email practices. In February 2016, right in the midst of the presidential campaign, Lisa Page texted Strzok, quote, one more thing, she might be our next president. Going on to say, the last thing you need is going in there loaded for bear. You think she's going to remember or care that it was more DOJ than FBI? Strzok replied that he agreed.

Lisa Page response, yeah, that is awful timing. Later adding, quote, it's a real profile in courage since she knows no charges will be brought, which only renews Republican suspicion that top law-enforcement officials knew well ahead of time that Hillary Clinton would not be facing charges.

There was all kinds of discussion about whether or not the president was considering firing Mueller, and should he, and would it be a big mistake if he did that? So, and it appears that their source on this, it says Robert Mueller learned about the episode, the firing -- you know, almost firing episode in recent months as his investigators interviewed current and former senior White House officials about this -- in the midst of their inquiries.

So, it's double, triple hearsay, number one. But number two, I think it calls into question, is the Mueller team actually leaking some of these information out that they gain during their investigation to change the narrative away from the FBI and focus it back on Donald Trump? Listen, I think these are shady tactics that are being used and, frankly, let all the facts come out. Let's let Trump to his interview with Mueller. Let's let the four-page memo come out from the house intelligence committee and see what kind of behavior was going on inside the FBI and the DOJ that I think will expose a lot of political bias and use of bad information for political purposes."

And look, Donald Trump can turn to a camera and call the story fake news even though we and other outlets had confirmed at least parts of it. He cannot do that when Bob Mueller puts him under oath and asks him about it, which he will because this is part of the questioning of the obstruction of justice piece that Bob Mueller is looking at, the firing of Jim Comey, asking for, you know, Mueller to possibly be fired. He's going to have to answer very detailed, very specific questions, and he cannot just use the excuse of fake news. This is a very serious allegation that he is trying to fire the exact people who are investigating him."

And you look at these text messages and you can kind of see where that conclusion might be drawn. However, Marie, if you look back at the basic facts, they didn't fire Mueller. They decided that that was not a wise decision to do, despite, you know, perhaps, the president's desire to make it happen, you know, he says you're right, can't do it."

Phil -- the fact that, Maria, Democrats will say, oh, my gosh, this is some bad act that Donald Trump thought about firing Mr. Mueller. Give me a break. This is a massive whiff on the part of the Democratic Party. Donald Trump didn't collude and they'll stretch and contort any news fact that drives the narrative away from a booming economy, wages going up, bonuses coming out, businesses coming back to America, a secure border, a crushing of ISIS, they can't handle that narrative so they'll grab that straw and report on Donald Trump thought about firing bob Mueller, who cares?

I mean, they've been demanding that DACA eligible people get resident status, 800,000. This more than doubles that number. But this is a two-way street. This is comprehensive immigration reform and the issue of the 25 billion for the wall is nonnegotiable. The end to chain migration and limiting to the immediate family is nonnegotiable. And the merit based immigration is nonnegotiable. Countries all over the world have all three of these programs implemented. But when America wants to do it, somehow it's evil, it's bad, the Democrats rejects it. They do so now at their own peril. My guess is they'll come around very quickly."

And the idea that we can't attach comprehensive immigration reform to this like Barack Obama harped on for eight years, and because suddenly it's President Trump, it's no good. No, we're going to get the funding for the wall to protect us from the drug dealers and to protect us from the gang members that come over. We're going to end chain based migration because that is spun completely out of control. We've lost control of who comes in unless we change it to the immediate family. And merit-based immigration, by the way, I know so many brilliant and talented people who have come from south of the border, highly educated, so the idea that it's going to be just white immigrants is a total false narrative.

As governor, he appropriated $250 million just for New Jersey. Now, that would make it nearly half as much as being spent on the whole country. Can you imagine New Jersey spending half of what the whole nation is spending on the opioid crisis, which means that it's just a pitiful, pitiful story when it comes to the amount of real federal effort and leadership on the part of the president because, frankly, when we had the aids crisis, for example, Martha, we were spending $24 billion a year to tackle that very challenging issue. We were losing 53,000 Americans a year to HIV/aids. This year were losing 64,000, as I mention.

We have a flu shot for the opioid epidemic. It's called short and long acting Buprenorphine. It can be given at any physician's office anywhere in this country. The only thing that's not making this happen is the fact the federal government has not push forward for a proper reimbursement to allow doctors to go ahead and prescribe this. On top of that, we need to treat this like the medical issue it is. The gentleman you spoke to last night, the father, there's not adequate treatment options in this country, whereas if you're trying to get treatment for your loved ones with cancer, or diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, there wouldn't be any problem with that. You have St. Jude Hospital to call up. But where are you going to call when your loved one is dying of an addiction? We're losing over 100,000 Americans when you consider not only overdose but suicide.
