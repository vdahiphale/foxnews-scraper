Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.\" Jason?

I think the White House realizes they needed to walk this back, and that's what you are seeing happening right now. And I think it's the right thing to do. Kim Jong-un basically took the position that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia took, which is these were rogue underlings. I really didn't know anything about it. I've very, very sorry.

So let's start here. Otto Warmbier's parents obviously have had to watch as President Trump has had praise for Kim Jong-un in certain respects, talked about their close relationship, how good of friends that they are and have become. They put a statement saying \"We have been respectful during the summit process. Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.\" Jason? JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: And it's not only their opinion. It's what U.S. intelligence officials have found as well. I think the White House realizes they needed to walk this back, and that's what you are seeing happening right now. And I think it's the right thing to do. Kim Jong-un basically took the position that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia took, which is these were rogue underlings. I really didn't know anything about it. I've very, very sorry. But we all know in countries like North Korea and Saudi Arabia nothing happens without the leadership at the top knowing about it. So they are obviously lying about this."

Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous administration did nothing and he was taken on their watch. Of course, I hold North Korea responsible for Otto's mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain. Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often!\" Chuck, that gets to this question about yes, he is saying this North Korea's fault, but he is not willing to directly attribute knowledge of it to Kim. CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": He never has, actually. Even when he was talking about this in the State of the Union of, I believe it was in 2018 where he said we pledge to honor Otto's memory with American resolve, he only talked about the dictatorship. He's been trying to shield Kim from blame for this all along. The thing that was different this time was he seemed to go an extra step and assert that he wouldn't have wanted to did that because it wouldn't have been to his advantage."

This has been a chronic problem for Donald Trump ever since he declared his candidacy is the way he talks about the human rights abuses of other countries. And he tends to relativize them. He tends to speak of them in morally exculpatory terms. Whether it's the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, strangely enough an old enemy like North Korea, or even suggesting that the United States killed a lot of people too. He is not over that problem."

      "utterance": "And Matthew, he gets a lot of heat also for the Helsinki situation with Putin and saying I believe him when he tells me they didn't interfere in the 2016 election. For him it seems that he's very relational. These relationships with the foreign leaders are the key for him he thinks to eventually being able to get important concessions for the U.S. And it seems his strategy is he's not going to insult them directly because that's how he believes he gets the deal done. MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\": The strategy is personal diplomacy. But I think he found the limits of personal diplomacy in this second summit where he really tried the charm approach, tried to talk up his love of Kim Jong-un, and it still didn't get him the dole. And so as he conducts this attempt to really promote peace in the Korean peninsula, I think we have moved beyond denuclearization. We just want a ratcheting down of tension. He has to keep in mind who Kim is, who the North Korean regime are. And they are the world's most chronic and terrible violators of human rights."

And these investigations are not about really finding anything new. It's about volume. How many can we go with here, keep them running right through the election. That is the goal.

I am not sure impeachment is the Democrats' end game here. I think to the contrary, I think in some ways this is a substitute for impeachment. This is a situation where they have so much to work with, they can keep it going all the way through, as Mr. Stewart said, all the way through 2020."

      "utterance": "Probably. He may not survive the next election. But in the 1980s \"The New Republic\" had a contest for the most boring headline, and the winner was \"Worthwhile Canadian Initiative,\" which appeared in the \"New York Times.\" So it's funny to me that now we have actually exciting headlines from Canada."

    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "I am sorry to disappoint, but I think Justin Trudeau is right. Everything I've read suggests that what he was trying to do was remind this prosecutor that a lot of people's jobs were on the line and that she might consider using prosecutorial discretion with that in mind. He did not enrich himself. There is no evidence that he took anybody's campaign contribution to do this, or that he was doing anything beyond what often happens in government, which is people get together and say what is the best way to handle this? The only supposed benefit he was going to get out of this was the voters in Quebec would be happy. And I am not sure that's such a horrible scandal. To indulge in some Canadian stereotyping here, this is the ultimate Canadian scandal because it's all about what seems to me a violation of decorum."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

      "utterance": "But in Montreal where this company is based and the province Quebec where he is popular. So there could be political consequences to this company being under a criminal investigation. But I will say this -- typically the Canadian press coverage of Justin Trudeau is like the American media's coverage of Barack Obama. It is overwhelmingly positive. So if the Canadian press won't let this go, it leads me to believe that there might be something to this scandal."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "All about the climate change, which is not, according to the polls, a mass appeal issue. But there is of course a relatively large minority who are intensely interested in it, so I guess his idea is if you can get the votes of those people in the Democratic primary you can succeed in jumping to the head of the field."

      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "It's not just name recognition. It's how he really distinguishes himself here as a governor, not really in any of his views or his agenda. That lane, that progressive lane is already chockfull of people. And it won't last long, even him distinguishing himself as a governor if someone like Hickenlooper from Colorado gets int eh race, or if Joe Biden with executive experience comes into the race. So no, I don't -- and back in his home state, he couldn't even get this green agenda passed in the form of a carbon tax. So he is now going to push on the country something he couldn't get passed in Washington, which is not Texas?"
    },

And it's what he wanted without budging an inch on his nuclear program. My loser of the week is Representative Elijah Cummings for these circus- like hearings with Michael Cohen which really told us nothing new. And I hope that if he is going to continue down this road he comes up with more substance."

      "utterance": "My winner is the Warmbier family who respectfully but forcefully spoke up about the president's statement on their son and forced him to climb down or walk it back. My loser of the week is the prime minister of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu, who was already in a lot of trouble for reelection because he had formed an alliance with the remnants of the ultra-right racist party in Israel, and now he is on notice that he might be indicted on various fraud charges. His reelection is going to be difficult."
