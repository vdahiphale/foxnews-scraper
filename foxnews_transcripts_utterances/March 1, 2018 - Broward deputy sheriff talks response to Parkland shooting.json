In fact, I think, it's demonstrably true that both things are true. If you look at his first year of accomplishments, it really is quite remarkable -- first comprehensive tax reform in 30 years, the biggest regulatory roll back in American history, the economy booming, you've got foreign policy, he's driven ISIS out of its caliphate. He has reversed Obama's withdrawal from Afghanistan, he enforced Obama's red line in Syria -- it was something he wouldn't do. He got Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. I mean, the accomplishments are there. But at the same time, I think it's also obvious that there's chaos in the White House. We're going to be on our fourth White House communications director in one year. And we may be on our third National Security adviser in one year. So, if he is doing this much, with this much chaos, imagine if there was no chaos how much he would accomplish."

And I don't think they can, and I think while jokes aside, Marc is saying that imagine if he got his act together, there's no indication they would be. I mean, Marc himself worked the beginning of the Bush administration, it is not uncommon for the first year of a White House or for an administration to have growing pains. That's not what this is. And this is also not governing by chaos, this is unintended chaos. And I don't think that that is serving the president or the American people well."

And we're going to have just an absolute wall.

You know, if you watch the faces in the room yesterday, at while I'll admit was an extraordinary event where the president said many things that I think Americans on the whole want to see in terms of gun control, they won't happen because the Republican Party, his own party."

Look, I'd like to be sitting here in a month and of all the things I'm wrong about to say that the president actually achieved gun control measures that he's talked about. I think that's a very, very tall order. And I think, you know, you saying who do we trust on these numbers. I think we have to trust our own eyes. And there's another element here. There's an element of not just what you are doing, but how you are doing it. And I think, you know, most Americans, including most Republicans don't like seeing the president acting out on Twitter every day. Most Americans, including most Republicans, don't like that his children and that his in-laws work in the White House. And, again, I think he's his worst -- he's his own worst enemy, and that's not a style of governing. And I think if you look at it."

So, coming in now to join us, Bill Bennett who worked for both the Reagan Administration and also George H.W. Bush's administration, he's the Host of 'The Bill Bennett' podcast and a Fox News Contributor. So, Bill, you heard the conversation and really, it's like there are parallel universes going on. And people in the White House will admit that, you know, there are folks who work there who are burnt out. I don't think that's completely unusual that there is a lot of turnover. But I don't think that anybody anticipated that a Donald Trump White House was going to a sort of, you know, calm environment, you know, given what we know about the way he works."

      "speaker": "BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND HOST OF THE BILL BENNETT PODCAST",
      "utterance": "Yes, well up until the time of the campaign, the most famous utterance of Donald Trump was you're fired. So, we're seeing a fair amount of that going on. You know, there are subtleties here. The poet E.E. Cummings says, a great order can be a disorder -- think of that smooth, friendly, elegant, charming Obama Administration for eight years not getting a lot done and getting a lot of negativity done in the country. Meanwhile, Cummings says, a disorder can create an order. As you pointed out, Martha, as you suggested maybe there's some, you know, some point to this -- if not chaos, to this conflict. And it's -- it has a creative aspect to it. But, we need to take it seriously. He can't have all the people who are most loyal to him leaving. But, there is no question. I love the line from The Wall Street Journal today that said: we disagree with Donald Trump in many things, except for policy. Well, that's a pretty big deal when you're a president."

Bret went down a list of all these things and said, do you agree with this, do you agree with that, and yes, I do, I do, I do. But I don't like the way that he does things. When you talk about the people who have left the White House, Anthony Scaramucci who was one of the -- you know, one of the group who served as communications director, he was there for a very short time, lashing out. We're seeing a lot of lashing out from people who are no longer getting the access that they wanted. Just watch this.

      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "Yes, and Anthony Scaramucci comes from a culture where, you know, you settle your debts, and settle your debts in public. I think what he's proud to say often is I plunge the knife into you, but I plunge it into your chest. So, you know, there's that going on, too. But, let's look at the bottom line. I think the bottom line is the accomplishments. Marc ticked them off better than I could, a lot, both domestically and foreign policy. The judges, ISIS, the economy and so on, all these regulations. And the federal court bench is so important. But you can't isolate yourself forever, and you have to have a team. The amazing thing it seems to me, Martha, hasn't been commented on, is he's doing this under staffed. Not only are people leaving, they don't have enough people at the White House, the cabinet departments are understaffed -- partly the fault of the Democrats. But, if as we heard earlier, you imagine what they could do with order, imagine what they could do with a full team."

And I think that some of that is the struggle that we see going on with people who were long time loyalists, you know, who are now, perhaps, you know, leaving, and people who are better for governing -- not mentioning Hope Hicks there because I think she was pretty well thought of all around. Go ahead, Bill."

As you hear the story about Hope Hicks, they show one picture after another of Hope Hicks. It's like a model's portfolio. The woman is absolutely stunning. Absolutely gorgeous. You can't comment on that, I guess, these days, but everyone knows it to be true. Actually, your colleague Ainsley commented on it.

So, is this more bluster than substance or are we on the verge of a new dynamic in the latest version of the cold war? Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry live in Washington tonight with the story.

But this is still deadly serious, because I've spoken to some top U.S. military officials who say he's, in fact, building up his nuclear capabilities and vowing that these weapons will be immune from interception, so there's basically no stopping them. Putin talking about closing in on development of a new and improved kind of nuclear weapon that allegedly can override American missile defenses. Warning Russia has successfully tested out actual nuclear propulsion engines that enable under water drones paired up with nuclear missiles to travel great distances one top military analyst I spoke to said what's really happening here is Putin does not have the money to build up both conventional weapons and nuclear weapons. So, he's picking the more lethal one while also trying to exploit the fact that during the eight years of President Obama, he did not invest enough in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, something President Trump has been vowing to reverse. And in fact, U.S. officials told our own Jennifer Griffin today that Putin is worried about the Pentagon's plans to develop two new tactical nuclear weapons. Listen."

In fact, it was little noticed, but today as well, the Trump State Department revealed it's approving a big military arms sale to Ukraine worth $47 million. So, it can defend itself from Russia, that includes 210 javelin anti-tank missiles -- a reversal of the Obama administration's decision to not send heavy arms and only provide non- lethal aid to Ukraine.

      "speaker": "JOHN BOLTON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.",
      "utterance": "Well, let's try and separate the hype from the reality. It is a fact that under Obama, American military spending declined dramatically -- 1.5 trillion less than the Bush projections if you exclude the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is huge. And so, the Trump budget, while it's sizeable increase doesn't come close to addressing over the long term, the gap that Obama created, that's number one. Number two, what Putin has talked about here with these new missiles, nuclear powered missile, cruise missiles that fly very low over the surface, the water and the land, and sort of pop up at the target. They're not ballistic missiles which follow ballistic missile trajectory. It's something they've been working on for a long time. So, are we. How operational they are? I don't know. Is it a week before the Russian election? Sure. Does Vladimir Putin have the slightest doubt who's going to win that? He knows how to fix elections when he wants to. I think this is a further effort to see whether the Trump administration will push back. And I think it needs to, I think there needs to be a strategic response to this, to help give confidence to our friends in Europe and around the world, that we're not going to but the up with this kind of Russian effort. I don't think it's a new cold war, but I do think it's Vladimir Putin trying to reassert Russian predominance in Eastern Europe, Eastern and Central Europe in the space of the former Soviet Union."

But the slow roll of the whole military effort, especially during the Obama administration allowed a lot of ISIS fighters in leadership to exfiltrate out of Syria and Iraq to go to Libya, to go to Somali, to go to Afghanistan, Pakistan. And I think the terrorist threat remains. And the Middle East, while we're on the subject is in chaos. And for example, the latest news that North Korea is selling Syria chemical weapons, it goes with the reactor North Korea built in Syria that Israel destroyed in 2007. So, if you want a projection of the future in the Middle East once North Korea gets nuclear weapons, sales to Iran, sales to any would be nuclear state.

Take a look at these dispatch logs obtained by Fox News. At 2:32 p.m., a full 11 minutes after the shooting began, and police still didn't know where Nikolas Cruz was. They were commanded to form a perimeter, rather than go into the school. And by the time the SWAT team did decide to enter, Cruz was already a few minutes away from the building buying a drink at a Subway restaurant, as you remember he had found his way out with other students as they were exiting the building, terrified for their lives.

If we did something wrong, we did something wrong. If we did not do anything wrong, then that's great, also.

Because of the political posturing that we have going on right now in Broward County, we've forgotten about the real issue and we failed to give proper recognition to some of the people that risked their lives that day going into the building. For example, the Broward County SWAT team, the Broward County crime scene and the canine unit and the Coral Springs police departments that selflessly went inside not knowing if the shooter was inside or not. Those guys have been the forgotten topic in this. And Mr. Cruz is suddenly not the topic of the conversation. It's about whether or not something did or did not happen.

Former Columbine principal, Frank DeAngelis, and Columbine teacher, Paula Reed, have offered honest, and at times, hard-to-here insight. In a USA Today piece, D'Angelo says, quote, the smell of the food in the cafeteria can trigger memories for some students. A fire alarm sound certainly will. So might sirens or the sound of a slamming door, even camouflage clothes, or the sight of police cars can frighten kids. Frank DeAngelis and Paula Reed, join me now. Good to hear from both of you. You know too well and firsthand what this feels like. I thought that your assessment, Frank, was so potent in terms of the triggers that exist for these kids. What advice do you have for them?"

And one of the things, you know, Paula and I were having a conversation before coming on air, and we wish that we would have had the help that we're able to give now and the people from Sandy Hook and some of the other places because, for us, it was a lot of trial and error. And I know when doors slammed or even a car back firing, and I remember the first day back over Chatfield High School because we couldn't go into Columbine, parents had put up an arch way of balloons and balloons started popping and kids started diving on the ground. Stuff that we never thought about that would re-traumatize these kids. The difficult things they're all in different places and depending on where they were that day, those triggers could be more intense or less intense for others. And it was a learning process for all of us."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Paula, you said -- or I think it was you or another teacher who was quoted in the piece said that the kids -- their brains are traumatized. And it's hard for a traumatized brain to learn. So how do you sort of have, you know, build that transition for these kids to get them back to the point where they can accept learning again in an open way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAULA REED, COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not so much an acceptance issue as it is that trauma actually does rewire the brain and actually makes changes in the brain that take a while to heal from. And so, what you kind of have to do for quite a while is you play school. You make sure it looks like school, it feels like school. But new learning is not something that can happen right away. They do have to get to the point where they feel safe again. And they can focus on their studies. And it's very possible that they won't be fully back to that place even by the end of the year, given the time of the year right now. So, it's a matter of making it feel normal again. But, for example, instead of having my students do all of their reading because your powers of concentration really get shot in trauma, I read out loud to them and they followed along. And that way they had both, you know, the hearing and the vision and it made it go faster. It's also sort of comforting and, you know -- even in a high school level when you've gone through something like this, there's worse things than feeling, kind of, back in second grade in terms of just the emotional comfort."

Frank, you know, in terms of going forward and, you know, when they came back there were all these people there, all the police there, everybody cheering them on. They had horses there and animals and everything they could think of to make them feel comfortable. But all that goes away in time and then what do you recommend?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Well, what I told them and I have been in contact with Principle Thompson and cabinet -- superintendent cabinet, and I said it's a marathon and not a sprint. And I think the thing that's so frustrating at times is they're going to have some great days and thinking gosh, everything is getting back to where it was and then something happens. A fire alarm. There may be a threat. And all of a sudden they're re- traumatizing and they're saying, oh, my gosh, we're right back to where we were. And I said this is part of that healing process that there's going to be ups and downs and everything is going to be there. It's going to be a long time. And one of things people will ask is when is it going to get back to normal. You know, it's been a month. Why are you still concerned about this? We had to redefine what normal is. This is a lifelong process. You know, these scars they say will heal with time. But the scars that they get will be there with us forever and it will be for them."

There is no remedy for what 260 girls and women allege happened to them, but the federal government and two states are now demanding information and solutions so that it won't happen again. Last night, three American gymnasts, Jamie Dantzscher, Jeanette Antolin and Jordyn Wieber met with two senators on Capitol Hill and detailed the abuse they suffered at the hands of Dr. Larry Nassar. Afterwards, Republican, Jerry Moran, and Democrat, Richard Blumenthal, said, quoting, we are hopeful for renewed commitment from all Olympic organizations to eradicate all sexual abuse and other misconduct and to raise a generation of athletes who feel safe in competing in the sports they love. The house oversight committee is also investigating and a primary focus of that congressional inquiry is the Karolyi ranch in Texas. Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the Texas rangers to investigate the sexual abuse allegations there. But so far, the rangers are not releasing details. And the Karolyi's will only say they had no knowledge of the allegation beforehand. But the Karolyi's have been named in a lawsuit brought by former national team gymnast, Maddie Larson, who says careless and neglectful adults made the ranch the perfect environment for abusers. And this week, a bipartisan group of Michigan lawmakers unveiled a package of bills to fight sexual abuse. Remember, Larry Nassar is a former member of Michigan state sports medicine staff. The legislation includes extending the statute of limitations on abuse claims and increasing penalties for possessing child pornography. Olympic gold-medalist, Jordyn Wieber, was at the rollout.

It's all these people for so many years putting reputation and money and medals over the protection of athletes.

I mean, Twitter, unfortunately gets people all the way from the beginning -- from the top down. A lot of desire, a lot of independence to say what they think. But some of it is just downright mean."

And the different ways that people grieve, that people react, that people want to extend or express goodwill or good wishes. But I think we're forgetting that there are a lot of people in this country when they say you're in my thoughts and prayers they really mean it. I mean, you look at somebody like Chris Pratt. Faith is a big part of his life. He's been vocal about it on social media before in interviews. And Kevin Smith even agreed, hey, we shouldn't be fighting over this. I appreciate all the prayers. I want all the help and prayers that I can get. So, I think we got to remember that when somebody says I'm praying for you, they really may be doing it and faith is an important part of their life and that's a way of taking action."

And, you know, people don't need to have these inside awful comments chiming in. It's just a bad environment in that regard. Quick question, one the movies that is expected to be up in the running for best picture, Three Billboards, which I saw last weekend, is getting a lot of backlash. Let's just play this little quick clip, and then you can tell everybody what the controversy is."

      "utterance": "Yeah, you know, Martha, right now, I think the conversation is this movie addresses sexism, a strong female lead, very well but not necessarily racism. And perhaps at the end of the movie a lot of people feel that it doesn't redeem culture in terms of having it being a teachable moment and how wrestling with these issues. And I think Hollywood is continuing to decide what art is. Is it an escape? Is it just entertainment? Or is it something that changes culture that effects change in culture? That is something that Hollywood has wrestled with I think for a long, long time. You know, voting fir the Oscars is over. It's just a couple of days, and so we will see on Sunday what they decide and if they're paying attention to this conversation."
