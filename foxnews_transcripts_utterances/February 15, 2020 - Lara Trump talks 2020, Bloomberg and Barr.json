      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro live tonight in the Sunshine State. Thanks so much for being with us. And thank you for making \"Justice\" No. 1 again last weekend, over three million viewers. We hit it big time for the whole weekend. Number one and viewers. We have a big show on deck tonight, Pam Bondi from the President's legal team is here. So is Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli. Fox News contributor, Lisa Boothe will join me as well and a little later, I'll talk with Laura Trump from the Trump 2020 team. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And a special treat tonight, the Daytona 500. It is tomorrow when I spent today at the legendary speedway hanging out with fans, a few drivers and even talking -- and even taking a spin in the pace car. I'll show you all the preparations for the race tomorrow, and a special guest appearance from the most powerful man in the land. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first My Open: if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As the Democratic clown car literally packed with B-list candidates: Bernie, Biden, Buttigieg and Bloomberg bumbles along with clowns tripping over their clown shoes to out liberal, out progressive and out socialize each other, the rest of us watch curiously to see who the winner will be. And as these Democratic primaries continue, understand that you are looking at the most extreme leftist agenda America has ever witnessed. So you need to start worrying. In fact, you need to be afraid. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These people don't care about you or law and order. I'll say it again. These people don't care about you, your safety, civil tranquility, innocent Americans or law and order, because if they did, they would support the police, law enforcement, ICE, Border Patrol, the military, and all the agencies designed to protect the safety of the American citizenry. But no, these leftists openly defy the law and protect those who are guilty of violating it. As a result, areas of crime are being created than endanger innocent Americans in sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We're now beginning to see how the left's reliance on identity politics, which focuses on race, gender, class and sexual orientation supersedes the issue of guilt or innocence, and instead seeks to protect the guilty and punish the innocent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, just this week in New York, a 92-year-old grandmother was raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant set free by New York City officials who defied Federal authorities who sought custody and detention of that illegal individual. But this is nothing new. We've seen it in San Francisco, Virginia and across this country, where mayors and governors decide that illegals who are criminals should not be handed over to ICE for deportation, but instead be allowed to roam freely among us with whatever attendant harm they may inflict upon us. But folks, it will only get worse if a Democrat gets elected into the White House. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So what does this have to do with the Democratic primaries? Everything. Those who are seeking to be Commander-in-Chief are part of this constructionist, ignore the law mentality. Bernie Sanders is an out and out socialist who calls America a racist society from top to bottom. And he believes that everyone should be able to vote, even felons who are in prison. He simply does not care about law and order. Now, Pete Buttigieg, a mayor of some town in Indiana, has proven over and over again that he simply doesn't know or understand anything about law and order. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Michael Bloomberg is sorry for what he said when he talked about law and order and still can't figure out what he meant when he talked about law and order. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Joe Biden, well, he still can't figure out whether law and order is a requirement or a television show. So these political clowns don't care that Americans overwhelmingly support enforcement of the law. So why wouldn't the left? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's simple. Their goal is power. They get that power when illegals vote because they know they've lost the vote of law abiding Americans, the ones that support the Constitution, the foundation of our laws. The leftists, on the other hand, prefer to subjugate the laws of the land, even if it means sacrificing the rest of us at their altar of political correctness and identity politics. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They know that if they give illegals driver's licenses, which they can then use as a point of identification to register to vote, they get another voter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But you might not even need that. There are politicians interested in having illegals, just go vote, and the latest leftist suicide pact with crime continues with the so-called \"bail reform.\" Now, it may sound great, but I'm here to tell you it's a nightmare. These radicals believe the imposition of bail is simply unfair, unconstitutional, and so they decided it is unjust and have turned into a simple get-out-of- jail free pass, but they are wrong. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Constitution recognizes the legality of the imposition of bail. The Eighth Amendment simply says that it must not be excessive. But folks, it's not bail reform. It's let them loose. If they come back, great; and if they don't or commit crimes, and victimize others while they're out, well, so be it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now as you can see, from just one day in New York City -- one day, the front pages of two major newspapers reflect what appears to be a growing crime epidemic because of the liberal nonsense Khumbaya BS where a bank robber who had already robbed five banks was let out on bail to then go out and rob two more banks. And the other headline where a career criminal would -- get this -- 138 arrests was again free to commit five additional crimes. Now both of them should have been in jail pending trial. These were public safety emergencies. Yes. The purpose of bail is to ensure the defendants return to court, I know that. No bail with someone though who is a serial offender and a danger to the community sends a message, go for it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If we give you no bail, we're telling you, you're free to go out and reoffend. So should serial pedophiles, the ones who prefer to have sex with children be let out on bail to simply re-offend? I don't think so and I don't think you think so either. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But these criminal justice issues highlight the radical difference between the right and the left, and how they view your safety. The left has a history of allowing crime to run rampant. Just look at these 10 cities with the highest violent crime rates in the country. They are all run by Democratic mayors. Coincidence? I think not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, take a look at the next chart with the 10 cities with the highest number of homicides in the country. Every one of those cities has a Democrat as a mayor. So the next time you watch for the outcome of a Democratic primary, ask yourselves if you want a country that reflects the policies of these leftists on a national level where the rights of the criminal are sacrosanct, and the rights of the victim are simply non-existent. Where victims are ignored, and where criminals are coddled as if they're violated and not the violators. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If that's what you want, then by all means, vote for the Democrat. But keep your eye on the bleeding heart socialists who don't give a damn about the rules, the weak leaders who find excuses for the criminalization by the offenders. Go right ahead. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But as I said, you need to be afraid. You need to be very, very afraid. And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine. And here with reaction to my open and more, special adviser to the President and former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi joins me now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right, Pam, you know, as the former Attorney General and an Assistant DA as well, you're very familiar with the issue of bail and what is happening in New York and is being mimicked around the country -- it is the concept of bail and the requirement that someone stay in jail if they don't make bail is unconstitutional and unfair. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as a result, people are being free to reoffend. And in fact, some of them aren't even coming back. What do you think can be done about this? And is this something that you had to deal with when you were Attorney General, Pam?",

Joe Biden, obviously has had a lot of gaffes, obviously, has a lot of ground that he would need to make up to even have a hope and a chance at making anything out of this. But I don't think he really connects with people, and it felt almost to me like it many times.

      "speaker": "As the Democratic clown car literally packed with B-list candidates",
      "utterance": "Bernie, Biden, Buttigieg and Bloomberg bumbles along with clowns tripping over their clown shoes to out liberal, out progressive and out socialize each other, the rest of us watch curiously to see who the winner will be. And as these Democratic primaries continue, understand that you are looking at the most extreme leftist agenda America has ever witnessed. So you need to start worrying. In fact, you need to be afraid. These people don't care about you or law and order. I'll say it again. These people don't care about you, your safety, civil tranquility, innocent Americans or law and order, because if they did, they would support the police, law enforcement, ICE, Border Patrol, the military, and all the agencies designed to protect the safety of the American citizenry. But no, these leftists openly defy the law and protect those who are guilty of violating it. As a result, areas of crime are being created than endanger innocent Americans in sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. We're now beginning to see how the left's reliance on identity politics, which focuses on race, gender, class and sexual orientation supersedes the issue of guilt or innocence, and instead seeks to protect the guilty and punish the innocent. Now, just this week in New York, a 92-year-old grandmother was raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant set free by New York City officials who defied Federal authorities who sought custody and detention of that illegal individual. But this is nothing new. We've seen it in San Francisco, Virginia and across this country, where mayors and governors decide that illegals who are criminals should not be handed over to ICE for deportation, but instead be allowed to roam freely among us with whatever attendant harm they may inflict upon us. But folks, it will only get worse if a Democrat gets elected into the White House. So what does this have to do with the Democratic primaries? Everything. Those who are seeking to be Commander-in-Chief are part of this constructionist, ignore the law mentality. Bernie Sanders is an out and out socialist who calls America a racist society from top to bottom. And he believes that everyone should be able to vote, even felons who are in prison. He simply does not care about law and order. Now, Pete Buttigieg, a mayor of some town in Indiana, has proven over and over again that he simply doesn't know or understand anything about law and order. Michael Bloomberg is sorry for what he said when he talked about law and order and still can't figure out what he meant when he talked about law and order. And Joe Biden, well, he still can't figure out whether law and order is a requirement or a television show. So these political clowns don't care that Americans overwhelmingly support enforcement of the law. So why wouldn't the left? It's simple. Their goal is power. They get that power when illegals vote because they know they've lost the vote of law abiding Americans, the ones that support the Constitution, the foundation of our laws. The leftists, on the other hand, prefer to subjugate the laws of the land, even if it means sacrificing the rest of us at their altar of political correctness and identity politics. They know that if they give illegals driver's licenses, which they can then use as a point of identification to register to vote, they get another voter. But you might not even need that. There are politicians interested in having illegals, just go vote, and the latest leftist suicide pact with crime continues with the so-called \"bail reform.\" Now, it may sound great, but I'm here to tell you it's a nightmare. These radicals believe the imposition of bail is simply unfair, unconstitutional, and so they decided it is unjust and have turned into a simple get-out-of- jail free pass, but they are wrong. The Constitution recognizes the legality of the imposition of bail. The Eighth Amendment simply says that it must not be excessive. But folks, it's not bail reform. It's let them loose. If they come back, great; and if they don't or commit crimes, and victimize others while they're out, well, so be it. Now as you can see, from just one day in New York City -- one day, the front pages of two major newspapers reflect what appears to be a growing crime epidemic because of the liberal nonsense Khumbaya BS where a bank robber who had already robbed five banks was let out on bail to then go out and rob two more banks. And the other headline where a career criminal would -- get this -- 138 arrests was again free to commit five additional crimes. Now both of them should have been in jail pending trial. These were public safety emergencies. Yes. The purpose of bail is to ensure the defendants return to court, I know that. No bail with someone though who is a serial offender and a danger to the community sends a message, go for it. If we give you no bail, we're telling you, you're free to go out and reoffend. So should serial pedophiles, the ones who prefer to have sex with children be let out on bail to simply re-offend? I don't think so and I don't think you think so either. But these criminal justice issues highlight the radical difference between the right and the left, and how they view your safety. The left has a history of allowing crime to run rampant. Just look at these 10 cities with the highest violent crime rates in the country. They are all run by Democratic mayors. Coincidence? I think not. Now, take a look at the next chart with the 10 cities with the highest number of homicides in the country. Every one of those cities has a Democrat as a mayor. So the next time you watch for the outcome of a Democratic primary, ask yourselves if you want a country that reflects the policies of these leftists on a national level where the rights of the criminal are sacrosanct, and the rights of the victim are simply non-existent. Where victims are ignored, and where criminals are coddled as if they're violated and not the violators. If that's what you want, then by all means, vote for the Democrat. But keep your eye on the bleeding heart socialists who don't give a damn about the rules, the weak leaders who find excuses for the criminalization by the offenders. Go right ahead. But as I said, you need to be afraid. You need to be very, very afraid. And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine. And here with reaction to my open and more, special adviser to the President and former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi joins me now. All right, Pam, you know, as the former Attorney General and an Assistant DA as well, you're very familiar with the issue of bail and what is happening in New York and is being mimicked around the country -- it is the concept of bail and the requirement that someone stay in jail if they don't make bail is unconstitutional and unfair. And as a result, people are being free to reoffend. And in fact, some of them aren't even coming back. What do you think can be done about this? And is this something that you had to deal with when you were Attorney General, Pam?"

      "utterance": "Well, when I was a career prosecutor, and when I was Attorney General, thank goodness, Judge Jeanine, we had great judges like you, who would look at the facts that you're supposed to look at. If someone is arrested, you have to look at what you said. If they're a flight risk -- and somebody with 138 prior arrests? Really? They are a flight risk. You have to look if there's a victim involved. If they could threaten or harm the victim. There are many factors that you have to look at. If they're going to flee -- many, many things. And so that's why it's so important and you the number one thing is, if they're a danger to our community. This isn't political. It should be about whether we can keep our citizens safe, our police officers safe on the streets and whether someone is going to come back to court. That's why bail bond is imposed."

They're now loosening it up. And instead of saying if you've got -- if you're likely to kill someone, as opposed to giving them an order protection, like we just witnessed in New York, MS-13 gang members who killed someone and then the prosecutor had to give the name of the witness who was going to testify against those defendants, he ends up dead. And you know, so it is all going against the law enforcement and the victims. And I honestly believe that it's the criminals and it's the liberals who feel sorry for them who are pushing this agenda."

      "speaker": "BONDI",

And not only that, just the citizens of our community who could be hurt and are great men and women in law enforcement. Look at everything President Trump has done, given everything to our military, to our police officers, everything to strengthen our police and our military, yet, they're trying to undermine that by letting criminals -- people charged with crimes -- out of jail without bond, the letting them just walk free. And again, it's to ensure that they arrive back in court, but it's also to protect our communities. And that's so very important. And that's why we have to have good judges in place, and we've got to have tough, strict laws, and they have to be enforced just like you said."

But there was something that really has got a lot of people frustrated and wondering, and that is the decision by the Department of Justice to not prosecute Andrew McCabe who was found by the Inspector General to have a falsely testified or sworn under oath, and on the other side -- and a decision made to not prosecute him. And on the other side, Roger Stone, who that same Department of Justice had made a decision to recommend a sentencing of seven to nine years for lying and various other charges. I know you can't comment on the prosecution side of it. But is there any question in your mind that seven to nine years for Roger Stone is too much and then not going after McCabe when even the Deputy Attorney General said yes, we give you permission to go after him. Is there still a Deep State in the Justice Department?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, Jeanine, to start with McCabe. What do we know from the Horowitz report? He is a disgrace to the F.B.I. He gave numerous false statements under oath and he was part of the Comey-McCabe, who with a fake steel dossier, pushed it forward despite pushback even from the C.I.A. And you know, Inspector Horowitz was very clear. The man is a disgrace, and he is just -- he's not a good person. And the F.B.I. is very lucky to be rid of him and our country is lucky to be rid of him. Whether the decision to prosecute, I can't comment on that, but then you go to someone like Roger Stone. You know, do you remember when they raided Roger Stone's house? They treated him like he was a mass murderer in the middle of the night that they went into his house with guns drawn. Roger could have had a heart attack. Look, he got his wife was home. That man was not a threat to lives, to society but they arrested him that way and then they gave him an insulated guideline."

    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "Well, and the Justice Department and Bill Barr stepped in and did the right thing that the Justice Department said Roger Stone does not need to be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. That that was absurd. They were going above the guidelines on him and that should not happen and said the Justice Department did the right thing there. But yes, you know, when you get all these disproportionate sentences, especially someone with Roger Stone's background, it's very sad for our country, Judge."

Here to discuss that as well as the state of law and order in this country when it comes to sanctuary cities and illegal immigration is Acting Deputy Secretary of the Homeland Security Department, as well as Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli. All right, Ken. All right, so we've got Andrew Cuomo, who decides that illegals should get driver's licenses. So the President says, okay, you want to do that, then I need to have access to that information, if I'm going to allow New Yorkers to access Global Entry to get into this country quicker, because I need to know who these people are. And Cuomo says, you're not getting any of this information. So New Yorkers freak out. I was one of them because I travel a lot and they meet on Thursday, anything happen?"

The key was that they cut off the Department of Homeland Security from having access from their DMV databases, which are absolutely critical to conducting law enforcement and national security work for the Department of Homeland Security. And it's amazing that one of the three states like mine, Virginia, that was hit on 9/11 is walking backwards on this kind of critical information sharing, but that's exactly what they're doing for their political virtue signaling."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUCCINELLI",
      "utterance": "Well, there are a number of things in that database, Judge. There's first of all, simply confirming if you have a driver's license, whether this is real, and this is actually the identification -- the identity of the person in front of you if you're a law enforcement officer, or if you're looking up witnesses in an investigation or if you come up on a vehicle knowing who owns that vehicle, and are there any warrants, or is it a stolen vehicle? The most dangerous thing law enforcement does and our law enforcement agents do this, too, is come up on a vehicle they've had to pull over because there's been a violation of law, or they're looking for something associated with that vehicle. It's a very dangerous moment for a law enforcement officer. And finally, all the updated criminal information warrants temporary restraining orders on people who've committed domestic violence, all sorts of things are contained in that database and they obviously tell us whether this person A, can be a trusted traveler, for the Trusted Traveler Programs that you referenced and B, whether they are who they say they are, and C, whether they're dangerous to that law enforcement officer. There's an awful lot that comes through that database."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And you know, the concept of this along with sanctuary cities, where you've got the liberals on left and I talked about this my open, not allowing law enforcement to access information so that you guys can protect the safety of innocent Americans is absolutely stunning to me. And I understand that the President has just recently decided to take some of the Border Patrol off of the border and to start sending them into the cities to assist in some investigations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUCCINELLI",
      "utterance": "So a number of different Federal law enforcement officers you'll see supporting ICE in their efforts to do removals and to enforce immigration laws of various kinds and C.B.P., obviously, partners with ICE in many other areas is the one you've read about most recently. They're not the only ones who do that work, and it's actually not all that unusual. It got a lot of news this week. But we're looking for any ways we can because it is a priority for the President and this White House to expand our ability to enforce immigration law."

And the American Medical Association found that Federal state Immigration Insurance Program $2 billion a year in emergency treatment not including $1.24 billion in infant delivery expenses. But why doesn't the left talk about this? Why is it always we've got to let them all in. We've got to let them all in. We can't afford it."

There are human costs. There all of these crimes in sanctuary cities, and it isn't a question of the rate of crime. These are crimes that are 100 percent preventable. You heard from my friend, Pam Bondi there. We were both A.G.s together. She was a prosecutor before that. These are people who shouldn't even have to be taken off the street because they shouldn't even be in this country. And for every single one of those that the left is trying to protect and defend, there are crime victims harmed by those people, and that's who we prioritize, and President Trump emphatically prioritizes protecting those crime victims."

Bernie Sanders is more likely to choose Hillary Clinton than Mike Bloomberg is -- and I don't think Hillary Clinton's interested in being anybody's second banana. So I think that's a story that is just somebody trying to get some clicks on the internet and it's never going to happen."

      "utterance": "I've not heard the second bananas. I like that one. I might use that in the future. Here's the thing. Mike Bloomberg is a manufactured candidate. It is a mirage right now. He is the only Democratic candidate who has not been tested, he's not had to go on a debate stage. He has been standing behind, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars of paid advertising, contrived by consultants and pollsters and people presenting an image of him. But it's not real. We haven't seen who Mike Bloomberg really is on a debate stage actually being tested, actually having to be vulnerable and exposed in front of the voters and I think once they see Mike Bloomberg on the stage squared up with the rest of the candidates, if he ends up on a debate stage, they're going to be turned off for him. They're not going to be interested in him."

So Donald Trump at a tweet calls Mike Bloomberg, \"Mini Mike is a five foot four massive dead energy.\" And then of course, Bloomberg responds and calls Donald Trump a carnival barking clown, which is kind of amazing, Chris. I mean, you know, it seems to me that Bloomberg is the guy who doesn't have the fortitude should we call it to even show up on a debate stage, but was able to buy himself a third term as New York City Mayor. If anyone should have been in New York City Mayor for third term, it should have been Rudy Giuliani after 9/11, but I digress. And now he's trying to buy himself into the Democratic Party when the Democrats don't want him to do this. What do you think?"

So, Donald Trump should really try to back off the criticism of him so that maybe if he loses this primary, he stays out of the general election. If I was Donald Trump, I would stop criticizing Mike Bloomberg right now."

He spent half of what Hillary Clinton spent and still won because he was a dynamic candidate with a compelling message. Mike Bloomberg has to spend hundreds of millions of dollars and we don't even know what that's going to get him in terms of delegates, because again, he has not competed at any of these contests yet. So we will see on March 3rd. We will see on Super Tuesday what he is able to do with that money.

Joe Biden, obviously has had a lot of gaffes, obviously, has a lot of ground that he would need to make up to even have a hope and a chance at making anything out of this.

You can't deny the results of this President. And that's why we've been so confident from well, before any of these people got into the campaign on the Democratic side that Donald Trump would win again in 2020. That said, we leave nothing to chance. So we do have to evaluate if you're running against socialist Bernie Sanders, and what that would mean and how you contrast that for the people of this country, compared to Donald Trump and all the great prosperity we've seen under him versus Pete Buttigieg if that does happen to continue to be a trend that we see him on the rise, who really has had very little experience, he is very young."

That's the problem that I think a lot of these folks have. Their only message and their only platform is, I can beat President Donald Trump. And if that is all you're running on, I don't think you're going to have the American people get behind you. I don't think the American people are going to rally behind a socialist whenever you start describing what that would mean and what that would look like for this country and the rest of the field by all accounts is really running to beat Donald Trump. So that is their problem, and it's really actually to our advantage, because we can say, well, you know what, they have nothing to run on but look at what Donald Trump has actually done."

You can have all the money in the world, but if you're not a good candidate, it doesn't matter. In 2016, Hillary Clinton had so much more money than the Trump campaign, yet, we see who won that election. I always find it interesting for the very far left base of that party who is anti-capitalism, who doesn't like millionaires. This is an old rich white guy who happens to be a billionaire who is literally buying his way into possibly the Democratic nomination. That is not going to sit very well with that group of people on the left."
