      "sentences": "And welcome to HANNITY. And tonight, we are broadcasting. We are in Music City, Nashville, Tennessee, and the site of the Republican Governors Association and their spring conference. Now, for the entire hour, we're going to have an open discussion with six of the nation's top governors about the state of our country. We will take on immigration. We will talk about the Southern border, taxes, law and order. We will also be talking about what works in the states and what I have been telling everybody and been listing, as, well, what does it mean to be a conservative? What are the policies that work for you, the American people, the conservative movement? Me, it's simple. It's liberty. It is freedom. It is capitalism, our Constitution, including our First and Second Amendment, low taxes, limited government regulation, choice for our kids in school. Oh, we do need integrity in elections. That would be voter I.D. laws to begin with, signature verification, partisan observers that can observe, and, of course, secure borders. We believe in free market solutions for health care, while protecting people with preexisting conditions. We believe in law and order. Without law and order, guess what? You can't pursue happiness. Free and fair trade, election integrity, constitutionalists on the bench, and peace through strength. For me, that about sums it up. And, hopefully, the governors will talk about what matters and what's been working in their states. Now, we will tell you what we're against as well -- cancel culture, defunding, dismantling the police, the so-called bail reform, where you get arrested, they let you out the same day without paying a dime, high regulations, draconian COVID-19 shutdowns that are still affecting so many people in the country, the Democratic Party's unholy alliance with the teachers union. And allow me to spell out a few of the basic, undeniable facts that even, well, if sippy cup is awake, which he is likely not, might he even be able to understand? The late -- the fastest growing state in America, by percentage, is the state of Utah. The fastest growing state by sheer numbers is the state of Texas. The fastest growing region in the U.S. is the South. When the pandemic hit millions of Americans, they flocked to Florida. And, meanwhile, New York, California, Illinois, they all lost seats in the 2020 census, while states like Texas and Florida, North Carolina, they all gained seats. Freedom, individualism, safety, security, key issues related to your prosperity. If, Republicans, you want to take back power in Washington, you want to stop this power grab that we all talk about, the America First, Make America Great Agenda, I think, needs to be articulated by anybody and everybody running for office. So, without further ado, joining us now for the hour, we have New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, soon-to-be-called senator, if he would take my recommendation, but, apparently, he's resistant.",

We -- in fact, in South Dakota, we didn't even define what an essential business was because according to the oath I took to the South Dakota Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, I didn't believe I had the authority to tell anybody that their business wasn't essential. I told my people I would trust them and that I was going to let them use personal responsibility to take care of their families but keep their doors open, provide for their employees and their customers. And the people of South Dakota, you know, appreciated it. We never issued shelter in place, didn't mandate any masks or anything. And today. we have the fastest growing GDP in the fourth quarter at 9.9 percent. In the country, our unemployment's 2.8 percent. We have the least amount of jobs lost, businesses closed, hours lost, wages lost from any employee in the country. And so what we did is we used conservative principles that we all talk about all the time. We've talked about them for years. We did them. And we're proving that it worked. And so that's really the story that I think we need to tell about 2020, is that leadership has consequences. And you just look at Democrat states and what happened to families and businesses there. You look at Republican states and how they're growing and they're thriving, and what all these leaders up here did, how it works for the American people. So we talk about statistics and facts all the time, but those stories are going to be powerful when we change the majority in Washington, D.C. and we change who's in the White House.",

They did the full school year, finished it today from the very beginning and every single parent from the beginning had the right to send their kids to school in person. I think there's obviously a lot of other policies that really mattered. Obviously, we didn't. We prevented COVID patients from being sent to nursing homes. We created COVID only nursing facilities to protect the most vulnerable. I think that that mattered. But I can tell you locking kids out of school for over a year, that's going to have ramifications for our country and those states. It's not going to be days, weeks, months. It's going to be years.

We were able to access a certain amount, a large number of tests so that we could not only keep the processing plants open but we could ensure the employees that they were working in a safe environment. Not only did we provide the PPE, but we were able to test. Those that were positive were quarantined. And we were able to keep our processing plants up and going and I mean, and not back up hog production for our producers. And we were looking at some horrific numbers because the processing plants were being impacted from COVID. And so we hit it head-on. We made testing available.

Now what is the future of the Republican agenda? How can red states fight back against the -- well, Biden power grab, far left new green deal socialist agenda, and stand up against the dangerous effort of defunding and dismantling police? In answer to these questions and much more, we turned to our Republican governors right here in Nashville. I won't bother you anymore, Governor Sununu, that's an inside joke, but in all seriousness here, all of can say to the people in your states that you have lowered taxes. That you have ended burdens from regulation. That you created business-friendly environments for everybody. And we are seeing the benefits of your policies in place. Now all of a sudden, you're fiscally responsible, you balance your budgets, you fund your pensions, and then in comes Joe Biden with his blue state bailout and he has given California and Gavin Newsom, that has a $75 billion surplus, $40 billion taxpayer dollars from your states. If I was a governor I might be a little ticked off about that. Governor Sununu?",

Secretary Yellen said we would have a bump in inflation. We are on the verge of hyperinflation, supply chain issues across this country. And there is no greater tax on the American people and worse tax than inflation because every low-income family has to pay for that, 30 percent more for that gallon of gas or a piece of wood to do a repair on their or a gallon of milk, whatever it is. So it's their policies to help low income and all that are just reversed. It's all political. And what happens is they end up hurting those they claim to be helping the most.",

We are in Music City, Nashville, Tennessee, and the site of the Republican Governors Association and their spring conference. Now, for the entire hour, we're going to have an open discussion with six of the nation's top governors about the state of our country. We will take on immigration. We will talk about the Southern border, taxes, law and order. We will also be talking about what works in the states and what I have been telling everybody and been listing, as, well, what does it mean to be a conservative? What are the policies that work for you, the American people, the conservative movement? Me, it's simple. It's liberty. It is freedom. It is capitalism, our Constitution, including our First and Second Amendment, low taxes, limited government regulation, choice for our kids in school. Oh, we do need integrity in elections. That would be voter I.D. laws to begin with, signature verification, partisan observers that can observe, and, of course, secure borders. We believe in free market solutions for health care, while protecting people with preexisting conditions. We believe in law and order. Without law and order, guess what? You can't pursue happiness. Free and fair trade, election integrity, constitutionalists on the bench, and peace through strength. For me, that about sums it up. And, hopefully, the governors will talk about what matters and what's been working in their states. Now, we will tell you what we're against as well -- cancel culture, defunding, dismantling the police, the so-called bail reform, where you get arrested, they let you out the same day without paying a dime, high regulations, draconian COVID-19 shutdowns that are still affecting so many people in the country, the Democratic Party's unholy alliance with the teachers union. And allow me to spell out a few of the basic, undeniable facts that even, well, if sippy cup is awake, which he is likely not, might he even be able to understand? The late -- the fastest growing state in America, by percentage, is the state of Utah. The fastest growing state by sheer numbers is the state of Texas. The fastest growing region in the U.S. is the South. When the pandemic hit millions of Americans, they flocked to Florida. And, meanwhile, New York, California, Illinois, they all lost seats in the 2020 census, while states like Texas and Florida, North Carolina, they all gained seats. Freedom, individualism, safety, security, key issues related to your prosperity. If, Republicans, you want to take back power in Washington, you want to stop this power grab that we all talk about, the America First, Make America Great Agenda, I think, needs to be articulated by anybody and everybody running for office. So, without further ado, joining us now for the hour, we have New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, soon-to-be-called senator, if he would take my recommendation, but, apparently, he's resistant."

We -- in fact, in South Dakota, we didn't even define what an essential business was because according to the oath I took to the South Dakota Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, I didn't believe I had the authority to tell anybody that their business wasn't essential. I told my people I would trust them and that I was going to let them use personal responsibility to take care of their families but keep their doors open, provide for their employees and their customers. And the people of South Dakota, you know, appreciated it. We never issued shelter in place, didn't mandate any masks or anything. And today. we have the fastest growing GDP in the fourth quarter at 9.9 percent. In the country, our unemployment's 2.8 percent. We have the least amount of jobs lost, businesses closed, hours lost, wages lost from any employee in the country. And so what we did is we used conservative principles that we all talk about all the time. We've talked about them for years. We did them. And we're proving that it worked. And so that's really the story that I think we need to tell about 2020, is that leadership has consequences. And you just look at Democrat states and what happened to families and businesses there. You look at Republican states and how they're growing and they're thriving, and what all these leaders up here did, how it works for the American people. So we talk about statistics and facts all the time, but those stories are going to be powerful when we change the majority in Washington, D.C. and we change who's in the White House."

They did the full school year, finished it today from the very beginning and every single parent from the beginning had the right to send their kids to school in person. I think there's obviously a lot of other policies that really mattered. Obviously, we didn't. We prevented COVID patients from being sent to nursing homes. We created COVID only nursing facilities to protect the most vulnerable. I think that that mattered. But I can tell you locking kids out of school for over a year, that's going to have ramifications for our country and those states. It's not going to be days, weeks, months. It's going to be years.

I think Charlie Baker did a very good job, frankly, trying to deal the best he could with what was going on with the death rate in Boston. And we're kind of a tax-free suburb of that.

And so we were able to go in and do surveillance testing. We were able to access a certain amount, a large number of tests so that we could not only keep the processing plants open but we could ensure the employees that they were working in a safe environment. Not only did we provide the PPE, but we were able to test. Those that were positive were quarantined. And we were able to keep our processing plants up and going and I mean, and not back up hog production for our producers. And we were looking at some horrific numbers because the processing plants were being impacted from COVID. And so we hit it head-on. We made testing available.

And all of us were going to err on the side of liberty and limited government. It was going to be a light touch. We were going to listen, inform our citizens, trust our citizens. I believe Arizonans have common sense. And, Sean, it was a tough year. I mean, there's no winner in a COVID year. But you want to do the right thing so that your state can navigate through it and come out of it healthier and stronger on the other side. That's where Arizona is.

And the problem is people from New York, and New Jersey, and California, and Michigan, they're leaving their states and they're going to your states.

They want to damage me. So, they just kept saying it was bad. And even though the facts didn't say it, like literally last April, they're saying Florida is doing worse than New York. New York was like 10 times worse. And so, I think what it did is the people that buy those phony narratives for these media, they probably aren't coming to Florida. But most people see through it. But the people that see through it, they think like us. And so, I think a lot of these people are coming. I think they are registering as Republicans overwhelming. And I also have come across a lot of people who, quite frankly, were Democrats. The lockdowns turned them into Republicans, because they say, I cannot fathom. I was -- people say, I was a Democrat because of education and I'm in California and they're locking my kids out of school. I come to Florida, they're in school. People are free. People are happy. So, I think this whole process has caused some people to reevaluate some of their prior commitments.

What was interesting is I also ran on South Dakota being an example to the nation. And what's happened during this pandemic, the pandemic has allowed us to tell our story. The thousands of people are moving to our state. And when you ask them, they say that they're moving there because they want to live somewhere that the government respects them. They want to live somewhere they can be free. South Dakota wasn't on their radar a year ago to move to, but it is now. And they wanted to live where they can have a quality of life and they'd be respected. We did one week of a national advertising campaign to law enforcement officers and told them, if you want to live somewhere where you're supported, where people respect you and will help you take care of your families and be successful, come to South Dakota.

Now what is the future of the Republican agenda? How can red states fight back against the -- well, Biden power grab, far left new green deal socialist agenda, and stand up against the dangerous effort of defunding and dismantling police? In answer to these questions and much more, we turned to our Republican governors right here in Nashville. I won't bother you anymore, Governor Sununu, that's an inside joke, but in all seriousness here, all of can say to the people in your states that you have lowered taxes. That you have ended burdens from regulation. That you created business-friendly environments for everybody. And we are seeing the benefits of your policies in place. Now all of a sudden, you're fiscally responsible, you balance your budgets, you fund your pensions, and then in comes Joe Biden with his blue state bailout and he has given California and Gavin Newsom, that has a $75 billion surplus, $40 billion taxpayer dollars from your states. If I was a governor I might be a little ticked off about that. Governor Sununu?"

And what you're seeing is, again, governors, especially Republican governors are the last line of defense against not a socialist agenda but true socialism. That's actually what's happening with all the executive orders. And we've seen it. When you talk about the economy, I think one of the biggest things that is hitting America is inflation. Secretary Yellen said we would have a bump in inflation. We are on the verge of hyperinflation, supply chain issues across this country. And there is no greater tax on the American people and worse tax than inflation because every low-income family has to pay for that, 30 percent more for that gallon of gas or a piece of wood to do a repair on their or a gallon of milk, whatever it is. So it's their policies to help low income and all that are just reversed. It's all political. And what happens is they end up hurting those they claim to be helping the most."

I think he has forgotten that, you know, I think he thinks we're just starting COVID, that we're not on the end of it. The emergency is over and the amount of money that's coming into our states is just unconscionable. And in fact, I sent back $95 million. They sent $95 to the state of Iowa to help us get our kids back in the classroom. And I said our kids have been in the classroom since August. This is ridiculous. They're sitting on $700 million right now to address testing and vaccines and to help address COVID issues. And so I said, here, you can take the $95 million back. We don't need it.

Was it the right thing to do? Yes. Because red states that elect fiscally- responsible politicians, they're being punished. They didn't get the same benefit that I was getting.

But, in all seriousness, we have laws about immigration. Those laws are not being obeyed. And, actually, I would argue that Joe Biden's administration is aiding and abetting lawbreaking and incentivizing it.

I can communicate, however, with the people who run those programs in my state. And they do receive state dollars.
