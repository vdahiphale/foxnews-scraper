And he thinks that like by calling other people stupid, would he have the balls for example to call 44 percent of Black stupid, right? He thinks that everybody is this amorphous, like red hat wearing group of people who live out in the sticks. When in fact, there is a whole bunch of categories of people who are not vaccinated. One of them are people that are young and very fit and think that they can risk the virus. I know a few of those people. You have women who are either pregnant or want to get pregnant and they're -- they have an extra layer of concern that other people don't have. You know blacks that are superstitious of any medical intervention from the government because, hey, Tuskegee. You have people that are immunocompromised. These are all -- there are a whole sort of people. If you broke this all down, you would find that it's not just a bunch of stupid people. So -- I think there's a reason why this is happening because there is a sensible alternative which is letting people get vaxxed at the pace they decide to without bullying them, which is kind of what's happening. If people just like have conversations like I talked about getting the vaccine with people who haven't, like tussle with skeptics, but I don't like -- I don't -- I respect him. That's life, and I listen to the reasons. And a lot of the reasons do make sense. Like if they are worried about childbearing, that's fine. But they chose this easy target because it allows them to create another team sport oppositional kind of thing for a cable news and for Joe Biden so that you will not look at the other problem. So if you -- if -- what's my - - what did I used to say? If America fights among themselves, the people in power escape our collective wrath. That's what they're doing. If we were unified in anything, then we could focus on crime, homelessness, drug addiction, the border --",

Points are awarded to families based on the numbers of people are that are in each family or in each household. It's a pretty -- it's a great program, especially as folks are returning.

And he thinks that like by calling other people stupid, would he have the balls for example to call 44 percent of Black stupid, right? He thinks that everybody is this amorphous, like red hat wearing group of people who live out in the sticks. When in fact, there is a whole bunch of categories of people who are not vaccinated. One of them are people that are young and very fit and think that they can risk the virus. I know a few of those people. You have women who are either pregnant or want to get pregnant and they're -- they have an extra layer of concern that other people don't have. You know blacks that are superstitious of any medical intervention from the government because, hey, Tuskegee. You have people that are immunocompromised. These are all -- there are a whole sort of people. If you broke this all down, you would find that it's not just a bunch of stupid people. So -- I think there's a reason why this is happening because there is a sensible alternative which is letting people get vaxxed at the pace they decide to without bullying them, which is kind of what's happening. If people just like have conversations like I talked about getting the vaccine with people who haven't, like tussle with skeptics, but I don't like -- I don't -- I respect him. That's life, and I listen to the reasons. And a lot of the reasons do make sense. Like if they are worried about childbearing, that's fine. But they chose this easy target because it allows them to create another team sport oppositional kind of thing for a cable news and for Joe Biden so that you will not look at the other problem. So if you -- if -- what's my - - what did I used to say? If America fights among themselves, the people in power escape our collective wrath. That's what they're doing. If we were unified in anything, then we could focus on crime, homelessness, drug addiction, the border --"

Look, I am here for the mandates, but I don't think you can have a mandate and then shame folks who don't get the vaccine. I think you have to take that approach that doctors take when you walk in to their office and you say you're unvaccinated.

Ten million people get the jab and the next day, 25 of them get in car accidents. Is that the correlation or causation? No, you have to look and see, find another group of 10 million and see what the rate of car accidents are among them. You might find that people gotten fewer car accidents.

And essentially what happened, September 19, 2016, almost five years ago to the day, Mr. Sussmann met with the FBI general counsel to meet with him and allege that then-candidate Donald Trump had connections to Russia. Negative connections to Russia. What Mr. Sussmann did not disclose according to Special Counsel John Durham is that not only did he worked for the DNC in 2016. He also did some work for the Hillary Clinton campaign. That is the crux of this story. He makes his first appearance before a federal judge tomorrow.
