Her flight landed around 1.30 in the morning and we see her deplaning at 2.09 wearing a light-colored sweater and black backpack. She then picked up her brown suitcase at baggage claim. Nothing seemed unusual. Police say the 23-year-old nursing student didn't talk to anyone, didn't call anyone. A half-hour later she took a Lyft not to her apartment, but to a suburban park miles away where at three in the morning she met up with someone who is waiting in another car. The Lyft driver told detectives Mackenzie seem fine and so he went back to work and police say he is not a suspect.

She had answered a newspaper ad for her first baby sitting job. Her family says the teen told them she was to be picked up at a nearby intersection once she arrived.

Adding that both have a long paper trail of votes and quotes for opponents to sift through for contradictions. But he says there is one important distinction. Biden is running in a deep and talented field of nearly two dozen contenders. Clinton had only one, self-avowed socialist to compete with, and she still had more trouble than anyone ever expected. That backdrop as Elizabeth Warren gets glowing multi-page stories in the New York Times and the Boston Globe touting her as a brilliant high school debater and quoting college professors who say that she was the best student they ever taught. Warren's tax the wealthy, free college for all brand is on the rise in several new national polls. And tellingly, a new straw poll from moveon.org puts her as number one among progressive voters.

And if Joe Biden runs the same race and becomes a Democratic nominee, and then, actually campaigns in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, a place where he will be much better received than a Hillary would have been, he will be the next president of the United States.

And he's renting a house that's worth as much as $5 million. And again, I don't really see anything wrong with that. But it makes for problems when you go back into politics, and you try and run as this guy who's appealing to the lunch-pail crowd as he says. And he's someone in the story he admitted today that he has never actually had a real job, nor has he cashed a paycheck. I mean, those are direct quotes from Joe Biden. So, again, nothing wrong with that. But when politicians go from public life to private life, and they go and make a lot of money, and then, they come back into politics, it's problematic. And this is before, Martha, we've had a full look at his taxes and his financial disclosure this time around.

Tonight, there is a showdown over the 4-1/2 billion emergency funding bill on the House, with some Democrats defecting, saying that they want more of a big picture. We expect that the vote on that bill will start to get underway tonight. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among the Democrats who have voiced opposition to this bill. She says, \"I'm not interested in making sure that caged children are getting warmer burritos. I'm trying to make sure they're not getting caged in the first place.\" She also today, from her folks pushed out pictures of herself from a one year ago, weeping at the border. You can see her there (INAUDIBLE), very upset at the border. So, while politician's posture and fight over whether it is like a concentration camp at these facilities, the American people rightly want their government to come up perhaps with some kind of solution.

And I'm just about concluded she's more famous than wise. And I trust her judgment on this issue about like I trust Jussie Smollett police report. I mean she says that the United States of America is intentionally running a concentration camp on the border. I would suggest she visit the Holocaust Museum to find out what a real concentration camp is. We do have very crowded facilities. There's a reason for that. Our Department of Homeland Security is running out of money. They don't have any more money. And for the longest time, my Democratic friends have refused to give them more money. Now we've got a bill moving in the Senate. I don't know what's going to happen to the bill in the House.

Now, today, he's saying this in a tweet. He says Iran's very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry and Obama.

I think that -- I feel bad for the people of Iran but I think the government in Iran is a fragile, exhausted, theocracy run by the Ayatollah, a very evil man. He's evil but he's not stupid. I don't think that he is going to spill American blood. If he does, we'll have to evaluate things and reciprocate. But we just need to hang on. We've got the Ayatollah down, now we need to choke him. And the deal that Secretary of State Kerry and President Obama made got us into this mess. They tried to separate the nuclear issue from the terrorism issue. They got a delay in Iran building a nuclear weapon but they didn't do anything about Iran's terrorism. Now the Ayatollah says if you don't agree with his version Islam, he hates you and you have to die. And that's why he's hurt people in Iraq, in Yemen, in Syria, in Lebanon, in France, in Bulgaria, in Denmark, and he's going to keep doing it until we make him stop.

That's why God made judges. If the accuser feels strongly enough, she'll bring them lawsuit and a neutral arbiter will decide. But just because you're accused of something doesn't mean you're guilty and doesn't mean you're not entitled to due process. I understand that the accuser is also coming out with a book and frankly I think that hurts their credibility.

It's terrific and she's just a huge distraction from all that, you know. And I've quite frankly, I don't understand why the U.S. coaches are tolerating it. In 2016, when the U.S. when the World Cup of Hockey was happening, U.S. coach John Tortorella said, any player who won't -- who sits on the bench for the national anthem is going to sit for the rest of the game. And I think that's what the U.S. coaches should be telling her. It's -- first of all, she's not protesting Donald Trump because she started doing this in September 2016 before he was president she started protesting the anthem. But even if it was -- even if she was protesting Donald Trump, she's not playing the Trump administration, she's playing for America. She's wearing the uniform of the United States. It's one thing to do that when you're a professional player playing for the Seattle professional women's soccer team, it's another thing when you're wearing team -- the Team USA Jersey. How can you protest the flag and wear it at the same time? It's utter hypocrisy."

And I thought it was very interesting because the President made a comment -- I'm not going to go through the whole thing, but he basically said, you know, it has to with economics and he talked about the great stars on the men's team.

Surveillance video tracked Mackenzie from the moment she got back to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles, where she had attended her grandmother's funeral, to the time she left the airport in a rideshare. Her flight landed around 1.30 in the morning and we see her deplaning at 2.09 wearing a light-colored sweater and black backpack. She then picked up her brown suitcase at baggage claim. Nothing seemed unusual. Police say the 23-year-old nursing student didn't talk to anyone, didn't call anyone. A half-hour later she took a Lyft not to her apartment, but to a suburban park miles away where at three in the morning she met up with someone who is waiting in another car. The Lyft driver told detectives Mackenzie seem fine and so he went back to work and police say he is not a suspect.

Statewide we've had some really good candidates. Gosh, like a lot personally. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, Bakari Sellers who is a commentator on another cable show. They both ran for statewide office, didn't come close in South Carolina. So, I'm glad they were here. I hope they spent a lot of money. Republicans are not going to win California and the Democrats are not going to win South Carolina."

Whether or not, you know, that dynamic is also probably unlikely to change. But obviously, their main -- their main reason for wanting to be there is they need to put in a very strong showing in South Carolina to be the viable Democratic presidential nominee. And it's interesting to look back at the Hillary Clinton president of then candidate Obama race, he won -- he was behind dramatically in South Carolina heading into the primary process. But then he won Iowa, he won New Hampshire, and he ended up winning South Carolina and then winning the nomination. Hillary Clinton did the same thing. It's a very important state to do well in for these folks."

It's important in the primary just like it's important in the Republican primary. But I'd be willing to bet you, Martha, unless it's a nontraditional nominee on the Democrat side, they are not coming back to South Carolina after they win the nomination. They just don't have -- they don't have a chance in 2020. The only way for Democrat to win is if the Republican Party is fractured. That's how we lost our state -- last statewide race. Jim Rex won superintendent of education because Republicans were fractured on the other side. They're not fractured behind President Trump. The opposition is solid, but his support is, too. So, it's not in play. I'm happy they're here. I actually hope the Democrat nominee will come up. Republican nominees will go to states that we are not going to win because that stands now. There are only 10 states that they need to bother to campaign then."

But Joe Biden is at 41 percent in South Carolina. Sanders at 13, Elizabeth Warren at 12, Buttigieg at eight and a half, Harris at eight, Cory Booker who is really trying to, you know, sort of get into this race is 4.5 percent there.

And they think that he may be more electable than some of the other names you called. But he's a familiar face, and he's been to the state a lot, whereas the mayor and some of the others, this may be their first visit. I don't see anybody catching Joe Biden but a traditional Democrat nominee is not going to win in South Carolina. It would require a nontraditional nominee, someone like Tulsi Gabbard."

The question for investigators in a case that never closed is what happened that morning 45 years ago when Margaret took a bus from Burlington City, New Jersey in the Philadelphia suburbs to Mount Holly. She had answered a newspaper ad for her first baby sitting job. Her family says the teen told them she was to be picked up at a nearby intersection once she arrived. Witnesses told police they saw a girl matching her description get off that bus. The Fox family then received two ransom notes demanding money in exchange for the return of their daughter. After that it was a phone call, part of which was recorded by authorities. Here it is once again."
