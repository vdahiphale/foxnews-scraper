And tonight we've got two presidents in the middle of it all, battling it out in a blitz to win voter support. On the left side of your screen, that's where in moments we are going to see President Obama in Georgia. He is campaigning for gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. This is a very hot race. One we're watching very closely. That's going to happen in a moment. Then, on the right-hand side of your screen, another huge race, this one in Indianapolis as President Trump makes stop number two of the day. In Indianapolis, he's going to be there in the Senator Joe Donnelly and Mike Braun race. He's on the Braun side, of course, he is the Republican there. And he was in as I said, West Virginia, earlier this morning. So, good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, live in Washington, D.C. tonight.

Very strong economy, which should really in many people's minds be the main story here. But the battle over this caravan and the bruising rhetoric that surrounds it is cutting both ways with voters as some members of the caravan have now found attorneys in the United States to help them sue the White House for entry to America. Geraldo Rivera on that in just a moment. Plus, Howie Kurtz with his analysis of brand-new polls that show who the American people actually blame for stoking the flames in all of this?

It was filed on behalf of six Honduran migrants and their children who are part of the caravan now making its way toward the U.S. border. The lawsuit is asking the court to declare the president's policies unconstitutional. The president says, he will send up to 15,000 U.S. troops to the border, several hundred of which are already on the ground. And Mr. Trump, says undocumented migrants would be held at the border, many in tent cities. Here's how the president explained it to Laura Ingraham. Watch."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We're going to put tents up all over the place. We're not going to build structures and spend all of this -- you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. We're going to have tents, they're going to be very nice. And they're going to wait, and if they don't get asylum they get out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "The president also says that asylum seekers would be blocked from claiming asylum if they're caught crossing the border anywhere except legal points of entry. Current law says asylum seekers can make a claim anywhere in the United States. Immigrant's rights activists argue that holding migrants in tent cities violates the Flores Act, which dictates how long and in what conditions the federal government can detain children. This summer a federal judge rejected an administration request to modify the Flores Act. Those who filed the lawsuit also claim, the president's actions are nothing but a racist political ploy. But the president is not backing down, in fact, it appears he is doubling down. At a rally this afternoon in West Virginia, Mr. Trump said, he won't have caravan after caravan of unvetted illegal immigrants flooding into the U.S. The president, said Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, no caravans. Martha."

      "speaker": "RIVERA",
      "utterance": "First, Martha, let me just tell you where I am. I'm at the University of Arizona, my alma mater. I'm 60 miles from the Mexican border here. In a state where there is an absolute heated contentious race, a battle for Jeff Flake's soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat. You've got two candidates who are fighting, both of them are pro -- you know, strict border enforcement. But one-third of Arizona's population is Latino. So, it does -- it's the fourth largest Latino population anywhere in the country. Davis-Monthan, the big air base just five miles from where I'm sitting right now is one of the military bases that will be used -- one of the 14 frontier bases that will be used for President Trump's deployment of the -- of the troops. As I understand, not to your specific question, Martha, as I understand the lawsuit, what the filers are worried about -- what they are suing the government for is to ensure that, that caravan when it reaches the border, that those people are if they appear as the president has required them at a legal port of entry --"

What happens when they request asylum, then, the due process of the United States comes into play, and they are required to be given a hearing before an immigration judge. What I would like -- and now the some of the stuff in the hurry. What I would like is rather than the president sending troops to the border, which I think President Obama did it, George W. Bush did it, to no effect, meaning, full effect. What I would like to see is a mobilization of immigration judges to make sure that those people once they request asylum are given a speedy hearing. Not the six to eight-month wait that the president has complained about, but something measured rather in days. Martha."

And I think they are going to need an army of immigration attorneys because of the Flores rule, they're going to have a small window to process these people in. Because as the president said, they're not going to release them. They will catch them, and then, they will hold them. And if they have legitimate asylum claims which we know a very small percentage of the group generally has once they go through the process, they have -- that's in my mind, the White House's biggest jam right now. Because they've got a time clock that will tick on that as soon as it begins. How do you think they're going to handle that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVERA",

That's not these, they've got to be, for instance, the gangs killed my husband and they forced my daughter into prostitution, we had to get -- you know, there are -- there are legitimate reasons coming from -- you know, this hotbed of insecurity in Latin America. But the main thing here coming back to this race between Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema. To -- you know, very highly regarded congresspeople. Both vying for Jeff Flake's open seat. They are both kind of tough on immigration, but the notion of using the military, I think is something that gives people pause. And I do believe that that's why President Trump in this last -- you know, rally -- you know, bonanza weekend, before the election. Rally bonanza across the country, he is not coming here to Arizona where ordinarily, you would expect him to come. I think he -- even the president is afraid that here, he could tip this delicate balance now between the Democrat and the Republican, separated by less than half of percentage point. Martha."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

You know, either you give me the wall and we fund the wall, or I'm going to have to have -- you know, a wall created by United States military. Because we all know that the places where people sneak in are between the areas that the Border Patrol is able to cover. So, he's trying to block those gaps and -- you know, it's going to be fascinating really that she had this place up."

And roughly half the country, 47percent, blames the news media for encouraging politically motivated violence. But the question from the ABC reporter was only about that blame Trump part. So, he was punching back. And so now, we have this sort of spectacle of each side blaming the other. I tend to blame the perpetrators in these situations. But the media very rarely, except with this poll, pause to consider their own role in spreading devices. And as you saw in those clips from other networks, that's all the president is fear-mongering, the president is race-baiting, the president is tearing this country apart. A lot of people out there think we are complicit as well."

And I think that people do respond to that, you know. They say, wait a minute. No, that's not we're talking about. And they can feel that they're sometimes being kind of bulldozed into thinking of it in those terms. And I think they do react negatively to that at times."

He is using immigration to rile up his base and all that, and they come out and say some commentators some journalists, race-baiting and it's inflammatory, and all of that. But the way in which it's covered is also divisive. And what the message that the press is sending by putting all the onus on President Trump, is that a lot of millions of Americans saying, they don't care very much about the very real problems created by illegal immigration. They just want to use it as a battering rehab against the president. At the same time, the president's rhetoric has gotten pretty hot. Sometimes uncomfortably hot."

Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is now investigating two false claims about Judge Kavanaugh during that whole -- you know, brouhaha. And we remember that at the time, there were a lot of Democratic Senators who were saying -- you know, there's all these other claims, we're getting other phone calls that are coming in, and told we investigate every one of these -- you know, this is not a legitimate vote that we're taking. Let me put up one of the sort of findings of this investigation that was released today. This is a woman named, Ms. Munro-Leighton, who claimed to be the author of an anonymous allegation regarding Justice Kavanaugh, originally sent to Senator Harris. When questioned by the committee investigators, she admitted that she had fabricated the claim, and she confessed to the committee investigators that she just wanted to get attention. It was a tactic, and that it was just a ploy."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "This is a really serious matter. And I remember when there was a white-hot debate over Christine Blasey Ford versus Brett Kavanaugh, and a lot of people took Christine Blasey Ford's allegations seriously, though they were never corroborated. But then, with some of these other women jumped in, including Julie Swetnick, who's their subject the first referral from Senator Grassley. I think it muddied the waters because their claims were outlandish, didn't have any backup whatsoever, and now we have the second woman who had been anonymous saying, yes, I made it up. Which sort of plays into what the critics of the -- of the people who are going after Judge Kavanaugh, who were saying, which is you can't necessarily believe anybody who comes out of the woodwork without evidence."

So in this heavily Hispanic district, Salazar initially went after the president in this tweet saying this. President Trump, our Constitution is sacred. Birthright citizenship is protected and you cannot change that by executive order. But now says that the 14th Amendment should \"be reviewed.\" Here to tell us about that House Republican candidate Maria Salazar. Good to have you with us this evening. I should mention that we have also reached out to your opponent and we are hopeful that she will join us on Monday evening.

We need to and I have called for an immigration reform law but not only that, for a summit meeting where President Trump can really show his leadership, where he should call for a summit meeting between the president of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala and help them keep their boys home. That is the only way my said that is going to prevent another caravan from occurring. Because as you were saying before, the Honduras is one of the most explosive countries in the hemisphere. It has one of the highest murder rates in the world. So what do you think those people are going to do? And I'm not saying that we need to allow them in, I'm not saying that we cannot protect or we should not protect our borders, what I'm saying is that we need to find a solution. And since I am from Miami, and we have hundreds of thousands of undocumented aliens in my town, and I know them very well, I know what the solution is. At one point I was the Central American Bureau Chief for Univision. I lived in Guatemala, I lived in El Salvador, in Nicaragua, and in Honduras, and I know what they need.

I only have about a minute left, because it was a Republican district, a lot of Cuban Americans live there.

You need to be part of the ultimate melting pot in order to be able to represent them in the House of Representatives. I mean the name says it, the House of Representatives.

Democrats by and large took the wrong lessons from Barack Obama's election and it was that they don't need white working-class voters anymore, right? When in fact, Barack Obama did really well with white, working-class voters. There were millions of Americans who voted both for Barack Obama and Donald Trump. There is a culturally conservative fiscally liberal streak that runs through a huge chunk of this electorate in states like these. This is the old new deal, Democratic coalition, and these were their grandchildren. And there are -- non-issues like immigration and others they are not liberal. They are actually quite conservative, and Democrats are coming around to having seen the electoral college consequences in 2016, and now looking at the Senate map in 2018.
