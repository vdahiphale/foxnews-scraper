It's becoming clear by the second that lives likely could have been saved. And, I can tell you, as a father and a grandfather, my heart breaks for the parents of these victims, I can't even imagine, the ones who will never see their children again, the ones wondering if their son or daughter could have been saved, the ones pleading outside the school for someone, anyone, to do something.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jason, right off the bat, one of the most disturbing elements that we learned today is at 11:27 a.m., a few minutes after the suspect shot his grandmother, a teacher at Robb Elementary School went outside, propped open one of the doors that led to the school, made a phone call and then went back inside and kept the door propped open. A minute later, that is when investigators say the suspect then crashed his truck. From that point on, that's when we believe and investigators believe that the suspect then started shooting at two witnesses at a nearby funeral home, and then made his way towards the school. A teacher at 11:30 a.m. then called 911. A minute later, a police officer responded to shots being fired, but couldn't see the suspect due to him being crouched behind a car, 11:32, that's when the suspect then started shooting at the school. And, here is where things get a little confusing. The suspect makes his way into the school, getting inside a classroom, and that is where officers say most of the gunfire took place. In those first few minutes, three officers go to the door, but, investigators say are shot at and grazed by bullets. At 12:03, more officers arrive, 19 in total, and spend the next 48 minutes in the hallway until a Border Patrol agent arrives with a master key to get inside. During those 48 minutes, children are calling 911 from inside the school, begging for police to respond. Investigators say, at that time, the local incident commander believed additional kids were not at risk, a call that Texas DPS investigators say was not the right call.",

As we now know in listening to Steve McCraw, Colonel McCraw, do his press conference, as we now know, they gathered, two officers went down, outside the door, 19 officers gathered outside, and a decision was made to wait. Now, what we don't know is whether they were in touch with dispatch, the 911 Center, because if they were aware that these people from inside the - children were calling from inside that room, then there is absolutely no excuse. It should have been the Charge of the Light Brigade. They should have just kept on going until they neutralize that shooter, because you know there are survivors inside and he is still in there. It was sporadic shooting. So, you hate to make harsh judgments. But, I think Steve McCraw laid it on the line today. I know him and he has great integrity. Note also that DPS was not the responding agency. They are the investigating agency. So, they only - they took what they were told, and then ran with that for a couple of days. I think, finally, after two days, the truth comes out. So, a lot of things went wrong here. But, clearly, they should have gone in.",

Don't paint all law enforcement with a broad brush right now. There are heroes in that community, heroes in that police department, who rushed to gunfire and rushed in to try and save lives. Now, I think, ultimately, what we need to find out is what were - what was the ideas and the thoughts behind the decision of the incident commander on the scene to treat this as a hostage situation? It's best practices in our country, and we train in law enforcement, and I trained. When I was a police officer, the officers under my purview that anyone who is showing homicidal intent, especially on the hallowed ground that our schools here in this country and our children being our most precious resource that we have, we have to rush in and we have to assume that deadly force may be warranted. We can't treat this as a hostage situation. He was showing murderous intent. It was very evident from the shots he fired at the two folks who were working at, I believe, a cemetery or a funeral home. There was a collapse, a breakdown of this school being secured, and leaving a door open, how heartbreaking that is. It's something we've all done.

And, all I can say is you have to trust but verify. In this situation, someone has to come around and do a periodic assessment of the school security. I think there is only a middle school, a high school and an elementary school in the county. And, I don't think it's a whole lot to ask that someone come around periodically and do a third-party assessment to make sure that they're following their own protocols because it was in the books to keep everything locked, one point of entry during school hours, how to lock things down when there is trouble, how to communicate the lockdown, which is always the problem, How do you communicate the lockdown?",

And, they said that that was against the rules that for the grandparents - for her to live there, she cannot have men in that home. So, it kind of started some contention among them. Now, again, he moved in with his grandparents not long ago, and he was sleeping on the floor while he was staying there. There were two bedrooms there. But, the grandfather tells me that the wife and him stayed in separate rooms at night. Now, when he would wake up in the morning, he would tell the gunman here to go into the bedroom and sleep. And so, he - we saw this kind of in this setting, and it was - sitting there and listening to the grandfather talk about it, was just really, really unsettling in the sense that it still hadn't really fully hit him until two days ago at noon.

He blocked the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, named for Luke and Alex, who were both killed in Parkland, Florida. The legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to establish a \"federal clearing house on school safety best practices\", and to collect data and user feedback and evaluation of the implementation of those best practices. Is he serious? Who could possibly be opposed to best practices for school security? Schumer tweeted \"The bill put more guns in schools. The truth: There were officers at the school in Texas. The shooter got past them\". Actually, the truth, Chuck, is that the resource officer was not there. Not really a best practice. The shooter walked in through an open door, left to open evidently by a teacher. Joining me now is Texas Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne and Sean Duffy, former Wisconsin Congressman, a former prosecutor, and now a Fox News contributor. Thank you both for joining me. I got to tell you, this thing fires me up. I mean, it's so sad. I can't even imagine the devastation. You are both parents. You got lovely, beautiful families and kids, like I do. But, we're going through this. So, a bill is on the floor that's been worked on for years since Parkland. Chuck Schumer has a chance to put it up for a vote, unanimous consent, Democrats and Republicans. Let's just establish best practices. And, Chuck Schumer says no, that's not good enough. I don't know how you react to that. But, I am sick and tired of these Democrats lecturing the rest of the country about how they want to do this. And now, all of a sudden, they actually do have something that they can do in a bipartisan way to put forward best practices. Who is against that? Chuck Schumer and the Democrats are against that. That's what's happening. Congressman Van Duyne, I'll turn it over to you, but I saw that, I'm just so fed up with these Democrats who want the issue. They want a lecture, but they don't actually want to do something that was on the floor of the Senate 24 hours after this shooting.",

And, each time they had a school resource officer that met with them, almost immediately stopped them in their tracks, disarm them, prevented them from ever having open fire and prevented mass casualties. That works. It's a conversation we have to have. But, what you're seeing is Democrats are politicizing this once again. It is all about control. It's not about on solutions that work. We've got President Biden who is going on his tirade hours after this killing. And, he is talking about how in his years, his career, he spent with all of these bills on gun control and on gun safety. He has been there for 50 years, folks. He has been there for half a century.

Special Counsel John Durham says the lie is when Sussmann told Baker he was delivering information on his own, not on behalf of any clients. Durham argues that Sussmann went on behalf of the Clinton campaign and peddled the story to the media. In closing arguments today, jurors saw billing evidence showing that Sussmann billed the Clinton campaign on the same day he met with the FBI. E-mails between Sussmann and reporters also shown to jurors. Sussman's team told jurors via a poster board, despite with the government said, this was not a giant political conspiracy theory. The defense accused the government of using smoke and mirrors to distract from the facts. Sussmann attorney Sean Berkowitz told jurors a text message that Sussmann sent Baker the night before that meeting doesn't matter. It's what Sussmann said to Baker Monday at the FBI headquarters, and there are no notes or recordings of that specific in-person meeting.

So for this jury to find not guilty, they are going to have to do what's called jury nullification. They're going to have to ignore the facts of the case, which are very simple, and they are upfront, and they're not disputed. and then they're going to have to ignore the law. And if they do use that, then they come back and say not guilty and they did so based on politics and not based on the facts and the law. So I hope, Jason, that this is not an instance where the prosecutors are sitting there and they regret putting each individual that they did unto the jury, but you can't control it all.

But some of the complicating factors here that may interfere with a conviction are, of course, the jury and its bias, although I don't know how you would even seat a jury in D.C. in this type of a case that didn't have donors to Democrats on it. But more importantly, there is a kind of a quirky issue here, which is the FBI agents who testified were really kind of reluctant witnesses. They didn't want a turnover, Baker didn't want to turn over that text message, that notorious text message that is absolutely damning. And there's a lot of suspicion here that the FBI wanted to be fooled by this story and taken in. They were absolutely willing participants. That's one theory. And if so, that is the where's the beef question that the defense is trying to get the jury to buy, which is, like, so what? So what if he told them this? They were lapping it up anyway, or it didn't make a difference, or they were going to run with it no matter who was presenting it on behalf of what politician. So I'm kind of cynical. I've also stood in front of juries I feel uncomfortable about. I've tried cases in San Francisco for the pro-life movement.

It's becoming clear by the second that lives likely could have been saved. And, I can tell you, as a father and a grandfather, my heart breaks for the parents of these victims, I can't even imagine, the ones who will never see their children again, the ones wondering if their son or daughter could have been saved, the ones pleading outside the school for someone, anyone, to do something."

Jeff, what can you tell us about this latest timeline?"

      "speaker": "JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Jason, right off the bat, one of the most disturbing elements that we learned today is at 11:27 a.m., a few minutes after the suspect shot his grandmother, a teacher at Robb Elementary School went outside, propped open one of the doors that led to the school, made a phone call and then went back inside and kept the door propped open. A minute later, that is when investigators say the suspect then crashed his truck. From that point on, that's when we believe and investigators believe that the suspect then started shooting at two witnesses at a nearby funeral home, and then made his way towards the school. A teacher at 11:30 a.m. then called 911. A minute later, a police officer responded to shots being fired, but couldn't see the suspect due to him being crouched behind a car, 11:32, that's when the suspect then started shooting at the school. And, here is where things get a little confusing. The suspect makes his way into the school, getting inside a classroom, and that is where officers say most of the gunfire took place. In those first few minutes, three officers go to the door, but, investigators say are shot at and grazed by bullets. At 12:03, more officers arrive, 19 in total, and spend the next 48 minutes in the hallway until a Border Patrol agent arrives with a master key to get inside. During those 48 minutes, children are calling 911 from inside the school, begging for police to respond. Investigators say, at that time, the local incident commander believed additional kids were not at risk, a call that Texas DPS investigators say was not the right call."

      "speaker": "STEVE MCCRAW, TEXAS DPS DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "From the benefit of hindsight, where I'm sitting now, of course it was not the right decision. It was a wrong decision, period. There is no excuse for that. But, again, I wasn't there. But, I'm just telling you, from what we know, we believe there should have been an entry at that as soon as you can. Hey, when there is an active shooter, the rules change. It's no longer, OK, it's no longer a barricaded subject. You don't have time. You don't worry about matter perimeters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "And, the hard part to think about is how many kids died in that span of 48 minutes from when those 19 law enforcement officers were in the hallway to the time they got inside the classroom and then shot and killed the suspect? How many died during that period? That is very much still under investigation, Jason."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Jeff, you've been doing some great reporting in a very difficult situation. One of the questions I have is did this school go into lockdown because obviously it wasn't effective with the teacher propping up the door? But, was there ever a lockdown in place?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Well, from what we know is that at 11:43 a.m., so it had been several minutes after the suspect crashed his truck and those first shots were being fired at a nearby funeral home, officially, we could see that there was a post on social media from the school saying that they were in lockdown. But, as far as if that went out to the school prior to that, that's unclear. We could just tell from their social media presence, 11:43, lockdown was issued."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",

    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, that's one of the things that investigators are looking at, is not only what his behaviors were, but his spending habits, how did he get this money to buy these firearms and all this ammunition as well as the conversations he was having, not just on social media. We made a big point to talk about these messages he sent back and forth with people privately, but also the conversations he had while he was a gamer, playing games online. These are all things investigators are going to be going through, Jason."

Evidently, no efforts were made to open that door early on in the process, and we have no idea how many lives could have been saved during that time. You're a professional. You study this. You've trained for this. What's your reaction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS SWECKER, FORMER ASSISTANT FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, a lot of things went wrong here right from the very beginning. The security at the school, all kinds of different security flaws there. If they had their procedures in place, they certainly didn't practice them. So, that's the first line of defense. The responses is a different matter. As we now know in listening to Steve McCraw, Colonel McCraw, do his press conference, as we now know, they gathered, two officers went down, outside the door, 19 officers gathered outside, and a decision was made to wait. Now, what we don't know is whether they were in touch with dispatch, the 911 Center, because if they were aware that these people from inside the - children were calling from inside that room, then there is absolutely no excuse. It should have been the Charge of the Light Brigade. They should have just kept on going until they neutralize that shooter, because you know there are survivors inside and he is still in there. It was sporadic shooting. So, you hate to make harsh judgments. But, I think Steve McCraw laid it on the line today. I know him and he has great integrity. Note also that DPS was not the responding agency. They are the investigating agency. So, they only - they took what they were told, and then ran with that for a couple of days. I think, finally, after two days, the truth comes out. So, a lot of things went wrong here. But, clearly, they should have gone in."

Don't paint all law enforcement with a broad brush right now. There are heroes in that community, heroes in that police department, who rushed to gunfire and rushed in to try and save lives. Now, I think, ultimately, what we need to find out is what were - what was the ideas and the thoughts behind the decision of the incident commander on the scene to treat this as a hostage situation? It's best practices in our country, and we train in law enforcement, and I trained. When I was a police officer, the officers under my purview that anyone who is showing homicidal intent, especially on the hallowed ground that our schools here in this country and our children being our most precious resource that we have, we have to rush in and we have to assume that deadly force may be warranted. We can't treat this as a hostage situation. He was showing murderous intent. It was very evident from the shots he fired at the two folks who were working at, I believe, a cemetery or a funeral home. There was a collapse, a breakdown of this school being secured, and leaving a door open, how heartbreaking that is. It's something we've all done. But, as school employees, people who are trained and to safeguard our children, this is something that we absolutely have to think about of - it's just a simple act of locking a door and having the entire campus on a--"

And, the ability to communicate with 19 officers inside, which was new information, which we didn't hear before, and the idea that a teacher left the door open, and there is a school lockdown in place, I mean, at what point do you just say, my goodness, we - this could have been prevented?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWECKER",
      "utterance": "Yes. It was preventable. I mean, I do school security assessments, and I see this a lot where they understand the rules. They're on the books. The protocols are there. They're in a book, sitting and gathering dust on the corner of the desk. But, nobody actually puts them in practice. And, you see time and time again that teachers will prop doors open. And, all I can say is you have to trust but verify. In this situation, someone has to come around and do a periodic assessment of the school security. I think there is only a middle school, a high school and an elementary school in the county. And, I don't think it's a whole lot to ask that someone come around periodically and do a third-party assessment to make sure that they're following their own protocols because it was in the books to keep everything locked, one point of entry during school hours, how to lock things down when there is trouble, how to communicate the lockdown, which is always the problem, How do you communicate the lockdown?"

So, as you mentioned, he'd only been living with his grandparents periodically since March, and in part because the grandfather tells me that they had another home that they were paying for the mother and his grandson to live in. But, he said that drugs started moving throughout that home. She had a man move in about a year ago. And, they said that that was against the rules that for the grandparents - for her to live there, she cannot have men in that home. So, it kind of started some contention among them. Now, again, he moved in with his grandparents not long ago, and he was sleeping on the floor while he was staying there. There were two bedrooms there. But, the grandfather tells me that the wife and him stayed in separate rooms at night. Now, when he would wake up in the morning, he would tell the gunman here to go into the bedroom and sleep. And so, he - we saw this kind of in this setting, and it was - sitting there and listening to the grandfather talk about it, was just really, really unsettling in the sense that it still hadn't really fully hit him until two days ago at noon. So, a full 24 hours had passed. And, he finally started kind of processing things. But, take a listen to what he had to say when he was talking about the relationship and what was going on in that house that the mother was living in."

But, he didn't say if there were guns in his midst at all. If he was caught with guns, he would go back to prison for 10 to 15 years. So, he was adamant that they were not there. Now, I did ask him, could he have hidden them in the yard somewhere? Could they have been at the mother's house, which again, was nearby? Now, he said he didn't know.

So, we didn't have a really - it didn't sound like he had a full on interview at that point. But, when they did go to his house, and he said that when they went there they ransacked it.

      "utterance": "One day after the shooting in Uvalde that took 21 innocent lives, Chuck Schumer did something pretty despicable on the Senate floor. He blocked the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, named for Luke and Alex, who were both killed in Parkland, Florida. The legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to establish a \"federal clearing house on school safety best practices\", and to collect data and user feedback and evaluation of the implementation of those best practices. Is he serious? Who could possibly be opposed to best practices for school security? Schumer tweeted \"The bill put more guns in schools. The truth: There were officers at the school in Texas. The shooter got past them\". Actually, the truth, Chuck, is that the resource officer was not there. Not really a best practice. The shooter walked in through an open door, left to open evidently by a teacher. Joining me now is Texas Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne and Sean Duffy, former Wisconsin Congressman, a former prosecutor, and now a Fox News contributor. Thank you both for joining me. I got to tell you, this thing fires me up. I mean, it's so sad. I can't even imagine the devastation. You are both parents. You got lovely, beautiful families and kids, like I do. But, we're going through this. So, a bill is on the floor that's been worked on for years since Parkland. Chuck Schumer has a chance to put it up for a vote, unanimous consent, Democrats and Republicans. Let's just establish best practices. And, Chuck Schumer says no, that's not good enough. I don't know how you react to that. But, I am sick and tired of these Democrats lecturing the rest of the country about how they want to do this. And now, all of a sudden, they actually do have something that they can do in a bipartisan way to put forward best practices. Who is against that? Chuck Schumer and the Democrats are against that. That's what's happening. Congressman Van Duyne, I'll turn it over to you, but I saw that, I'm just so fed up with these Democrats who want the issue. They want a lecture, but they don't actually want to do something that was on the floor of the Senate 24 hours after this shooting."

      "utterance": "And, something that could have helped. That's the most frustrating part. If you look at all the policies that have been thrown out there, you look at the ones that work, and without a doubt, having school resource officers on campus works. In fact, in 2018 alone, they had three separate shooters in Florida, Maryland and Illinois, that tried to go into a school and have a mass casualty situation. And, each time they had a school resource officer that met with them, almost immediately stopped them in their tracks, disarm them, prevented them from ever having open fire and prevented mass casualties. That works. It's a conversation we have to have. But, what you're seeing is Democrats are politicizing this once again. It is all about control. It's not about on solutions that work. We've got President Biden who is going on his tirade hours after this killing. And, he is talking about how in his years, his career, he spent with all of these bills on gun control and on gun safety. He has been there for 50 years, folks. He has been there for half a century. This problem has gotten worse. It hasn't gotten better. It's gotten much worse. And, we're sitting here now having to deal with him talk to us, and taking solutions off the table. But, I do want to have a message to all of those families in Uvalde. You have elected leaders who will fight with you, who will try to help you through this horrible nightmare trauma, and not politicize the soul crushing grief that you're going through now."

I mean, listen Ed Markey, Senator from Massachusetts, the bottom line is the founders put the Second Amendment in the Constitution. And, our Supreme Court is upholding it. But, you know what burns me, Jason, is this is the under - the ugly underbelly of politics. You have a bill on the floor that's bipartisan, that could save kids' lives, best practices, best policies for schools to keep kids safe, and Democrats say no to it. This is about preserving an election issue for them in November so they could hopefully have a chance at retaining seats they are going to lose, both in the Senate and in the House. Instead of doing that, again, of protecting kids, they want to come up and say no, we're going to preserve the issue. We want to see an issue that we can run on as opposed to saying, Hey, we can come together as America. We can come together as a Congress and pass a legislation that can save lives.

      "utterance": "Jurors spent a few hours deliberating today, but we won't have a verdict until at least Tuesday after the holiday weekend when Michael Sussmann is back in court. Former Clinton campaign attorney Michael Sussmann is charged with lying to the FBI, specifically then FBI General Counsel James Baker, when he came to Baker in September, 2016, and said he had some information linking the Trump Organization to a Russian bank called Alpha Bank with Kremlin ties via a computer server backchannel. Special Counsel John Durham says the lie is when Sussmann told Baker he was delivering information on his own, not on behalf of any clients. Durham argues that Sussmann went on behalf of the Clinton campaign and peddled the story to the media. In closing arguments today, jurors saw billing evidence showing that Sussmann billed the Clinton campaign on the same day he met with the FBI. E-mails between Sussmann and reporters also shown to jurors. Sussman's team told jurors via a poster board, despite with the government said, this was not a giant political conspiracy theory. The defense accused the government of using smoke and mirrors to distract from the facts. Sussmann attorney Sean Berkowitz told jurors a text message that Sussmann sent Baker the night before that meeting doesn't matter. It's what Sussmann said to Baker Monday at the FBI headquarters, and there are no notes or recordings of that specific in-person meeting. Baker told different people different stories about what Sussmann actually said. Again, we could have a verdict as soon as Tuesday. Jason?"

Joining me now is Harmeet Dhillon, attorney and founder of the Center for American Liberty, and Brett Tolman, former federal prosecutor and the executive director of Right On Crime. Brett, I want to go to you. You've been a federal prosecutor. One of the deep concerns about this whole case is the jury. I believe in juries, I liked jury trials, but when you have three of the jurors who donated to Hillary Clinton, one of the jurors is supposedly supportive of the Squad, and yet another juror has a daughter who is on the same sporting team as the defendant's daughter, how do you look at that and say, yes, five of these jurors have ties to the defendant? I just don't understand that."

      "speaker": "BRETT TOLMAN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR",
      "utterance": "I stood in front of juries that I was nervous about, and it's not a fun feeling. You are worried about individual jurors and what their perspective on the case is given the bias that they come into the jury with. But I will tell you, the facts here, this is not a complex case. So for this jury to find not guilty, they are going to have to do what's called jury nullification. They're going to have to ignore the facts of the case, which are very simple, and they are upfront, and they're not disputed. and then they're going to have to ignore the law. And if they do use that, then they come back and say not guilty and they did so based on politics and not based on the facts and the law. So I hope, Jason, that this is not an instance where the prosecutors are sitting there and they regret putting each individual that they did unto the jury, but you can't control it all. You don't have enough challenges to remove everyone you think might have a bias. So you help that in the end, despite those leanings, that they will still do the right thing."

Harmeet, the media has never, ever, the traditional media, institutional media, whatever you want to call it, they still have not done the proper job in covering this story. Here you've got Hillary Clinton's attorney, and you've got, it's a criminal trial. \"The Washington Post,\" for instance, they are still pulling for Hillary Clinton. They wrote, quote, \"Perhaps there was a ploy to use contrived information to trigger an FBI investigation of Trump as Durham appears to hope to prove. But crucially, it didn't. Put another way, Hillary Clinton didn't do it,\" end quote. It was Robby Mook, the campaign manager, who testified that yes, he involved her in this decision."

      "utterance": "Look, this is one of the biggest hoaxes, between this one and the Steele dossier, the pair of them, ever perpetrated in American political history. And she did it and she got away with it, and it isn't disputed, like Brett said. The only thing that's in dispute here is whether the jury is going to follow the law and follow the facts to their inexorable conclusion, which is that Sussmann lied to the FBI. But some of the complicating factors here that may interfere with a conviction are, of course, the jury and its bias, although I don't know how you would even seat a jury in D.C. in this type of a case that didn't have donors to Democrats on it. But more importantly, there is a kind of a quirky issue here, which is the FBI agents who testified were really kind of reluctant witnesses. They didn't want a turnover, Baker didn't want to turn over that text message, that notorious text message that is absolutely damning. And there's a lot of suspicion here that the FBI wanted to be fooled by this story and taken in. They were absolutely willing participants. That's one theory. And if so, that is the where's the beef question that the defense is trying to get the jury to buy, which is, like, so what? So what if he told them this? They were lapping it up anyway, or it didn't make a difference, or they were going to run with it no matter who was presenting it on behalf of what politician. So I'm kind of cynical. I've also stood in front of juries I feel uncomfortable about. I've tried cases in San Francisco for the pro-life movement. And that's the kind of situation I think that this jury is going to be looking for ways to let these people off. But ultimately, one of the benefits of this trial may be the public knowing exactly what happened here, Hillary Clinton's involvement, and how potentially --"
