We saw the real border czar, the president of Mexico, not the vice president. But I will say for Kamala Harris. The Kamala Harris problem is not a Kamala Harris problem. It's a Joe Biden problem. They are looking at this. The things that Joe Biden can count as an achievement, passing his infrastructure bill or the COVID -- those are Washington achievements. People want to see improvements in their own lives. And I think what they see is not just the president going in the wrong direction but looking incredibly incompetent. Certainly, that's what we saw in Afghanistan. First, they dismissed inflation. Everyone in the administration telling us not something they should be worried about, they didn't predict it would be here at this level today. I think it's very hard to come up with an achievement, a concrete achievement that Joe Biden can point to and say because of this, Americans are better off. As Byron said, COVID is still raging. I believe more people died this year than last year. There are a lot of things he led us to believe that he was going to fix, that he was the solution. And I think a lot of people are just concluding, like Jimmy Carter, the job is just too big for him.",

And what we are hearing today with the meetings of the leaders of Canada and Mexico, as far as Mexico is concerned the president didn't bring up the remain in Mexico issue. The White House said, well, it's under litigation, we can't really talk about it. The most important factor, really in the flow of illegal immigrants across the border is Biden's rescission of the remain in Mexico program. It doesn't even come up.

I think he took a good step on the submarines and the deal with Australia and so forth. But there is a lot left to do. And right now, I would say, for me the key test of a policy is does it strengthen our friends in the region like Australia and Taiwan, whom China is trying to bully, or does it weaken them?

      "utterance": "Vice President Harris's communications director is not as excited, lost the job, no longer at the White House. Bill, thoughts about her answer and where she is kind of positioned? BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, look, I don't think the vice president has a lot she can point to what she has done. She seems to be terrified going to the border. We saw the real border czar, the president of Mexico, not the vice president. But I will say for Kamala Harris. The Kamala Harris problem is not a Kamala Harris problem. It's a Joe Biden problem. They are looking at this. The things that Joe Biden can count as an achievement, passing his infrastructure bill or the COVID -- those are Washington achievements. People want to see improvements in their own lives. And I think what they see is not just the president going in the wrong direction but looking incredibly incompetent. Certainly, that's what we saw in Afghanistan. First, they dismissed inflation. Everyone in the administration telling us not something they should be worried about, they didn't predict it would be here at this level today. I think it's very hard to come up with an achievement, a concrete achievement that Joe Biden can point to and say because of this, Americans are better off. As Byron said, COVID is still raging. I believe more people died this year than last year. There are a lot of things he led us to believe that he was going to fix, that he was the solution. And I think a lot of people are just concluding, like Jimmy Carter, the job is just too big for him."

We don't want an armed conflict with China. But the United States and China are more and more going two separate ways. They're decoupling in some ways. But soon China is going to be the biggest economy on the globe."

      "utterance": "It doesn't really work. Listen, I think it was stunning to learn that in a three-and-a-half hour conversation, the president did not bring up with President Xi the issue of China stonewalling an investigation into the origin of COVID. And what we are hearing today with the meetings of the leaders of Canada and Mexico, as far as Mexico is concerned the president didn't bring up the remain in Mexico issue. The White House said, well, it's under litigation, we can't really talk about it. The most important factor, really in the flow of illegal immigrants across the border is Biden's rescission of the remain in Mexico program. It doesn't even come up. So you wonder whether the president is really on the mark on some of these issues."

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, it's because Joe Biden leaves a lot of question marks on things. On China you can't just solve this by having dialogue. It's great to talk about phone calls. But if you don't convey a message, I don't know what the purpose is. I think it's very unclear what Joe Biden's China policy is. It's very difficult. I think he took a good step on the submarines and the deal with Australia and so forth. But there is a lot left to do. And right now, I would say, for me the key test of a policy is does it strengthen our friends in the region like Australia and Taiwan, whom China is trying to bully, or does it weaken them? The first thing we have to do is keep our friends, keep them secure, keep them safe, and keep them strong."

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
