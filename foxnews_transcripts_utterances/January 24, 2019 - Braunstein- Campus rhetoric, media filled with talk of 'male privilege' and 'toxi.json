      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” For a brief and shining moment earlier in the week, the National Press Corps felt a mild pang of conscience for mishandling the Covington High School story so thoroughly. But that moment has passed, just a blip on the screen. And the press is now renewing its attack on that group of High School boys while giving their accusers a pass. We've got details just ahead, it's nauseating. That's a preview. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, the Border wall battle's approaching a climax today. Republicans and Democrats in the Congress held votes on two competing proposals that would have ended the government shutdown, but in the end, did not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Chief National Correspondent, Ed Henry was there, as always, and has the latest for us.

      "sentences": "Tucker, good to see you. As I've often said, you know this Tucker, you can try to teach a goat how to climb a tree but you're better off hiring a squirrel in the first place. Actually, I've never said that before until now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That was actually said by a Republican Senator, John Kennedy. You see him there on the left. I'm of course quoting the always-folksy, Republican Senator Kennedy, who was trying to explain one plan pushed by Chuck Schumer there. Kennedy's point being, we know a squirrel can actually climb a tree just as we know a wall or a barrier of any kind will provide some kind of defense. But Kennedy said the Schumer plan would not get the job done on border security because it would have opened the government without money for any kind of barrier. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A half dozen Republicans in the Senate broke ranks, including Lisa Murkowski, you see her there, supported the Democratic plan because she said the plan was flawed, but she wants to get the government open, so she supported it anyway. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joe Manchin was the only Democrat who broke with his party. He voted for the Republican plan by Mitch McConnell that would open the government, but also fund the wall and make changes to the DACA that not just the President wants, but many Democrats have previously backed. Neither plan though got the needed 60 votes, so we're still stuck. So, back to Senator Kennedy, he said it's like a scene in the movie Pulp Fiction, where John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson are driving along, Travolta accidentally shoots a character named Marvin in the backseat, Kennedy said federal workers are innocent and they are caught in the crossfire tonight. And, in fact, the President, a short time ago, told reporters, he respects those furloughed employees, and is now considering a third plan, where he would agree to open the government for three weeks if he gets a down payment on the $5.7 billion for a wall, for a barrier while they negotiate. So, he wants a down payment tonight, Tucker. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There are also White House officials saying in private he's considering the possibility of finally declaring a national emergency, Tucker.",

So, you have to ask yourself, when you consider that, was the border secure in December before the shutdown? Well, no, it wasn't. And that's why we're having this debate right now. Then, how would it be more secure after a bill that doesn't change anything passes? Well, it wouldn't be more secure, and that's the point of the legislation, to maintain the broken status quo, let's be honest about that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, in the House, Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Bennie Thompson says he plans to introduce a bill that contains billions for border security, but nothing for a wall. Thompson has a brand-new idea, he's telling us. He says he can secure the border with the marvels of technology. He recently told PBS that cutting- edge machines can help us, quote, identify those vulnerabilities on the border. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Thompson's plan can expect enthusiastic support from the Congresswoman from Tech-Land, Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.

You'd have to be totally ignorant of what's happening on our Southern border to believe that more surveillance is going to solve the problem. We have an awful lot of surveillance technology there already. We've got drones, cameras, sensors, radar, dirigibles. We have it there, in part, because the Bush Administration put it there. That Administration spent more than a billion dollars on something called the Secure Border Initiative Network. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They use technology to watch about 50 miles of our Southern border.

They specialize in grave and expensive disappointments. They're pushing one now. And that's short-sighted. Leaving the politics aside, it's not a good idea because our Southern border is one of America's most dangerous vulnerabilities. That's not a talking point. It's literally true, and here's why. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As of tonight, Mexico is an intact country. Will it remain an intact country? Maybe but maybe not. Mexico is a deeply unstable place, not an attack on the Mexican people. It's an acknowledgment of what anyone who knows anything about the country will tell you. The national murder rate in Mexico is five times ours. Since 2006, more than 250,000, a quarter million people have been murdered in Mexico. That includes hundreds of politicians and judges. There is a war going on there, and it's spurred by drug cartels that reach into the highest levels of the Mexican government, not an exaggeration. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Attorney General of an entire Mexican state recently pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges. The Governor of a state on the U.S. border took bribes to let cartels operate freely, which they did. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, just the other day, Mexico's previous President was credibly accused at trial in court by a witness of taking a $100 million bribe from \"El Chapo\" Guzman. In effect, Mexico has become a narco-state. But it's not even the most volatile country in the region. Nicaragua is in severe turmoil right now. That gets no coverage but it's real. Parts of El Salvador are largely controlled by gangs. Venezuela, meanwhile, is literally falling apart. A recent Brookings Institution report predicted that a total collapse of Venezuela, which could happen any day, might create 8 million refugees. For perspective, that's more refugees than fled the entire Syrian Civil War. And keep in mind that that flood of humanity upended all of Europe. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Something similar could easily happen here, to us, and it likely will, if we ignore the problem, which we are doing. And yet, the position of Democrats in the Congress is that everything is fine, and you're nuts if you disagree. Nothing needs to be done. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well that's the definition of recklessness. In fact, it's worse than recklessness. It's like letting your kids play in traffic. You wouldn't do that to people you cared about. You prevent it from happening. Democrats have become extremists on the question of borders. But you never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won't say it, and nor will most Republicans, by the way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Even in the Trump Administration, some officials seem intent on making Nancy Pelosi's case for her.

When he offered to arrange a swifter mode of transportation, she declined. He asked why, she explained that she \"needed the steps\" on her Fitbit to sign in to her social media accounts. If she fell below the right number of steps, it would lower her health and fitness rating, and that's part of her social rating, which is monitored by the Government of China. A low social rating could prevent her from working or traveling abroad.\" That's what's going on there. Author and Columnist, Mark Steyn joins us tonight. So Mark, I'm not paranoid by temperament.

The entries were spine-tinglingly embarrassing, the kind of crap you wrote in a spiral notebook freshman year after breaking up with your high school girlfriend, and discovering marijuana. Pretty amusing! Here's a selection from them. \"Have been stuck lately. In and out of a funk. My last day of work was January 2nd. It's been more than 20 years since I was last not working. Maybe if I get moving, on the road, meet people, learn what's going on, where they live, have some adventure, go where I don't know and I'm not known, I'll clear my head, reset, I'll think new thoughts, break out of the loops I've been stuck in.\" By the way, no periods in that sentence, just commas. Or this, \"Drove to Dalhart. Ate at the Grill. Was last there in August of 2017. Green Chile cheeseburger. The table over asked if I was Beto.\" Or this, my favorite, \"Found some crab claws. Maybe left by a bird. Walked out on a pier. Looked out, took some pictures. Leaned over, scooped up water and washed my face. Picked up beer cans that someone had left,\" and so on like that. Hilarious stuff! But you can see why Beto wanted it sup - oh, wait, no so (ph) we totally screwed that up. Those are actual quotes from Beto's real online diary. In other words, we couldn't make it up, but the Twitter feed was funny too. That's it for us tonight.

But that moment has passed, just a blip on the screen. And the press is now renewing its attack on that group of High School boys while giving their accusers a pass. We've got details just ahead, it's nauseating. That's a preview. But first, the Border wall battle's approaching a climax today. Republicans and Democrats in the Congress held votes on two competing proposals that would have ended the government shutdown, but in the end, did not. Chief National Correspondent, Ed Henry was there, as always, and has the latest for us. Hey, Ed."

      "utterance": "Tucker, good to see you. As I've often said, you know this Tucker, you can try to teach a goat how to climb a tree but you're better off hiring a squirrel in the first place. Actually, I've never said that before until now. That was actually said by a Republican Senator, John Kennedy. You see him there on the left. I'm of course quoting the always-folksy, Republican Senator Kennedy, who was trying to explain one plan pushed by Chuck Schumer there. Kennedy's point being, we know a squirrel can actually climb a tree just as we know a wall or a barrier of any kind will provide some kind of defense. But Kennedy said the Schumer plan would not get the job done on border security because it would have opened the government without money for any kind of barrier. A half dozen Republicans in the Senate broke ranks, including Lisa Murkowski, you see her there, supported the Democratic plan because she said the plan was flawed, but she wants to get the government open, so she supported it anyway. Joe Manchin was the only Democrat who broke with his party. He voted for the Republican plan by Mitch McConnell that would open the government, but also fund the wall and make changes to the DACA that not just the President wants, but many Democrats have previously backed. Neither plan though got the needed 60 votes, so we're still stuck. So, back to Senator Kennedy, he said it's like a scene in the movie Pulp Fiction, where John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson are driving along, Travolta accidentally shoots a character named Marvin in the backseat, Kennedy said federal workers are innocent and they are caught in the crossfire tonight. And, in fact, the President, a short time ago, told reporters, he respects those furloughed employees, and is now considering a third plan, where he would agree to open the government for three weeks if he gets a down payment on the $5.7 billion for a wall, for a barrier while they negotiate. So, he wants a down payment tonight, Tucker. There are also White House officials saying in private he's considering the possibility of finally declaring a national emergency, Tucker."

The Democratic bill, in the Senate that Ed was just telling you about, simply restores previous funding levels for the Border Patrol and other existing programs. So, you have to ask yourself, when you consider that, was the border secure in December before the shutdown? Well, no, it wasn't. And that's why we're having this debate right now. Then, how would it be more secure after a bill that doesn't change anything passes? Well, it wouldn't be more secure, and that's the point of the legislation, to maintain the broken status quo, let's be honest about that. Meanwhile, in the House, Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Bennie Thompson says he plans to introduce a bill that contains billions for border security, but nothing for a wall. Thompson has a brand-new idea, he's telling us. He says he can secure the border with the marvels of technology. He recently told PBS that cutting- edge machines can help us, quote, identify those vulnerabilities on the border. Thompson's plan can expect enthusiastic support from the Congresswoman from Tech-Land, Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. Here's her most recent suggestion for the border. Watch."

      "utterance": "The positive, shall we say, almost technological wall that can be built is what we should be doing. Technology to scan the cars coming through the ports of entry, and that is to detect guns. It's like an electronic dog almost to - to detect drugs, guns and other contraband."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's really like an Electronic Dog that can detect contraband. On level (ph), that's hilarious. We've laughed about it before. But it's also patronizing, really. You'd have to be totally ignorant of what's happening on our Southern border to believe that more surveillance is going to solve the problem. We have an awful lot of surveillance technology there already. We've got drones, cameras, sensors, radar, dirigibles. We have it there, in part, because the Bush Administration put it there. That Administration spent more than a billion dollars on something called the Secure Border Initiative Network. They use technology to watch about 50 miles of our Southern border. Congressman Bennie Thompson himself called that program \"Grave and expensive disappointment.\" Well Thompson was right about that. What's changed is that Democrats now support grave and expensive disappointments. They specialize in grave and expensive disappointments. They're pushing one now. And that's short-sighted. Leaving the politics aside, it's not a good idea because our Southern border is one of America's most dangerous vulnerabilities. That's not a talking point. It's literally true, and here's why. As of tonight, Mexico is an intact country. Will it remain an intact country? Maybe but maybe not. Mexico is a deeply unstable place, not an attack on the Mexican people. It's an acknowledgment of what anyone who knows anything about the country will tell you. The national murder rate in Mexico is five times ours. Since 2006, more than 250,000, a quarter million people have been murdered in Mexico. That includes hundreds of politicians and judges. There is a war going on there, and it's spurred by drug cartels that reach into the highest levels of the Mexican government, not an exaggeration. The Attorney General of an entire Mexican state recently pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges. The Governor of a state on the U.S. border took bribes to let cartels operate freely, which they did. And then, just the other day, Mexico's previous President was credibly accused at trial in court by a witness of taking a $100 million bribe from \"El Chapo\" Guzman. In effect, Mexico has become a narco-state. But it's not even the most volatile country in the region. Nicaragua is in severe turmoil right now. That gets no coverage but it's real. Parts of El Salvador are largely controlled by gangs. Venezuela, meanwhile, is literally falling apart. A recent Brookings Institution report predicted that a total collapse of Venezuela, which could happen any day, might create 8 million refugees. For perspective, that's more refugees than fled the entire Syrian Civil War. And keep in mind that that flood of humanity upended all of Europe. Something similar could easily happen here, to us, and it likely will, if we ignore the problem, which we are doing. And yet, the position of Democrats in the Congress is that everything is fine, and you're nuts if you disagree. Nothing needs to be done. Well that's the definition of recklessness. In fact, it's worse than recklessness. It's like letting your kids play in traffic. You wouldn't do that to people you cared about. You prevent it from happening. Democrats have become extremists on the question of borders. But you never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won't say it, and nor will most Republicans, by the way. Even in the Trump Administration, some officials seem intent on making Nancy Pelosi's case for her. The Republicans are the real extremists here. Here's what Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross said today when he was asked about workers who aren't being paid during the shutdown."

And it's also a distraction because it doesn't change the nature, the fundamental nature of this crisis. Our borders remain vulnerable, and the stakes are higher than they have ever been, thanks to the chaos just south of them. Leaders who cared about this country would be staying up late, trying to fix that problem. Democratic leaders are trying to make it worse. That's the bottom line truth.

So, Brookings says we could have 8 million refugees, which will come not simply to the United States but to neighboring countries, but a lot of them would come here, a lot of them have come here.

Increasingly though, some suspect that the gadgets we use every day are becoming tools to control us. A recent piece in Wired magazine, and it's worth reading, and it captures this phenomenon and the threat (ph) of it. It describes what's happening in China right now under its social rating system. Here's the lead of the piece. \"A friend of mine, who runs a large television company in the car-mad city of Los Angeles, recently noticed that his intern, an aspiring filmmaker from the People's Republic of China, was walking to work. When he offered to arrange a swifter mode of transportation, she declined. He asked why, she explained that she \"needed the steps\" on her Fitbit to sign in to her social media accounts. If she fell below the right number of steps, it would lower her health and fitness rating, and that's part of her social rating, which is monitored by the Government of China. A low social rating could prevent her from working or traveling abroad.\" That's what's going on there. Author and Columnist, Mark Steyn joins us tonight. So Mark, I'm not paranoid by temperament. But - but it seems like this regi - this regimen in the world's most populous country might be getting more attention than it is in this country. It's getting no attention."

They deliberately impose shorter prison sentences. Dozens of prosecutors were fired. So, what happened? Cause and effect? Well the most murders in a decade.

And it's, you know, everybody's pointing the fingers to police officers, to the Police Commissioner. And we're - fact of the matter is we're out doing the job. He's decimated the Philadelphia District Attorney's office. He has a great disdain and dislike for law enforcement. He let go many prosecutors his first week in, 31, to be exact.

He also hosts The Greg Gutfeld Show, which is excellent, and co-hosts The Five, of course, every night. He joins us tonight.

It consisted of fake diary entries from the Democratic front-runner, Robert Beto O'Rourke. Now, we don't know if Beto complained to Twitter about the account. But, if so, we can see why he did. The entries were spine-tinglingly embarrassing, the kind of crap you wrote in a spiral notebook freshman year after breaking up with your high school girlfriend, and discovering marijuana. Pretty amusing! Here's a selection from them. \"Have been stuck lately. In and out of a funk. My last day of work was January 2nd. It's been more than 20 years since I was last not working. Maybe if I get moving, on the road, meet people, learn what's going on, where they live, have some adventure, go where I don't know and I'm not known, I'll clear my head, reset, I'll think new thoughts, break out of the loops I've been stuck in.\" By the way, no periods in that sentence, just commas. Or this, \"Drove to Dalhart. Ate at the Grill. Was last there in August of 2017. Green Chile cheeseburger. The table over asked if I was Beto.\" Or this, my favorite, \"Found some crab claws. Maybe left by a bird. Walked out on a pier. Looked out, took some pictures. Leaned over, scooped up water and washed my face. Picked up beer cans that someone had left,\" and so on like that. Hilarious stuff! But you can see why Beto wanted it sup - oh, wait, no so (ph) we totally screwed that up. Those are actual quotes from Beto's real online diary. In other words, we couldn't make it up, but the Twitter feed was funny too. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. We have a surprise for you tonight, one night only, 9 P.M., Sean Hannity live from New York is next. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
