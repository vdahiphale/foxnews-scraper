Anyway, I will say this, before I get into my serious -- I actually believe what Holder is saying because I believe in the principle that you don't take the worst meaning or the worst intention of what somebody is saying. I don't believe he was inciting violence. He was basically saying you have to fight harder. Having said that, accusations of incivility, in my opinion, don't bug me at all. I think incivility is actually pretty good because it reduces the chance for violence. If you're uncivil with each other, it might mean you might not punch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The thing that bothers me is the incitement and enabling of a mob. So when you have Netflix employees, for example, stalking Kilmeade in order for a show on Netflix, and then inciting the passengers on the subway to join in in this orgy of persecution. What you have to look for is you have to look at people like that because persecution is like this contagion. It's like when you're in a mob, it spread through repetition. It can happen very easily. And I think we need to contrast words, again, and deeds. What Holder is saying is words. But you've got to look at the deeds. People are comparing Donald Trump, you know, his words, to left-wing deeds. I get it. Trump can be rude, his jokes can be mean, but there's no right-wing Antifa or occupy Wall Street. There's no right-wing Scalise shooting. There's no right-wing mob chasing people out of restaurants or Broadway plays. And there's no right-wing Netflix employees because nobody who's right-wing works at Netflix.",

      "utterance": "Yeah. Accusing an innocent man of gang rape for about two weeks is not exactly the high road. And where does Scalise get off lecturing people about violence. Anyway, I will say this, before I get into my serious -- I actually believe what Holder is saying because I believe in the principle that you don't take the worst meaning or the worst intention of what somebody is saying. I don't believe he was inciting violence. He was basically saying you have to fight harder. Having said that, accusations of incivility, in my opinion, don't bug me at all. I think incivility is actually pretty good because it reduces the chance for violence. If you're uncivil with each other, it might mean you might not punch. The thing that bothers me is the incitement and enabling of a mob. So when you have Netflix employees, for example, stalking Kilmeade in order for a show on Netflix, and then inciting the passengers on the subway to join in in this orgy of persecution. What you have to look for is you have to look at people like that because persecution is like this contagion. It's like when you're in a mob, it spread through repetition. It can happen very easily. And I think we need to contrast words, again, and deeds. What Holder is saying is words. But you've got to look at the deeds. People are comparing Donald Trump, you know, his words, to left-wing deeds. I get it. Trump can be rude, his jokes can be mean, but there's no right-wing Antifa or occupy Wall Street. There's no right-wing Scalise shooting. There's no right-wing mob chasing people out of restaurants or Broadway plays. And there's no right-wing Netflix employees because nobody who's right-wing works at Netflix."

They think he gets away with saying things that are untrue, and nobody is standing up and says, hey, this guy is misleading you, Republicans. Hey, where did you go, Republican Party? Come on back. Don't need to become Trumpian. But here's the thing, I listen all you guys, I think, wait a second. What kind of one-sided presentation is this?

Because, historically, whoever wins the presidency, as you know better than anybody, they don't do well in midterms. I think this is different. The economy is the best it's ever been, ever. Plus, I really think that Justice Kavanaugh, the way he was treated so horribly. This is a fine man.

And the goal of the Republicans is to keep that phone charged. And the only way you're going to keep that phone charged is with anger, which is what -- the Democrats are doing the same thing. They're relying on anger. But the problem with the Democrats, it's been the same anger for two years. The phone is already charged. So I don't know if you can add more charged to that phone. However, the Republicans, you know, they're charged but now -- every day it's going to get a little bit less. So the Trump rallies are a way to plug that phone back in, get that charge backup.

So now we're seeing Democrats and saying, well, this is beyond the pale. These are people who really don't play fair. And, you know, the vast majority of the country does believe in presumption of innocence. There's so many people in this country that regardless of their party lines are saying that the way Kavanaugh was treated, not just by Democrats but by the media, it was horrific. And many people who maybe don't buy into that philosophy of, oh, the media hate conservatives -- they're not part of that conservative really hard-core base. They're sitting back and saying maybe they do have a point because they watch what this guy was put through and how he was painted and they were completely appalled by it. So I think a lot of those people that may not have been pushed to vote are now saying, wait a minute, these Democrats are really -- went off the rails, and now I have to get out there because I'm fighting for basic tenets of our republic."

And in some states you see -- especially states that were purplish to red because it's energized the Republican votes there. But if you contrast that with what's going on, on the house level, it may have had a flip reaction, especially in terms of women, and suburban white women in particular. But overall, I think this emphasis from Republicans and the president on Kavanaugh is because that -- guess what, they haven't found something that's worked with voters for the midterms. So clearly, they'd hoped the tax cuts would work but it didn't work. They've hope the economy, the president even reference that on Fox & Friends today. And, again, most Americans don't think that the economy is a topic to vote on. The president had an op-ed that we've talked about a moment ago in USA Today this week, it was on -- guess what topic, health care. But again, that's the number one topic in these midterms, health care, and he's trying to position himself as not undercutting Obamacare or Medicare. But again, he's scaring people.

And to Juan's point, I don't think that the economy or the tax cuts wasn't working and they were flailing around looking for other things, I think you build on success, and the Kavanaugh confirmation was just another successful point. But the Democrats can't get out of their own way. They stepped into a hornets nest and instead of running away, they're lingering around and they keep getting stung. They keep talking about the definition of a mob. They keep talking about impeachment.

And it was a real special moment. You played a really important sound bite, and it was the sound bite where Kanye said this. Because China has stolen all of our factory jobs from the inner cities and from the core of America, it's gotten to the point where young black Americans are now taking risks and doing illegal things to feed their family, because they don't have access to good jobs on the streets anymore. And they're getting put in jail. And if you can solve that problem, and if you can get on, if you can get black America buy into the \"America first\" agenda, to the made-in-America agenda, to the trade agenda, to the energy agenda, that's going to have a huge impact on this country, where you have people coming together of all stripes -- of all stripes -- and fighting for a nationalistic, patriotic economic agenda for this country. It's really special. And the media already framing it as negative. They're saying this was an angry rant. When Taylor Swift or Katy Perry, they do those things, they're called, you know, expressions, soulful expressions, passionate. You don't hear that. So you've got to really keep in mind that the media is trying to trick your mind. And I just thought everybody needs to watch the raw of this footage. Because it was even more than you played.
