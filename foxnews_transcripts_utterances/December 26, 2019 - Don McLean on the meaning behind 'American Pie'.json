I hope you had a terrific Christmas, Happy Boxing Day or as I believe it's known in America, Thursday. 2019 was supposed to be the year of impeachment. The Democratic Party spent years promising it and it looked like they were finally going to deliver. They called witnesses. They held hearings. They summoned academics to deliver dull, pseudo-constitutional lectures to any American bored enough to watch the proceedings live. And finally last week, they voted to impeach President Trump. And yet, the President still isn't actually impeached. A week after the vote, Nancy Pelosi still hasn't forwarded the Articles to the Senate for a trial as is constitutionally required. Impeachment has been put on hold, maybe it was all a charade from the start. Or maybe Speaker Pelosi is too busy basking in the fawning, drooling, sycophantic praise of cable news talking heads."

Listening to that montage you had of the mainstream media, giving Nancy Pelosi a proverbial cat bath just reminds me that the rest of us ends up stuck with the hairball with this sort of bizarre circumstance where just weeks ago, it was Jerry Nadler and Eric Swalwell saying things like, nothing could be more urgent than this impeachment."

And what Democrats have done is they've really cheapened the impeachment process to any disagreement about the utilization of presidential power, or any disagreement at maybe a President's different type of approach to a particular problem set, all of a sudden becomes impeachable. Now, when they say in their court filings that they're not done investigating Articles of Impeachment, I actually believe them because they have no agenda for the American people.

And now, I think you can look back to the time directly after Robert Mueller's testimony where they wanted to impeach Justice Kavanaugh. They wanted to impeach Bill Barr. It's like they've got impeachment fever and there's no cure.

Tom Perez is a Dominican-American from Maryland. We've got other leaders and people who have run for office and more women and people of color in Congress than ever before, and none of them are Republicans, or very few. So again, I think that the party is diverse. The party is listening to people of color and to women, and that's the strength of the party. But what we need is somebody with conviction and that's where I think Bernie Sanders, he has got a lot of strength because he's been the same his entire career, unlike many of the other people that have run."

You've got these three guys who were born during the Chester Arthur administration or whatever it was. And so you've basically got the moderate geezer, you've got the Soviet geezer, and you've got the nanny state geezer. So it's like a game of conscience. It's dancing with the coot. How can you just have a party where the leading candidate, whatever lane you're looking, are all of these old guys and all the supposedly more fashionable candidates who can't get beyond two, three, or four percent?"

She couldn't decide what lane she's in. Biden has been in the same lane for his entire career, as has Bernie Sanders. And I think that that's their strength. And again, I think the problem is, and this is a funny thing about the right, is that the right wing oftentimes talks about, you know, black people wanting black candidates, but you notice -- or black people supporting black people and that being a race based thing, or brown people supporting brown people. But as you can see, we're more concerned about supporting people that are going to better people's lives, rather than the color of their skin. But I've heard Republicans actually say that if Alan Keyes were white, he would have been President of the United States.

      "speaker": "MANGUAL",
      "utterance": "Well, exactly. This is one of the big misconceptions about the tone of the criminal justice debate in the United States, right? The tone gives the impression that the criminal justice system is this overly Draconian kind of Orwellian entity that is oppressing people left and right. And the reality is, is that in a lot of cities across America, Baltimore being one of them, people are going actually pretty soft on crime. I mean, Maryland as a state has de-incarcerated really significantly and sharply in recent years. I mean, they cut their prison population by 10 percent between 2016 and 2017. That means more criminals on the street, and I think that's reflected in these numbers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "But they keep all these tough sounding law, you know, you're looking at three felonies, you're going to be in jail for 49 years. But the criminals unlike the public know that that, as a matter of policy, those are never enforced."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANGUAL",
      "utterance": "Right. They know better. I mean, the reality is, is that the United States have only about 40 percent of felony convictions result in a post-conviction prison sentence, right? That means 60 percent of the time, you're not actually going to prison. And when you do go to prison, about 40 percent of prisoners only serve about a year of their time, right? So they're back out in the street relatively soon, which is how you can get in a City like Baltimore a situation where you have offenders with 10 priors, and yet 36 percent of homicides are committed by people on probation or parole."

      "speaker": "ANNOUNCER",

This week, Bloomberg's campaign admitted to employing prisoners in Oklahoma to make phone calls on Bloomberg's behalf. Robby Soave is a senior editor at \"Reason\" and the author of the book, \"Panic Attack.\" He joins us now. The Bloomberg campaign has severed all connections with the Oklahoma Penal System. What actually is the objection to what Mayor Bloomberg accidentally found himself doing? Using prisoners to make campaign calls?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBBY SOAVE, SENIOR EDITOR, REASON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think everyone, right, left and center is going to agree, right, that it doesn't look good. It may be perfectly legal, but I don't think it looks ethical to be using people who are locked up to be making calls on behalf of your campaign. I mean, what kind of statement is that about your campaign if the people you're getting excited about it, literally, they have no choice to even leave the building? So I don't think that sends an enthusiastic message of a nation ready to fall in love with Michael Bloomberg and convince people to vote for him, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Yes, no, I hate it when you get campaign calls, but you sort of always assume it's a genuine volunteer, and when it's not, you kind of assume they've paid, you know, out of work actors or somebody to do it. The idea that it's a guy who is locked up in in jail, and he has got a choice between sewing mailbags or hammering license plates, or making telephone calls for Mike Bloomberg, it doesn't seem like a good comment on the health of his campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOAVE",
      "utterance": "No, I mean, maybe in some ways, it's somewhat symbolically fitting for Bloomberg. I mean, this is someone who is -- you know, he's not like an ideological far-left person. He is, I guess, he is a sort of centrist, but centrism can be authoritarian in and of itself. This is a man who wanted to arrest people for you know drinking extra large soda, for consuming fatty foods, for consuming flavored tobacco products. I mean you name it, it's not good for you. Mike Bloomberg thinks well maybe you should go to jail for using it or someone should go to jail for selling it to you. So there's a prison theme underlying this campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Right. Underlying his campaign. If I recall correctly, John Kerry wound up having to get rid of his telephone call. They had been outsourced to a call center in Ontario, which last time I checked wasn't an American state, but it is in the dominion of Canada. What do you think looks worse? Having to have your campaign calls made by Canadians or jailbirds?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOAVE",
      "utterance": "I think this is worse. Although, none there are good ideas, right? You're not creating American jobs in the Kerry case, and you're not creating well-paying jobs because these are people, you know, who are being paid far under minimum wage, and I don't object, by the way, to prisoners having tasks to do rather than kind of sitting in their cells being bored and not sort of bettering themselves or learning anything. But I don't think working on campaigns is the kind of thing that the prison system should be doing. Again, I think that strikes basically everyone as improper, if not illegal."

    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "No, that's not the least bit redemptive. Thank you. Thank you for that, Robby. Although, we should note that he has basically bought himself to five percent in the polls, and all the other people struggling to get to two, three, four percent without his money.

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's the Democratic Party's position, and if you're not sold yet, if you sense there might be a few links missing from that logic chain, Nancy Pelosi has an answer for you. It's not so much an argument as it as a cliched bomb, a dense cluster of familiar phrases designed to convey the impression that important facts are being delivered and profound thinking is taking place. It's like that old Don McLean song, \"Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.\" It doesn't actually mean anything, but it kind of moves you anyway."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But then we start thinking about it, we realize maybe that's not fair. \"American Pie's\" lyrics may mean something. To find out, we go to the man who wrote them. Probably the most famous songwriter in this country, Don McLean joins us tonight. Mr. McLean, thanks so much for coming on."

And I came up with this notion that politics and music flow parallel together forward through history. So the music you get is related somehow to the political environment that's going on."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCLEAN",
      "utterance": "This was all in my head, and it sort of turned out to be true because, you now have a kind of music in America that's really more spectacle, it owes more to Liberace than it does to Elvis Presley. And it's somewhat meaningless and loud and bloviating and, and yet -- and then we have this sort of spectacle in Washington, this kind of politics, which has gotten so out of control. And so the theory seems to hold up, but again, it was only my theory, and that's how I wrote the song. That was the principle behind it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So you set out to write as you said, a big song about America. And boy, did you succeed. Fifty years later, you know, it's one of the most famous songs ever written in English and one of the most resilient and resonant. I mean, we're still listening to it every day. What kind of reaction do you get from people to the song now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCLEAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I always -- the song has been part of their lives now. You know, I'm part of their lives and the albums that I made in the 1970s go along with that. But of course the kingpin is the song, \"American Pie.\""

You know, I've been doing this for so many years that I kind of make up a new show every night. But can I just tell you one thing about yourself that I've noticed, and that is that you do something that nobody else does. You get a guest on and then you ask them a core question and I think that nobody else does that. It's a very well thought out question. And nine times out of 10, the guests can't answer it, which makes it very amusing and fun because you don't get into a whole thing of going everywhere he wants to go, you make him come to that question. And that's very philosophical. That's Socratic. And I love that. I think that's terrific."

Chadwick Moore is a New York journalist and he joins us. Chadwick, people mocked Tucker's precis of this guy, creepy porn lawyer, but in fact, Tucker nailed the essentials of the guy when CNN and all these others fell for him and actually thought he was a credible presidential contender at one point."

I'm sure that the Adonis all-male review at the Rainbow Lounge have been thrilled to have him. As you know, he has plenty of -- plenty of lonely liberal women fans, the same women who I'm sure will be writing him letters in prison should he be convicted. But you're right that Tucker --"

I mean, if we must take this man's fate seriously, his lawyers are now arguing that when he demanded that Nike pay him $22.5 million that he was simply exercising his First Amendment rights and shaking down Nike is protected speech."

Okay, sure. But yes, you've have CNN turn this guy into hero. He was their -- he was America's sweetheart for a very long time on CNN. Brian Stelter, obviously, famously called him a very serious contender against the President. Too bad that career never took off the ground because he could have been using campaign donations to pay off his debts -- his alleged debts, I should say. But he's absolutely a craze to the media, and look at how they dumped and run from him and just, frankly pretend it never happened. That he wasn't on CNN over a hundred times while he was supposed to be representing Stormy."
