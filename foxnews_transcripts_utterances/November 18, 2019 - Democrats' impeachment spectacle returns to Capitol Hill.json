I feel like going into this second week, the Democrats already have the burden of proof, and it's a really high one. And last week, I don't think that they met it because even just from their own admission and their own coverage and their own headlines, if you read a lot of the coverage or if you even listened to some of the podcasts where they're talking about how the Democrats felt after Wednesday's testimony in particular, it was like, \"Oh, gosh, I don't know. Are we going to be able to keep this going?\" They continue to tell the same story over and over and over again. It's a short period of time.

No, it is hysterical. Again, the resentment the media holds for anyone who doesn't swallow their garbage is repugnant. You should give them the metaphorical finger to all of this because these insane people that implored you to take the dossier seriously, to take collusion seriously, to take the anti-Cavanaugh mob seriously, they've been wrong every time. It's all garbage. You know what you could do? I would binge watch -- by the way, our ratings are great so I think we can say this. We could take one for the team.

Like whenever he talks, it's like he's trying to recite a plot from a movie he saw when he was wasted a year ago, or he's talking about chem trails. The fact is, I would argue that marijuana, which I don't use, is the exact opposite of a gateway drug because pot smokers usually begin with pot and end with pot. It's a filter against other things. And they've seen that in studies. It's not something that -- if you want -- a real gateway drug is alcohol. People get drunk, lowers their inhibitions to try other drugs like cocaine or math or Special K or ecstasy, or glue. I saw a guy do an interesting thing the other day with a bag that he inflated over a cone. No idea what that is. People at home, if you know what I'm talking about, he sucked it through a bag."

And the problem is, in terms of the police and the law enforcement relationship with the community, was when somebody's compstat, which is, you know, part of NYPD statistic, some captain said, \"Listen, we've got to do more stop and frisk.\" So what they did was they set up a minimum number they had to do. So they were stopping and frisking all the time. The United States Supreme Court under Terry versus Ohio said stop and frisk, as long as you have some reasonable, articulable suspicion is OK. But they were saying, you know, we've got to be so much as you're not stopping and frisking on Park Avenue, you're only doing it in Bed Sty. Well, the reason at the time was there were so many homicides in Bed Sty, and it kind of got out of control. It was. It is a legitimate law enforcement tool."

The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\" Now, some candidates like Bernie Sanders, they're taking issue with Obama's comments. Bernie Sanders It depends on what you mean by \"tear down the system.\" When I talk about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, I'm not tearing down the system.

I do think, though, that he has now been supplanted. It's almost as if time moves so quickly that now Barack Obama is so far in the past that the party has passed him by. And if you have somebody like Bernie Sanders who's taking on the most popular Democrat in the -- in the country, which is Barack Obama still, and you see that his numbers don't go up very much. Whose does? Biden. Biden has been consistent all the way through. But I do think it's really amazing that Barack Obama has chosen to be pretty quiet. He went to this event. I don't think it was tied to Deval Patrick, but he went to this event on Friday night. Basically, he's sounding the alarm. But it seems to me they don't want to listen to him."
