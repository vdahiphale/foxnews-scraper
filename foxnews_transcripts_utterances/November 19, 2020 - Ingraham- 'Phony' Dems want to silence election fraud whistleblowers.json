Inside the box were stacks of ballots, one batch stood out, it was pristine. There was a difference in the texture of the paper. There were no markings on the ballots to show where they come from and where they had been processed? My estimate in observing these ballots, approximately 98 percent constituted votes for Joseph Biden and only observed two of these ballots as votes for President Donald J. Trump. Likewise a Fulton County poll observer made this stunning claim. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Many of the boxes of ballots had voted 100 percent for Biden and 0 percent for Trump.

Hundreds of these ballots seemed impeccable. The bubble selections were perfectly made, only observed sections in black ink and all happen to be selections for Biden. No corresponding envelopes seen in sight. I believe there was fraud committed in the presidential election and questioned the validity of the Georgia recount process. Again, that's from a Democrat. But the media, they don't care. They are barely even interested in the publicly known mistakes and problems in George's initial vote count. So far this week, county officials admitted to uncovering not one, not two, but three computer memory cards containing thousands of uncounted votes, mostly for Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In Cobb County alone, election officials allegedly forgot to upload 2700 votes. Fixing those mistakes netted Trump of 1400 votes well, that's not obviously enough to change the outcome in Georgia it's still no small matter for those people who voted. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Presidential elections have been decided by smaller margins, remember Bush V Gore in Florida by just over 500 votes. Stacey Abrams lost Georgia by a margin four times greater than Biden's current lead over Trump and we are still pretending as if she was robbed just last night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

In his deposition Glenn Sitak (ph) another observer were counted that he contacted Detroit police to file an assault complaint after an election worker shoved him away from the table. Well, there is also a sworn testimony of irregularities during the Georgia recount. A poll manager with 20 years of ballot handling experience in the Atlanta area provided this troubling account. Inside the box were stacks of ballots, one batch stood out, it was pristine. There was a difference in the texture of the paper. There were no markings on the ballots to show where they come from and where they had been processed? My estimate in observing these ballots, approximately 98 percent constituted votes for Joseph Biden and only observed two of these ballots as votes for President Donald J. Trump. Likewise a Fulton County poll observer made this stunning claim. Many of the boxes of ballots had voted 100 percent for Biden and 0 percent for Trump. Ballots appeared to be perfectly filled out as if almost they were preprinted with the presidential candidate selected. In Cobb County a poll observer who said she's a registered Democrat also noticed something odd about many of the ballots. Hundreds of these ballots seemed impeccable. The bubble selections were perfectly made, only observed sections in black ink and all happen to be selections for Biden. No corresponding envelopes seen in sight. I believe there was fraud committed in the presidential election and questioned the validity of the Georgia recount process. Again, that's from a Democrat. But the media, they don't care. They are barely even interested in the publicly known mistakes and problems in George's initial vote count. So far this week, county officials admitted to uncovering not one, not two, but three computer memory cards containing thousands of uncounted votes, mostly for Trump. In Cobb County alone, election officials allegedly forgot to upload 2700 votes. Fixing those mistakes netted Trump of 1400 votes well, that's not obviously enough to change the outcome in Georgia it's still no small matter for those people who voted. Presidential elections have been decided by smaller margins, remember Bush V Gore in Florida by just over 500 votes. Stacey Abrams lost Georgia by a margin four times greater than Biden's current lead over Trump and we are still pretending as if she was robbed just last night."

Now look, there have been a lot of frankly very outlandish claims made including one about a global effort to hack voting machines - so far, not backed up by evidence that I have seen and whether the ultimate outcome in a particular state would change if all this is worn out. Some of that hasn't been laid out, but those are largely besides the point that we are making tonight. If election laws are not applied and not followed consistently, if they are changed midcourse without proper legislative authority, it's reasonable to start questioning motivations and taking a serious, deeper look. If any vote is either improperly counted or discarded, it does matter. One illegal vote, one illegal vote cast nullifies a legal vote for the other candidate and it cancels it out. It undermines trust in the system and that itself is corrosive and that is the \"Angle\".

Democrats viciously attacked and threatened the GOP canvassers over their concern, even calling them racist. Well today, despite all of that intimidation, Monica Palmer and Bill Hartmann rescinded their votes and they joined \"The Ingraham Angle\" exclusively, thank you both for being here and having the courage to speak out. I want all of our viewers to see how you both were treated during this process, watch."

After some deliberation with Vice Chair, he offered an audit for unbalanced precincts, an audit comprehensive should be able to dig down and find the explanation of why the number of voters doesn't match the number of ballots cast.

There have been calls of universities to cancel Trump Administration officials across the country. We at the Leadership Institute for Campus Reform know that better than anybody, I've worked countless times with the Texas Federation of College Republicans against Texas Schools who have been trying to do this in a red state.

And the only thing these people have in common is that they should be allowed to speak there because Harvard is a space for ideas. It's a space for us to communicate and to battle out ideas, but when you try to box out people with ideas, when you try to censor conservatives, that's not what's happening and these progressives know that, they just don't want those ideas to permeate people's minds because they know we're right."

But he'll come up short; you would've said there is no way that would happen. But that is exactly the fact pattern. And then you put on top of that fact pattern all the irregularities we've seen, all the affidavits that have been signed, what you just had on with Bill and Monica the story they told what's happened to them for simply saying we've kind of like to know what happened? So we are saying with all those taking place, why don't we investigate in congress?

That drives me crazy, I would've loved to have had a chance to cross-examine that whistle-blower under oath in the American people frankly would have liked to know who this individual was who was the reason that the Democrats were trying to move the guy that they elected the President of the United States? So we've got time to get to the bottom of this. We have got 25 days till the Electoral College meets, they took four years to go after this fake Russian hoax, they took a year and half to go after President Trump with this fake impeachment.

You see that you've had just a few short weeks of people litigating election results in a court of law, and a lot of powerful people in the media and elsewhere have said that this undermines the country to in any way question this very close election in which you had this major uptick in mail-in ballots, which everybody knows are more susceptible to fraud, and at the same time that you decreased scrutiny of those ballots. So something totally reasonable, which is that people are questioning the legitimacy of this brand-new thing that we all rushed into this year. And what is just shocking for people hearing these comments is we just lived through four years of many prominent people spending much of every day questioning whether Donald Trump, or asserting Donald Trump was not a legitimate president. And this began immediately after his surprise election in November of 2016 and it continued for years in a really dramatic fashion. And these were high-profile people. You just pictured some of them, but these were people throughout the media, throughout the political establishment, who believed in a Russia collusion hoax, or they claimed to believe and they perpetrated that on the American people, saying that the Donald Trump was not the legitimate president but that he had stolen the election by colluding with Russia to become president.

I can understand it if people were dying, 10, 20 percent of the population that gets the disease would die from it. But the long acting consequences of this, the mental health problems, the divorce problems, we have mental health up -- I'm sorry, we have suicidality up 145 percent in certain counties, divorce rate is up 34 percent, alcohol binge drinking is up 40 percent. All these have long lasting effects."

They're also coming for your guns. A shocking story out of Virginia that's going to outrage every American who cherishes his or her right to self- defense. Don't go away."

      "utterance": "One of the biggest gun shows of the year was supposed to kick off this Friday in northern Virginia about 25 miles from our nation's capital. But Virginia's Democrat Attorney General Mark Herring stepped in and shut it all down over COVID fears. And then he smugly bragged about it on Twitter, \"Putting hundreds or even thousands of Virginians at risk for the sole purpose of selling guns is just not worth it.\" Joining me now is Ken Norman, owner of Red River Guns and Ammo who was supposed to be at the gun show tomorrow. Ken, you don't have a brick-and- mortar, so these gun shows support of your family, your livelihood, and that of so many others, don't they?"

    {
      "speaker": "NORMAN",
      "utterance": "Exactly. And we've had two COVID restricted shows already, and although some people at the guns shows feel like it's a violation of their rights, we all wore masks because, contrary to people's beliefs, we're not the dregs of society. We do care about other people. So we all wore masks. There was nothing burnt down, no violence. And this is with a room full of guns and ammo, largely Trump supporters. And you can walk across the parking lot to Walmart, and it's some wear their mask and some don't. So not only that, I ordered my parts for this show six months ago, but two more shows coming up that are big, those parts are on the way. So it's very scary and difficult. I've been traveling all day so I didn't get to hear the tweet. Roman was telling me a little bit about it, but I just really, really am insulted that somebody can think that we're just selling guns under the table, a bunch of rednecks picking barbecue out of their teeth and spitting bacco juice on the floor, and not following the rules. The majority of my clients are there for knowledge. They want to know the laws and how to operate a firearm safely. So I just ask this gentleman, whoever he is, just come out to the gun show and see for himself if he would let us ever have one."

      "utterance": "And by the way, I've been to a bunch of these gun shows in Virginia over the years, and it's a very diverse crowd. These are new immigrants. These are black, white, Hispanic, Muslim, these are people from all walks of life. This is not -- again, you're right, he should come and watch. But the same attorney general, by the way, praised the large scale Black Lives Matter gatherings and said in a statement from last May, peaceful protest demonstrations can and should continue. And then a tweet in June bragging about standing with his neighbors at an I can't breathe protest in Leesburg, Virginia. So he's concerned about crowds at a gun show, but not at Black Lives Matter and other protests. How is that consistent?"

We were definitely complying, and taking a look. There's three big gun shows. You've got Oaks in Philly, it's been canceled all year. They haven't had it. And then the big great American outdoor show in Harrisburg, it's a nine-day show in February, it's canceled."
