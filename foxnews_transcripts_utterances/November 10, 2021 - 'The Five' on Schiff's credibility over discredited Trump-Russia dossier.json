So, the D.A. never really looked into whether or not there was a possibility of self-defense. He just immediately indicted him. And what you are seeing today is a D.A. who was reacting to the whole scenario of what we were doing in a post George Floyd world, in an area where Jacob Blake had just been shot. You've got a young guy who was a, you know, new CPR, he was a police explorer, he was some kind of fireman cadet. He was a good kid. He went there to clean up the graffiti on the buildings. He has -- he was exemplified, on that witness stand what every defendant should learn to do. And that is to speak clearly, directly. He stops exactly where he should stop. He doesn't add any further information. He listens exquisitely to the questions, and he -- you know, there isn't even a knee down the part of the defense attorney to object to this prosecutor who is so desperate, so out of control that he's even got the judge going through the roof in that courtroom. The bottom line here is that this kid has established that when he shot Rosenbaum, the first victim, he was in fear for his own life. When he shot the second guy, Huber, he was in fear legitimately and reasonably of his own life, and when he shot Grosskreutz, the third guy who didn't die, for which he is being charged with attempted murder, he had legitimate grounds for which he used deadly physical force. So now the question is whether or not the prosecutor can prove now because the burden of proof has shifted beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not self defense. He can't do it. He can't.",

That is the story that is old as time that when there is no police, you become the policeman, hence the reason why you have cops. But I've learned a lot from this prosecutor. Number one, you have to let someone beat you over the head with a skateboard. If you defend yourself, that's on you. You should never shoot a guy pointing a gun at you because he hasn't shot you yet. And remember that. He made that very clear. You know, he hasn't shot you yet. And when a guy comes at you with a gun up close, he probably won't shoot you because he could have shot you maybe 10 feet earlier. However, he probably would have had a better chance to kill you up close. But that never would have happened because he would have done it already. And some - - but the bottom line is somebody pointing a gun at you is not enough for self-defense. You must be shot first. What -- the bottom line and Jesse nailed it. Rittenhouse was doing a policeman's job because he could no longer rely on the state or the politicians to provide cover protection for the police. The city was burning and going to hell unabated. So, this kid, rightly or wrongly, acting probably on his own instincts, felt that he could help.

Because this video, the drone, and all of the other information that's been brought together, it took a while to put together -- but this D.A. charged Rittenhouse within 48 hours. So, the D.A. never really looked into whether or not there was a possibility of self-defense. He just immediately indicted him. And what you are seeing today is a D.A. who was reacting to the whole scenario of what we were doing in a post George Floyd world, in an area where Jacob Blake had just been shot. You've got a young guy who was a, you know, new CPR, he was a police explorer, he was some kind of fireman cadet. He was a good kid. He went there to clean up the graffiti on the buildings. He has -- he was exemplified, on that witness stand what every defendant should learn to do. And that is to speak clearly, directly. He stops exactly where he should stop. He doesn't add any further information. He listens exquisitely to the questions, and he -- you know, there isn't even a knee down the part of the defense attorney to object to this prosecutor who is so desperate, so out of control that he's even got the judge going through the roof in that courtroom. The bottom line here is that this kid has established that when he shot Rosenbaum, the first victim, he was in fear for his own life. When he shot the second guy, Huber, he was in fear legitimately and reasonably of his own life, and when he shot Grosskreutz, the third guy who didn't die, for which he is being charged with attempted murder, he had legitimate grounds for which he used deadly physical force. So now the question is whether or not the prosecutor can prove now because the burden of proof has shifted beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not self defense. He can't do it. He can't."

Did he reasonably believed that his life was in danger, and was the force he used to defend himself appropriate? And it just seems to me that the kid -- now, he is a dopey kid with a hero complex. You know, he shouldn't have been there. He should not have had the AR-15 and all this and all the rest of it. But I think he walks to tell you the truth. I don't see how they touch him on the murder case, is the most serious charges. You know, the other one, what is it, recklessly endangering?

The prosecutor's office, corrupt Democrat district attorneys, release a falsely edited piece of footage to make it look like this was a cold- blooded racial execution attempt, when in fact Blake was a bad guy who was a rapist and had a knife, and was a danger to police officers and those people in that car.

And what did that do? It creates a void. Who fills that void? Well, sometimes thugs do, but other times well-meaning citizens who have had enough. That is the story that is old as time that when there is no police, you become the policeman, hence the reason why you have cops. But I've learned a lot from this prosecutor. Number one, you have to let someone beat you over the head with a skateboard. If you defend yourself, that's on you. You should never shoot a guy pointing a gun at you because he hasn't shot you yet. And remember that. He made that very clear. You know, he hasn't shot you yet. And when a guy comes at you with a gun up close, he probably won't shoot you because he could have shot you maybe 10 feet earlier. However, he probably would have had a better chance to kill you up close. But that never would have happened because he would have done it already. And some - - but the bottom line is somebody pointing a gun at you is not enough for self-defense. You must be shot first. What -- the bottom line and Jesse nailed it. Rittenhouse was doing a policeman's job because he could no longer rely on the state or the politicians to provide cover protection for the police. The city was burning and going to hell unabated. So, this kid, rightly or wrongly, acting probably on his own instincts, felt that he could help.

Therefore, if he is acquitted, you're going to have the same thing where people go, oh, my god, white guy -- white guy acquitted. He could do whatever he wants. Even though he shot white people, it doesn't matter because our -- because our media is interested in the racial divide more than anything. They're going to make it about race. Rex Chapman already did it on Twitter. And then, what's going to happen is you're going to have the activist class egged on by the media once again at CNN saying, you know, it is time to scream and yell and yes restorative justice can't take the shape of looting and arson.

What you've got is the prosecution, crossed the line that is as old as the constitution where you have a right to not incriminate yourself. And the -- and the prosecution is trying to make this kid someone who is not entitled to the right to remain silent. You know from every TV show you ever watch, you have a right to remain silent. But this prosecutor is saying, this is the first time you talked about it since you -- since this thing happened as if therefore you're not entitled to have the right to remain silent. And everyone in their mind when they go into the jury room is going to say, gee, I wonder. He had to think it all through and work it all through. That's a fundamental mistake by the prosecution. So, when the judge says, why would you even do that, I can't figure out why you would do it, the prosecution wants to push a mistrial here because the prosecution knows they're losing.
