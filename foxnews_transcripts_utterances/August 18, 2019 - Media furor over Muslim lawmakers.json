The press is also lambasting the president for helping persuade Israel to bar business by two democratic congresswomen who are Muslims. Is this really about Trump getting the press to focus on these freshman Democrats? And Anthony Scaramucci launches a media blitz against his former boss, saying he is so divisive Republicans should dump him while the president calls him a neurotic, nervous wreck, blasts \"The Mooch\" and a top White House spokesman about the bitter breakup. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" President Trump dominating headlines yet again with a new attack on two democratic congresswomen who are Muslims by successfully urging Bibi Netanyahu to bar the lawmakers who backed a global effort to boycott Israel from visiting the Jewish state."

Guy, it's obviously up to Israel to decide whether to admit these two members of Congress, just as clearly Bibi was influenced by his friend Donald, I think most people would agree. Whatever your views of these lawmakers, and I've criticizes Omar sharply for history of anti-Semitic comments, is it fair for the press to slam the president for taking a position on this?"

I think he is drawing attention to it which is part of his secret sauce here, forcing the press to cover something that they don't want to wouldn't have otherwise, which is looking into, for example, the group Miftah, this organization sponsoring the trip for Omar and Tlaib, had they gone to Palestine which is what was the word on their itinerary. This is a very radical organization that has backed terrorists in the past, has published all sorts of extremely anti-Semitic screens."

      "utterance": "I think it always benefits him when the \"Squad\" is the spotlight. We know Nancy Pelosi doesn't like because it doesn't help Democrats. For President Trump, he thinks this is a benefit to him especially in the upcoming election because if he can put the Democrats as far left progressives, as far as what their agenda is, it benefits him."

      "utterance": "As I said earlier, Trump did not have to make this such a personal issue but he has because he sees a political advantage and further polarizing Democrats and Israel. In the past, both parties have competed, who can show the love for Israel more right now? But it hasn't really changed much outside of the two members of the \"Squad\" we are talking about. They do have a more extreme view but we have had others like Paul Findley, the late Illinois representative who was also harsh critic of Israel and somewhat kind of controversy at that time."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I agree. I'm just giving a little historical context here. The resolution, they voted on resolution, Democrats denouncing some of anti- Semitic language by Omar. Let's move on to the economy because there was a pretty dramatic day this past Wednesday when the Dow plummeted more than 800 points. Guy, I'm watching all these anchors and liberal commentators saying this is the Trump meltdown. Obviously, there's been a slight of about 2,000 points over the last couple of weeks and obviously the president's trade battle and war with China has contributed to this. No question about it. But I did not notice the press rushing to celebrate the Trump market when it went from 18,005, the day he was elected, to more than 27,000 before the recent retrenchment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Of course not! They are gleeful now because the economy might be going south in some respects, and I do actually blame the president's policies on trade for part of it. I think that's reality that he needs to think about politically and just for the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Yeah, for sure. But the press is in some cases -- openly we've been cheering Bill Maher. He has said on his show repeatedly on the other end of the stink, saying that he is rooting, openly rooting for a recession to help Trump lose. I think that sentiments run relatively deep in newsrooms even if they may not come out and say it. Their coverage reflects the same time of instinct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "At least give him credit for honesty. He just comes out and --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Yeah, sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "At the same time, the president's conservative supporters in the media, Clarence, who constantly blame the press for not talking up to Trump bull market when everybody's 401ks were soaring, not having much to say about this latest line on Wall Street."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "I think we need to be careful of our language. We talked about coverage versus opinion. There's a big difference. Yeah, among the opinion people, you are going to find some folks who are going to be on both sides, whether recession is good for the country or not. But the fact, this one, you got -- every president brags about a good economy and credits themselves. When the economy goes bad, they find others to blame. Donald Trump was already finding people to blame, the media and the Federal Reserve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Clarence, you said that there are people on both sides of the question of whether or not a recession is good for the country."
    },

      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "I will explain it to you. Because --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Because of the way how (ph) Trump lose?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Trump -- by the way, I do not agree with Bill Maher on this. I also have a 401(k), by the way. Many members of the media do. But let's be realistic here. It's news. When the economy goes down at this point, especially when Trump is trying so hard to scuttle it --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, sometimes recessions are inevitable in the business cycle. But talk about looking for people to blame. Let us put the tweet up from the president. He says the other day, \"The fake news media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that would be bad for me and my reelection. The problem they have is the economy is way too strong.\" Beverly, what is he talking about the media crashing the economy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, you can even look to Joe Biden. Of course, he has been covered since he is the leader in the democratic nomination race right now who likes to talk about the economy when it is doing well, saying it's Obama's economy, and then once it starts having issues in the stock market, he blames it on Trump. We are seeing the media do the same thing but here is what they are not covering this much. Well, we are seeing the volatility in the market. I agree with Guy. I think there is reason we can point to Trump and the trade war. Trump also points out the Fed and what he's unhappy about when it comes to them, their interest rates and how they've handled it. We do see that unemployment is an all-time low, especially among African Americans. We see that wages are going up. So there are so many positives. The media aren't reporting on the positives that all Americans are seeing on a daily basis. It's not going to work in their favor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What you say is true. And, of course, it seems to me that -- we are talking here about is there a recession down the road or certain Wall Street indicators that may or may not happen. But it's remarkable to me, when the market goes down you have people blaming everything in the world on Donald Trump. Well, he screwed up Hong Kong. He is not taking a stronger stand. Well, the market thing is his fault. They just can't wait to pounce."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Let me turn to one more topic before we go to break and that is the following",
      "utterance": "President Trump also joins the media surprise over Jeffrey Epstein's prison suicide for retweeting a conspiracy theory by self- described actor and comedian Terrence K. Williams, who floated a link between the death and Bill Clinton with the hashtags Clinton body count and Clinton crime family. The president defended the move with reporters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "The retweet, which is what it was -- it was a retweet -- was from somebody what's a very respected, conservative pundit. So I think that was fine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over)",
      "utterance": "Do you really think the Clintons are involved in Jeffrey Epstein's death?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I have no idea. I know he was on his plane 27 times and he said he was on the plane four times. So you have to ask, did Bill Clinton go to the island? That's the question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Whether or not this guy is a respected pundit, is the media criticism fair or unfair in saying the president should have declined to spread to his 62 million Twitter followers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Fair, of course. Of course, the president should not have done this. Some of the questions he asked about Bill Clinton and the plane and the island, I think those are fair game. But to come out as the president of the United States to link your political opponents and your predecessor in the White House to this suicide or death, I think, is really irresponsible. Then again, he also accused Ted Cruz's father of killing John F. Kennedy during the 2016 campaign. So, this is par for the course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He didn't accuse him. He pointed to reports and the National Enquirer --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "No, it's the same type of thing."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Look, Bill Clinton was a friend of Jeffrey Epstein many years ago and did fly in his plane. I mean, Donald Trump was also a friend many years ago. We're talking here 15 or 20 years ago. That does not mean that either of them was involved in what the medical examiner has now ruled was a suicide by Epstein in prison."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "So why does Donald Trump care about it so much? Because he wants to, once again, put not just the two \"Squad\" members' faces on the Democratic Party but also Jeffrey Epstein. The fact this is Donald Trump, asked the question on Bill Clinton, said he don't know, what about Donald Trump? But then again, what is the question? Who cares?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "They were not on the plane together. Look, Donald Trump is not the only person to weigh in to this question of what really happened with Epstein, who was of course a convicted sexual predator and accused of being a sex trafficker. Many people in the media have indulged in all the speculation and conspiracy theories. One of Epstein's powerful friends must have him killed. Now, we know from the autopsy that he hung himself. So, what do you make of the press performance on this matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "I think they love to follow the president on Twitter. I think the president knew that putting this out was a little bit controversial because he did not add a comment to it. It was a retweet. He didn't have comment to it."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "But I would say, with all of this, the president is using this as pointing to the press, always points out conspiracy theories. He had a follow-up tweet taking about, of course, what they did with Russia. So I think that Trump loves to weigh into this because he know the media are going to cover it and he's always going to point it back to Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He knows it is (INAUDIBLE) for the media and so often that is true. Let me get a break here. When we come back, the press is making Joe Biden's gaffes a front and center issue with ample help from Donald Trump on occasion. Later, Charlie Gasparino and his interview with Jeffrey Epstein a few months before his death in prison."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joe Biden has been making gaffes for a long time. Trust me. I've covered him for a long time. But now that the 76-year-old former VP is the democratic front runner, the press is focusing on these missteps, raising new questions about his age."

Yes, you are tough on certain issues including on this program, including harsh some of his harsher rhetoric against the press but you largely defended him, you wrote a book largely praising him. And now they are saying what took you so long."

      "utterance": "A thing is a very justifiable criticism and I will be, I will have an editorial in the Washington Post this week that fully elicit it. Frankly, I don't have enough time on your show to fully elicit it but here's what I would say to those people on the left. We recognize that the president is a clear and present danger to the American society, the American culture. There are many people inside the White House and in the cabinet, I would ask the left to let's create an off-ramp for those people because when you're trying to deprogram people from a cult, one of the first things you have to do is allow them to change your mind. And you have to allow them to have the space to change her mind. So, me, it was a very gradual process and they can be very critical of me for that. I frankly owned that. But trust me, there's a ton of people inside that White House, inside the government, up on Capitol Hill to feel the exact same way. And I would just caution those people on Capitol Hill. When their poll numbers start to go in the direction of the president's, I know they're intimidated by his bullying now and I know they are intimidated by the force of his personality and his nonsense but don't be."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I know that you're saying that you speak for some Republicans who were -- aren't willing to say these things publicly. But look, you have been a very popular guy this week. You been all over MSNBC and CNN. You sat down with Don Lemon when the premiere of Trump bashes on cable news and you are on MSNBC with Omarosa. Sean Spicer says your defection is, I'm quoting here, \"catnip for the left- wing media to go out and use somebody like you to create a controversy.\" Does he have a point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, he has a point and I think it's a very good talking point. But you know, listen, people can see through the camera, in their living rooms, that that's not really my personality. I got brutally fired by the guy, if I was going to break from the guy why would I just have broken right then and there? I tried to stay loyal to his agenda and his mission but I'm also balanced today. I'm also pointing out there's a lot of things that he's done as it relates to the economy, has been very helpful. The racial stuff has been very hurtful. And what I would say to Sean Spicer and others, ripping the social fabric of the country is a cancer, it's a metastatic cancer. Having a recession here or there, that's a bone break we can survive it. But what he is doing and the way he is processing that, and I said it on your show a few weeks ago, I said, please stop doing that. It is un- American. And it's not good for our country."

So, were you just swallowing all of this while you are largely -- and you informally spoke to him sometimes, you largely a defender on television? Were you just sort of, I mean, did you have terrible judgment? Because now you're coming out expecting all of us to believe the guy is a terrible leader, the guy who you supported."

    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "-- people who are on this need to -- OK, people in cult need to be deprogramed so therefore you have to create an off-ramp for them. But on this specific question, again, I'll say the exact the same thing to you that I said three weeks ago so that you can see it's consistent. There's a lot of things that the president has done. Economically, delayering the administers state, deregulation, the tax reform by and large has helped corporate America become more competitive. There are a lot of things that he has done. But as I said on this show three or four weeks ago, if he continues down the path of projecting racism to try to split the country, people like myself will break from him. So, this is a, you know, to me, it's been a gradual, painful process, frankly. And if you want to question my judgment, that's fine."

In terms of your -- I want you to be able to respond to what Hogan Gidley said about people like you, when they see a moment they can profit personally from turning on the president, because it makes them more popular with the rest of the media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Right. Hogan Gidley has seen my S-86, which is my financial disclosure. I'm not interested in anything like that. What I'm interested in is real leadership and less division. And I think that's the most important thing for the country. So, Hogan can say that, I get that, he's got a very tough job. I don't even take it personally. I'm sure he's terrorized in fear most of the day dealing with the guy."

And Charlie Gasparino is back with us. You talked to him in March several times on background. Obviously, that's out the window he is dead. I know you called on a business story, but you ended up talking to him about the actual sex crimes which he was convicted. And you asked him to describe the sex acts that landed him in jail. Can you tell us about that?"

    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",

I was doing a story about him, and whether he was a government witness on Wall Street related crimes which accounted for his lenient sentence back in 2009. I called his lawyers. I called prosecutors. I called people that were involved in some of the prosecutions."

Jeffrey, in your words explain to me what went down? And that's when he explained to me that, he said, listen, Charlie, I'm not a pedophile. He said the only thing worse than being called a pedophile is be called a hedge -- is being called a hedge fund manager. I'm not one of those either. He always describes himself as high-end money manager not a hedge fund manager."

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And I said this to him. I said, I'm assuming, you didn't really know. And he was yes, yes, sure. And then he said, listen Charlie, this isn't all that much different than what happened to Bob Kraft. Remember Robert Kraft earlier in the year was charged with soliciting a prostitute."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, listen, it was a dismissive conversation. I really think, I mean, what's fascinating about Epstein -- and I have another piece on foxbusiness.com that's going to be posted soon -- is it was his arrogance that allowed him to think he can get away with anything. That allowed him to basically have a business career, push forward throughout his business career, re-establish himself largely, even after he got out of jail."
