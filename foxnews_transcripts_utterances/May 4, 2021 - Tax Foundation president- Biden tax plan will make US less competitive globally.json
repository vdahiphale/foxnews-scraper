We see price hikes across the board, seafood and eggs and oranges and lettuce. And I could go on and on to talk about things like, well, gasoline and appliances, chicken and, well, you name it, still more vegetables. The latter part with vegetables, that can still happen. It's a nonevent, but I'm sure, for the healthy among you, it's a big event to you.

But in the grocery store, it's starting to go up a little by little by little. For example, I bought this loaf of bread at the grocery store. It cost me 30 cents more today than it did a year ago. Doesn't sound like a lot.

And the higher jet fuel costs also hurts airlines, which all tumbled today on the back of higher oil prices. Now, while money was coming out of stock markets, Neil, average Joes, even the pros, they're going crazy over cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin.

After all, if you can buy a Treasury bond or note from Uncle Sam fully guaranteed, why would you risk it in the market? That's, again, one of the fears, even though those rates are still very, very low. Let's get the read from Danielle DiMartino Booth, a former Dallas Fed adviser, I might point out, and our own Scott Martin wasn't even alive when we had the last inflation spiral. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, Scott, that makes you a perfect guy to talk about what's happening right now. I think there's a generation of people who don't remember this, but are freaking out about it, because they have heard people talk about when it was much higher. They just know that it's higher than what they're used to. What do you tell them?",

I still do wear a mask when I'm in close public places, because not everyone has had the opportunity to be vaccinated. There are people at risk. And even though I'm fully vaccinated, I still have a small percent chance of harboring virus and potentially giving it. So I do wear a mask and comply with all regulations.

He said: \"We all need to be working as one.\" And he made it clear, if we're -- if we're able to win the majority, remember, majorities are not a given, he said. They are earned.

So, clearly, very little appetite among those Republicans in power for Liz Cheney, who has constantly gone back at Donald Trump and the big lie, as she called it, addressing it earlier this week at a conference.

Doesn't sound like a lot. But when you start compounding that and everything you buy is a little bit more, then that gets -- adds up a little bit. Now, the data is showing that 3.5 percent year-over-year increase in the stuff we buy, in average, on average, in the grocery store, is more expensive. Now, within that, some very interesting things. Take a look at this, cereal and bakery products, 2.6 percent more from last year to this year, meat, poultry, fish eggs, 5.4 percent increase in prices, dairy, 1.6 percent, fruits and vegetables 3.8 percent, non-alcoholic beverages 3.2 percent.

      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "Yes, so Yellen's comments really goes against the efforts by the Federal Reserve chairman, Jay Powell, who has been trying to talk down interest rate expectations. And he just told \"60 Minutes\" less than a month ago that interest rates were highly unlikely to go up this year. So, Wall Street was a bit confused. And you saw the selling accelerates after Yellen's comments. We saw the worst day for the Nasdaq since March, worst day for the S&P and the Dow in just about a week's time or so. Now, investors were busy ditching the large technology companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google, stocks have really dominated over the past year. And, meantime, you did see it, though. Prices are going up for energy, for instance, highest that we have seen in seven weeks for oil, which means Americans are paying $2.91 now at the pump for a gallon. And the higher jet fuel costs also hurts airlines, which all tumbled today on the back of higher oil prices. Now, while money was coming out of stock markets, Neil, average Joes, even the pros, they're going crazy over cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin. Take a look at Ether, which is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world, hitting a record high. And so did -- Elon Musk promoted Dogecoin. Dogecoin started off as a joke back in 2012, up more than 11000 percent this year. So, yes, Neil, prices are going up."

Now, I know a lot of you are looking at this and saying, oh, my gosh, you're losing your head. How bad does this all get? I have to remind you that this is still relatively contained. And for those of you who are getting a little nervous about a 3 percent something mortgage, did I ever tell you the time my wife and I got our first mortgage and it was over 13 percent?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "My point is, my point is that it has been a lot higher and a lot worse. But, again, it's the trend that has some folks worried on Wall Street, and that could eat into earnings and real gains that we have been seeing and be competition for stocks as well. After all, if you can buy a Treasury bond or note from Uncle Sam fully guaranteed, why would you risk it in the market? That's, again, one of the fears, even though those rates are still very, very low. Let's get the read from Danielle DiMartino Booth, a former Dallas Fed adviser, I might point out, and our own Scott Martin wasn't even alive when we had the last inflation spiral. So, Scott, that makes you a perfect guy to talk about what's happening right now. I think there's a generation of people who don't remember this, but are freaking out about it, because they have heard people talk about when it was much higher. They just know that it's higher than what they're used to. What do you tell them?"

We have been facing this inflation bugaboo now for, say, three decades, since the '70s at least. And so if you look at the pace at which, though, inflation is starting to increase, and now we're getting that pickup in economic growth -- obviously, we have a lot of government spending behind that as well -- you're starting to see some of the inflation numbers catch up. And you make a good point. Even though inflation may double from here, let's say, and get up say, oh, my gosh, close to 4 percent, that's nothing like we have seen in past decades. But it still is going to feel like a lot different of an environment than we have had in the last several years, where basically we were growing for free, without inflation and without much wage growth either."

Danielle, you know these figures far better than I, but I was reading that, for the next couple of quarters, it looks like we're going to be borrowing upwards of at least $1.25 trillion to support the spending already committed. Forget about the trillions more the president is planning on. So, that generally means still higher rates. What do you think?"

If you're asking me, I think that that's one of the reasons that Janet Yellen stepped into her old self, as former head of the Federal Reserve today, and mentioned the specter of rising interest rates, which is, by the way, not under her purview. That is strictly Jay Powell's world. But if she's advocating..."

      "utterance": "Why did she do that? Danielle, why did she do that? Now, she's a former Federal Reserve chairman. I get that. But she was stomping on someone else's turf. And I wonder if that was by design, or what did you read into that?"

      "speaker": "DIMARTINO BOOTH",
      "utterance": "There is -- look, Neil, there is no way in the world that she did not understand the weight and the magnitude of what she was saying. In theory, the Federal Reserve official leaders should not talk about the U.S. dollar. That is the place of the U.S. Treasury secretary. Vice versa, the U.S. Treasury secretary is not supposed to be talking about interest rate policy, which is supposed to be set by an independent, apolitical, unelected group of individuals. Jay Powell has spent the last part -- the better part of the last week insisting that they're not even thinking about thinking about slowing the growth of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, which, by the way, is step one before they can even contemplate raising interest rates. And she just beat him well over the finish line and slaughtered all of the messaging that he has carefully crafted for the past weeks and months. So, this was very unusual, and, I would add, highly inappropriate."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Scott, if you think about it, the backdrop for this is all good news, companies earning money hand over fist. They're doing much better than thought. The technology companies, the very ones getting beaten down yesterday and today, are the ones that are reporting these off-the- chart numbers, retail sales soaring, car sales doing very, very well, consumer confidence the highest in years. So, that's the backdrop. I guess the balance to that backdrop is, people fear rates go still higher, and it could be a short-lived good market environment. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "MARTIN",

And, two, Neil, inflation isn't a bad thing, as long as it's not out of control. And we will actually see that show up in stock prices if these companies have pricing power, which they're starting to get. So, as long as this pace doesn't go out of control, some normalization of the interest rate curve, some normalization of interest -- of inflation rates, rather, should be good for this market, and it should be able to tolerate it."

And I do want to put in perspective here that this is all still pretty low -- low-hanging inflation for the time being, but it starts somewhere and it goes somewhere. What the markets were digesting today is, they don't know where all this is going. And we don't know where taxes are going. Remember when there was a big kerfuffle about a top capital gains rate of 43.4 percent? Well, now a figure to beat, that 61 percent. For some looking at inherited wealth, you're going to pay through the nose."

      "utterance": "I'd have to talk to our number crunchers about the specific example you gave. I don't know what percentage of people have $100 million in capital gains. Maybe you know. That sounds like quite a lot to me. But the fundamental value here the president is conveying is that his proposals are about and making a historic investment in education, in childcare. That's going to make us more competitive to compete with China, to bring more women back into the work force. He's proposed a way to pay for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, and that way to pay for it might be, for some of the wealthiest families, their heirs to pay a rate north of 61 percent. It comes little more than a week that we learned that the top capital gains rate could balloon to 43.4 percent. So, the advertised rates you often hear are done in by higher rates that are pretty much in the ready. The read on all of this from Scott Hodge, The Tax Foundation. He's the president there. They were the ones who crunched these numbers and came up with these numbers. And, Scott, to hear the White House spokesman put it, this is really for the ultra-rich, essentially, so no need to worry. You say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT HODGE, PRESIDENT, TAX FOUNDATION",
      "utterance": "Well, no. She said, oh, I don't know how many people that would affect. Oh, quite a few, actually. What we're talking about is really our privately owned car dealerships, our small hotel chains, restaurant chains, a successful manufacturer of PPEs, for instance, who built up a business over a lifetime, and then their estate gets hit twice under the Biden plan. Of course, it gets hit by capital gains. Say, if you have a $100 million business that you have you have left, and you have built it up from zero, so it's $100 million with a capital gains, they want to hit you with that 43.4 percent tax right off the bat. And then there's the estate tax, which is a tax rate of 40 percent. And so, once you have done the math and taken account of the exemptions, you're down to a tax rate, an effective tax rate of over 61 percent. And so now your heirs are left with just a small fraction of that successful fortune that you put together over a lifetime."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, you know their argument will be it affects the view, it won't spill over to the many. They understand maybe the business argument you make and those that will go ahead and apply under the individual rate. But we are seeing a pattern here to a lot of these numbers that are not as advertised, in other words, provisions that could easily send -- for those who pay the top rate, and depending on the state in which they live, well over 50, 55, in some cases close to 60 percent. So, the trend is up. The question is how far up, because, even with all these record tax increases the president plans, they don't come close to paying for all the money he wants to spend. So, they either go up still more on the wealthy, or we expand the pool of those who will pay taxes. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "Well, he talks about trying to make sure that he's protecting people who earn under $400,000 a year. Well, that's not so easy. You can direct where the tax bill is paid, but you can't protect or insulate the rest of the economy and regular folk from the economic harm of those decisions. We estimate that those provisions alone would raise about $215 billion over the next decade. And, overall, the tax increases that he's proposing would have serious harm to the economy and overwhelming any of the economic benefits that might come from some of those other transfer payments or any of the infrastructure that he's talking about. And so what you have got is a smaller economy, fewer jobs, less investment, and yet a whole bunch of government spending that doesn't make up for the harm that is done by the taxes."

    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "Well, I do. I think, number one, there's not enough wealth at the top in order to pay for everything they're talking about. But he is handing out a lot of goodies. Look, we estimate that, because of the expansion of the child tax credit, that some 58 million Americans will pay zero income taxes this year. And many will get an actual refund even if they pay nothing because of the generosity of these credits. And so there's a lot of goodies being handed out here that are kind of blindfolding people to the possible economic harm of the tax increases on both corporations and the rich. Now what we're going to have is a small -- smaller economy that's less competitive globally, because he's trying to pay for his infrastructure and spending programs with the most harmful taxes possible. Those are tax increases on corporations and successful individuals. These are really success taxes that he's trying to fund his programs with."

The president's also trying to make it more fun to get vaccinated by bribing those reluctant with discounts at grocery stores for shoppers to get vaccinated on site and by teaming up with major sports leagues to provide special promotions for fans."

We set up 70,000 sites, including 40,000 pharmacies. This is what it looks like. And let me emphasize that 70 percent is not a magic number. But what we're seeing right now in 39 out of 50 states is the R -- not to get geeky -- but the R is less than one, means -- meaning that cases are continuing to decline, even in places like Texas, that are fully open with 100 percent occupancy, with everybody going around their daily business. So, we are -- really, that light is almost at -- we're at the end of the tunnel right now. We're seeing it, and, again, very achievable by July 4 to get that percentage of 70 percent done."

And then we are going to be immune from what's going on there. The one danger is that, given the extreme spread, like in India, the numbers of people, the sheer volumes, that we could pop a strain that would be difficult for the vaccines to overcome. So, right now, I think we need to support everyone. It is a catastrophe in India and many countries.

If you're fully vaccinated, and you're around other people that are vaccinated, whether that's in a party or a cruise ship, you don't need to wear a mask. You just really don't. The chances are so low of you having it, of you transmitting it, of you giving it to someone, that you really don't need that. We didn't need to wear masks outside anyway. It was a big non-moment last week when the CDC said, if you're vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask outside. We didn't need to do that the entire time. I still do wear a mask when I'm in close public places, because not everyone has had the opportunity to be vaccinated. There are people at risk. And even though I'm fully vaccinated, I still have a small percent chance of harboring virus and potentially giving it. So I do wear a mask and comply with all regulations. But, look, where the president is talking us about being in July 4, most of the country is there already. Texas, Florida, we're open. The economy's booming. Nationally, we're only 14 percent down in mobility from pre-COVID. So we are almost back to normal, except for those few states that are still reluctant to do the normal things like open businesses and get kids back to school."

We will tell you all about it -- after this."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, welcome, everybody. There's been a bit of a kerfuffle in the media about what House Leader Kevin McCarthy had to say when he thought he was all fair on a hot mic when discussing the state of affairs right now with Liz Cheney in the House leadership on \"FOX & Friends\" this morning. I'm far more focused right now on what he said on air, realizing he was very much on air, when talking to \"FOX & Friends,\" saying that he's heard from members concerning Liz Cheney, concerned about her ability to carry out the job, as a conference chair, to carry out the message."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "He said",
      "utterance": "\"We all need to be working as one.\" And he made it clear, if we're -- if we're able to win the majority, remember, majorities are not a given, he said. They are earned. And that's about the message about going forward. So, clearly, very little appetite among those Republicans in power for Liz Cheney, who has constantly gone back at Donald Trump and the big lie, as she called it, addressing it earlier this week at a conference. And it has separated the party between those who want to move on from Donald Trump and those who have long memories regarding the treatment of Donald Trump. I want to explore that in more detail with Amanda Makki, the Republican strategist, Michael Starr Hopkins, Democratic strategist. We have also Tiana Lowe with us of The Washington Examiner. So, Tiana, I end it with you. Let me begin with you and the reaction a good deal two off mic comments attributed to Kevin McCarthy, which are blistering, but it's what he has said publicly even on air, when he thought he was on air, on \"FOX & Friends\" that are almost as damning, that she might not be welcome in leadership. What do you make of that?"

      "speaker": "TIANA LOWE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "So it's not very promising for Liz Cheney, considering that McCarthy did have her back to an extent during that first initiative to try and oust her from House leadership. That being said, this is a really political dicey situation for Republicans, because, if they punish Liz Cheney more for saying the truth, that the election was not stolen from Donald Trump, than they punished Marjorie Taylor Greene for spreading QAnon insanity and saying previously anti-Semitic remarks, that's not a great calculus. That being said, having leadership that is not united is not great for anyone in the GOP."

And, certainly, President Trump has made no bones about it who he is going to primary and who is going to be personally involved with in their races. And Liz Cheney is someone who has fought back against President Trump. And he -- she has said all along that what happened on the 6th, the insurrection, was his fault, and she has never backed off from that. And I think that has caused the situation to escalate. And Kevin McCarthy, kind of being backed in a corner right now, is doing what he thinks he has to do, which is follow Trump's lead."

And I think Republicans are worse off for it, because, rather than having actual philosophical debates, this is more of an ideological/cultish mentality, that it's hurting the party. And by hurting the party, it's hurting our democracy, and it hurts the voters. We're seeing it all over the country in places like Florida..."

And whether it's cultish on one end -- no, no, you're right -- and there are two sides to whether Republicans, it's cultish on one end being loyal to Donald Trump, and another part of the party saying, well, cool it with the Donald Trump fixation. But, Tiana, I'd be curious about where you see it all going, because you could look at the rising fortunes of Ron DeSantis or a Kristi Noem in Florida and South Dakota respectively, that they are rising figures in the party precisely because of their handling of the pandemic, and might be credible candidates whether or not Donald Trump decides to run. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "LOWE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I think that, if the Republican Party wants to win elections in the future, Ron DeSantis really should be one of those leaders. He really shouldn't be the future of the party. Donald Trump's legacy could have been adding -- making major gains with Hispanics, that he did improve vastly over the past GOP. Ron DeSantis outperformed Donald Trump among Hispanics. This is a viable, working coalition that can bring in some of the populist base, bring in some of the good of Trumpism, while expunging the bad. Ron DeSantis, he will have discipline. He will not just bring a knife to gunfights, like Donald Trump used to."

And you had those who are very, very loyal to Donald Trump and would do anything and everything for him and those who are not. And I wonder whether this, to Michael's point, gets to be such a divisive issue that the party will be grabbing defeat from the jaws of otherwise victory. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKKI",
      "utterance": "Well, I do think there is a divide in the party. There are a lot of people who would support someone like Governor Ron DeSantis. There are also a lot of people that still support Donald Trump and believe he is the leader of the party. Look at the CPAC poll, just as an example. President Trump won that. And so I think people look at him still as the de facto leader, with very little media coverage. He has no social platforms anymore. He's still out there quite a bit, and he is still revered. He's still a kingmaker. And so I think those things are all very important factors. But who is a distant second? Ron DeSantis. And if you look at what Governor DeSantis has done in the state of Florida, really betting on Floridians to make the best decisions for themselves, taking away that mask mandate yesterday was hugely important for businesses here and for all Floridians. I think this is really important, what he's done and the steps he's taken."

So, bottom line here, you don't really have to focus on what someone is saying off mic to hear very clearly what he was saying on mic, when he thought he was on air, that he has problems with Liz Cheney.

Of course, for year after year after year, he was the world's richest man, now the fourth richest. But he and his wife, Melinda Gates, are splitting up after 27 years, dividing an empire that, between them, under Washington state law, I guess, where they're technically domiciled, would have to be split 50/50. Mercedes Colwin, FOX News legal eagle, expert all things law. How do you think that goes, Mercedes? What are the requirements in Washington state as far as separating property after you separate?"

Usually, there's really no math, there's no formula. It says 50/50 down the middle. But, here, the Gateses did something a little differently. They have a private agreement. They have a separation agreement. They are dividing the assets in the property pursuant to the agreement. In the formal filing, they actually refer to the agreement. They have now filed the agreement. And so there's all this buzz whether there was prenup, postnup. We don't know. What we do know from the public filing that has been made available is that they do have the separation agreement, and all of the property will be divided pursuant to that agreement. The agreement has not been filed."

These are two absolutely brilliant individuals that have this enormous compassion and passion for this foundation and all the great work that they do globally. So they are continuing to do it, which I think is -- which is wonderful for the foundation to have these two individuals continue in the foundation. And it does -- and you're right about -- there is -- seems to be a very amicable split. Doesn't seem that there's any sort of animosity. We have not heard at all that there's a third party involved. In fact, we do know that Bill Gates had mentioned -- had stepped out of the board for Microsoft back in March of 2020, saying that he was going to focus on his family. So, perhaps that was the -- just the work/life balance was continuing to be a challenge for him. So, he stepped away from the board and continued to focus on family. Unfortunately, it didn't work out, and here we are. But, to their credit here, they're going to work together to the foundation. And we will just have to see where it goes. But it certainly seems that it's -- there's a bright future with the two of them at the helm."

It didn't hurt anyone. But the fear was that it might, because they couldn't tell where the heck it would land. Fast-forward to today, where a Chinese rocket that detached from a space station could make an uncontrollable reentry somewhere on Earth. Clayton Anderson joins us right now, the former NASA astronaut. I guess there's no way to tell where this thing will land. But it's pretty big, right, Clayton?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLAYTON ANDERSON, FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT",
      "utterance": "Yes, I understand it's pretty big. It was part of their first stage of the rocket that took their base block module for their new space station. So, unfortunately, it made it into orbit, which, in America, we typically design the trajectories to not allow those big pieces to get to orbit, so they can drop safely in the Pacific Ocean somewhere. So who knows where this one's going to hit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Another thing, Clayton, I heard, they're going to have a couple of more launches, the Chinese, with similar type setups. So we will have maybe a couple of these down the road that will do this, because the Chinese are not saying this is a problem at all. And some have said it's very akin to the way we did things in the early days of the space program. I have no idea. But are you worried that this could be intact or do a lot of damage, giving its sheer size, especially if it were to fall on land?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously, there's a greater than zero chance that it might hit somewhere on Earth where it could do some damage. But I talked to the folks in Mission Control earlier today. And they assured me that there's no concern for this item at this time. The issue with these things is that, depending on how big they are, and whether they're tumbling or not, that creates uncertainty in the ability to track their trajectories. But we have a lot of folks around the world that track that sort of thing. So it looks like it's not going to be an issue to anyone, and hopefully it'll fall safely and quietly somewhere where nobody cares."

      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "I -- that, I do not know, Neil. I know that the rocket that they shot to get their base block up there was pretty good size. And I read on the Internet some of the -- it's like 23,000 pounds or something. And I don't remember what Skylab was. But the good thing is, when this thing starts to come through the atmosphere, pieces will burn up, hopefully start to disintegrate. So that makes it a little better, in that it becomes smaller, but then you have more pieces that you have to worry about tracking. But, typically, those things create a footprint that -- where the first piece will hit here. And if it's breaking up, the last piece will hit within that foot. And that's the piece -- the foot -- is what we have to worry about."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. And that meteor over Russia, that did burn up in the atmosphere and it created -- exploded, basically, and created a big pressure wave. And that pressure wave did some damage. I don't think -- when this one explodes, I think it'll be high enough up that there won't be any issue from a pressure wave. It may just be the pieces that fall to the ground. But I don't think that it's going to be an issue. The Earth is a pretty big place."
