And the best way we can try to repay their service is by issuing what is called a Special Immigrant Visa and allowing them and their families to come to America. Here's a statement from Congressman Michael Waltz. He's a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. He said Afghan translators are vital allies in our missions in the Middle East. These are people who not only stood and fought with us, they died with us protecting the U.S. Unfortunately, translators are far too often victimized and endangered as a result of their service while waiting for their visas. They are very brave men and women. We cannot forget them. Just everybody keeps that in mind as they have this meeting tomorrow.",

And we've killed about a thousand people over the last month. They've said of Taliban because they're getting a little-bit belligerent. But the way the president wanted to happen, the reports were, he said he wanted to meet with the Taliban, they don't want to meet with the sitting government. They wanted to go and have a ceremony say, hey, look what I did, here's a ceremony. He said -- the president said, no, I don't want a celebration.  What I want to do is get this -- go on. I want to look these guys in the eye and see if they're serious about taking the next step. It was his idea to choose Camp David. It was Calisad idea to bring him to Washington. It was Pompeo and Calisad who put together the nine rounds of talks. But, ultimately, I think the president made the right decision. They're not ready to talk peace. They were high-fiving as if they're already were successful. They were saying we've slain another super power.  That was the talk in between sessions, and clearly they didn't."

And the Taliban was basically saying, we have run off the United States of America, and aren't we great.

They make Kim Jong-un look refined. Let's remember, Kim Jong-un, barbarian too, but he has his henchmen do his dirty work for him. The Taliban personally stone women.  They personally commit atrocities. They personally do horrible, horrible things. You can't even say here on television. So to give them that Camp David platform I think was a bad idea, and I'm glad the president canceled it. We have had bad guys at Camp David before.  We have Soviet leaders. We've had Yasser Arafat, but not to this level. I understand the president wanting to withdraw from Afghanistan. All powers eventually fight there and then they leave. We just want to leave on our own terms. And I believe his generals and his strategists were trying to lock those terms in, so they could leave with some sense of accomplishment. But also, not just leave Afghanistan for terrorists to reconstitute themselves and launch attacks here. So, at the end of the day, I think it's going to be a long process, and we need to do something to end this war and spent the tens of billions of dollars that we're spending there, have it spent here."

Better to stay on offense on their turf than to retreat to playing defense on America's. Far better to have Muslim allies fighting by our side in their country that to play preemptive and reprisal attacks on the air and far away. The Clinton years showed us that pin-prick-missile attacks alone do not stop Al-Qaeda.

But the people running for president on the Democratic side are talking about assault weapons band and gun confiscation. First of all, it's never going to pass, and the second one would lead to an unconstitutional bloodbath. You're going to have armed federal agents knocking on doors, demanding people turn over their legally purchased riffles? That is the exact thing that the founding fathers wrote the second amendment about, to protect us from those Democrats. And those Democrats are Booker, Harris, and O'Rourke. Mandatory gun confiscation and that's crazy. The real issue should be focused on the local level because Andrew Pollack, Meadows's father, Stoneman Douglas High School, has a new book coming out.  And the things that the school knew that this mass shooter was doing, Dana, I can't even say that on television. He was doing that in school. He was saying to the assistant vice principal, I'm a bad kid. I want to kill.  Telling teachers to F-off. He was also drawing Swastika's all over the place. It was a reign of terror. He was suspended every other day. He was talking about torturing and killing animals and going like this to people in class.

We've talked about this on Friday in terms of due process. But these Democrats, they're in a bind now because they -- clearly, many of them will not stop until there's an assault weapons ban.

So, ahead of tomorrow's White House meeting on refugees, I just wanted to make sure one thing is on everybody's mind and that is Afghan translators. These are the people who assisted our troops in the Middle East. Many of them risked their lives to help American soldiers and our civilians that are helping overseas. And the best way we can try to repay their service is by issuing what is called a Special Immigrant Visa and allowing them and their families to come to America. Here's a statement from Congressman Michael Waltz. He's a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. He said Afghan translators are vital allies in our missions in the Middle East. These are people who not only stood and fought with us, they died with us protecting the U.S. Unfortunately, translators are far too often victimized and endangered as a result of their service while waiting for their visas. They are very brave men and women. We cannot forget them. Just everybody keeps that in mind as they have this meeting tomorrow."

Whether those issues are political, racial or moral, here I am with the chair of the men's group Warren Graves and one of the ministers Reverend Michelle Hagan. American church attendance as you know is down and it's especially a sharp drop among men of all ages. Here's a friendly word for me. Just like exercising your body, guys, just like exercising your mind, it's also critical to be in community with other people and exercise your spirit."
