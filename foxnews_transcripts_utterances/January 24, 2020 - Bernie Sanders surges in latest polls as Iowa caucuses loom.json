Clearly, people have heard this case from the Democrats over and over and over again. They've read the transcript of the call. They've heard what the witnesses have had to say.

So I think that's something even Democrats who are resigned to the likelihood that there's not going to be a conviction of the president are hoping is something they can get out of this process, which I think a lot of people are thinking, why are we sitting through hours and hours of this, is to try to really make those moderates uncomfortable, maybe get a vote that causes some drama that causes the president pain, and if not, make them pay for it in the next election.",

President Trump's objections are not genuinely rooted in the law. They are not good-faith legal arguments. We know that because President Trump said early on, he would fight all subpoenas. We know that because he declared the impeachment inquiry illegitimate before it even adopted any procedures. We know that because he has denounced every single effort to investigate him as a witch hunt. And we know that because he never even claimed executive privilege during the entire impeachment proceeding. President Trump's first excuse for obstructing Congress, this is a serious belief that he did nothing wrong. That his July 25th call with President Zelensky was perfect. In the October 8th letter, sent by his council, President Trump asserted the prerogative to defy all House subpoenas because he has declared his own innocence. As Mr. Cipollone put it, at President Trump's behest, the president did nothing wrong, and there is no basis for an impeachment inquiry. He had the White House Counsel, include this in a formal letter to the House, defying every single subpoena. As we have shown in our discussion on the first article of impeachment, these claims of innocence are baseless. They lack merit. We have provided overwhelming evidence of President Trump's -- Pro football's New Orleans Saints are going to court to keep the public from seeing hundreds of e-mails that allegedly show team executives doing public relations.

Nearly nine months before the election, and in the middle of an impeachment trial, the head of Pro-Choice America calls it, a desperate attempt to divert attention and fire up his radical base. But these March for Life were, say, his presence here today is genuine, and that his record proves it."

First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 26 in Houston, where, at least, two people are dead after a massive explosion at an industrial company. Police chief there, says authorities do not believe this morning's blast was intentional. Though a criminal investigation is underway. Area residents are being asked to search their homes and neighborhoods for any debris including body parts and to contact police if they find anything that could aid in the investigation. Fox Two in San Francisco has nearly 100,000 gallons of red wine spills from a tank at a vineyard in Sonoma County, eventually leaking into the Russian River. The one went into a sanitary sewer system on the property to a drainage ditch that feeds a creek and eventually to the Russian River. It's affecting water quality in the 110-mile tributary flowing into the Pacific Ocean. And this is a live look at Las Vegas from our affiliate out there, Fox Five. The big story there tonight, a new marketing slogan for that city. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas is being changed.

Jay Sekulow, one of the president's attorneys indicated that this was like a coming attraction at the movie -- kind of like a movie trailer here. When you talk to some of the Republican senators, though, they think that the democratic arguments over the past couple of days have been repetitive.

And also, Bret, from the Senate floor, probably the best piece of news that senators have heard today is they restock the candy desk. This is a desk for Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. Hershey sent 700 pounds of chocolate to the Capitol today.

They mentioned the Bidens yesterday in the -- in the trial, 226 times. And it really will come down to the math. If there's 51 votes, maybe to call the Bidens or any witness, that's going to be a big deal. The capital, Bret, will absolutely explode if the votes are there to call the Bidens, and the Democrats don't get some of the witnesses they want, say, John Bolton or Mike Pompeo, or the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney."

      "utterance": "That's right. We're talking about his daughter Ashley whose husband had a business that was effectively launched in the Oval Office. Joe Biden gave private briefings to investors and partners in this company while his son-in-law was one of the principals involved. We're talking about a two of his brothers that had deals, one involving federal contracts in the United States for a construction company. He had no background in construction. Another brother doing deals overseas. So it's a systematic pattern of corruption that I think people need to be aware of."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "I think it may not be illegal, but I think it's certainly corrupt. And the point is that Joe Biden granted access, and by the very nature of his power created opportunities. If you look at the Hunter Biden case in particular, the timing here is key. Hunter Biden could've been hired by the Ukrainians any time, but he was hired in the spring of 2014. February of 2014, Putin moves into Crimea, creating the crisis. In March of 2014, Barack Obama appoints Joe Biden as point person on Ukraine. Within two or three weeks, Hunter Biden has suddenly been identified by the Ukrainians and is put on a payroll to the tune of about $1 million a year. That timing is significant. And Joe Biden really could have said, as politicians do in Washington, D.C., to his family, look, I don't want you doing these kind of deals. But he's obviously never said that because they still have access and the deals are still taking place."

The pushback is that the Bidens, the relatives are hardly the first people to use a famous name to bolster their livelihoods, I guess. And while it's swampy, what do you take away from it? And is it a problem right now for Joe Biden the candidate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "It's a great question. I think it's one of those things that has kind of become acceptable in Washington, D.C., but outside the beltway people are still very frustrated and angered about it. And I don't think this is a case of having a name that's helping you. Everybody knows that if your last name is, say, Bush or Biden, you're going to have certain inherent advantages. What we're talking about here is political families that are making money once they achieve political power. That's the key difference. If you achieve political power and then your family becomes wealthy because of your public service, I think people at least out of Washington, D.C., are still outraged by that and should be."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "It's certainly not opposition research. We focus on one thing -- follow the money. So this is not about personal problems or substance abuse. It's about follow the money. But I also, if you look at my track record, I've gone after Republicans and Democrats. The reason I focused on this book, I talk about it in chapter one, on these progressives is I think we have in American media today what I call the Trump vortex. It sucks in everything and there has been massive coverage of Trump and what are seen as scandals or perceived as scandals. That's a good thing. But the problem is some of the reporting is good, some of the reporting is bad, but it blacks out everything. And my point is Trump needs to be scrutinized, but so do those people that are aspiring to his office or have other positions of responsibility."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "I think it's hard to say. It's certainly the most systematic because Joe Biden has been there the longest. But I think there are a lot of things about Elizabeth Warren that was troubling, about how she was actually a government consulted in the 1990s rewriting bankruptcy laws, and in a typical Washington move she took that position and cashed in. She basically went to corporations and said, I will consult for you and advise you in how to use the law that I wrote to your maximum advantage. And there are others."

The president's job approval rating hovering roughly around where it was, but it's up from October of 2019, but recent polls about the same in this category. But all of them are also the same, this one a little bit higher on the president's handling on the economy in the latest poll from \"Washington Post\"-ABC, approve, disapprove, 56 percent. With that, let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Michael Crowley, White House correspondent for \"The New York Times.\" Steve, where are we on impeachment?

The second one is the deflection used by Senate Republicans that really there is not really much new here rests uncomfortably alongside their apparent determination not to allow new evidence in. Those seem to be in a fair amount of tension to me. But the third is that House Democrats, even with a very good hand, I think, based on facts and evidence, have played this pretty poorly. You have moments. I think Adam Schiff's closing yesterday was pretty effective. But in many other ways they seem to be playing to the crowd. They seem to be as interested or more in politics than they are in a just the facts recitation of what happened.

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Mollie? You have a different take, let's just start there. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes. So really when you think about what's going on here, the president is going through an impeachment. His numbers should be horrible. Instead they are stronger than they've been in a long time. Clearly, people have heard this case from the Democrats over and over and over again. They've read the transcript of the call. They've heard what the witnesses have had to say. Many people who aren't opposed to President Trump just don't find it compelling at all. And so I think this was supposed to be a really moment for Democrats, a way to tarnish President Trump's image. Instead he's coming out very strong, and next week there will be an acquittal likely or soon thereafter. And then where are Democrats going to be?"

Obviously, there are some moderate Democrats, Doug Jones and Kyrsten Sinema and Gary Peters of Michigan, but the moderate Republicans, have they moved in this testimony? MICHAEL CROWLEY, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": We haven't seen that tipping point critical moment yet. I think that an interesting thing about this is it does seem like public opinion is largely baked in on this, and we are kind of regurgitating things that people are pretty familiar with. But I do think that Democratic leaders feel like part of what they can do here is put pressure on those moderates. And to a large degree what this is about now is an internal Senate exercise, making those moderates squirm and trying to set them up to make them potentially more vulnerable in 2020. So I think that's something even Democrats who are resigned to the likelihood that there's not going to be a conviction of the president are hoping is something they can get out of this process, which I think a lot of people are thinking, why are we sitting through hours and hours of this, is to try to really make those moderates uncomfortable, maybe get a vote that causes some drama that causes the president pain, and if not, make them pay for it in the next election."
