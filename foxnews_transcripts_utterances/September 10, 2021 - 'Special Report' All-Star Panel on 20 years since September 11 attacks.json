I think there is a pretty good argument that it will escalate. There is a sad sort of bookend to those remarks from George W. Bush, and it's the Taliban tomorrow coming into office, 20 years to the day, since the attacks on 9/11, taking over the country officially, 20 years to the day. If you go back and you look at the rhetoric from Al-Qaeda leaders, from Taliban leaders in the years since we have been fighting this war, they basically predicted this. Usama bin Laden in letters that we recovered from the compound where he was killed suggested that really what Al-Qaeda needed to do, what the jihadists needed to do, what the global jihadist movement needed to do was simply be patient and outwait the Americans. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, told his interrogators, and I'm going to read the quote to make sure that I get it right, \"We will win because Americans don't realize we do not need to defeat you militarily.

      "utterance": "My winner is Kevin Dowdell, the New York firefighters who died in the twin towers. He left behind two sons, one son Patrick who went to West Point and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, and another son James who joined the FDNY and is now in his father's old house. America is a great country because of families like the Dowdells. My loser is Joe Biden. Imagine screwing up so badly that even you recognize that you don't have the moral authority to address the American people on the anniversary of September 11, 2001."
