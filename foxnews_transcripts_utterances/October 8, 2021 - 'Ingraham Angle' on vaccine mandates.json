If tough, COVID policies, by the way, are so great for the economy as he's trying to argue there. Why are the unemployment rates of New York, LA, San Francisco and Chicago, big vaccine mandate places those are so much higher than the national average? By contrast, look at what's going on in Florida, where the governor has rejected mandates, their unemployment is below the national average. And if the false economic projections aren't bad enough, now the COVID police are actually putting lives in jeopardy. This is happening in Colorado, the University of Washington Medical Center just announced it will join that Colorado health system and refusing organ transplants to unvaccinated patients. So much for the do no harm thing. Now in moments, we're going to talk to a woman waiting for a kidney transplant, she was just told she's getting kicked off the list. Now the left is one step closer though to imposing vaccine mandates on your kids. So today, Pfizer asked the FDA for emergency use authorization of its COVID vaccine in five to 11 year old.

And California has already laid the groundwork announcing earlier this month that it mandate vaccines for students ages 12 and up once the FDA gives its final approval, expect to see this insanity repeated in blue cities and states across America. And don't believe the line by the way that the vaccines like a Sanjay Gupta said, it means we're getting all back to normal. If they really wanted to return to normal, they would drop the mandates and leave people alone. In fact, is, they didn't like the old normal much, they want a new normal said that since March 2020. And by the way, normal is what most of red state America is doing. And the Delta variant by the way is declining in those states as well. That's good news. Especially by the way, given the results of a brand new study published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed waning vaccine effectiveness overtime still helps in serious illness, hospitalization, but infectivity we're talking about here and it found that fully vaccinated individuals, antibody levels decreased rapidly for the first three months after someone is fully vaccinated. It also found that six months after receipt of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine humoral response was substantially decreased. Presumably this means that, I don't know I guess we're going to be talking about mandating boosters long, long, long into the future. Or Republicans win in a landslide and finally, we do get back to normal, we do get back to making our own decisions about health, risks and benefits without by the way, being vilified, shamed or punished. Now let's bring back my medicine cabinet. Dr. Stephen Smith, founder of the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases, and Urban Health and Dr. Paul Alexander, former Trump HHS COVID Adviser. Dr. Smith, let's start with you. Is the solution to this pandemic, the forced vaccination of children and the 20 percent or 25 percent of adults who have yet to receive a shot, especially given the new published report today from the New England Journal of Medicine.",

Whereas the HPV vaccine give to boys to help girls or women in the future. Whereas the shingles vaccine is just for the individual. But for giving to the kids, I don't get what the point is, it's not going to help end the pandemic at all. It's not going to help the kids at least not the vast majority of children at age five to 11. The vast, vast majority--",

      "sentences": "I want to get into that Dr. Smith. Yes, I want to get into that because for over a year now, and we've been talking about this on this program since April of 2020, when you were on initially, because we've known for the early data that COVID poses a relatively minuscule risk to small children. As of September 30th, during the entire pandemic 520 children died from COVID in the United States. Now, of course, it's tragic. We don't want any child to ever die. But that's a fatality rate of point 0.1 percent of those that we know actually had COVID, obviously millions more had COVID. Dr. Alexander, why do they keep pretending that kids are most at risk from COVID? I mean, it's a 99 percent survivability rate, 99 point something. I'm not good at math. So, Dr. Alexander, what of this? This is bizarre. DR. PAUL ALEXANDER, FORMER TRUMP HHS COVID ADVISER, Yes. And I agree with you on. Thanks for having me again, Laura. The science doesn't support vaccinating persons under 19 for COVID. And this is illogical and I think reckless and dangerous. The reality is that these vaccine developers, the CDC, the FDA, they must put liability protection on the table, because they are the only ones in this situation who are protected, not the children. And I think this is going to be a very dangerous situation. We knew Laura, we knew as you just explained for 15 months now, the children are very little risk of acquiring infection in the first place have transmitted to other children, have taken at home. We have the Sweden study Ludwigsen where they looked at 2 million street kids under 16. No instances of that. We have the French (ph) study where Danny Stile (ph) showed that one child exposed to 150 other children, no secondary transmission. Children do not drive at home, like seasonal influenza. Children do not get severely ill, and children do not die. So, I think this is a very reckless and Dr. Fauci, Dr. Walensky and Dr. Francis Collins, no one has yet come to the table and told the American people and prosecuted this case as to why our children must be vaccinated. There's absolutely - these vaccines provide no opportunity for benefit, only opportunity for harm for children.",

Now recall that a few years back, the Harry Potter author and self- made billionaire found herself in the woke mobs' crosshairs for merely stating her beliefs that biological sex does in fact exist. Tweeting in June 2020, my life has been shaped by being female, I do not believe it's hateful to say so. This is possibly one of the least controversial statements ever posted to Twitter. But based on the Left's reaction at the time, you would have thought that she was a war criminal.

Trans activists Dana White, not only slam Chappelle, but also Netflix for showcasing him saying nothing Dave Chappelle says changes the facts that trans women are women. He's wrong, and Netflix has empowered him to be wrong loudly. Of course, the activist said glad, no surprise there, chimed in as well claiming Chappelle's comedy was synonymous with ridiculing trans people and other marginalized communities. NPR's TV critic remarked, it just sounds like Chappelle is using white privilege to excuse his own homophobia and transphobia. Wow. While Chappelle is using white privilege, wait a second, OK, I got it. What? Now when Chappelle used the most profane language in a previous special, to pillory, yours truly and Candace Owen. did any of the usual girl power activists come to our defense? Did any major media outlets or celebrity women advocate condemned Chappelle as misogynistic? Or even say he's disappointing in his attacks? Now you know the answer, of course not. And not that we cared. We didn't think it, we don't want it, we don't need their protection. By the way, Chappelle knew what he was doing and attacking us. He thought that by attacking us he was buying himself expiation for past comedic sins and maybe a free pass for future ones. How did that work out for you Dave?

Like I'm young enough to remember when they were roundly derided as war criminals for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Was there anyone more hated by the Left than Dick Cheney? Before W's time in office, had you ever seen a president so ruthlessly mocked and derided as a dim witted frat boy, I mean, I worked for Reagan, it was nothing to compare to what they did to Bush. But now that he's they're useful idiot. They've totally rehabilitated him. Same thing for Liz Cheney. It's also obvious, it's almost boring at this point. No one with a shred of independent thought should be cowed by any of these people. The Far Left has relentlessly tried to get this show boycotted and even banned kicked off air. How well that worked out for him. We've only gotten stronger. Our audience, thanks to you, has only gotten bigger. So, instead of trying to ingratiate yourself to the woke mob, or try to appease them by saying just the right thing, just be yourself. Stand up for your own views. For the truth. There are more people who agree with us than the left would have you believe. And as for Sinema, she'd be far more at home, I think, as an independent. And of course, she's always welcome to cross the aisle and joined the conservative movement. At least our side tolerates dissent and divergent views. There's zero room for dissent in her current party. Manchin should do the same and break away from the lunatics that he's had to put up with once and for all. I don't know, maybe he's too rich, or too rich that he doesn't even care at this point. I don't know. After all, it's kind of easier, right, just to relent back, at least in the short-term. But remember, unless you are 100 percent compliant and ready to compromise your beliefs for every leftist crusade, they'll eventually come for you anyway. Just ask Dave. And that's The Angle.

Dorian is here now along with Stephen Miller, former Trump senior advisor, founder of America First Legal that helps protect the freedoms that we all enjoy as Americans in its work.

But as we've talked about before, Laura, he is losing those sorts of intangible qualities. Is he honest or not -- a net loss of 20 points and eight months.

If tough, COVID policies, by the way, are so great for the economy as he's trying to argue there. Why are the unemployment rates of New York, LA, San Francisco and Chicago, big vaccine mandate places those are so much higher than the national average? By contrast, look at what's going on in Florida, where the governor has rejected mandates, their unemployment is below the national average. And if the false economic projections aren't bad enough, now the COVID police are actually putting lives in jeopardy. This is happening in Colorado, the University of Washington Medical Center just announced it will join that Colorado health system and refusing organ transplants to unvaccinated patients. So much for the do no harm thing. Now in moments, we're going to talk to a woman waiting for a kidney transplant, she was just told she's getting kicked off the list. Now the left is one step closer though to imposing vaccine mandates on your kids. So today, Pfizer asked the FDA for emergency use authorization of its COVID vaccine in five to 11 year old. Now, for those of us in real America, this is a cause for concern. But for the media, it's like Christmas has come early."

And California has already laid the groundwork announcing earlier this month that it mandate vaccines for students ages 12 and up once the FDA gives its final approval, expect to see this insanity repeated in blue cities and states across America. And don't believe the line by the way that the vaccines like a Sanjay Gupta said, it means we're getting all back to normal. If they really wanted to return to normal, they would drop the mandates and leave people alone. In fact, is, they didn't like the old normal much, they want a new normal said that since March 2020. And by the way, normal is what most of red state America is doing. And the Delta variant by the way is declining in those states as well. That's good news. Especially by the way, given the results of a brand new study published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed waning vaccine effectiveness overtime still helps in serious illness, hospitalization, but infectivity we're talking about here and it found that fully vaccinated individuals, antibody levels decreased rapidly for the first three months after someone is fully vaccinated. It also found that six months after receipt of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine humoral response was substantially decreased. Presumably this means that, I don't know I guess we're going to be talking about mandating boosters long, long, long into the future. Or Republicans win in a landslide and finally, we do get back to normal, we do get back to making our own decisions about health, risks and benefits without by the way, being vilified, shamed or punished. Now let's bring back my medicine cabinet. Dr. Stephen Smith, founder of the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases, and Urban Health and Dr. Paul Alexander, former Trump HHS COVID Adviser. Dr. Smith, let's start with you. Is the solution to this pandemic, the forced vaccination of children and the 20 percent or 25 percent of adults who have yet to receive a shot, especially given the new published report today from the New England Journal of Medicine."

Whereas the HPV vaccine give to boys to help girls or women in the future. Whereas the shingles vaccine is just for the individual. But for giving to the kids, I don't get what the point is, it's not going to help end the pandemic at all. It's not going to help the kids at least not the vast majority of children at age five to 11. The vast, vast majority--"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I want to get into that Dr. Smith. Yes, I want to get into that because for over a year now, and we've been talking about this on this program since April of 2020, when you were on initially, because we've known for the early data that COVID poses a relatively minuscule risk to small children. As of September 30th, during the entire pandemic 520 children died from COVID in the United States. Now, of course, it's tragic. We don't want any child to ever die. But that's a fatality rate of point 0.1 percent of those that we know actually had COVID, obviously millions more had COVID. Dr. Alexander, why do they keep pretending that kids are most at risk from COVID? I mean, it's a 99 percent survivability rate, 99 point something. I'm not good at math. So, Dr. Alexander, what of this? This is bizarre. DR. PAUL ALEXANDER, FORMER TRUMP HHS COVID ADVISER, Yes. And I agree with you on. Thanks for having me again, Laura. The science doesn't support vaccinating persons under 19 for COVID. And this is illogical and I think reckless and dangerous. The reality is that these vaccine developers, the CDC, the FDA, they must put liability protection on the table, because they are the only ones in this situation who are protected, not the children. And I think this is going to be a very dangerous situation. We knew Laura, we knew as you just explained for 15 months now, the children are very little risk of acquiring infection in the first place have transmitted to other children, have taken at home. We have the Sweden study Ludwigsen where they looked at 2 million street kids under 16. No instances of that. We have the French (ph) study where Danny Stile (ph) showed that one child exposed to 150 other children, no secondary transmission. Children do not drive at home, like seasonal influenza. Children do not get severely ill, and children do not die. So, I think this is a very reckless and Dr. Fauci, Dr. Walensky and Dr. Francis Collins, no one has yet come to the table and told the American people and prosecuted this case as to why our children must be vaccinated. There's absolutely - these vaccines provide no opportunity for benefit, only opportunity for harm for children."

I spoke to a father just twice today, we spoke the other day, he has sent me a couple emails and such, his daughter who's 12 is currently on dialysis here in Colorado. He's received communications from UC Health saying that she too will be denied this life saving surgery unless and until the COVID vaccine is taken.

Now let's start with Chappelle. In his new Netflix Special called The Closer, he defends JK Rowling from the vicious lunatics on the Left. Now recall that a few years back, the Harry Potter author and self- made billionaire found herself in the woke mobs' crosshairs for merely stating her beliefs that biological sex does in fact exist. Tweeting in June 2020, my life has been shaped by being female, I do not believe it's hateful to say so. This is possibly one of the least controversial statements ever posted to Twitter. But based on the Left's reaction at the time, you would have thought that she was a war criminal. Few of anyone in the entertainment industry dared stick their necks out for the woman whose books made many of them very rich. At least pleased their kids who love them. But Dave Chappelle stuck his neck out."

Well, who would say that they're transgender well, typical Chappelle? That diatribe, plus his own defense of JK Rowling sparked outrage among the denizens of the woke Left. Trans activists Dana White, not only slam Chappelle, but also Netflix for showcasing him saying nothing Dave Chappelle says changes the facts that trans women are women. He's wrong, and Netflix has empowered him to be wrong loudly. Of course, the activist said glad, no surprise there, chimed in as well claiming Chappelle's comedy was synonymous with ridiculing trans people and other marginalized communities. NPR's TV critic remarked, it just sounds like Chappelle is using white privilege to excuse his own homophobia and transphobia. Wow. While Chappelle is using white privilege, wait a second, OK, I got it. What? Now when Chappelle used the most profane language in a previous special, to pillory, yours truly and Candace Owen. did any of the usual girl power activists come to our defense? Did any major media outlets or celebrity women advocate condemned Chappelle as misogynistic? Or even say he's disappointing in his attacks? Now you know the answer, of course not. And not that we cared. We didn't think it, we don't want it, we don't need their protection. By the way, Chappelle knew what he was doing and attacking us. He thought that by attacking us he was buying himself expiation for past comedic sins and maybe a free pass for future ones. How did that work out for you Dave? The fact is, there is no satisfying the insane Left that today's Democrat Party spawned and projects. There's no point in anyone trying to placate them or even paying attention to them because there will always come a day when you'll fall short of, they're constantly moving woke goal post. Now, Kyrsten Sinema should know this by now. It doesn't matter that she's a first that she wears fun outfits or that she voted to impeach Trump twice. That's not enough.

      "utterance": "The other way, but, of course, this twisted game goes both ways. Take what happened to the Bush's and the Cheney's. Like I'm young enough to remember when they were roundly derided as war criminals for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Was there anyone more hated by the Left than Dick Cheney? Before W's time in office, had you ever seen a president so ruthlessly mocked and derided as a dim witted frat boy, I mean, I worked for Reagan, it was nothing to compare to what they did to Bush. But now that he's they're useful idiot. They've totally rehabilitated him. Same thing for Liz Cheney. It's also obvious, it's almost boring at this point. No one with a shred of independent thought should be cowed by any of these people. The Far Left has relentlessly tried to get this show boycotted and even banned kicked off air. How well that worked out for him. We've only gotten stronger. Our audience, thanks to you, has only gotten bigger. So, instead of trying to ingratiate yourself to the woke mob, or try to appease them by saying just the right thing, just be yourself. Stand up for your own views. For the truth. There are more people who agree with us than the left would have you believe. And as for Sinema, she'd be far more at home, I think, as an independent. And of course, she's always welcome to cross the aisle and joined the conservative movement. At least our side tolerates dissent and divergent views. There's zero room for dissent in her current party. Manchin should do the same and break away from the lunatics that he's had to put up with once and for all. I don't know, maybe he's too rich, or too rich that he doesn't even care at this point. I don't know. After all, it's kind of easier, right, just to relent back, at least in the short-term. But remember, unless you are 100 percent compliant and ready to compromise your beliefs for every leftist crusade, they'll eventually come for you anyway. Just ask Dave. And that's The Angle. Joining us now, one of my next guests knows all too well what it's like to get canceled by the woke left. University of Chicago Professor Dorian Abbott was supposed to give the annual Carson Lecture at MIT until a Twitter mob discovered his very public comments about how higher education's obsession with diversity, equity, and inclusion, is actually harmful. Dorian is here now along with Stephen Miller, former Trump senior advisor, founder of America First Legal that helps protect the freedoms that we all enjoy as Americans in its work. Dorian, your lecture had nothing to do with DEI or Critical Race Theory, but the incredible controversial topic was what drew their scorn? What was it?"

Like the professor, just find a different form, keep moving forward."

What I'm worried about are the millions of Americans who face the real threat of job loss, personal destruction, financial harm, de-platforming because of their points of view. And in particular you see this now with the Department of Justice coming after Americans objecting to Critical Race Theory, concerned parents. You see it increasingly with people that express divergent viewpoints on the coronavirus. We are living in an environment of what I like to call left- wing fascism, in which if you express a contrary point of view, like you've seen for biological sex, you stand up for racial equality, they're going to come at you with everything that they have. And ultimately if we give into that even a little bit, we are just feeding the fire, and it gets bigger and more fearsome every single time they claim a victim."

That includes 62 percent of independents, by the way. And that's not all. The poll also found that 49 percent believe Biden cares about the average American, well, just 49 percent of them. That's a drop of 58 percent in April. All right, here to break it all down is Tom Bevan, cofounder and president of Real Clear Politics. Tom, what's going on here? A drop not just in the general numbers for Biden, but on every major measure that matters, from immigration to COVID to foreign policy."

And it's just one poll, but if it's confirmed by other polls, and there is some indication that it is being seen in other places, it's terrible news not only because, as you mentioned, on issue after issue, whether it's Afghanistan, foreign policy, the border, taxes, he is losing support overall, but particularly among independents. But as we've talked about before, Laura, he is losing those sorts of intangible qualities. Is he honest or not -- a net loss of 20 points and eight months. Is he a good leader -- a net loss of over 30 points on that question in eight months. And as you mentioned, most surprising to me with this question of does he care about the average person. This is one of Biden's sort of -- one of his core brand. He was from Scranton -- blue- collar Joe from Scranton. That number has dropped dramatically as well. It started at 60 percent in February. Now, as you mentioned, down to 49 percent. So he's lost a great standing there as well. And so those of the things that are really tough to recover, and I think it shows just across the board how badly he's been performing."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, and as we just put up a different graphic about honesty, and the honesty numbers -- and I know you've addressed this before with us, but the honesty numbers are a real drop. Back in February it was 53 percent said he was honest. Now in October, only 44 percent say he's honest, 50 percent say he's not honest."
    },

      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Right. Listen, that's what happens when you make this one of the cornerstones of your campaign. Trump is a liar. I'm going to tell the truth. I will always level with you. He said it in his inaugural address. He said it all throughout the campaign, that I will always level with the American people good, bad, or otherwise. And the American people have recognized that he hasn't been on the level with them on a number of issues. He's ignored, been in denial about the border. He said Afghanistan, the exit there was a huge success, and that it couldn't have been done any other way, and the American people don't believe that to be true. And so that's why he's seen -- and the other one, as you mentioned, he said he would be competent, and the American people have seen on that score things at odds with his rhetoric. And I think that's what he's lost support. Again, he hasn't lost so much support among Democrats. It's among independents were he's really sliding. And this is a huge concern for Democrats in the midterms, and even Terry McAuliffe in his Virginia governor's race in just a couple of days, independents are about 30 percent of the electorate there. And if they are feeling this badly about Biden, that does not bode well for McAuliffe or the Democrats."

Congresswoman, I should note that FOX News was supposed to go with you to Fort Bliss yesterday, but our permission was withdrawn 10 minutes before our reporter was supposed to board his flight.

They tell us because we have so many people in such a small area that we can expect to see things like this happen. That's unacceptable. Laura, think about it. If we can't keep service members safe on military bases within the United States, what does that look like for any town, USA, once these people are let loose or resettled or choose to leave the base on their own accord, which we know at least 500 people have from Fort Bliss."
