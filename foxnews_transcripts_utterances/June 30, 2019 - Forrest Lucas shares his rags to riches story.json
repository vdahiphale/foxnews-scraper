      "sentences": "Hello America, Mark Levin. This is a special edition of \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" We will have a special guest in a few moments, Forrest Lucas of Lucas Oil -- capitalism versus socialism, liberty versus tyranny. That's the subject of this program. It's not discussed enough. A report just came out from the Congressional Budget Office. It projects unprecedented 144 percent of GDP toward the debt by 2049. This is a big deal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Federal debt held by the public is on track to hit this level and the report found that if Congress works to wipe out scheduled spending and tax changes under current law, which includes sharp spending traps set to go into effect in 2020 and the expiration of income tax cuts scheduled for 2026, the debt would rise to 219 percent of the GDP. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We're in a serious problem here. And I have a question, all your parents and grandparents out there. Do you care about your kids and grandkids? This is particularly aimed at the Democratic socialists, they like to call themselves. Do you care about your kids and grandkids? Most of us would give our lives for our kids and grandkids. We're protective of them that we want the very best for them. And yet we're destroying their society. We're destroying their economy, because that's the end result in a decade or two, if this continues. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } \"Oh, we've heard it before, Mark.\" No. The numbers are just not working right now. The numbers aren't working. We have a crushing debt. We have a fiscal operating debt of $22 trillion. Our economy produces slightly over $18 trillion in goods and services every year. That's enormous. Unfunded liability, so called entitlements and so forth, over $250 trillion. The mind can't even be wrapped around that. It's incredible. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then we have proposals being made by Democrats running for President of the United States, not a single proposal on actually cutting the debt, but in ballooning the debt, at least five new entitlements proposed by this group. And let's go through some of them quickly. Universal childcare: We have no idea how much that's going to cost. They want to eliminate the student debt, which is outrageous. $1.6 trillion. People accumulate the debt and then the rest of us have to pay for it? The government is going to pick it up? Two thirds of the American people never went to college. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Two thirds of the American people are going to subsidize people who went to college who are, in most cases, wealthier than those who have subsidizing them. Genius idea by the Democratic socialists. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Free college? Free college for everybody? Well, what does that mean? Tuition is already through the roof. These college campuses, they can't stop building their empires into themselves. There's never investigations for why this is. Why? Because this is the indoctrination mill of the left, so they want more and more kids to go through there. But the spending is already out of control in these universities and colleges -- by the way, which squelch free speech among other things -- but free college? Family leave? Family leave. Did we have children before family leave? Did we know how to raise children before family leave? Do we really need the government through some cockamamie scheme subsidizing parents who have children? I mean, this is absurd. Whatever happened to responsibility? Government run healthcare. They've come up with a lot of cute names like Medicare-for-All. The problem is, it eliminates Medicare. It eliminates all private healthcare. We're all going to live under the Veterans Administration. Where we all have a right to healthcare. Really? Ask the vets. When they go to the Veterans Administration, do they get to say I need this medicine. I need this medicine. I need it to be there tomorrow. No. What does that mean? A right to healthcare. It's an absurdity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No private insurance, no Medicare, including illegal aliens, according to Bernie Sanders. Now think about that. How the hell are we going to control costs in healthcare? Guaranteed minimum income. That was a brainchild of Cory Booker and others. So you have what they call a baby bond. Cradle to grave. Guaranteed minimum income? Why the hell would anybody work with all these benefits? A Green New Deal. You know what this is? This is imported from Germany. It used to be called the De-Growth Movement, the Deindustrialization Movement specifically aimed at making America poor and it has been embraced now by every single candidate in one form or another running for the Democratic nomination. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And climate change. Climate change. Jake Tapper went after the Vice President last week about it. Chuck Todd has announced with his fiat, we will not have manmade climate deniers on our network ever again. Two guys who know nothing about climate. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have physicists, meteorologists, climatologist with PhDs up the wazoo, thousands of them who questioned manmade climate change or the impact men can have on the climate. They're not allowed anymore on NBC apparently and Jake Tapper says the scientists decided. I don't know how they know that. But I do know this. It'll kill the economy. It'll kill the economy. Massive Federal infrastructure spending. You drive around Washington, D.C., they never stopped building. Oh, we've got the Metro that goes all the way out. It never works. But it goes all the way out. Two roads into four roads, overpasses, bypasses, underpasses, all kinds of stuff going on. It never ends. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We're going to add $2 trillion, and how much of that is going to flow through the hands of local and state governments for a thousand different purposes. But where is this money coming from? We have a proposal from Kamala Harris. Federal subsidies for local teacher salaries. Say what? Oh, yeah, Federal subsidies for local teacher salaries. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And they're proposing expanding Social Security, the trustees of the Social Security trust, which there's no money, by the way, because the Federal government stole it already. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They say eight years is all we have under Social Security. The left wants to expand a program that is sinking rather than trying to figure out how to protect it for the people who've paid into it. Now out of these proposals, and I've only just gotten started. There's five new entitlements -- universal childcare, parental or family leave, government-run healthcare, guaranteed minimum income, Federal subsidies for local teacher salaries -- where's this money coming from? We'll take it from the rich. We will tax the rich. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Ladies and gentlemen, there aren't enough rich. There's not enough wealth in the entire universe to pay for all this. And their proposed costs are a joke. Because they don't know what it's going to be 10 years from now anymore, that they know what the climate and the weather is going to be 10 years from now. They're always low. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is a destructive program. It not only will fundamentally transform America, it will fundamentally destroy our economic system. And what happens when you destroy an economic system? Government gets stronger and stronger and more and more abusive, which is why virtually every one of these Democrats reject the limitations placed on them and their agenda and the progressive ideology by your Constitution. No, I'm not done. Taxes. We have proposals for a wealth tax. Unconstitutional, but don't worry, that'll go the way the Electoral College. Proposals for 70 percent to 90 percent marginal tax rate. A war tax. A Wall Street investment tax. Higher corporate income taxes. Financial transaction taxes. Every kind of tax you can think. We're going to tax our way into wealth and equity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They have plans that will do nothing but destroy the society. And the media, you sit there as the Praetorian Guard and you protect these people, you protect the idea of a big, ubiquitous centralized government with an unaccountable massive bureaucracy, pushing people around. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We never talk about liberty anymore, or individualism anymore, or success, or true free market capitalism. Look around you. Look at all the wealth that we have. You go to a grocery store, there's everything you want in a grocery store. Look around your home, look what we have. We don't appreciate what we have. Well, we do, but they don't. And let me remind you, this agenda -- well, this agenda is quite Stalinistic. What do you mean, Mark? Oh, all of these left wing sites and so forth are going to dismiss you. Dismiss me as you will, but pay attention. Facts, listen to this. Chapter X of 1936 Constitution, Stalin's Constitution for the Soviet Union. This is where the Democrats get their policy ideas. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Article 118, \"Citizens of the USSR have the right to work, that is, are guaranteed the right to employment and payment for their work in accordance with its quantity and quality.\" Article 119, \"Citizens in the USSR have the right to rest and leisure. The institution of annual vacations with full pay for workers and employees and the provision of a wide network of sanatoria, rest homes and clubs for the accommodation of the working people.\" It sounds just like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Article 120, \"Citizens of the USSR have the right to maintenance in old age, and also in case of sickness or loss of capacity to work. This right is ensured by the extensive development of social insurance of workers and employees at state expense, free medical service for the working people, and the provision of a wide network of health resorts for the use of the working people.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Article 121, \"Citizens in the USSR have the right to education. The right is insured by universal, compulsory elementary education; by education, including higher education being free of charge, by the system of state stipends for the overwhelming majority of students and universities and colleges.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I could go on. Why is it that these Democrats embrace, not the American dream, but the Soviet dream? Oh, yes, it's true. Why is it that we don't have serious substantive discussions about what they're proposing and how they're going to be paid for? Enough of these platitudes. Enough of this fortune cookie stuff where you pull a sentence out of a cookie and you just read it. Tax the rich - that answer is not good enough. Redistribute wealth - that answers not good enough. Pay that gap - that answer is not good enough. We need facts. We need information. Your children, my grandchildren, generations yet born. That's what this is all about. These proposals coming from the left, coming from the Democrats, part of this progressive ideology, are anti-American. That's right, I said it, they're anti-American. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Capitalism. Nobody talks about capitalism anymore. The Industrial Revolution, the biggest middle class on the face of the Earth. We have clean water. It comes right into our homes. You turn the faucet on, there it is, how did that happen? Electricity with the flip of a switch. How did that happen? We have washing machines, dishwashers, toasters. We have heat when we need it. We have air conditioning when we need it. And don't give me that most Americans don't get these things. Almost all Americans have access to these things. Almost all Americans have access to these things. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The average American in this country lives better, in more luxury than Kings and Queens 200 years ago. As I said earlier, walk into your local grocery store. Look at the -- look at the shelves. Look at the 14 different kinds of bread with five different grains. Go to the other aisle. Look at the different kinds of meats you have, 80 percent fat, 85 percent fat, 96 percent fat -- all different cuts. Look at the different poultry, the different fish all over the country, all over the world. The different wines. I could go on and on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why would we destroy such a society? It's time to take on the left. Time to take on the Democratic leadership. It's time to take on socialism with Americanism. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I have a special guest tonight who is going to help us do that, Forrest Lucas of Lucas Oil. He started from nothing, and he is a successful man who contributes to this society far more than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. But first, don't forget, most weeknights you can watch Levin TV, just give us a call 844-LEVIN-TV, 844-LEVIN-TV and join us, we have a wonderful community over there. Or go to blazetv.com/mark; blazetv.com/mark. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One other thing, the hottest book in America. Folks, this is very, very important. We stand for freedom of the press. The modern mass media today stand for unfreedom of the press. Read all about. We'll be right back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And if have everybody -- you have the right to haul this particular product to this particular place and that's kind of where it was. Regulations were like that. And this is getting way out of control. Some of the big guys were buying up all the regulations there were and some of the little guys out there were just still stuck with having to haul for those guys -- the big guys. And that wasn't working too good. And then there's people like myself, although I was hauling moving them and stuff. I get to places like California where everybody moved them to California. Nobody was moving back. So I was a hot freight. There's plenty of people out there that would let us haul their stuff, we would haul for less money. You've got out there, they were a lot better.

      "utterance": "Hello America, Mark Levin. This is a special edition of \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" We will have a special guest in a few moments, Forrest Lucas of Lucas Oil -- capitalism versus socialism, liberty versus tyranny. That's the subject of this program. It's not discussed enough. A report just came out from the Congressional Budget Office. It projects unprecedented 144 percent of GDP toward the debt by 2049. This is a big deal. Federal debt held by the public is on track to hit this level and the report found that if Congress works to wipe out scheduled spending and tax changes under current law, which includes sharp spending traps set to go into effect in 2020 and the expiration of income tax cuts scheduled for 2026, the debt would rise to 219 percent of the GDP. We're in a serious problem here. And I have a question, all your parents and grandparents out there. Do you care about your kids and grandkids? This is particularly aimed at the Democratic socialists, they like to call themselves. Do you care about your kids and grandkids? Most of us would give our lives for our kids and grandkids. We're protective of them that we want the very best for them. And yet we're destroying their society. We're destroying their economy, because that's the end result in a decade or two, if this continues. \"Oh, we've heard it before, Mark.\" No. The numbers are just not working right now. The numbers aren't working. We have a crushing debt. We have a fiscal operating debt of $22 trillion. Our economy produces slightly over $18 trillion in goods and services every year. That's enormous. Unfunded liability, so called entitlements and so forth, over $250 trillion. The mind can't even be wrapped around that. It's incredible. And then we have proposals being made by Democrats running for President of the United States, not a single proposal on actually cutting the debt, but in ballooning the debt, at least five new entitlements proposed by this group. And let's go through some of them quickly."

People accumulate the debt and then the rest of us have to pay for it? The government is going to pick it up? Two thirds of the American people never went to college. Two thirds of the American people are going to subsidize people who went to college who are, in most cases, wealthier than those who have subsidizing them. Genius idea by the Democratic socialists. Free college? Free college for everybody? Well, what does that mean? Tuition is already through the roof. These college campuses, they can't stop building their empires into themselves. There's never investigations for why this is. Why? Because this is the indoctrination mill of the left, so they want more and more kids to go through there. But the spending is already out of control in these universities and colleges -- by the way, which squelch free speech among other things -- but free college? Family leave? Family leave. Did we have children before family leave? Did we know how to raise children before family leave? Do we really need the government through some cockamamie scheme subsidizing parents who have children? I mean, this is absurd. Whatever happened to responsibility? Government run healthcare. They've come up with a lot of cute names like Medicare-for-All. The problem is, it eliminates Medicare. It eliminates all private healthcare. We're all going to live under the Veterans Administration. Where we all have a right to healthcare. Really? Ask the vets. When they go to the Veterans Administration, do they get to say I need this medicine. I need this medicine. I need it to be there tomorrow. No. What does that mean? A right to healthcare. It's an absurdity. No private insurance, no Medicare, including illegal aliens, according to Bernie Sanders. Now think about that. How the hell are we going to control costs in healthcare? Guaranteed minimum income. That was a brainchild of Cory Booker and others. So you have what they call a baby bond. Cradle to grave. Guaranteed minimum income? Why the hell would anybody work with all these benefits? A Green New Deal. You know what this is? This is imported from Germany. It used to be called the De-Growth Movement, the Deindustrialization Movement specifically aimed at making America poor and it has been embraced now by every single candidate in one form or another running for the Democratic nomination. And climate change. Climate change. Jake Tapper went after the Vice President last week about it. Chuck Todd has announced with his fiat, we will not have manmade climate deniers on our network ever again. Two guys who know nothing about climate. We have physicists, meteorologists, climatologist with PhDs up the wazoo, thousands of them who questioned manmade climate change or the impact men can have on the climate. They're not allowed anymore on NBC apparently and Jake Tapper says the scientists decided. I don't know how they know that. But I do know this. It'll kill the economy. It'll kill the economy. Massive Federal infrastructure spending. You drive around Washington, D.C., they never stopped building. Oh, we've got the Metro that goes all the way out. It never works. But it goes all the way out. Two roads into four roads, overpasses, bypasses, underpasses, all kinds of stuff going on. It never ends. We're going to add $2 trillion, and how much of that is going to flow through the hands of local and state governments for a thousand different purposes. But where is this money coming from? We have a proposal from Kamala Harris. Federal subsidies for local teacher salaries. Say what? Oh, yeah, Federal subsidies for local teacher salaries. And they're proposing expanding Social Security, the trustees of the Social Security trust, which there's no money, by the way, because the Federal government stole it already. They say eight years is all we have under Social Security. The left wants to expand a program that is sinking rather than trying to figure out how to protect it for the people who've paid into it. Now out of these proposals, and I've only just gotten started. There's five new entitlements -- universal childcare, parental or family leave, government-run healthcare, guaranteed minimum income, Federal subsidies for local teacher salaries -- where's this money coming from? We'll take it from the rich. We will tax the rich. Ladies and gentlemen, there aren't enough rich. There's not enough wealth in the entire universe to pay for all this. And their proposed costs are a joke. Because they don't know what it's going to be 10 years from now anymore, that they know what the climate and the weather is going to be 10 years from now. They're always low. This is a destructive program. It not only will fundamentally transform America, it will fundamentally destroy our economic system. And what happens when you destroy an economic system? Government gets stronger and stronger and more and more abusive, which is why virtually every one of these Democrats reject the limitations placed on them and their agenda and the progressive ideology by your Constitution. No, I'm not done. Taxes. We have proposals for a wealth tax. Unconstitutional, but don't worry, that'll go the way the Electoral College. Proposals for 70 percent to 90 percent marginal tax rate. A war tax. A Wall Street investment tax. Higher corporate income taxes. Financial transaction taxes. Every kind of tax you can think. We're going to tax our way into wealth and equity. They have plans that will do nothing but destroy the society. And the media, you sit there as the Praetorian Guard and you protect these people, you protect the idea of a big, ubiquitous centralized government with an unaccountable massive bureaucracy, pushing people around. We never talk about liberty anymore, or individualism anymore, or success, or true free market capitalism. Look around you. Look at all the wealth that we have. You go to a grocery store, there's everything you want in a grocery store. Look around your home, look what we have. We don't appreciate what we have. Well, we do, but they don't. And let me remind you, this agenda -- well, this agenda is quite Stalinistic. What do you mean, Mark? Oh, all of these left wing sites and so forth are going to dismiss you. Dismiss me as you will, but pay attention. Facts, listen to this. Chapter X of 1936 Constitution, Stalin's Constitution for the Soviet Union. This is where the Democrats get their policy ideas. Article 118, \"Citizens of the USSR have the right to work, that is, are guaranteed the right to employment and payment for their work in accordance with its quantity and quality.\" Article 119, \"Citizens in the USSR have the right to rest and leisure. The institution of annual vacations with full pay for workers and employees and the provision of a wide network of sanatoria, rest homes and clubs for the accommodation of the working people.\" It sounds just like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Article 120, \"Citizens of the USSR have the right to maintenance in old age, and also in case of sickness or loss of capacity to work. This right is ensured by the extensive development of social insurance of workers and employees at state expense, free medical service for the working people, and the provision of a wide network of health resorts for the use of the working people.\" Article 121, \"Citizens in the USSR have the right to education. The right is insured by universal, compulsory elementary education; by education, including higher education being free of charge, by the system of state stipends for the overwhelming majority of students and universities and colleges.\" I could go on. Why is it that these Democrats embrace, not the American dream, but the Soviet dream? Oh, yes, it's true. Why is it that we don't have serious substantive discussions about what they're proposing and how they're going to be paid for? Enough of these platitudes. Enough of this fortune cookie stuff where you pull a sentence out of a cookie and you just read it. Tax the rich - that answer is not good enough. Redistribute wealth - that answers not good enough. Pay that gap - that answer is not good enough. We need facts. We need information. Your children, my grandchildren, generations yet born. That's what this is all about. These proposals coming from the left, coming from the Democrats, part of this progressive ideology, are anti-American. That's right, I said it, they're anti-American. Capitalism. Nobody talks about capitalism anymore. The Industrial Revolution, the biggest middle class on the face of the Earth. We have clean water. It comes right into our homes. You turn the faucet on, there it is, how did that happen? Electricity with the flip of a switch. How did that happen? We have washing machines, dishwashers, toasters. We have heat when we need it. We have air conditioning when we need it. And don't give me that most Americans don't get these things. Almost all Americans have access to these things. Almost all Americans have access to these things. The average American in this country lives better, in more luxury than Kings and Queens 200 years ago. As I said earlier, walk into your local grocery store. Look at the -- look at the shelves. Look at the 14 different kinds of bread with five different grains. Go to the other aisle. Look at the different kinds of meats you have, 80 percent fat, 85 percent fat, 96 percent fat -- all different cuts. Look at the different poultry, the different fish all over the country, all over the world. The different wines. I could go on and on. Why would we destroy such a society? It's time to take on the left. Time to take on the Democratic leadership. It's time to take on socialism with Americanism. And I have a special guest tonight who is going to help us do that, Forrest Lucas of Lucas Oil. He started from nothing, and he is a successful man who contributes to this society far more than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. But first, don't forget, most weeknights you can watch Levin TV, just give us a call 844-LEVIN-TV, 844-LEVIN-TV and join us, we have a wonderful community over there. Or go to blazetv.com/mark; blazetv.com/mark. One other thing, the hottest book in America. Folks, this is very, very important. We stand for freedom of the press. The modern mass media today stand for unfreedom of the press. Read all about. We'll be right back."

We had to kind of trucks we hauled cattle with and stuff like that, you know, so I could do of all that. I got out of school, and I was married and had a baby on the way already. I did not want to work in a factory all my life. At that time, that's what most people did. You got a job. That was your job the rest your life. That's what you were going to do or become and I didn't want to do that. But I ended up you know, with a factory job in the night shift. And now I can do the other work during the day, which I did, you know, working for the -- actually, my landlord had a lot of stuff to do. I worked for him all day long, and get five hours of sleep and I knew I wasn't going to do that forever either. So I started saving up enough money to buy me a truck. And when I was 21, I bought my first semi and went out on the road working for Mayflower, a moving company. They went all over the country. They even went into Canada. And I was getting home about a day or two every five weeks. So I thought, okay, I'll do this for a couple of years. That was my plan going into it. I'll do this for a couple of years. You know, it's hard for my family and hard for me. But I can do it and then to have enough money to go buy my gas station or some kind of business where I could go from there. Unfortunately, my first wife, when I left and then the money started coming in, she had to blow it."

We were in Indiana, and the trucks were passing through, so I couldn't -- I didn't have time to work on them very good, so I told my wife, we're going to get on one coast or the other. And she had been to the East Coast with me and she says, there is no way in the world we're going to go back there.

We didn't have air conditioners, so it's hard on the drivers, too. I started looking around the additives. What can we do to put in here to make this all better? And I found some stuff that was on the market. That was better than nothing. So okay, I kept looking for more and more and I found a guy who had a little sort of a trash company there where if you were leaving town and you had to get rid of your oil, they would come in and take it or they would buy it or you'd pay them to take it or whatever. But this guy knew a lot about oil. I was in there talking to him things, mostly oil. At the time, I had made it up for hours, I thought it was as good as I could get it. It was pretty darn good stuff. But one day, I said, I was looking for something else and I said, this is what wanted it for, and he said I've got it down here, I think just what you want and he showed me the rest of the barrel and I read some writing on it and I said, I didn't know this was ever made yet, it hadn't even been invented, and I took the lid off and I said, holy cow this is it. This is what I'm looking for."

I made up some batches that are -- after all these years, it's pretty much the same batches that I used right then. One for the engine oil and one for gear oil and then one for the fuel. And is sent the trucks back out. They went from four and a half miles to a gallon. They all ran at the same time, same engines up to five miles per gallon and the smoke went away because it was all burning. So we didn't have any atmosphere problems at all, which was not a problem at that time anyhow. But then the engines quit burning their oil, and your boxes are all cooled down. So I fixed all my problems right there with just those two products."

And if have everybody -- you have the right to haul this particular product to this particular place and that's kind of where it was. Regulations were like that. And this is getting way out of control. Some of the big guys were buying up all the regulations there were and some of the little guys out there were just still stuck with having to haul for those guys -- the big guys. And that wasn't working too good. And then there's people like myself, although I was hauling moving them and stuff. I get to places like California where everybody moved them to California. Nobody was moving back. So I was a hot freight. There's plenty of people out there that would let us haul their stuff, we would haul for less money. You've got out there, they were a lot better. So I was on the hot freight."

Coal might be a little nasty, but that's -- that can be worked out one way or another. But the big thing is, we are in control of a lot of things in the world now.

Their programs almost never work, and yet the answer to their programs is more government. We just haven't tried enough. We just haven't spent enough. We just haven't done it. This is one of the reasons I wanted you on the program, so people can understand. Here's a real living success story, a capitalist who came from nothing and produces something that we all need and we all want.
