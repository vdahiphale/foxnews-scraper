      "sentences": "In just a few moments, we will speak to the President of the United States in his first on camera interview since he was diagnosed with coronavirus last week. Our own Dr. Marc Siegel will interview the President about his condition: if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } how he is doing, assess his health.

Hurricane Delta has made landfall in Southwestern Louisiana. It's a Category Two storm.

But first, good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For a guy who has been in politics all of his life, Joe Biden has never learned to lie very well. You think he would have picked up some flair over the years, given the extensive practices had, but no. Biden still tells whoppers like a child, like that insecure fat kid in your sixth grade class who was always bragging about how his dad was a secret agent, when actually he worked in insurance. So there was a scary gang guy called Corn Pop, he was going to kill me. So I beat him with a chain, then I went to South Africa to free Nelson Mandela from jail, but a bunch of Nazis arrest me at the airport, but I fought them off and -- okay, Joe, you say to yourself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You're kind of embarrassed for the guy. It's just so transparent and dumb. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But Biden isn't embarrassed. He assumes you believe him or maybe he is so deep in his internal fantasy world, he doesn't care what you think. Either way, he keeps going tall tale after tall tale. And then I went to a segregated black college, top of my class. The guys there love me. The whole thing is weird, it's a little sad. What's interesting, though, are those moments in which Joe Biden doesn't lie, when instead he decides to tell the truth in the face of criticism. That's not an easy thing to do for a man who is desperate to be loved. So you've got to ask yourself, why is he doing it? It's happening right now. It's interesting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Repeatedly, Biden has been asked in recent weeks whether he plans to pack the Supreme Court with partisan Democrats if he is elected. The answer is obvious. Of course, I would never do that. I'm not a radical. I'm moderate. I'm from Scranton. You can trust me. And in fact, that's essentially the answer Biden has given on a bunch of different issues like a fracking ban or the Green New Deal. He used to support those things. Now, he claims he doesn't support them. It's an election year, he wants to win, he'll say anything. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But again, what's weird is that Biden isn't trying to reassure you that he won't pack the Supreme Court. Most Americans don't want them to do that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They don't want to destroy an entire branch of government and turn into a political judiciary. They know that's a bad idea. But again, Biden is refusing to reassure them. What does that tell you? It tells you that packing the Supreme Court is the one thing Joe Biden is certain to do if he is elected. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Listen to his answer on the question from yesterday. Notice, he doesn't even bother with a colorful story. Here it is. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Well, they put some thought into the question just before the last vice presidential debate, the Biden campaign apparently got an intern to Google up some facts to justify court packing. They came up with Abraham Lincoln, probably a few minutes before Kamala Harris took the stage. They handed her the notes and she repeated it.

For the record, it's a place called Ottawa. Kamala Harris could probably tell you, but when it comes to Abraham Lincoln, she's completely at sea. None of what she said was true. Michael Burlingame would know, he runs the Lincoln Studies Department at the University of Illinois at Springfield, and he was baffled by what he saw at the VP debate. \"I've never seen anything like that quote, and all my 36 years of Lincoln research,\" Burlingame later said. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In fact, Lincoln didn't immediately nominate a new Supreme Court Justice before the 1864 election because he couldn't. The Senate was not in session at the time. And in 1864, there were fewer direct flights to Washington. Senators couldn't just hop on a red eye from California to come in and vote. Things moved more slowly. In December, the day after the Senate reconvened, President Lincoln immediately nominated a replacement to the court. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So Kamala Harris's version isn't real, it didn't happen.

It'll move very quickly towards the north, throughout the overnight hours tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But take a look at this, this is incredibly active season. Ten named storms that made landfall in the U.S. this year, five of those as hurricanes, and behind us, there is nothing big concerning that we're watching and that's really good news. We have a little bit of a break and we're heading toward the end of the season. Hopefully we'll continue to see things remain very calm. What happened today is a storm earlier today was a Category Three storm, and then it moved over this very much relatively cooler water and began to weaken a little bit and that's good news, brought it into landfall as a Category Two storm. And as it pulls towards the north, we will see this rapid weakening from it now. But as it does, we are going to see a lot of rain, some spots, probably 10 to 12 inches of rain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Winds still, they've been around 80 miles an hour in Lake Charles where we saw the worst of that damage from Hurricane Laura. Now you've got a lot of people just with tarps for roofs right now and you're seeing those kinds of winds so that's certainly very concerning for us. Track from the storm continues to pull off towards the north and northeast, eventually getting in around parts of the Tennessee Valley. We'll see that for tomorrow and in towards the day on Sunday. Still lots of rain ahead and lots of wind, but hopefully this is our last storm that we're going to have to deal with this in this crazy 2020 season -- Tucker.",

He went as far as even saying that if the President had called upon to launch the missiles in several occasions, they couldn't have done it. The missiles were deactivated.

We are tracking it. We'll have an update on that as well. But first, good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. For a guy who has been in politics all of his life, Joe Biden has never learned to lie very well. You think he would have picked up some flair over the years, given the extensive practices had, but no. Biden still tells whoppers like a child, like that insecure fat kid in your sixth grade class who was always bragging about how his dad was a secret agent, when actually he worked in insurance. So there was a scary gang guy called Corn Pop, he was going to kill me. So I beat him with a chain, then I went to South Africa to free Nelson Mandela from jail, but a bunch of Nazis arrest me at the airport, but I fought them off and -- okay, Joe, you say to yourself. You're kind of embarrassed for the guy. It's just so transparent and dumb. But Biden isn't embarrassed. He assumes you believe him or maybe he is so deep in his internal fantasy world, he doesn't care what you think. Either way, he keeps going tall tale after tall tale. And then I went to a segregated black college, top of my class. The guys there love me. The whole thing is weird, it's a little sad. What's interesting, though, are those moments in which Joe Biden doesn't lie, when instead he decides to tell the truth in the face of criticism. That's not an easy thing to do for a man who is desperate to be loved. So you've got to ask yourself, why is he doing it? It's happening right now. It's interesting. Repeatedly, Biden has been asked in recent weeks whether he plans to pack the Supreme Court with partisan Democrats if he is elected. The answer is obvious. Of course, I would never do that. I'm not a radical. I'm moderate. I'm from Scranton. You can trust me. And in fact, that's essentially the answer Biden has given on a bunch of different issues like a fracking ban or the Green New Deal. He used to support those things. Now, he claims he doesn't support them. It's an election year, he wants to win, he'll say anything. But again, what's weird is that Biden isn't trying to reassure you that he won't pack the Supreme Court. Most Americans don't want them to do that. They don't want to destroy an entire branch of government and turn into a political judiciary. They know that's a bad idea. But again, Biden is refusing to reassure them. What does that tell you? It tells you that packing the Supreme Court is the one thing Joe Biden is certain to do if he is elected. Listen to his answer on the question from yesterday. Notice, he doesn't even bother with a colorful story. Here it is."

It's not like he's never thought about the subject of packing the court. Joe Biden sat on the Senate Judiciary Committee for decades, famously. At one point, this specific issue came up during a hearing. Here's what Biden said about it."

      "utterance": "President Roosevelt clearly had the right to send to the United States Senate and the United States Congress a proposal to pack the court.

It was a terrible, terrible mistake to make, and it put in question for an entire decade the independence of the most significant body, including the Congress, in my view, the most significant body in this country, the Supreme Court of the United States of America."

It's not a partisan issue. It's common sense. The system has worked this way for hundreds of years. Let's not wreck it now.

So how is the Biden campaign explaining this way? Well, they put some thought into the question just before the last vice presidential debate, the Biden campaign apparently got an intern to Google up some facts to justify court packing. They came up with Abraham Lincoln, probably a few minutes before Kamala Harris took the stage. They handed her the notes and she repeated it. Here's what she said."

Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge not only the White House, but the Senate. But Honest Abe said, it's not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next President of the United States and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land."

      "utterance": "So that's Kamala Harris's version of American history. It's not correct. Not surprisingly. She really mentions it, but Harris actually didn't grow up in this country. She moved to Quebec when she was 12 and she didn't come back until after high school. So if the question is, what's the capital of Canada? For the record, it's a place called Ottawa. Kamala Harris could probably tell you, but when it comes to Abraham Lincoln, she's completely at sea. None of what she said was true. Michael Burlingame would know, he runs the Lincoln Studies Department at the University of Illinois at Springfield, and he was baffled by what he saw at the VP debate. \"I've never seen anything like that quote, and all my 36 years of Lincoln research,\" Burlingame later said. In fact, Lincoln didn't immediately nominate a new Supreme Court Justice before the 1864 election because he couldn't. The Senate was not in session at the time. And in 1864, there were fewer direct flights to Washington. Senators couldn't just hop on a red eye from California to come in and vote. Things moved more slowly. In December, the day after the Senate reconvened, President Lincoln immediately nominated a replacement to the court. So Kamala Harris's version isn't real, it didn't happen. It was her version of the Corn Pop story. It was colorful, but entirely made up. What's not a fantasy is their plans, hard to believe, but this is real. They're planning to completely change our American form of government. That is very close to happening, closer than a lot of Republicans want to admit and you should be worried about it. For details on what they plan to do, if elected, we're joined now by Judge Jeanine Pirro, she's the host, of course of \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" on FOX News and the author of the book, \"Don't Lie to Me: And Stop Trying to Steal our Freedom.\" She joins us now.

They just have a hissy fit and decide how they're going to change things. They don't like the Electoral College, because that's how Donald Trump got elected, so now they want to change it to the Popular Vote, but what they intend to do when they're laughing at the people who support them, and they're lying to the rest of us when they say, look, the issue of who the next Supreme Court Justice is will be on the ballot. No, that's not on the ballot, there is no Supreme Court Justice on the ballot. Their intent is to pack the court so that we have a Supreme Court of 11 or 12 however many they need, of justices dressed in black who are nothing more than another legislative branch who will create the law of activist judges of whatever law they want to satisfy whatever raw power it is that they need. Congress won't matter. The Executive Branch won't matter. They'll have the Supreme Court so they don't believe in originalist interpretation of the Constitution. They believe in being activists and they will change everything. They will change America. This election is about everything being on the ballot, and I've got to tell you, what they are saying when Joe Biden says I'm not going to tell you, I'll tell you after the election, is they're disrespecting the people. They are disrespecting the process and they are disrespecting the American Constitution. We are entitled to know.

The First Amendment freedom of speech, freedom of religion, we saw it in the pandemic; the Second Amendment, Kamala Harris says she can take away your guns, she can confiscate them.

The hurricane that made landfall six weeks ago, that was Hurricane Laura and it was the strongest one we saw this year, a Category Four storm caused incredible damage, especially around the Lake Charles area, people just this last week got power back, and now another landfall from another hurricane. This one, Delta, made landfall about an hour ago in Creole just around 13 miles to the east of where Laura made landfall. It's moving pretty quickly. It'll move very quickly towards the north, throughout the overnight hours tonight. But take a look at this, this is incredibly active season. Ten named storms that made landfall in the U.S. this year, five of those as hurricanes, and behind us, there is nothing big concerning that we're watching and that's really good news. We have a little bit of a break and we're heading toward the end of the season. Hopefully we'll continue to see things remain very calm. What happened today is a storm earlier today was a Category Three storm, and then it moved over this very much relatively cooler water and began to weaken a little bit and that's good news, brought it into landfall as a Category Two storm. And as it pulls towards the north, we will see this rapid weakening from it now. But as it does, we are going to see a lot of rain, some spots, probably 10 to 12 inches of rain. Winds still, they've been around 80 miles an hour in Lake Charles where we saw the worst of that damage from Hurricane Laura. Now you've got a lot of people just with tarps for roofs right now and you're seeing those kinds of winds so that's certainly very concerning for us. Track from the storm continues to pull off towards the north and northeast, eventually getting in around parts of the Tennessee Valley. We'll see that for tomorrow and in towards the day on Sunday. Still lots of rain ahead and lots of wind, but hopefully this is our last storm that we're going to have to deal with this in this crazy 2020 season -- Tucker."

We should note that these are very unusual circumstances.

And after two days, I said, you know, I want to go out and say hello to the people and I went to Secret Service, and these are the people that are with me all the time. And they said, we have no problem, sir. I said, I just want to take a drive by them and just wave, and you saw what happened, it was a great display of love out there. It's -- I don't think there was one negative person. And there were many, many, many people, but I don't think there was anybody negative out there. It was just -- they went crazy when they saw the van go by the -- you know, the car go by and the people in were protected. They were very heavily protected. Because at that time, I guess I would have been positive. But they were very, very protected. And they've been with me, you know, they have been with me for a long time and they understand. But they also thought it was very important. I thought it was very important to show my affection for them. They were standing out there 24 hours a day, you saw that. I mean, every time you'd be on television, you'd see them in the background. And I just thought I you know, I love the people that -- I love the people of this country, and I thought it would have been very disrespectful if I was there for three, three and a half days.

So it's a lot easier for me than somebody that's you know, not -- doesn't have access to a doctor so easily where it's a big deal to see a doctor. But, you know, here we have all over the White House, frankly, they are watching every corner. But I think very important for me was very early. You know, as soon as I felt something, and you know, I'm thinking about it, because I see what's going on. And I have a lot of -- a lot of people are around me even though there is tremendous testing, but a lot of people around me. So I think about it. And I know there's a danger, but I can't be somebody that goes into a basement and just hides in a basement for the rest of my life. I'm running a country, the greatest country in the world. So what I think the big secret for me was I got there very early. And, you know, I think it would have gotten a lot worse. One of the doctors said he thought it would have gotten a lot worse. I just think that even these medications, they're a lot better if you get them early than if you get them late, you know, it will react probably better.

Well, up next, you may have read today, Democrats have set up a commission that could remove Donald Trump under the 25th Amendment, but we've got some video that shows the commission could have other uses, too. We will show you after the break."

      "utterance": "Well because apparently she doesn't consider the country unstable enough, Nancy Pelosi today announced legislation that would make it possible for the Congress to unilaterally take the President out of office under the 25th Amendment of the Constitution. That's the amendment that outlines the procedures for removing Presidents who can no longer perform their duties as President. But here's the interesting thing. According to Nancy Pelosi, this new legislation has nothing to do with Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "For future presidents, like, let's say you elected some guy who was like 78 years old, and the Congress decided you know, he couldn't do the job. So maybe be his VP had to be President. Scenarios like that. No matter what she is thinking of, Nancy Pelosi does seem like maybe the wrong person to deliver a message about fitness for office. Maybe you've seen her speak in public recently. If you haven't, here's one example last month. Nancy Pelosi froze completely and then rebooted live on air in the middle of an interview. Watch this."

The anchor didn't say anything. He didn't want to mansplain, so he didn't. The rest of the media reached the same conclusion. They decided the safe bet is just to agree with Nancy Pelosi."

Here you have CNN, which has its own weightlifting correspondent who also hosts a show at night, who does squats on TV and screams at strangers on the street, threatens them. But they're upset about the President's roid rage. They have to remove him because of his roid rage. Oh, it's all so great. Steve Krakauer has been watching carefully. He is the founder and editor of the \"Fourth Watch\" newsletter and the podcast. He joins us tonight. Steve, great to see you. So roid rage. They are very against -- they are very concerned that the President has been pumping too much iron in his basement and screaming at people at the Hamptons. Should they be?"

But this is like the most commonly prescribed steroid in the country, according to \"The Washington Post\" actually. You know, it's for like rashes and allergic reactions. This is not some like roid rage happening. And honestly, the biggest proof that this is completely ridiculous is, has anything Donald Trump done in the last seven days since his COVID diagnosis, any different than the Donald Trump free COVID diagnosis? I mean, rage tweeting, it's like -- was he tweeting differently before? I don't understand why they are coming up with his other than they're just trying to find some new talking point."

It does seem like if you have a national audience, you want to tell the truth, and sometimes the truth is upsetting. But you don't want to go out of your way to make the country more volatile and scare people needlessly. That seems reckless to me."

      "utterance": "And certainly -- yes, it's certainly not in the very serious situation of the President of the United States coming down, getting hospitalized with coronavirus. You'd think now, okay, let's all just focus on the facts and sort of lower the temperature, report to the public who probably is nervous about this. Instead, we get people like, honestly, Sanjay Gupta, who has been at CNN for a long time. You've worked with him, I worked with him. Now, he is on the air saying, I think the President is sicker than the doctors are letting on. You think you think the President is sick? I mean, why are you even saying what you think? And even today, diagnosing based on an interview, what he was hearing of a cough was saying, oh, you know, it sounds like he is actually sicker than then than we think, It's completely ridiculous and is not based, in fact, and for a media that really likes to, you know, hold themselves up as very fact based, we get this on one of the most important topics in the country right now, a very fact free sort of reports."

After the break, we'll talk to people behind the film who said they've got proof of that. This is not an irresponsible take. It is fact based and it's pretty shocking. We'll be right back."

Why don't we know a lot more about this? Because the government has hidden that information from us outrageously. But now, some of that information has come into public view, thanks to a new documentary called \"The Phenomenon.\" We learned the Feds are hiding more than we thought they were."

The answer is yes, and that's all this was about, and why the Federal government all of these years has covered up, put brake pads on everything. Stopped it. I think it's very, very bad for our country."

But that's not even the biggest claim he makes. According to the film, Reid said that UFOs have actually and repeatedly interfered with our nuclear weapons capabilities. So where are these UFOs from? Some researchers told the filmmakers that their origins are becoming clearer."

If this wasn't an election year, we'd be doing a full hour and may be a full week, it's that important. Unfortunately, we just have a few minutes with James Fox. He is the director and producer of \"The Phenomenon\" now available in streaming services and Christopher Mellon, a former senior intelligence official from the Department of Defense. They join us tonight. Mr. Fox, first to you. Thank you both for coming on and for making this film. I just want to ask you in turn about these two strains from the documentary, the first to you, James Fox, is the question of the nuclear weapons facilities. How often do we think UFOs have visited and why? JAMES FOX, DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER, \"THE PHENOMENON\": Well, that was one of the big bombshells that Harry Reid dropped during production of the film, it really kind of caught me off guard, because the first time, you know, a government official of his magnitude, of his level had revealed that these UFOs were not only seeing over, you know, super-secret nuclear weapons facilities, but they were interacting, shutting on and off some of the missiles. He went as far as even saying that if the President had called upon to launch the missiles in several occasions, they couldn't have done it. The missiles were deactivated. And this has also been happening in Russia, and we document those cases very thoroughly with high level military officials testifying about these incidents."

      "utterance": "Well, this is -- my congratulations to James. This is the most informative and engaging documentary and important documentary on this subject because it's no longer a theoretical issue as you've observed. This is -- now, the Defense Department has confirmed this is happening. Congress is asking questions. They're asking for a report. So this information, people need to get an understanding and a context with which sort of process and absorb this. In terms of the materials, there are private researchers, Jacques, perhaps foremost among them, also To The Stars Academy, that have materials and are funding research. Jacques is a meticulous scientist, so he is sending it to peer review in multiple labs. But the gist of it is that those materials were engineered at an atomic level. It's a capability that we don't even possess. If they can prove that and demonstrate that, that will raise a lot of interesting questions."
