I don't think we're voting for that guy. They want to raise your taxes. I don't know. Maybe they know something I don't. Blue wave? We are going to raise your taxes. We're going to let crime go all throughout our country. We're going to get rid of ICE so that as the crime comes in, we're going to have none of our people that are so tough -- these are great people, but these are tough, strong, these are -- these are warriors. These are warriors. I don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. I look at these people in the front row, two of whom I know, they don't want to do it. ICE doesn't like, hey, it's like let's go out to dinner. They have done an incredible job.

California has just increased in size to 500 million people. California has just become one really large person. California -- think of it. He says, I want to open the border. I want everyone to come in at the same time for illegal aliens and illegal immigrants, lots of different names. He wants to get rid of ICE. He wants to cut down on law enforcement and he wants to pay for their medical, their health care and their education. But I really ask one -- look, it's all about common sense, right. I think I won because of common sense and because like you, like you, you, me, we are smart. We're really smart. But I said to myself, just common sense. Everyone is going to come in.

Now Democrats want to steal trillions of dollars from Medicare. They will ruin your Medicare, watch. They want to turn America into Venezuela. I don't think so.

I didn't touch your social security. Remember what I said? Growth. Growth will take care of it, growth. And that's what's happening, we are growing beyond what anybody expected, beyond what those people thought was possible. We are growing. It's called growth. A lot of money is coming in. Democrats also want open borders and all of that equals massive costs, massive. And massive crime and massive tears, tears. You look at the families that have been so badly hurt. Republicans want strong borders. We want to finish the wall. We are up to $3.2 billion. We have done a lot of work on the wall. A lot of people don't understand that but that's OK. We're going to finish the wall and we'll get that approved. We're going to get it approved.

I could do that whole thing in one year but these guys are holding back. The only thing Democrats are good for is obstruction and resisting. Their whole campaign is resist, resist. I don't get it.

Come on in, free college. In Florida, the Democrat nominee for governor wants to abolish ICE and release hundreds of criminals onto our streets. He wants to also take care of their Medicare and every other thing you can take care of. You name it, he wants to take care of it. And Florida will be a disaster. Florida is one of the most successful states in our union -- it will be a disaster.

This election is a choice between Democrats who want to abolish ICE and Republicans who want to abolish MS-13. It's very simple. People have no idea how bad they are. Nancy Pelosi got extremely angry at me when she started yelling, they are human beings, don't talk to them like that. Don't call them animals. Remember, she said don't call them animals. Then you see what they do and how they do it and the viciousness of it. No, I'm sorry Nancy. I'm very sorry. I hate to tell you, Nancy.

This election is about jobs. It's safety and it's jobs. Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never before in our history. Think of it, in our history. Nobody knew this was going to happen. If I would have set this on the campaign trail, if I would have used 4.2, you saw it was adjusted upward from 4.1. 4.2 GDP. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The press would have gone after me and they would have said, impossible. Jobless claims just fell to a 50-year low, 50 years. We have created over 4 million new jobs since the election and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Not only is it good for them, our country saves a tremendous amount of money. But it's good for them, they have jobs. We've added over 400,000 new manufacturing jobs that the Democrats say are gone and that number is going to vary shortly with what's happening in certain areas, be well over 600,000 manufacturing jobs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Something that makes me very happy. It makes a lot of my friends very happy. African-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest -- think of it, the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country. Remember, I said it, what do you have to lose? Go with me. What do you have to lose? So good. We are going to have a tremendous African-American support because they say and they see. You know, before I said, what do you have to lose? Now I say, see, looks what's going on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The lowest unemployment in the history of our country. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have also reached their lowest rates in the history of our country. Youth unemployment has just reached its lowest rate in nearly half a century. Unemployment for Americans, this is so important. Without a high school diploma, has reached the lowest level ever recorded. Think of that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Women's unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in nearly 65 years. We have added 100,000 jobs building pipelines and supporting the production of oil and natural gas. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have added something great to our portfolio by increasing exports of clean, beautiful coal by over 60 percent -- 60 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Montana knows something about coal. Think of that. Over 60 percent, we've freed it up. It's a great natural resource for us. Clean -- I call it clean, beautiful coal. What they can do with coal today. In the first eight months of 2018, Montana coal production increased by 2.5 million tons. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's a lot. That's a lot, right? To continue this incredible momentum we need to elect more Republicans like Matt Rosendale. You got to do it because it can be turned off -- it can be turned off so quickly. Last week we made another truly historic announcement. We are replacing NAFTA with a beautiful new brand because it is a much different deal. It will be called, the U.S.-Mexico trade deal. One on one. And hopefully, Canada will come into that deal and if they don't that will be fine and if they do, that will be fine. Either way, we can live. We'd be very happy. I think they will because we love Canada. We do love Canada. They have treated us pretty badly in trade for the last 40 years, but that's OK. It wasn't my fault. We're going to make a fair deal with Canada just like we did with Mexico. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We are cracking down on unfair trade practices emanating from China. America is tired of getting ripped off. We are going to get a great deal for our farmers and ranchers and factory workers. We are giving our workers and businesses a level playing field. Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and a very importantly, tax reforms. The average Montana family of four will take home $2,281 extra dollars this year and many will take home much more than that. And our tax cut saves family, farms and ranches and small businesses from unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. So now, you leave your -- I have a beautiful farm, husband and wife and you love your kids -- by the way if you don't love your kids, don't leave it to him. Don't worry about it. Then this won't help too much. But you want to leave it to your kids. You like your kids to take over the farm, but you couldn't do it because they had to borrow a fortune in order to work it out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We got rid of that tax, that's a big deal. It's a big, big deal. So you can leave your small business or your farm or your ranch and they won't have to go into a big bank and say, gee whiz, wouldn't it be great if we could borrow some money? By the way, Dodd Frank, that little thing, I fixed it -- Dodd Frank has been changed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We are canceling Obama's illegal anti-coal so-called clean power plant. That sounds so beautiful. You know what that means. You know when I did it I said, man, this is a tough one. It sounds so nice, clean power plant. There's only one problem, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. It will put our country out of business. It took away our greatest natural resources and we couldn't do anything with them. It was such a pretty term -- clean power plant is out of business now. We're going to have clean power but it's not going to be under the clean power plant. And we are strongly protecting our public lands for hunters and fishermen and everyone who loves the outdoors, like my son, Don, who comes here a lot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } My son comes here a lot, you know that. A lot of you know my son, Don, he comes here, he loves hunting. We passed veterans choice giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor if he has to wait in line for the rest of his life. And we also passed the landmark VA Accountability Act. They've been trying to pass both of them for more than 45 years and I got them both passed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And with accountability now, when a bad government worker abuses one of our great veterans, and we love our veterans, we turn to them and we say, you are fired. We secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion next year for our military. And at my direction, the Pentagon is working hard to create a sixth branch of the United Estates Armed Forces, the Space Force. So important. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } People don't know, I mean we are not just talking about going up to the moon, going up to Mars. We are talking about, you need it. Now you need it. You look at Russia, you look at China, you look at what's going on and what they are doing. We need -- we will be the best of the world very shortly in space. I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran deal and I also recognize the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Big deal. It was a big deal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the embassy is already built. It's built about 20 years ahead of budget and schedule. I would say we're probably about 20 years, you know that story. I'm not going to tell it, but we built it real fast. We had the best location. They are all looking for a location and a friend of mine, the ambassador to Israel said, oh, but we already have the best piece of land in all of Israel. Best piece of land in Jerusalem and we have a building on it, let's renovate it. So instead of spending $1.2 billion, we spent $400,000. That was set… And instead of opening it in 10 to 20 or 30 years or maybe never, we opened it about four months later. It's been open for a long time already. A lot of people work in there. So we have the embassy already open. Do I get credit for saving a billion bucks? Not really. Someday. Someday. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know when Abraham Lincoln made that Gettysburg address speech, the great speech, you know he was ridiculed. He was ridiculed. He took the horse and carriage up from the White House. He rode it partially in that carriage and partially at a desk in the Lincoln bedroom which is incredible by the way in the White House, and he went up to Gettysburg and he delivered that speech, the Gettysburg address. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And he was excoriated by the fake news. They had fake news then. He was excoriated. They said it was a terrible, terrible speech. They said it was far too short. It's not long, many of us know it by memory. It was far too short and it was far too flowery. It's too flowery. Four score and seven years ago, right? Too flowery. And he died. Fifty years after his death they said it may have been the greatest speech ever made in America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Pretty good. Pretty good. I have a feeling that's going to happen with us. In different ways, that's going to happen with us. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized to other countries for America. They apologized. We are so sorry, we're so sorry, so sorry. Now you have a president who's standing up for our country and standing up -- Look at the size of that guy, man. Look at this guy. Do I like him? Wow. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We are not going to mess with him tonight, I tell you. Thank you, man, that's cool. That's really great. Thank you very much. We are standing up for your values, we are standing up for Montana and we are standing up for our national anthem and our flag. But if Democrats get back into power, they will try to reverse all of our incredible gains, gains like nobody thought possible. So this November you need to get your friends and get your family, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican. Get out and vote for Matt Rosendale. He's going to be a great senator and he will always vote for what we want. He will always vote for America first, so make America great again. Matt will always be voting for us. It won't just be talk. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country, sometimes not so easily, but it's happening, and it's happening fast. We are returning power back to where it belongs, back to the American people. Our American ancestors braved the oceans, tame the wilderness, won a revolution and fought to victory in two world wars. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We defeated fascism, triumphed over communism and we delivered millions into freedom.

It's an incredibly important hour of television. I am really proud of my team and what we accomplished there. Watch it tomorrow night, 10:00 p.m. DVR us if you're out and about. But that's all the time we have tonight. Let's go to Shannon Bream, who has been on the Hill, covering every aspect of this Kavanaugh hearing.

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "And they lost, and they lost big. That's why we are here. In 2016 the American people voted to reject this corrupt globalist. They voted to reclaim their independence and their pride and they voted most importantly to make America great again. It's very simple. Soon we would be changing it to keep America great. Keep America great, soon. When should we do that, by the way? OK, wait a minute, soon we will have to change because we are doing well. So when do we change make America great again to keep America great? I don't know, soon. We are draining the swamp and the swamp is fighting back. But don't worry, we will win. We will win. We always win. We always win. This November you need to vote Republican. Vote for Matt Rosendale and vote to put America first. Have to do it. Republicans stand for stopping illegal immigration, fixing horrible trade deals, cutting your taxes in a major, major way, biggest tax cut in the history of our country. And in addition to that, we got ANWR. You know what that is, right, in Alaska? They've been trying to get that approved for 50 years. We got it approved. It's part of that plan. We will be defending your social security which the Democrats will destroy, and we are going to be defending your Medicare and protecting the safety net for truly needy Americans, people that need help that are Americans, not for people that come into our country illegally. Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to raise them. I don't get it. I don't think I can win if I say I'm going to raise you -- ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to raise you're taxes. Oh, good. I don't think we're voting for that guy. They want to raise your taxes. I don't know. Maybe they know something I don't. Blue wave? We are going to raise your taxes. We're going to let crime go all throughout our country. We're going to get rid of ICE so that as the crime comes in, we're going to have none of our people that are so tough -- these are great people, but these are tough, strong, these are -- these are warriors. These are warriors. I don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. I look at these people in the front row, two of whom I know, they don't want to do it. ICE doesn't like, hey, it's like let's go out to dinner. They have done an incredible job. So they want to raise your taxes, they want to open your borders, they want crime to pour in because that's what's going to happen when you open your borders. How about the governorship of California? He just announced that he wants to open borders and he wants to let anybody come in that wants to. And then he wants to pay for all medical, for all school. What happens, I said it, if the entire world decides to go to California because they get free health care, free medical care, and free education? California has just increased in size to 500 million people. California has just become one really large person. California -- think of it. He says, I want to open the border. I want everyone to come in at the same time for illegal aliens and illegal immigrants, lots of different names. He wants to get rid of ICE. He wants to cut down on law enforcement and he wants to pay for their medical, their health care and their education. But I really ask one -- look, it's all about common sense, right. I think I won because of common sense and because like you, like you, you, me, we are smart. We're really smart. But I said to myself, just common sense. Everyone is going to come in. I may even move to California to get free health care. I may move there. The last time Democrats were in power, they cut Medicare by more than $700 billion to pay for the scandalous Obamacare. Now Democrats want to steal trillions of dollars from Medicare. They will ruin your Medicare, watch. They want to turn America into Venezuela. I don't think so. Democrats would destroy Medicare with Medicare for all, you heard that. Medicare for all, until they run out of money which would be like on the third day. And then, it would be Medicare for none or be one-tenth Medicare what you used to get. They want to rob our seniors of their Medicare benefits and they want to raid your social security. They will destroy your social security and I'm going to save your social security. We are not touching your social security. Do you remember when I ran? Do you remember when I ran? I said, I'm not touching social security. Everybody said well -- and everybody else wanted to do things with social security. I said, we are not touching your social security, right. I didn't touch your social security. Remember what I said? Growth. Growth will take care of it, growth. And that's what's happening, we are growing beyond what anybody expected, beyond what those people thought was possible. We are growing. It's called growth. A lot of money is coming in. Democrats also want open borders and all of that equals massive costs, massive. And massive crime and massive tears, tears. You look at the families that have been so badly hurt. Republicans want strong borders. We want to finish the wall. We are up to $3.2 billion. We have done a lot of work on the wall. A lot of people don't understand that but that's OK. We're going to finish the wall and we'll get that approved. We're going to get it approved. Just move it along. I'd like to do it. I could do that whole thing in one year but these guys are holding back. The only thing Democrats are good for is obstruction and resisting. Their whole campaign is resist, resist. I don't get it. We would have no crime. We want to protect America's great people and its great citizens. We want to protect American benefits and we are doing that, and I've done it. In Maryland, the Democrat candidate for governor wants to give illegal aliens free college tuition, courtesy of the American tax payer. Come on in, free college. In Florida, the Democrat nominee for governor wants to abolish ICE and release hundreds of criminals onto our streets. He wants to also take care of their Medicare and every other thing you can take care of. You name it, he wants to take care of it. And Florida will be a disaster. Florida is one of the most successful states in our union -- it will be a disaster. You have a great candidate in Florida, it's called the Republican candidate, Ron DeSantis. Ron for governor. This election is a choice between Democrats who want to abolish ICE and Republicans who want to abolish MS-13. It's very simple. People have no idea how bad they are. Nancy Pelosi got extremely angry at me when she started yelling, they are human beings, don't talk to them like that. Don't call them animals. Remember, she said don't call them animals. Then you see what they do and how they do it and the viciousness of it. No, I'm sorry Nancy. I'm very sorry. I hate to tell you, Nancy. You are going up the wrong tree, Nancy. Republicans stand proudly with the brave men and women of ICE, with Border Patrol and with our law enforcement. Every single day ICE is tracking down drug dealers, child predators, gang members and vicious killers and we are either throwing them the hell in jail or getting them the hell out of our country, and we are doing it fast. This election, this is about safety. This election is about jobs. It's safety and it's jobs. Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never before in our history. Think of it, in our history. Nobody knew this was going to happen. If I would have set this on the campaign trail, if I would have used 4.2, you saw it was adjusted upward from 4.1. 4.2 GDP. The press would have gone after me and they would have said, impossible. Jobless claims just fell to a 50-year low, 50 years. We have created over 4 million new jobs since the election and lifted almost 4 million Americans off of food stamps. Think of that. Not only is it good for them, our country saves a tremendous amount of money. But it's good for them, they have jobs. We've added over 400,000 new manufacturing jobs that the Democrats say are gone and that number is going to vary shortly with what's happening in certain areas, be well over 600,000 manufacturing jobs. Something that makes me very happy. It makes a lot of my friends very happy. African-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest -- think of it, the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country. Remember, I said it, what do you have to lose? Go with me. What do you have to lose? So good. We are going to have a tremendous African-American support because they say and they see. You know, before I said, what do you have to lose? Now I say, see, looks what's going on. The lowest unemployment in the history of our country. Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have also reached their lowest rates in the history of our country. Youth unemployment has just reached its lowest rate in nearly half a century. Unemployment for Americans, this is so important. Without a high school diploma, has reached the lowest level ever recorded. Think of that. Women's unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in nearly 65 years. We have added 100,000 jobs building pipelines and supporting the production of oil and natural gas. We have added something great to our portfolio by increasing exports of clean, beautiful coal by over 60 percent -- 60 percent. And Montana knows something about coal. Think of that. Over 60 percent, we've freed it up. It's a great natural resource for us. Clean -- I call it clean, beautiful coal. What they can do with coal today. In the first eight months of 2018, Montana coal production increased by 2.5 million tons. That's a lot. That's a lot, right? To continue this incredible momentum we need to elect more Republicans like Matt Rosendale. You got to do it because it can be turned off -- it can be turned off so quickly. Last week we made another truly historic announcement. We are replacing NAFTA with a beautiful new brand because it is a much different deal. It will be called, the U.S.-Mexico trade deal. One on one. And hopefully, Canada will come into that deal and if they don't that will be fine and if they do, that will be fine. Either way, we can live. We'd be very happy. I think they will because we love Canada. We do love Canada. They have treated us pretty badly in trade for the last 40 years, but that's OK. It wasn't my fault. We're going to make a fair deal with Canada just like we did with Mexico. We are cracking down on unfair trade practices emanating from China. America is tired of getting ripped off. We are going to get a great deal for our farmers and ranchers and factory workers. We are giving our workers and businesses a level playing field. Republicans passed the biggest package of tax cuts and a very importantly, tax reforms. The average Montana family of four will take home $2,281 extra dollars this year and many will take home much more than that. And our tax cut saves family, farms and ranches and small businesses from unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. So now, you leave your -- I have a beautiful farm, husband and wife and you love your kids -- by the way if you don't love your kids, don't leave it to him. Don't worry about it. Then this won't help too much. But you want to leave it to your kids. You like your kids to take over the farm, but you couldn't do it because they had to borrow a fortune in order to work it out. We got rid of that tax, that's a big deal. It's a big, big deal. So you can leave your small business or your farm or your ranch and they won't have to go into a big bank and say, gee whiz, wouldn't it be great if we could borrow some money? By the way, Dodd Frank, that little thing, I fixed it -- Dodd Frank has been changed. We are canceling Obama's illegal anti-coal so-called clean power plant. That sounds so beautiful. You know what that means. You know when I did it I said, man, this is a tough one. It sounds so nice, clean power plant. There's only one problem, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. It will put our country out of business. It took away our greatest natural resources and we couldn't do anything with them. It was such a pretty term -- clean power plant is out of business now. We're going to have clean power but it's not going to be under the clean power plant. And we are strongly protecting our public lands for hunters and fishermen and everyone who loves the outdoors, like my son, Don, who comes here a lot. My son comes here a lot, you know that. A lot of you know my son, Don, he comes here, he loves hunting. We passed veterans choice giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor if he has to wait in line for the rest of his life. And we also passed the landmark VA Accountability Act. They've been trying to pass both of them for more than 45 years and I got them both passed. And with accountability now, when a bad government worker abuses one of our great veterans, and we love our veterans, we turn to them and we say, you are fired. We secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion next year for our military. And at my direction, the Pentagon is working hard to create a sixth branch of the United Estates Armed Forces, the Space Force. So important. People don't know, I mean we are not just talking about going up to the moon, going up to Mars. We are talking about, you need it. Now you need it. You look at Russia, you look at China, you look at what's going on and what they are doing. We need -- we will be the best of the world very shortly in space. I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran deal and I also recognize the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Big deal. It was a big deal. And the embassy is already built. It's built about 20 years ahead of budget and schedule. I would say we're probably about 20 years, you know that story. I'm not going to tell it, but we built it real fast. We had the best location. They are all looking for a location and a friend of mine, the ambassador to Israel said, oh, but we already have the best piece of land in all of Israel. Best piece of land in Jerusalem and we have a building on it, let's renovate it. So instead of spending $1.2 billion, we spent $400,000. That was set… And instead of opening it in 10 to 20 or 30 years or maybe never, we opened it about four months later. It's been open for a long time already. A lot of people work in there. So we have the embassy already open. Do I get credit for saving a billion bucks? Not really. Someday. Someday. You know when Abraham Lincoln made that Gettysburg address speech, the great speech, you know he was ridiculed. He was ridiculed. He took the horse and carriage up from the White House. He rode it partially in that carriage and partially at a desk in the Lincoln bedroom which is incredible by the way in the White House, and he went up to Gettysburg and he delivered that speech, the Gettysburg address. And he was excoriated by the fake news. They had fake news then. He was excoriated. They said it was a terrible, terrible speech. They said it was far too short. It's not long, many of us know it by memory. It was far too short and it was far too flowery. It's too flowery. Four score and seven years ago, right? Too flowery. And he died. Fifty years after his death they said it may have been the greatest speech ever made in America. Pretty good. Pretty good. I have a feeling that's going to happen with us. In different ways, that's going to happen with us. For years, you watched as your leaders apologized to other countries for America. They apologized. We are so sorry, we're so sorry, so sorry. Now you have a president who's standing up for our country and standing up -- Look at the size of that guy, man. Look at this guy. Do I like him? Wow. We are not going to mess with him tonight, I tell you. Thank you, man, that's cool. That's really great. Thank you very much. We are standing up for your values, we are standing up for Montana and we are standing up for our national anthem and our flag. But if Democrats get back into power, they will try to reverse all of our incredible gains, gains like nobody thought possible. So this November you need to get your friends and get your family, get your coworkers, and get out and vote Republican. Get out and vote for Matt Rosendale. He's going to be a great senator and he will always vote for what we want. He will always vote for America first, so make America great again. Matt will always be voting for us. It won't just be talk. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country, sometimes not so easily, but it's happening, and it's happening fast. We are returning power back to where it belongs, back to the American people. Our American ancestors braved the oceans, tame the wilderness, won a revolution and fought to victory in two world wars. We defeated fascism, triumphed over communism and we delivered millions into freedom. Our ancestors built the railroads, linked the highways and they proudly planted an American flag on the face of the moon which is not shown in that movie. They did not show that in the movie. See what they are missing is that that movie would have been a much bigger success if they planted the flag like they were supposed to. We stand on the shoulders of generations of American patriots who knew how to work. You have to fight and knew how to win. Just like them, we are going to keep on fighting and we're going to keep on winning. We will not bend, we will not break. We will never give in, we will never give up. We will never, ever back down and we will always fight on to victory. We are going to have victory to keep it going. Because we are America and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation, under God. And together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again -- already happened. We will make America safe again. And above all, we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Montana. Thank you."

All of it is a slow rolling attempt to undermine a duly elected president. And meanwhile, anonymous says the president is anti-democratic. An anonymous is supposed to be the president now?

BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Anonymous also said that President Trump is making the country safer and more prosperous. Now, on the impeachment thing, we do see Democratic leaders trying to walk on eggshells on this. They focused group this. They have decided to talk about holding President Trump accountable, lots of hearings and things like that. But the base does appear to want impeachment. We've had a number of polls where 70 to 80 percent of the self-identified Democrats say they want to see President Trump impeached. Democratic leaders will not be able to ignore that."

There was no national security interest. That's why the Dems were complaining about one day they had a document dump, and many of these are being withheld by the Bush lawyers, and yet if you look at them, there's nothing confidential about them at all.

Last week we all traveled to Chicago where I held a fascinating town hall on the warzone levels of violence seen in the city's west and south sides. We talked to community leaders, law enforcement, victims of crime, heartbreaking and heartening. What's really driving the violence and what we can do about it. It's an incredibly important hour of television. I am really proud of my team and what we accomplished there. Watch it tomorrow night, 10:00 p.m. DVR us if you're out and about. But that's all the time we have tonight. Let's go to Shannon Bream, who has been on the Hill, covering every aspect of this Kavanaugh hearing. She's put in a hundred hours this week covering the proceedings. I cannot wait to watch. Shannon, take it away."
