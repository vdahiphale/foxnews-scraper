The destruction of the U.S. dollar, because by all this printing that the government's doing now, especially in the Biden administration, the fact that they're just destroying the value of it, is really what's driving up the prices of everything. It's really not, say, your father's or grandfather's inflationary story. It's not too much money to chasing too few goods. It's shutting down the economy, telling us how to operate as business owners and as producers, therefore producing less because the government's on our back, and destroying the very means of currency that we use to buy that stuff. So, if they keep printing more of something, like the U.S. dollar, for example, yes, that's going to devalue it and drive up the cost of things we buy.",

And one thing I am concerned about, and it's part of this conversation, real hourly wages, your wages minus inflation. Last month, wages were up seven-tenths of a percent. That's huge, but real hourly were unchanged. The month before that, they were down eight-tenths of a percent, the month before that, down one-tenth of a percent, the month before that, down two- tenths of a percent.

Wages should go up because employers should start paying more to get people in the jobs, first of all. Second of all, I think these fears of inflation are overblown. I -- if you don't listen to the White House, if you are on one side or the other politically, listen to the Fed. The Federal Reserve has said explicitly that this inflation is transitory because of pent-up demand. People were worried during the pandemic. They weren't buying the cars. They weren't -- certainly weren't traveling. And now that pent-up demand has caused certain hot spots of small bits of inflation. But, overall, I got to say, you wouldn't stop you -- we shouldn't stop spending on infrastructure.

Yes, she was hit by a stray bullet in the face while she was eating at a Thai restaurant on Friday. Shootings year to date in the city are up 81 percent.

The victims include a 15-year-old boy who was shot in the head while just sitting on a front porch. Gunfire, Charles, is up in several major cities across the country.

They can't be everywhere at once. And this new video just highlights that problem. We will show it to you right now, remarkable exclusive footage caught by our FOX drone team yesterday here in La Joya showing dozens of migrants just rushing the U.S. border, crossing illegally and running away from Border Patrol. They are not turning themselves in. You're going to see it's mostly adults, mostly men, no kids there. You will see two of the guys are actually already handcuffed together. And then a single Border Patrol unit in a pickup truck is futilely trying to chase them. He's completely outnumbered as these migrants scatter all into a field and run in all sorts of different directions. He's trying to follow in that truck. The migrants eventually, some of them go off in the area of a stream, a culvert. They jump into it. Some cross it. One border agent is on foot trying to track them down. One migrant gets stuck in the water. But you see video of other migrants continuing on. One tries to scale a wall. Ultimately, Border Patrol units did end up catching up with part of that group. We saw them take into custody about 15 to 20 of them. But the rest of that group, it did appear they got away and escaped into the brush. But this happens constantly down here. Take a look at this video we shot this morning also here in La Joya. We saw another group of migrants running away from Border Patrol yet again, this group running into brush. This time, they were spotted by Border Patrol more quickly. Border Patrol brought a helicopter over. They were able to pin some of those migrants down. Some of them got away into the brush. But Border Patrol ultimately was able to apprehend two men we saw them take out of the brush in handcuffs. And they took them away, but again stretched very thin.

This Ryanair plane was only briefly over Belarus while traveling from Greece to Lithuania, when it was intercepted. It had 171 passengers on board, including Americans, when a MiG fighter jet demanded it divert to the capital, Minsk. In a bizarre twist, the Belarusian authorities claimed there had been a bomb threat from Hamas. Now, when the plane landed, opposition journalists Roman Protasevich was arrested. And video has now appeared on social media in which he admits he played a role in last year's mass protests in the country. But political prisoners in Belarus have often spoken about confessing under duress and torture. Protasevich now faces the death penalty. Secretary Blinken today tweeted, in part: \"We strongly condemn the Lukashenko regime's brazen and shocking act to divert a commercial flight and arrest a journalist.\" Lukashenko is a close ally of Vladimir Putin and his actions raise further questions about the wisdom of lifting sanctions on Nord Stream II. The Russian gas pipeline would run straight through Belarus and greatly enrich the dictator. E.U. leaders have met just in the last hour and have called for more sanctions on the country as a result. They have also said that Belarus can no longer use E.U. airports or E.U. airspace. The U.K. and Sweden have said their planes cannot fly over Belarus.

The destruction of the U.S. dollar, because by all this printing that the government's doing now, especially in the Biden administration, the fact that they're just destroying the value of it, is really what's driving up the prices of everything. It's really not, say, your father's or grandfather's inflationary story. It's not too much money to chasing too few goods. It's shutting down the economy, telling us how to operate as business owners and as producers, therefore producing less because the government's on our back, and destroying the very means of currency that we use to buy that stuff. So, if they keep printing more of something, like the U.S. dollar, for example, yes, that's going to devalue it and drive up the cost of things we buy."

Wages should go up because employers should start paying more to get people in the jobs, first of all. Second of all, I think these fears of inflation are overblown. I -- if you don't listen to the White House, if you are on one side or the other politically, listen to the Fed. The Federal Reserve has said explicitly that this inflation is transitory because of pent-up demand. People were worried during the pandemic. They weren't buying the cars. They weren't -- certainly weren't traveling. And now that pent-up demand has caused certain hot spots of small bits of inflation. But, overall, I got to say, you wouldn't stop you -- we shouldn't stop spending on infrastructure. We have got to get that deal done, because it's been decades since we have invested in our infrastructure."

Yes, she was hit by a stray bullet in the face while she was eating at a Thai restaurant on Friday. Shootings year to date in the city are up 81 percent. Chicago, though, wow, Chicago had a worse weekend, where nine people were killed and 38 people injured by gunfire there. The victims include a 15-year-old boy who was shot in the head while just sitting on a front porch. Gunfire, Charles, is up in several major cities across the country. But pressure continues to mount on police. In Saint Louis, for example, which, by the way, has the worst murder rate in the country right now, the Democratic mayor there is trying to defund the police by $4 million and shut down a city jail. And here in New York, New York's attorney general, Letitia James, now pushing the Police Accountability Act.

They can't be everywhere at once. And this new video just highlights that problem. We will show it to you right now, remarkable exclusive footage caught by our FOX drone team yesterday here in La Joya showing dozens of migrants just rushing the U.S. border, crossing illegally and running away from Border Patrol. They are not turning themselves in. You're going to see it's mostly adults, mostly men, no kids there. You will see two of the guys are actually already handcuffed together. And then a single Border Patrol unit in a pickup truck is futilely trying to chase them. He's completely outnumbered as these migrants scatter all into a field and run in all sorts of different directions. He's trying to follow in that truck. The migrants eventually, some of them go off in the area of a stream, a culvert. They jump into it. Some cross it. One border agent is on foot trying to track them down. One migrant gets stuck in the water. But you see video of other migrants continuing on. One tries to scale a wall. Ultimately, Border Patrol units did end up catching up with part of that group. We saw them take into custody about 15 to 20 of them. But the rest of that group, it did appear they got away and escaped into the brush. But this happens constantly down here. Take a look at this video we shot this morning also here in La Joya. We saw another group of migrants running away from Border Patrol yet again, this group running into brush. This time, they were spotted by Border Patrol more quickly. Border Patrol brought a helicopter over. They were able to pin some of those migrants down. Some of them got away into the brush. But Border Patrol ultimately was able to apprehend two men we saw them take out of the brush in handcuffs. And they took them away, but again stretched very thin.

This Ryanair plane was only briefly over Belarus while traveling from Greece to Lithuania, when it was intercepted. It had 171 passengers on board, including Americans, when a MiG fighter jet demanded it divert to the capital, Minsk. In a bizarre twist, the Belarusian authorities claimed there had been a bomb threat from Hamas. Now, when the plane landed, opposition journalists Roman Protasevich was arrested.

    {
      "speaker": "LYDIA HU, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi there, Charles. When the University of Pennsylvania health care system issued this policy last week, it said that about 70 percent of its employees were already vaccinated, and now the remaining 11,000 workers have until September 1 to get the vaccine. Now, they join a short, but growing list of other companies making similar policies. Most of them are health care providers, but also on this list is Delta. It's requiring vaccines of its new hires. Now, lawyers say these types of vaccine mandates are -- issued by employers are generally on solid legal ground, especially in a health care setting. This means that employers can probably use their disciplinary proceedings in order to enforce these mandates, which could include termination for an employee that does not comply. Listen to this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEVIN TROUTMAN, FISHER PHILLIPS LAW PARTNER",
      "utterance": "The employee says, no, I don't want to get vaccinated, the employer has the right to say, well, you can't come to work here, and we can only give you a certain amount of time off. And then, if you don't get vaccinated, you're not going to be able to be employed here anymore."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HU",
      "utterance": "Important to note here, Charles, that a mandate must also include exceptions for religious observances or health reasons. But I also want to add that I'm hearing from a major health care union that represents thousands of workers, from nurses and nurses aides and lab techs across the country, just within the past hour, and they tell me that they oppose these types of employer mandates, although they also generally encourage their members to get the vaccine. And that really underscores the tension here, because, although these mandates might be legally permissible and enforceable, it doesn't mean that companies that are issuing them won't get sued by employees that say, hey, this is an overreach, this is a violation of my right to privacy in my health, or possibly it's discriminatory in its application. So, as we move forward here, we could see this unfold more in the court system -- Charles."

      "utterance": "Right. Lydia, thank you very much. I want to get to read from our legal eagle today, attorney Katie Cherkasky. Katie, I -- we just heard what Lydia had to say. But I also read where states are getting involved, states like Alabama, where they may try to make it where employers cannot take these sort of courses of action and certainly wouldn't be able to have adverse outcomes, like firing people or denying them promotions. Where are we on this legal spectrum?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, it's very complicated, needless to say, because the coronavirus has really kind of exceeded the legal landscape, if you will. So the law hasn't really caught up in all ways how to deal with this. But it's -- but, for the most part, employers can absolutely mandate the vaccine. There's really nothing stopping them from doing so. The question is, should they do so? Because, as the reporter mentioned, this is going to be a huge problem with lawsuits and unions speaking out against it. So, practically speaking, is it really a good business idea? They can certainly do so, because there's nothing that prevents employers from making certain conditions of employment, except, of course, for religious or disability purposes, which are already regulated by the federal government for. But, yes, it's an interesting time, needless to say."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right. If you're a pregnant woman, and you're hesitant, and your company says, well, it's still a vaccine or no vaccine, that sounds like it's a serious legal issue for the company to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",
      "utterance": "It very well could be, but it would have to go through that litigation process, because, on its face, an employer can, in fact, mandate that, except for, of course, observing disability and religious exemptions, and things of that sort, which they're already required to observe."

      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",

The state's Republican governor says they are starting to see signs that the move could be paying off. Montana's Governor Greg Gianforte joins me now with an update. So, Governor, tell us -- tell us what's happened since then."

      "utterance": "Well, Charles, good to be with you. We have had a terrific response. We were paying people to stay home, which was appropriate during the midst of the pandemic. And, as you know, we were the first state to remove these supplemental benefits. And we have just heard from all sectors. Two quick anecdotes. I had a hotel owner here in Helena, Montana, who hadn't been able to find workers for months. In fact, the manager was cleaning rooms and doing laundry himself because he couldn't get anybody to apply. Within a couple of days of us removing the supplemental benefits, they had 60 applications that single hotel. Another paint contractor in Bozeman, Montana, hadn't been able to find anyone for months. Within two days after us removing these supplemental benefits, six applications. Montana's open for business, and now we're getting people back to work."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I did the math, and I don't know if the data is right, but 510 bucks the state unemployment, $300 from the federal. If the if the per capita income was $31,000, that's $42,000. I mean, it's -- I mean, when you hear the media say that it was a heartless move on your part, that you, that Republicans are denying these folks who are out of work, what do you say to that? What kind of pushback do you give against this? Because, ultimately, you're helping the small businesses and these people to do -- pull themselves up by their bootstraps."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIANFORTE",
      "utterance": "And you're right, Charles. We were paying people $42,000 a year to sit at home. And unemployment is a safety net. And we need it. It should be there for the people when they hit a rough patch. But, as I have said many times, it should not be a career choice. And we were incenting people to stay home, instead of getting back to work and, in the process, removing the satisfaction that comes from working hard and being self-sufficient. We want to give people the dignity of work. We have plenty of jobs."

    {
      "speaker": "GIANFORTE",
      "utterance": "Yes, there is. We did three things. We removed the supplemental benefits, going back to the benefits that we had pre-pandemic. We reinstituted the search-for-work requirement. And then we took some of the American Rescue funds, working with our legislature. If you were on unemployment May 4, and you go back into the work force, work for a minimum of four weeks, you get a $1,200 bonus. Again, we wanted to remove the non-work bonus and replace it with a work bonus. That's what we have done here in Montana."

We wanted to be in a position where we take care of all the Americans that choose to come here and get a line wet or just view the mountains. And our hotels, our restaurants, they didn't have the staff they needed. We needed to provide an incentive to get people back, so we could take care of all our visitors this summer."

So do my next guests agree? FOX News contributor Deneen Borelli, Democratic strategist and FOX News contributor Jess Tarlov, and The Washington Examiner's Kaylee McGhee White. Deneen, law and order back in focus for the Republican Party?"

And, look, government's basic role is to protect citizens. And this -- voters need to understand how policies affect them and their families. They need to connect the dots. So, when you look at how Democrats are behind bail reform, they're behind defunding the police, these are initiatives that are not good for Americans. And it will result in more crime, which we're already seeing across the country."

All of a sudden, Eric Adams comes out of nowhere, and he's high in the polls in part because he's sort of taking an approach like, let's support the police. It seemed counterintuitive for New York City. I mean, if New York City goes this way, isn't that a message to Democrats?"

Eric Adams has made it a cornerstone issue, and as a borough president, and it's something that he has taken seriously throughout his career and knows how much it matters to New Yorkers. In just the fact -- the past few weeks, crime and policing has leapt to the number one issue to New Yorkers, as people have gotten vaccinated and COVID has moved down the list in terms of their priorities. And the same thing is happening all over Democratic-run cities in America. Now, I think there's a tremendous opportunity for Democrats to put forward smart reforms, not talk about defunding the police, which only 18 percent of Americans support, but to talk about banning choke holds, to talk about ways that we can reform or reimagine the police, so that we don't end up with outcomes like what happened to Eric Garner or George Floyd or Breonna Taylor, and we can satisfy everyone who agrees that we want to root out the bad apples, but we want to make sure that we're safe and secure. And that is what government is there for."

And they're the ones who get the ink, the headlines. And, listen, they all kind of stoke the protests last year, even those that violated COVID protocols. So, it feels like they really thought they were on the winning horse. It's not winning anymore. Americans are being -- are starting to suffer, their own daily lives, every single day. And they're not even looking at political parties anymore. They're like, bring back the police, aren't there?"

    {
      "speaker": "KAYLEE MCGHEE WHITE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Well, the 2020 election, I think, was a really good indication of how voters feel about this issue, because you had several House Democrats lose races that the Democratic Party did not expect to lose. The House GOP actually made some really surprising gains. And several House Democrats even said to their own colleagues that they blamed defund the police rhetoric for those losses. So, you even have this kind of internal skirmish of more moderate members who recognize that anti-law enforcement rhetoric is hurting the party, because voters will not stand for it."

You couple that with the changes in education that the progressives are pushing, and it just feels like the entire platform -- we all agree we're moving toward a more perfect union, so we're not there yet. But it's always about, this is not a great country, let's just completely rip up what we are and who we are because we're just a bad, evil place to be."

That means jobs and cheap, reliable energy. They don't support school choice. And you look at all the number of Americans who were in Democrat-run states who were overly harmed by the lockdowns because of the virus. And so we're looking at different policies that are taking effect, rules and decisions that are made by Democrats that are not in the best interests of the Americans."

And he was one of the loudest voices saying that defund the police is the wrong way to go and that we lost seats as a result of that. But I do think that there is ample room for Democrats to make the case about what patriots are. I believe that we have more members of the House who have served than Republicans do people ,like Jason Crow, who was a hero and protected people during an insurrection that was fomented by Republicans themselves, many of whom did not serve, but perpetrated the big lie."
