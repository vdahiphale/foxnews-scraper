      "sentences": "Jeez. Oh, hey, look at you. Happy Tuesday. What a marvelous time to be alive. Well, if you weren't working for CNN Plus. Sick burn, but you should consider yourself lucky and grateful. And not just because you're watching the former Calvin Klein underwear model who also happens to be the king of late night. Although you should be. Gratitude matters. I even thanked my assistant today by not making her cry. When the soup she brought me had only three slice shallots instead of four. I still threw it in her face. So, do you know -- do you show enough gratitude for all the great things in your life? Are you grateful for your family? Your friends, your proctologist with really slender fingers? That matters? And what about me? Are you thankful for me? Then why don't you show it? Why not get a tattoo of my name on your face? What's stopping you? Your upcoming job interview? Your loved ones? Dignity? Well, that's not stopping Luis Angel Hernandez. This L.A. gang member convicted of murder vows to get the ultra woke district attorney George Gaskon's name tattooed on his face for shaving years off his sentence. Now he might be lying. After all, he is a murderer. But it's great. Now we can identify fail liberal policies by the tattoo on our assailant's faces. Hernandez had pleaded guilty to murder as well as personal use of a firearm for the killing of a pot delivery person back in 2018. It raises the question, what other kinds of uses are there besides personal use when you're the shooter? Last time I checked Smith and Wesson didn't have a friends and family plan. But also, he killed a pot delivery person. Why not just kill Santa Claus? Am I right, Kat?",

      "sentences": "That is an old timer. So -- so hairy. Initially, this gangbanger faced a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Facing what's called several enhancements. And I'm not talking about collagen injections or breast implants. For example, being in a gang should add 10 years to your sentence. But that means of course more jail time and in the modern woke and book, that's the very worst. Containing criminals is seen as oppressive, especially to them. It infringes on their rights to go out and mug, rape or murder. And do you really have the right to deny them that right? They're oppressed enough as it is. But in a world with pregnant men, the perpetrators are the victims. After all, we're just subjects in the left's great cultural experiment. What happens to us when we lead violent thugs out into the general population and eliminate disincentives for crime? You don't have to be Matlock or Angela Lansbury or any other T.V. detective that I have a poster up next to my bed which is shaped like a race car. FYI. Of course, after those enhancements were dropped thanks to Gascon back in 2020, crime and murder shot up quicker than Nikki Sixx three minutes before Showtime. So, hence, the show of appreciation by getting a new tattoo. Now every time someone asks about the tattoo, we asked to tell them, it's because I'm a murderer. Well, good luck getting a job. But you got to hand it to Gascon, he's got some serious street cred. I mean, gangbangers love this lawyer. Their victims not so much. But I don't know if there's anything I love that much to get its name tattooed on my face. Let me think. Hmm. Yes. I wonder what Kat would have. Jerk. Although -- hair jerk. Although details of Hernandez's new sentence aren't clear. According to Fox News, he'll be able to qualify for youth offender parole, or YOP. It's limits his sentenced to 25 years. And if you think he'll serve that out, you're as nutty as a king size payday bar. He'll finish his sentence around the time I finished this one.",

Agreed to pay $400,000 settlement to a Christian professor, they had punished for refusing to use a trans student he or she pronouns. Now, the school's pronoun is loser. But 400 grand that's almost a full student loan payment. Nick Merriweather, a Philosophy Professor at the School for 25 years, said the pronouns violated his religious belief that gender is determined at conception, much different from the school's belief, which is that gender is determined by watching tick tock videos. The school responded to Merriweather by filing a formal warning which is like a regular warning, but wearing a tuxedo. Merriweather then sued claiming he could not discuss gender issues in class for fear of being suspended or fired, and it would make it hard for him to get another job elsewhere. Sadly, colleges aren't the only ones, are the only ones that hire philosophers. Well, that and Uber. Anyway, the sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that the school violated Merewether its rights to freedom of speech and religion and reached the settlement last week. So, I guess the Constitution isn't just sexist and racist. It's also transphobic. But what more can you expect from a bunch of white males besides excellence?",

Sick burn, but you should consider yourself lucky and grateful. And not just because you're watching the former Calvin Klein underwear model who also happens to be the king of late night. Although you should be. Gratitude matters. I even thanked my assistant today by not making her cry. When the soup she brought me had only three slice shallots instead of four. I still threw it in her face. So, do you know -- do you show enough gratitude for all the great things in your life? Are you grateful for your family? Your friends, your proctologist with really slender fingers? That matters? And what about me? Are you thankful for me? Then why don't you show it? Why not get a tattoo of my name on your face? What's stopping you? Your upcoming job interview? Your loved ones? Dignity? Well, that's not stopping Luis Angel Hernandez. This L.A. gang member convicted of murder vows to get the ultra woke district attorney George Gaskon's name tattooed on his face for shaving years off his sentence. Now he might be lying. After all, he is a murderer. But it's great. Now we can identify fail liberal policies by the tattoo on our assailant's faces. Hernandez had pleaded guilty to murder as well as personal use of a firearm for the killing of a pot delivery person back in 2018. It raises the question, what other kinds of uses are there besides personal use when you're the shooter? Last time I checked Smith and Wesson didn't have a friends and family plan. But also, he killed a pot delivery person. Why not just kill Santa Claus? Am I right, Kat?"

      "utterance": "That is an old timer. So -- so hairy. Initially, this gangbanger faced a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Facing what's called several enhancements. And I'm not talking about collagen injections or breast implants. For example, being in a gang should add 10 years to your sentence. But that means of course more jail time and in the modern woke and book, that's the very worst. Containing criminals is seen as oppressive, especially to them. It infringes on their rights to go out and mug, rape or murder. And do you really have the right to deny them that right? They're oppressed enough as it is. But in a world with pregnant men, the perpetrators are the victims. After all, we're just subjects in the left's great cultural experiment. What happens to us when we lead violent thugs out into the general population and eliminate disincentives for crime? You don't have to be Matlock or Angela Lansbury or any other T.V. detective that I have a poster up next to my bed which is shaped like a race car. FYI. Of course, after those enhancements were dropped thanks to Gascon back in 2020, crime and murder shot up quicker than Nikki Sixx three minutes before Showtime. So, hence, the show of appreciation by getting a new tattoo. Now every time someone asks about the tattoo, we asked to tell them, it's because I'm a murderer. Well, good luck getting a job. But you got to hand it to Gascon, he's got some serious street cred. I mean, gangbangers love this lawyer. Their victims not so much. But I don't know if there's anything I love that much to get its name tattooed on my face. Let me think. Hmm. Yes. I wonder what Kat would have. Jerk. Although -- hair jerk. Although details of Hernandez's new sentence aren't clear. According to Fox News, he'll be able to qualify for youth offender parole, or YOP. It's limits his sentenced to 25 years. And if you think he'll serve that out, you're as nutty as a king size payday bar. He'll finish his sentence around the time I finished this one."

Like to launch that thing if you know what I mean. I don't know what I mean. The concern, some might perpetuate negative stereotypes, you know, of hard working dwarves like me. Among those flags -- I'm not that short. Though some of the -- what they were concerned about was Tinkerbell because she's body conscious and jealous of Peter Pan's attention. Well, who wasn't? And of course this casts a negative stereotype on people identifying as tiny magical fairies. Captain Hook. Apparently there were fears he'd exposed Disney to accusations of discrimination against people with disabilities since he's a villain with a hook for a hand. But also he might discourage children from going into pirating. That's unfair. Now it might seem absurd that Disney was so fearful of their back catalogue but they're also terrified of the one percent of their employees who are woke nut jobs. You think it'd be pretty chill considering Walt's been frozen solid for 45 years. But sometimes they do make the right call. You got to admit. I mean do you remember the original Mickey Mouse and friends? Holy crap."

All right, use this pronoun they demand and he walked away with 400-grand. Shawnee State University in Ohio -- is that real? Agreed to pay $400,000 settlement to a Christian professor, they had punished for refusing to use a trans student he or she pronouns. Now, the school's pronoun is loser. But 400 grand that's almost a full student loan payment. Nick Merriweather, a Philosophy Professor at the School for 25 years, said the pronouns violated his religious belief that gender is determined at conception, much different from the school's belief, which is that gender is determined by watching tick tock videos. The school responded to Merriweather by filing a formal warning which is like a regular warning, but wearing a tuxedo. Merriweather then sued claiming he could not discuss gender issues in class for fear of being suspended or fired, and it would make it hard for him to get another job elsewhere. Sadly, colleges aren't the only ones, are the only ones that hire philosophers. Well, that and Uber. Anyway, the sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that the school violated Merewether its rights to freedom of speech and religion and reached the settlement last week. So, I guess the Constitution isn't just sexist and racist. It's also transphobic. But what more can you expect from a bunch of white males besides excellence?"
