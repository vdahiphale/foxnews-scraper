I'm Martha MacCallum and \"The Story\" tonight as the FBI claims to have lost five months of text messages between these two individuals, who were kicked off and removed from the Mueller probe, Peter Strzok, and Lisa Page. Now, top Republicans say that they have really gotten to the point where they're fed up with the lack of answers on all of this, and they say there may now be real grounds for a second special counsel to investigate what is going on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to a statement just released moments ago by Congressman Gowdy, Goodlatte, and Nunez: \"Rather than clearing up prior FBI and DOJ actions, these recently produced documents cause us to further question the credibility and objectivity of certain officials at the FBI.\" Congressman Trey Gowdy and John Ratcliffe will be here in a moment with more on that.

      "sentences": "Martha, good to see you. And breaking tonight, sources close to the House Intel Chair Devin Nunes tell Fox that, in fact, he and some other key Republicans are now moving to begin the process to release that four-page memo that is at the center of these allegations that top Obama officials at the FBI and the Justice Department were conducting surveillance of top Trump officials. These Republicans include Nunez, who I mentioned, but also Trey Gowdy, and Bob Goodlatte, who's Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. That's important because he has oversight of both the FBI and the Justice Department. And what they're doing, I'm told, is going through the steps they have to take to release that memo to the public by early February. Now, the FBI just put out a statement a few moments ago under pressure, saying they want a copy of this four-page memo -- and they requested it from the House Intel Committee but so far, they've declined. The FBI says they'll take appropriate action if they see the memo. These Republicans, though, on the House Intel Committee and elsewhere say that the FBI knows what's in the memo, and they think that by releasing, it will put pressure on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a second special counsel beyond Robert Mueller to probe these allegations that during the campaign and the transition, Obama officials were basically spying on Trump officials. I'm told, Nunes and the other Republicans involved were compelled to act because they were angry about learning this weekend: the FBI is claiming it did not retain text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page from December 14, 2016 to May 17 of 2017. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's an amazing coincidence since that covers a good chunk of the presidential transition, the early days of the Trump administration, but also because May 17 happens to be the day that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to take over the Russia probe. Now, the attorney general just puts out a statement warning: \"We will leave no stone unturned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced. We'll use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recovered from another source.\" Republicans' upset because this is reviving those suspicions about e-mails wiped from Hillary Clinton server on top of the fact that some of the new text messages between Strzok and Page may cause trouble for former FBI Director James Comey.

So, when President Trump announced that he was phasing out Obama's DACA protection, the DREAMERS started flexing their political muscles and demanding that the Democrats use filibuster power in the Senate to deny government-funding unless they gained full legal status. At first, those requests went nowhere but the movement slowly picked up steam, and late last year, a number of Democrats came out in support of the DREAMERS' demand, saying they would vote against funding. Now, that didn't stop a funding bill in late December from passing, but it certainly ginned up the DREAMERS influence in last week's government shutdown. The question now is whether that influence led Democrats to miss read polls and overplayed their hand. The polls, as you see, do show that American voters on both sides of the aisle support legislation to allow DREAMERS to remain in the U.S. legally, but experts say voters did not support shutting down the government to make that happen. But now, immigrants' rights activists are blasting Democrats for \"retreating\" on the shutdown and walking away with no concrete gains.

Investigators say Paddock also did internet searches for the biggest open air concerts in the U.S. and for how crowded Santa Monica beach gets here in Los Angeles. Paddock's research included information on Las Vegas SWAT team tactics, as well as exactly what weapons and explosives police in Las Vegas use.

From a civil perspective, some of the information even in this report is very helpful to the civil litigation because of the things you're bringing up tonight. How did this happen without somebody's eye -- if you remember when Mr. Wynn was on several months ago and he talked about their policy at the Wynn, and how service elevators aren't used, and how they do not disturb sign after 12 hours, somebody knocks on the door. Let me tell you something. These are the kinds of things that are going to be looked at in this kind of case from civil liability. The MGM is going to have one hell of a defense.",

These Republicans include Nunez, who I mentioned, but also Trey Gowdy, and Bob Goodlatte, who's Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. That's important because he has oversight of both the FBI and the Justice Department. And what they're doing, I'm told, is going through the steps they have to take to release that memo to the public by early February."

These Republicans, though, on the House Intel Committee and elsewhere say that the FBI knows what's in the memo, and they think that by releasing, it will put pressure on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a second special counsel beyond Robert Mueller to probe these allegations that during the campaign and the transition, Obama officials were basically spying on Trump officials.

That's an amazing coincidence since that covers a good chunk of the presidential transition, the early days of the Trump administration, but also because May 17 happens to be the day that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to take over the Russia probe. Now, the attorney general just puts out a statement warning: \"We will leave no stone unturned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced. We'll use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recovered from another source.\" Republicans' upset because this is reviving those suspicions about e-mails wiped from Hillary Clinton server on top of the fact that some of the new text messages between Strzok and Page may cause trouble for former FBI Director James Comey.

And she's referring to the fact that Loretta Lynch has said at this point that she is going to step aside, that no politically appointed official is going to make a judgment on the Hillary Clinton situation. She's going to let the FBI do it, and that's how we know that Comey came forward and made his announcement. And she says, well, you know, about that, she said this: \"It's a real profile in courage since she knows no charges will be brought.\" And here's an exchange with James Comey and Congressman Ratcliffe.

But, as you just said, those text messages that we saw earlier today indicate that Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, and Loretta Lynch all apparently knew on the first of July that Hillary Clinton wasn't going to be charged.

At some point, we'll be going to have to talk to him again, not so much about Russia and his removal from office, but about the decisions, he made in 2016. It's really clear to me that the decision was made in May of 2016, two months before the press conference.

So, lay aside this glaring five- month gap in texts that the world's premier law enforcement agency somehow missed, lay that aside. What we have seen, what John and I saw today was a text about not keeping texts. We saw more manifest bias against President Trump all the way through the election into the transition. And I saw an interesting text that Director Comey was going to update the president of the United States about an investigation. I don't know if it was the Hillary Clinton investigation because remember that had been reopened in the fall of 2016, or whether it was the Trump investigation. I just find it interesting, the head of the FBI was going to update the president of the United States, who at that point, would've been President Obama."

Just as, you know -- it's possible that these text messages that are missing, perhaps they really were lost, perhaps it is another strange coincidence. The problem, Martha, is for former prosecutors like Chairman Gowdy and myself that worked at the department and FBI, it makes it harder, and harder for us to explain away one really strange coincidence after another. Look, the point, I think, with respect to the issue of bias that Chairman Gowdy mentioned before, we knew that Strzok and Page had an intent anti- Trump bias. And that's OK so long as they check it at the door and do their job. But we learned today in the thousands of text messages that we've reviewed that perhaps they may not have done that. There's certainly a factual basis to question whether or not they acted on that bias. We know about this insurance policy that was referenced in trying to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president. We learned today about information that after -- in the immediate aftermath of his election that there may have been a secret society of folks within the Department of Justice and the FBI to include Page and Strzok that would be working against them. I'm not saying that actually happened, but when folks speak in those terms, they need to come forward to explain the context with which they used those terms."

You have this insurance policy in the spring of 2016 and then the day after the election, the day after what they really, really didn't want to have happened, there's a text exchange between these two FBI agents, these two supposed to be objective facts-centric FBI agents saying, perhaps this is the first meeting of the secret society. So, of course, I'm going to want to know what secret society are you talking about because you're supposed to be investigating objectively the person who just won the electoral college.

Of course, we want that, I hope the Mike Horowitz, the Inspector General, got them. Unfortunately, the way our government is set up, law enforcement is better able to go to communications carriers and get texts and instant messages than the Congresses. So, I want them, but I don't want them two years from now, and I don't want them after a motion to be held in contempt of Congress. I want them sooner rather than later.

Democrats demanding no deal without protection for the DREAMERS -- a group of 800,000 illegal immigrants who did not have the right to vote in the country. Compare that to 327 million legal Americans who did not have a say in this part of the process really at all. Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast Newsroom with the backstory here. Hi, Trace!"

You know, it wasn't too many years ago the DREAMERS remained in the shadows -- 700,000 or 800,000 young people who are part of an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. But by the end of the Bush administration and beginning of the Obama term, not only had they come out of the shadows, the DREAMERS were openly defying the government to deport them. They were invited to the State of the Union address, welcomed into the oval office and spoke at Democratic conventions. By the time President Obama signed his DACA executive order protecting DREAMERS, they had become a political force. So, when President Trump announced that he was phasing out Obama's DACA protection, the DREAMERS started flexing their political muscles and demanding that the Democrats use filibuster power in the Senate to deny government-funding unless they gained full legal status. At first, those requests went nowhere but the movement slowly picked up steam, and late last year, a number of Democrats came out in support of the DREAMERS' demand, saying they would vote against funding. Now, that didn't stop a funding bill in late December from passing, but it certainly ginned up the DREAMERS influence in last week's government shutdown. The question now is whether that influence led Democrats to miss read polls and overplayed their hand. The polls, as you see, do show that American voters on both sides of the aisle support legislation to allow DREAMERS to remain in the U.S. legally, but experts say voters did not support shutting down the government to make that happen. But now, immigrants' rights activists are blasting Democrats for \"retreating\" on the shutdown and walking away with no concrete gains. Today, the White House offered this advice for those fighting for DACA. Watch."

Go look at your IRA, your 401(K), because there's money there now. So, the economy is working for also small business owners. The majority of which are started by women and people of color. So, women's lives are benefiting now with the numbers of this march as well. The first one, of course, had millions of people. Even the New York Times admits that this was considerably lower.

Extreme poverty among women was the highest ever recorded under Obama, and 3.7 million women under Obama entered poverty.

They say after conducting hundreds of interviews and scanning thousands of hours of surveillance video, there is no evidence at all that Paddock conspired with anyone. The Las Vegas metro police did release a bit of a bombshell by acknowledging that as part of the ongoing investigation, potential charges against someone else are now pending. As for the context on another possible suspect, police will only say it involves the FBI. And we now know that in the weeks and months leading up to the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock did extensive research and not just on the concert venue outside the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Investigators say Paddock also did internet searches for the biggest open air concerts in the U.S. and for how crowded Santa Monica beach gets here in Los Angeles. Paddock's research included information on Las Vegas SWAT team tactics, as well as exactly what weapons and explosives police in Las Vegas use. And police did confirm that a week before the mass shooting, Paddock rented rooms at another venue in downtown Las Vegas that overlooked a different outdoor concert. Police say the shooting from the Mandalay Bay Hotel was well-planned and well hidden. Listen."

And Steve Wilson is a great D.A., he's a great communicator. The way that he said was very terse. Well, I totally didn't have to be there. There was nothing -- he didn't bring any endearment to this. And I realize he was in a tough spot and this was a forced issue, but the bottom line is the silence has not helped the anxiety of the community.

Now, Mesquite from Nevada is 77 miles north, small town. The amount of suitcases this guy brought up to the room, the fact that he got in through the service elevator, if you talk to some of the people there, and I have, they have said that many times that people who are VIP's that gamble get up through the service elevators. We already know from the civil side of this litigation what's going to happen, that's going to be something that they will concentrate on very much. But the fact that you could bring this many suitcases with one guy in a room, the room that he was in was under girlfriend's name. He requested certain things -- what time he gets food to be delivered, how he dead bolted the doors. All of these things you wonder why didn't something catch somebody's eye?"

I love the MGM and the people they employ, and the men and women that work there in executive positions. I get it. But you and I are lawyers. We know, number one, this report was vetted very closely. We also know that the MGM's involvement in major litigation. From a civil perspective, some of the information even in this report is very helpful to the civil litigation because of the things you're bringing up tonight. How did this happen without somebody's eye -- if you remember when Mr. Wynn was on several months ago and he talked about their policy at the Wynn, and how service elevators aren't used, and how they do not disturb sign after 12 hours, somebody knocks on the door. Let me tell you something. These are the kinds of things that are going to be looked at in this kind of case from civil liability. The MGM is going to have one hell of a defense."
