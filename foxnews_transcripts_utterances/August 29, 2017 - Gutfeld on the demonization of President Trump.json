And he's the expert in climate change! But this is my point: Donald Trump is now death metal to the left. He is now a scare, officially a scare. Triggered by Trump selection, the aftershock creates uncertainty which leads to this frenzy. So to the left, Trump isn't just racist or insane, but now he's both. And yet the Democrats lost to him, how nuts does that sound? But this belief that he is crazy evil, that removes one step, dialogue that used to prevent violence because to make violence OK, you must demonize the target, which was done to cops recently. After years of demonizing, they became targets. Shots by fiends in Dallas and Brooklyn, Louisiana, San Antonio who took pigs in a blanket to heart. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You'd think some people would learn, but delusions die hard when you only talk to the diluted.",
