By the way, you know who Paladino used to work for doing that same job? Bill Clinton. You got it. Then there's David Boyd, the Democratic super lawyer who represented Al Gore and gave millions to the Clintons and Obamas, and was also employed by Weinstein. He, too, helped suppress stories of Harvey's misdeeds using what the \"New Yorker\" called a network of spies. I haven't even gotten to the rape allegations against Bill Clinton. Of course, sex scandals involving Weiner, Spitzer, Barney Frank. Need I go on? And the GOP is the party of sexual abuse? Get out of here. Last time I checked Weinstein, Spacey and Louis C.K. weren't exactly hanging out at CPAC. You see the left shield and protect their own to the very end. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, Democrat Senator Bob Menendez is currently in the middle of a federal trial for bribery. Right now, no one, and I mean, no one on the left is calling for him to resign. By the way, when Chuck Schumer was asked about this recently, he just kind of refused to answer, kind of moved on to the next question. Who can forget that after impeachment, remember that impeachment vote of Bill Clinton? The Democrats raced up to Capitol Hill after the vote and they held what was the equivalent of a White House pep rally for Bill Clinton. Only thing they didn't have is balloons. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, Republicans, they throw their candidates overboard the moment an allegation is made even if it's 38 years old. Regarding Roy Moore, as I stated last night, he was not the candidate I supported in this race. I supported Mo Brooks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, my commentary doesn't come from a place of advocacy, but rather I want to lay out the facts as we have them. This is Moore himself answering the charges from our own Sean Hannity today on the radio. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } ROY MOORE, U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE (via telephone): These allegations are completely false and misleading. I don't know Miss Corfman from anybody. I've never talked to her. I've never had any contact with her. You understand this is 40 years ago, and after my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies. I don't remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.",

And to specifically answer your question, you have to understand the people of Alabama are suspicious of anything that comes what they think comes out of Washington, D.C. They're suspicious of Washington to begin with. That's not to take anything away from these allegations that are serious, which it is.

By the way, when Chuck Schumer was asked about this recently, he just kind of refused to answer, kind of moved on to the next question. Who can forget that after impeachment, remember that impeachment vote of Bill Clinton? The Democrats raced up to Capitol Hill after the vote and they held what was the equivalent of a White House pep rally for Bill Clinton. Only thing they didn't have is balloons. Meanwhile, Republicans, they throw their candidates overboard the moment an allegation is made even if it's 38 years old. Regarding Roy Moore, as I stated last night, he was not the candidate I supported in this race. I supported Mo Brooks. So, my commentary doesn't come from a place of advocacy, but rather I want to lay out the facts as we have them. This is Moore himself answering the charges from our own Sean Hannity today on the radio."

The timing of these allegation, just weeks before the election is a little suspicious, to say the least. The fact that The Washington Post, whose editorial board opposes Moore's candidacy and then some, is the source of the bombshell should give us some pause. That's the Angle. Should Moore stay or should Moore go? What about the timing and source of these allegations? To discuss this from Montgomery, Alabama, I'm joined by Terry Butts, a retired Alabama Supreme Court justice who once represented Roy Moore and from Boston, Brian Maloney, the co-founder of mediaequalizer.com. Mr. Butts, let's start with you. You once represented Judge Moore. You served on the Alabama Supreme Court. Are there any circumstances given what you know now that would lead you to advise him to step aside?"

So, we've gotten to know Judge Moore very well at that time. And to specifically answer your question, you have to understand the people of Alabama are suspicious of anything that comes what they think comes out of Washington, D.C. They're suspicious of Washington to begin with. That's not to take anything away from these allegations that are serious, which it is. If a girl is a victim of any kind of sexual abuse, when I was a trial judge, I had a reputation of coming down very hard on child abusers. But people of Alabama will probably stand by Judge Moore, and he will be elected. And that is what is likely to happen in this instance because they are not sure on the timing of this and whether or not it's a political hit piece. That's one of the things that people are saying and they don't look at it as a necessarily as a moral issue as such necessarily, but whether or not it's just more politics or more of the same."

We had Juanita Broderick make a rape allegation against Bill Clinton and it was difficult to find mainstream media outlets that would do much of anything. They reported it initially in The New York Times. NBC (inaudible) report. Lisa Myers actually pursued that, but it went away, and it was a rape allegation, this is rape. For these people to come on television and say, this just shows you, this is a party of abuse, party of sexual abuse. Get out of here. I listed the names of the Democrats who have had their own sexual problems. Most of them are not encouraged to resign, step aside, and often they don't even get a reprimand."

The northeastern media and The Washington Post, they're not trying to be journalists here. They have become the story. They are creating the news. How you know this is in the timing? I used to work on political campaigns. I know how to time a hit piece on your opponent. That is exactly when you do so. Here you have a political figure who's been well known in that state for decades. Where was this, in a bruising primary battle where tens of millions of dollars were spent, how come none of this came about? And then a Washington Post reporter waltzes into the state and suddenly gets the scoop of the decade in that state and has this magical story unfold. Now to me at this point it's not even so much about whether it's guilt or innocence because we weren't there. It was almost 40 years ago. What it is about is a fundamental misunderstanding by the northeastern media that it is ultimately the people of Alabama that will decide this race. They are the ones voting, not anyone in Washington. I don't think they can get past that in D.C."

I couldn't even watch the news again. That part of it is infuriating. At the same time, it is hard to ever disprove something like this. If a man or woman is accused of something decades and decades later, how do you ever -- you can't really ever respond. You can't really get your reputation back. If it's not true, a man's reputation will ever be the same. If it is true, he shouldn't be running. But the people of Alabama now have this pressure on them because people like Jonah Goldberg, columnist, and Mike Lee of Utah, they say he should step aside.

One other thing, too, that's playing out in the state of Alabama is addition to the Roy Moore thing is how is this going to affect state politics in Alabama? Is it going to bleed over into our 2018 election cycle for all of our state races, legislative and governor and others? Because what people don't realize here is if I understand the United States Senate rules, even if Roy Moore is elected in December, the United States Senate can refuse to seat him if that is correct. I'm no expert on the United States Senate rules. But what happens if the United States Senate says OK you have elected the man, but we are not going to seat him because we don't think we can. Now we have a real mess in Alabama and now we really do have a legal mess. It just continues on. That bleeds over and hurts the Republican Party in the state of Alabama. What's going on?"

Mr. Merrill, we've heard a lot in the last 24 hours about state process. The state process when something like this happens.

He's been a public figure for more than 30 years in the state of Alabama. It's very difficult for a lot of people in our state to believe that because of his history and because of the controversy that that has surrounded Judge Moore in this public service that this information is only now being introduced by someone. Of course, these charges are very, very serious and they need to be given the full measure of vetting that would be necessary to determine their validity.

But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your -- isn't a question, it's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me,\" closed quote. It's unbelievable. Louis C.K. went on to say he regretted that he hurt so many people and that he, quote, \"will now step back and take a long time to listen.\" Let's not forget that last year Louis C.K. denied the then rumors to the entertainment website, Vulture, saying, quote, \"I don't care about that. That's nothing to me. That's not real.\" And late-night comedians who are always quick to pounce any time a conservative is accused of anything had far more muted reactions to Louis C.K.

Everybody in the city knew this story including a guy like Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel. Now in Kimmel's defense, he's not speaking out because he hasn't gotten his talking points from Chuck Schumer yet.

I mean, maybe a few years ago things would have changed. It's interesting, real quickly I was listening to lecture by a theologian tonight who mentioned in passing the dramatic changes since the two of us were debating on cable news the Clinton and Broaddrick stuff that you alluded to earlier. But dramatic change in attitudes of Americans when it comes to personal conduct of public officials, and how, this was a theologian saying atheists in this country now place a higher priority on personal misconduct, personal behavior of politicians than do evangelicals. But I don't think much is going to happen. I think he's going to be in the U.S. Senate."

But you know I looked at a recent polling, he's now tied, Roy Moore, with his Democrat opponent. They're both at 46 percent.

And I hope they're not true. You saw the president tweeted about that, if they are, Judge Moore will do the right thing. But Laura, the interesting thing about Judge Roy Moore is everyone knows he is a devout Christian. He professes Christ his lord and savior. And so he knows that responsibility if he's not being truthful or whatever, what his accountability is going to be which is of course who he's going to have to answer to. But I do say this, and I say this cautiously. This is very new, these charges or allegations came out -- I hate to say the word \"charges.\" So I say stay tuned. But everyone just pray for everyone that's involved in this. And the great state of Alabama, the people of Alabama are going to come through. They're going to prevail and they're going to do what's right when they vote December 12. And the other thing, too, is I tell all the Republican, don't panic. Just pray for Judge Roy, pray for the party. And just be diligent. This is going to play itself out. So I'm very optimistic."

It actually destroyed the party. Essentially that's what happened to the DNC.

Everybody here completely misinterpreted that. The other thing Laura, they showed him a great deal of deference. He's the first leader that's been to the Forbidden City. That's just not done. Yet this is completely missed by the main stream media. The other thing he said very clearly -- I don't know this for a fact but I have a feeling that one of the things that he was probably suggesting to threaten is their most favored nation trade status. That's huge. If you start threatening how they are able to get money from us and he's saying we need to balance thing, that is in their face but a polite way.

So the other thing is now he goes to Vietnam and says, by the way, we want to have a partnership with you. The other thing he has got in his pocket is the fact that Vietnam has a great economy, the South Koreans have a great economy, the Japanese have a great economy.

I think we serve veterans by supporting groups that actually get help to the vets who need it. There are a lot of great groups out there, the Wounded Warrior Project, Homes for Our Troops, and Liberty USO just to name a few. There are a lot of them. And I think we serve veterans by remembering their stories and telling their stories to our children. We serve them by teaching our kids real history, the true history of our battles fought and lost, not a sanitized version that gels with the political correctness mores of the day. Our heroes aren't found at the Oscars or the Grammy Awards. They're found in ceremonies for Medal of Honor recipients, like the one last month for Vietnam vet Captain Gary Michael Rose."

Those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America. We were taught very directly what it means to be an American. And we have soared almost in the air a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions. If you didn't get these things from your family, you got them from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea, or the family who lost someone at Anzio, or you could get a sense of patriotism from school. And if all else failed, you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture where movies celebrated Democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special. TV was like that, too, through the mid '60s. We've got to teach history not based on what's in fashion, but what's important, why the pilgrim came here, who Jimmy Doolittle was, and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant. If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are. I'm warning of an eradication of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the American spirit. Let's start with some basics -- more attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual."
