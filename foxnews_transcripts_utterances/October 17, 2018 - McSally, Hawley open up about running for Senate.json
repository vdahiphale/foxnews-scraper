No moderates left.  Party leaders have called for incivility. They have pushed for confrontation on the streets. They have encouraged an angry mob to get in the faces of their political opponents and kick them. Now, the climate in this country is downright scary. Violent protests in some of our major cities. Two local GOP candidates now assaulted in Minnesota. A Democratic operative arrested for battery against a Republican campaign manager. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Lindsey Graham, who's going to join us in a moment, he actually got spat on. And coming up, we're going to break down all of this hysteria and tonight, we will detail specifically, you vote for a Democratic House member, well, you're voting for Nancy Pelosi. We'll tell you her plan if she gets back the gavel. We will expose the far left wing candidates that want your crumbs back.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right. Devoid of any ideas to help improve the country, the left in America completely humiliated after 2016, they are now desperate. Every two and four years, you've heard me say this often, we've become accustomed to their playbook. Republicans, racist, sexist, you know the whole list, et cetera. But over the past 21 months, we've seen something even worse than what we usually see, name-calling, identity politics, that just wasn't enough.  Instead, we watched the left for two years now vilify this president, any conservative, any Republican. Now calling on their supporters to literally create crowds, confront so-called evil opponents that happen to just disagree with them. Hillary Clinton said, you can't be civil with a Republican Party member that wants to destroy American values. And there's Maxine Waters, one of the new leaders of the Democratic Party, urging her supporters, create crowds, go after Republicans, where they eat, and grocery stores, department stores, gas stations. Cory Booker urging voters, get up in the faces of people in Congress and the cabinet. Eric Holder, Republicans go low, we kick ‘em. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This kind of rhetoric started from the very moment Donald Trump, frankly, came down the escalator, but certainly when he was inaugurated. In fact, on January 31st, right after the president is inaugurated, 2017, failed vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine, just to remind you, he had this to say about what Democrats need to do in order to reclaim their power. They were looking for it on day one. Watch this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right. Apparently, we lost that tape. On this program, we are saying this better stop. This is what I'm saying to everybody. This better stop before people, our fellow citizens, some of our elected politicians are severely injured or even killed. In this country, differences should be settled at the ballot o box, not on the streets, not with a violent mob, not with fists or intimidation. Not with riots in major cities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as you can see, this is not the approach Democrats are taking. And while words are just words, I understand, I hold people accountable for their own actions, but some people are inspired by these words, sadly. Are we really surprised by what we have been witnessing, what we have all been seeing? Sarah Sanders, her family, kids, run out of a restaurant.  Secretary Nielsen, same thing. Senator Ted Cruz, his wife, Heidi, run out of a restaurant. The Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi violently confronted just trying to go watch a movie. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Republicans shouted down all over D.C. and reports tonight in Minnesota, two local Republican candidates were assaulted by far-left individuals. In one case while talking to constituents, state representative candidate Shane Mekeland was literally sucker punched. Not only did he have a serious concussion, he will have a four to six-week minimum recovery. He says this is not what he signed up for. No kidding. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A few days earlier, while campaigning door-to-door, state representative, Minnesota, Sarah Anderson, she was punched by a person claiming to be an anarchist. And meanwhile, in Nevada, a Democratic operative arrested after violently assaulting GOP campaign manager Kristin Davidson after a political event in Vegas. Nevada's attorney general, now the Republican gubernatorial candidate, called this a new low for politics in Nevada. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And last night, Senator Lindsey Graham, who will join us in a moment, he talked about how he was actually spat at during the anti-Kavanaugh protests. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Listen, a threatening package was sent to Susan Collins' home with contents they claimed to be ricin, a poison that can kill people. Her staff receiving thousands of coat hangers, other horrible threats via phone. Make no mistakes: what we are seeing here is the left unhinged in America and they have been unhinged the day that Donald Trump announced, certainly the day he won, and the day he was inaugurated and it has not stopped.  They are hoping that this vitriol, this hatred where the even get rid of due process and the presumption of innocence, they are hoping this is what carries them into November. And if Democrats take the House, I've been telling you, and it's true, impeachment will be on the table. They just keep begging Maxine Waters, just keep it a secret. Just like the Center for American Progress says, don't talk about, ever, immigration. It's a losing issue. Just pretend you're somebody you're not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How does that help the American people? What does that do to create jobs?  How does that make us more prosperous? How does that make us and our families more safe and secure? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Investigations into this administration, if Nancy Pelosi wins, Chuck Schumer wins, it will be a daily subversion. Obamacare, that will be the law of the land. How is that working out? Keep your doctor, plan, and pay less. Remember the crumbs they were so upset about? Your tax decrease, your paycheck -- well, your paycheck will get smaller. And of course they want to abolish ICE, forget about the border wall but they just don't want to tell you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But you don't have to take my word for it, just listen to Nancy Pelosi.  She's measuring the drapes to her brand-new office. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You know why? Because you, we, the people, we get a say in this. According to a new study from NBC News, Democratic, GOP voter registration, guess what? They are at the exact same level they've been as past election cycles.

You have far left socialism, Ron DeSantis. You have a choice in the Senate in Florida. One of the most capable, honest, decent, hardworking trustworthy governors who has been successful in the entire country. Rick Scott running against confirmed far left, out of touch, Chuck Schumer incumbent Bill Nelson. Florida, wake up, you've got to get out and vote, to support Rick Scott, Ron DeSantis. Or guess what?

That took people off of food stamps. It meant there were no longer dependent on government so if you are a left-wing Democrat that's actually bad, not good. I know it's hard to believe but I have a prediction for you. Sometimes politicians and their consultants and everybody does all this planning and then history just pick things up and changes everything. I think two words are going to define the night of the 2018 election in the next three weeks. One is Kavanaugh and the other is caravan. And the combination of anger over how the left smeared, engaged in character assassination, live, used bullying tactics with Judge Kavanaugh is going to be one part of this. And the degree to which the left is eager to have 3,000 people in a caravan cross the American border, break American law, recognizing that if that happens, the next caravan will be even bigger and the caravan after that will be even bigger. And I think the American people are going to reject both the way they treated Kavanaugh and the way they are dealing with the border, and I think those will end up being the reasons the Republicans keep the House and dramatically increase the number of senators they have.",

And we picked up 12 Senate seats in one night. So, this could become a big blowout. The House is a little bit of trouble but I think what Kevin McCarthy has done in introducing a bill to gain control of the southern border and I would urge Kevin to challenge Nancy Pelosi to a national debate. Let her defend the total failure to control the American border, to protect American sovereignty, to draw a line in the sand and say no more, to welcome caravans and all sorts of deliberate effort to undermine the American system. And let Kevin explain the bill he's got that he wants to bring up in December that controls the southern border.

Three weeks from tonight, we will be talking about the results. That's how close we are. Democratic candidates, they're running on nothing but fear and extreme hatred for President Trump. There is no plan to strengthen the country, grow the economy, protect the American people. They are just fueled by this rage from their humiliating loss in 2016. And Democrats have vilified all political differences. No moderates left.  Party leaders have called for incivility. They have pushed for confrontation on the streets. They have encouraged an angry mob to get in the faces of their political opponents and kick them. Now, the climate in this country is downright scary. Violent protests in some of our major cities. Two local GOP candidates now assaulted in Minnesota. A Democratic operative arrested for battery against a Republican campaign manager. Lindsey Graham, who's going to join us in a moment, he actually got spat on. And coming up, we're going to break down all of this hysteria and tonight, we will detail specifically, you vote for a Democratic House member, well, you're voting for Nancy Pelosi. We'll tell you her plan if she gets back the gavel. We will expose the far left wing candidates that want your crumbs back. They want your money. Also, Republican Senate hopefuls Josh Hawley, Missouri, Martha McSally, war hero, will join us tonight. They will talk about the election. A brand-new breaking report, huge news from John Solomon. Robert Mueller, Jeff Sessions, I hope you're watching. Buckle up, time for a jam-packed edition of our opening monologue."

      "utterance": "All right. Devoid of any ideas to help improve the country, the left in America completely humiliated after 2016, they are now desperate. Every two and four years, you've heard me say this often, we've become accustomed to their playbook. Republicans, racist, sexist, you know the whole list, et cetera. But over the past 21 months, we've seen something even worse than what we usually see, name-calling, identity politics, that just wasn't enough.  Instead, we watched the left for two years now vilify this president, any conservative, any Republican. Now calling on their supporters to literally create crowds, confront so-called evil opponents that happen to just disagree with them. Hillary Clinton said, you can't be civil with a Republican Party member that wants to destroy American values. And there's Maxine Waters, one of the new leaders of the Democratic Party, urging her supporters, create crowds, go after Republicans, where they eat, and grocery stores, department stores, gas stations. Cory Booker urging voters, get up in the faces of people in Congress and the cabinet. Eric Holder, Republicans go low, we kick ‘em. This kind of rhetoric started from the very moment Donald Trump, frankly, came down the escalator, but certainly when he was inaugurated. In fact, on January 31st, right after the president is inaugurated, 2017, failed vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine, just to remind you, he had this to say about what Democrats need to do in order to reclaim their power. They were looking for it on day one. Watch this. All right. Apparently, we lost that tape. On this program, we are saying this better stop. This is what I'm saying to everybody. This better stop before people, our fellow citizens, some of our elected politicians are severely injured or even killed. In this country, differences should be settled at the ballot o box, not on the streets, not with a violent mob, not with fists or intimidation. Not with riots in major cities. And as you can see, this is not the approach Democrats are taking. And while words are just words, I understand, I hold people accountable for their own actions, but some people are inspired by these words, sadly. Are we really surprised by what we have been witnessing, what we have all been seeing? Sarah Sanders, her family, kids, run out of a restaurant.  Secretary Nielsen, same thing. Senator Ted Cruz, his wife, Heidi, run out of a restaurant. The Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi violently confronted just trying to go watch a movie. Republicans shouted down all over D.C. and reports tonight in Minnesota, two local Republican candidates were assaulted by far-left individuals. In one case while talking to constituents, state representative candidate Shane Mekeland was literally sucker punched. Not only did he have a serious concussion, he will have a four to six-week minimum recovery. He says this is not what he signed up for. No kidding. A few days earlier, while campaigning door-to-door, state representative, Minnesota, Sarah Anderson, she was punched by a person claiming to be an anarchist. And meanwhile, in Nevada, a Democratic operative arrested after violently assaulting GOP campaign manager Kristin Davidson after a political event in Vegas. Nevada's attorney general, now the Republican gubernatorial candidate, called this a new low for politics in Nevada. And last night, Senator Lindsey Graham, who will join us in a moment, he talked about how he was actually spat at during the anti-Kavanaugh protests. Listen, a threatening package was sent to Susan Collins' home with contents they claimed to be ricin, a poison that can kill people. Her staff receiving thousands of coat hangers, other horrible threats via phone."

And if Democrats take the House, I've been telling you, and it's true, impeachment will be on the table. They just keep begging Maxine Waters, just keep it a secret. Just like the Center for American Progress says, don't talk about, ever, immigration. It's a losing issue. Just pretend you're somebody you're not. How does that help the American people? What does that do to create jobs?  How does that make us more prosperous? How does that make us and our families more safe and secure? Investigations into this administration, if Nancy Pelosi wins, Chuck Schumer wins, it will be a daily subversion. Obamacare, that will be the law of the land. How is that working out? Keep your doctor, plan, and pay less. Remember the crumbs they were so upset about? Your tax decrease, your paycheck -- well, your paycheck will get smaller. And of course they want to abolish ICE, forget about the border wall but they just don't want to tell you.

You know why? Because you, we, the people, we get a say in this. According to a new study from NBC News, Democratic, GOP voter registration, guess what? They are at the exact same level they've been as past election cycles. Now, this means there has been no huge increase in Democratic voters nationwide, and the race for the Senate, Republicans do have good momentum and for good reason. Senator Dianne Feinstein, whose dirty political tricks surrounding the Kavanaugh nomination shocked many Americans, no due process, no presumption of innocence at all, believing any and all allegations with no corroboration -- oh, she announced she is planning to continue her war on Justice Kavanaugh if Democrats take back the Senate. She actually wants his sexual misconduct investigation reopened. This, after seven FBI investigations, including the one she wanted, found zero evidence to support any of the claims against the Supreme Court justice. Meanwhile, tonight in Florida, we are tracking two key races, including a very tight gubernatorial race between far radical left Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum and Republican Freedom Caucus member Ron DeSantis. Gillum is calling for -- get this -- a 40 percent tax increase for Florida business. If you are in Florida, let me tell you what that would do. It will wreck your economy. It will destroy any incentive for anybody to build a business in Florida. Forty percent? And Gillum also has been called one of the most anti-law enforcement candidates in history. The choice in Florida, pay attention, is clear. You have far left socialism, Ron DeSantis. You have a choice in the Senate in Florida. One of the most capable, honest, decent, hardworking trustworthy governors who has been successful in the entire country. Rick Scott running against confirmed far left, out of touch, Chuck Schumer incumbent Bill Nelson. Florida, wake up, you've got to get out and vote, to support Rick Scott, Ron DeSantis. Or guess what? Your state will become like this state, New York. Ten percent state income tax or California, 13.5 percent state income tax. In Florida, you have zero state income tax. You might want to keep it that way. In just moments, we're going to have to Republican candidates. Martha McSally in Arizona. Josh Hawley, Missouri. Hawley running against Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill. This week, projectveritas.com exposing McCaskill for just how far left her views are in a series of undercover videos including, of course, her extreme views on gun control, her campaigns plan to lie to the good people of Missouri. No, no, we're not going to really do this but we just have to act this way -- and present McCaskill as a moderate, which she is not. She says she's just like Barack Obama. Take a look."

Mueller's deputy, his pit bull Andrew Weissmann, the top of offender. All right. We'll get back to that in the days and weeks ahead.

And somehow she thinks this is either funny or not important. I mean, this is unbelievable that she thinks it's okay for Americans to commit treason.  In any other moment, this should be disqualifying and she would withdraw, but the Arizona media mostly is ignoring it or making excuses for her again."

You know, the list is pretty amazing. It really is awesome. Here's a question, are we better off as a country than we were just two short years ago with four million new jobs, eight million fewer Americans in poverty on food stamps. Let's see, a path to energy independence, three and a half billion dollars on a border wall. North Korea, Iran. I don't know.

This election is a life-and-death struggle with a left-wing movement which wants to radicalize America. You know, you are happy that there are more people at work. That took people off of food stamps. It meant there were no longer dependent on government so if you are a left-wing Democrat that's actually bad, not good. I know it's hard to believe but I have a prediction for you. Sometimes politicians and their consultants and everybody does all this planning and then history just pick things up and changes everything. I think two words are going to define the night of the 2018 election in the next three weeks. One is Kavanaugh and the other is caravan. And the combination of anger over how the left smeared, engaged in character assassination, live, used bullying tactics with Judge Kavanaugh is going to be one part of this. And the degree to which the left is eager to have 3,000 people in a caravan cross the American border, break American law, recognizing that if that happens, the next caravan will be even bigger and the caravan after that will be even bigger. And I think the American people are going to reject both the way they treated Kavanaugh and the way they are dealing with the border, and I think those will end up being the reasons the Republicans keep the House and dramatically increase the number of senators they have."

I don't hear one thing that they are running on that would benefit the American people. Obamacare? A disaster."

And yet, Democrat after Democrat has signed up for a program which I think absolutely would collapse Medicare and absolutely would eliminate all of the employer-based insurance systems, which is what Bernie Sanders says he wants to do. He wants to force you and me and everyone else into a single government system that he gets to define."

I really feel confident in the people of Florida. I really believe that Josh Hawley will win, who we just had on for Missouri as Claire McCaskill has been exposed and the same with Marsha Blackburn after Bredesen has been exposed. And I'm hoping Dean Heller, the latest polls have him up. He's always in a tough race in Nevada and I think Jon Tester is in trouble in Montana. Heidi Heitkamp is now in double digits, as she should be in North Dakota, Joe Donnelly in Indiana. I think we can win every one of those races. The only thing that worries me tonight, I don't know about the House. Don't have a big margin there."

So, the Senate could become -- if you remember in 1980 when I was working with the Reagan team, we ended up picking up 12 Senate seats, one control of the Senate, nobody expected. And we picked up 12 Senate seats in one night. So, this could become a big blowout. The House is a little bit of trouble but I think what Kevin McCarthy has done in introducing a bill to gain control of the southern border and I would urge Kevin to challenge Nancy Pelosi to a national debate. Let her defend the total failure to control the American border, to protect American sovereignty, to draw a line in the sand and say no more, to welcome caravans and all sorts of deliberate effort to undermine the American system. And let Kevin explain the bill he's got that he wants to bring up in December that controls the southern border. I think if the choice is that clear, if over here you've got sanctuary cities, MS-13, fentanyl, opioid deaths, all the different things the Democrats seem to accept, and over here you have a party dedicated to protecting you, protecting your family, protecting your neighborhood, I think we'll do just fine on election night."

But here's what I want every Democratic every candidate for the Senate to be asked tomorrow. Do you agree with Dianne Feinstein? If Democrats take control of the Senate, are you for reopening the Kavanaugh investigation? Are you for more humiliation, degrading treatment of this fine man, are you for continuing this debacle? Do you agree with Dianne Feinstein? If you get in charge of the Senate Democrats you are going to go after Kavanaugh again.

I've never had police security before, Capitol Hill police protect me ever before until the Kavanaugh hearings. Had a guy who would not let the elevator close. I had to go to my office and somebody on the elevator pushed him out. I don't know what I would have done. I had a bunch of people around me filming me, yelling at me, all over my jacket. It was pretty bad and I can only imagine what my other colleagues went through. So, this is on the ballot. What you want America to look like? Once the election is over do you want those who lost to try to physically assault those who won, or do you want to have an election once it's over we try to work together and govern the country?"
