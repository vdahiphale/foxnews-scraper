I've seen or read every interview that you've done on this media tour. A lot of people have focused on President Trump and your interactions. I wanna get to that, but I wanna start chronologically with the Hilary Clinton e-mail probe and the decisions you made there. Is it true that you and your FBI colleagues made the decision to exonerate Secretary Clinton well before she was interviewed?"

They weren't certain of that result but they said, \"Look, boss, on the current course and speed, it looks like it's not going to get to a place where the prosecutors will bring it.\" So then, in May, I started thinking, \"Okay, if it continues that way, and it may not, but if it continues that way, so, how do we end this thing in a credible way.\""

      "utterance": "Well, two ways. First, by lying in a way that we could prove, in the interview or -- or giving us a hook to continue the investigation to see if we could prove a lie or admitting something that would surprise us about her intent. Now a lot of folks have asked, good question, about why to do the interview at the end, that's fairly typical for a subject interview in a white collar investigation. I think you see Special Counsel Mueller taking, exactly, that approach with the president."

And the question was, would she lie to us? What people say in the public forum, in a debate, or in a, you know, a political campaign, is not our business. Our business is, are you going to lie to us and if you are and we can prove it then we're going to prosecute you for it (ph)."

How do describe that? I probably should of said, \"really sloppy\" (ph), but I wanted to be honest and say, \"It's above sloppy.\" It doesn't add up to what the 1917 statute meant when it said, \"grossly negligent\" (ph) is a felony"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Yea. My -- my understanding was, at that time, she was one of Clinton's attorneys. She was no longer a subject in our investigation. The agents had scrubbed her conduct very carefully by that point and she was no longer a subject. But that again, that's a reasonable question but the facts are, not a subject, one of Clinton's lawyers. She's entitled to be in an interview."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

We have one from Jay Harper Wilson (ph). \"I am a retired FBI agent, serving almost 25 years, retired in 1995 as a Senior Executive Special Agent. Please (ph) ask, Thursday, why a grand jury was not used in the Hilary Clinton investigation, as would be normally, and why was it run out of HQ, the book did not address (ph)?\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Yea, this second one, I'll take first. It was run out of HQ because it was a case of intense interests outside to the media and so, to keep it tight, it was worked in the counterintelligence division at headquarters. You can reasonably disagree with that if your FBI person. You could have put it in Washington Field Office, could have put it in New York but the decision that Counter Intelligence made was it'll be kept tighter and leak proof which it was in the Counter Intelligence Division."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

She writes, if he had any concerns regarding email investigation, classified or not, he had ample opportunities to raise them with me both privately and in meetings. He never did. So someone's not telling the truth here. Is it the former Attorney General or your?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "No, actually I think we're both telling the truth. I never went to her and said Loretta I think you should recuse yourself. My problem was she had already announced it publically that she wouldn't and that she would accept my recommendation. And so at that point, what do I do? And I decided at that point, I got to step away from her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right. Fast forward. A lot of people are upset about how it comes out. How you take control. It actually leads to Rod Rosenstein, he cites this in what you did as a reason for recommending your firing. You go on after that recommendation; you write a letter to congress to announce the case is reopened because more classified emails have been found on Anthony Weiner's computer. You said it was, last night, a tough choice between concealing or coming forward. A really tough choice. But there are authorities in New York who are saying that eight (ph) FBI HQ was slow walking that case and weeks went by without any action. Did you know that Andrew McCabe, your deputy, had sat on that revelation about the emails?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. I don't know that -- I don't know that to be the case. I do know that New York and FBI headquarters became aware that there may be some connection between Weiner's laptop and the Clinton investigation weeks before it was brought to me for decision. And as I write in the book, I don't know whether they could have moved faster and why the delay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So was it the threat that the New York agents were going to leak, that it existed really what drove you to the not conceal part?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "I don't think so. I think actually what drove it was the prosecutors in New York who were working the criminal case against Weiner, called down to Headquarters and said are we getting a search warrant or not for this. That caused -- I'm sorry. Justice Department Headquarters, to then call across the street to the FBI and poke the organization and they started to move much more quickly. I don't know why there was -- if there was slow activity, why it was slow for those first couple of weeks."

      "utterance": "You said you didn't leave but there's a New York Time story in April 2017 that first reported the Lynch email. You didn't write about it here in this book because you said it's classified. The New York Times wrote a lot about it. Did the FBI Public Affairs coordinate that story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Not to my knowledge and I'm not going to comment on any stories because I'm not allowed to confirm or deny classified information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right. In the infamous Oval Office meeting with President Trump when he asked you to stay behind one on one, you write in the book that you felt awkward. You didn't like it."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "OK. So you say you didn't push when he said he hoped you could see your way clear of letting Flynn go, that he was a good guy. Hope you can let it go. You said you didn't push back and that he should have known that he couldn't do that. All right. So let's assume that that's true that he should have known that. Is it possible there was another reason why you didn't push back and that is that you wanted to keep your job?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",

      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. In fact, that was my intention. To serve another six years."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Exactly. And on the media tour in the Blitz you basically are encouraging voters to vote Trump out of office because he doesn't line up with your values."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "I'm asking them to vote their values and what I believe your viewers would agree are America's values."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "OK. And -- but as of tonight had you not been fired, you'd still be working for this guy that you say is like a crime boss who's morally unfit, who you just don't agree with on principal and values. You'd still have that job tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Be protect -- my goal would be to protect the FBI and serve the President of the United States."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "When you say to Republicans why do you work with this President and then sit and say you would still have this job tonight. Isn't there a disconnect there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "No, because elected officials in Congress have a public platform and are responsible for communicating with the voters in a way they FBI Directors not. My job would be to protect the independence of the institution. Their job should be to represent the people who elected them."
