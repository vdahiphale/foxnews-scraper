But seriously, it's really hard to understand how we do the galloping into the spending and Republicans are now in control, and the Republicans are supposed to be the party of constraint. But I do think the president put probably the best spin, as usual, of any Republican on it by saying, look, Democrats are holding the military hostage. I caved because of that. That's a pretty good line, but I don't know if it's one that Republicans on the Hill will be able to make."

So honestly, I don't think he gets points for this. I do want to say you made me tingle just a little bit as a Democrat talking about why nobody would vote for a Republican. I just had to throw that out."

But I do think as a Democrat it's absolutely laughable that he thinks the Hispanic community and the American people are going to buy that Democrats are throwing DACA under the bus, they don't care, when the House and the Senate are majority Republican, and the majority of Republicans are what wrote these thousands of pages that nobody seems to know what's in."

This time, though, they got the military spending. And ironically, Trump wasn't upset about the spending. He didn't even mention it. That's why the tweet was so funny. He said people didn't believe it because he said the reason I might veto this is because DACA is not in the bill."

I don't know how you can really be both.

You have John Dowd in the personal legal, and then Joe diGenova we think, but there may be some back and forth about that.
