And if they have budget rules that they have to follow to make some of the stuff expire, then they're going to have to do that in order to have a bill that changes the law. But right now the law is completely unacceptable. And so, if they get something passed then it will be a step in the right direction.

Is the nationwide sexual harassment scandal that's now reached Capitol Hill? Does Team Clinton have a point or are they just mad the Democrats no longer seem to fear the power couple? And what about President Trump? Why is he tweeting about Al Franken but ducking on Roy Moore? We'll dig into all of that fair and balanced as always.

As the occupants of the New York Senate seat once held by Hillary Clinton, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is frequently mentioned as a potential contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Early in her political career, she campaigned with former President Clinton, but now Gillibrand tells The New York Times that Mr. Clinton should've resigned the presidency amid the sexual misconduct allegation that led to his impeachment and acquittal at trial in the Senate."

Over 20 years, you took the Clintons' endorsements, money, and seats. Hypocrite. Interesting strategy for 2020 primaries. Best of luck.\" Prominent figures at The New York Times, The Atlantic Magazine, MSNBC, and elsewhere have recently called for the Democratic Party and the Feminist Movement to have a \"reckoning with their defense of the 42nd president\" against charges, including rate, similar to those sweeping various industries today. Mr. Clinton belatedly acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with his 22-year-old intern, Monica Lewinsky, but he denied the rape allegations from Juanita Broaddrick. In January of this year, a Gallup poll asked respondents to rank how various presidents will go down in history. 33 percent said Bill Clinton will be ranked above average; 33 percent said just average, 17 percent listed him below average with 10 percent, predicting he'll be ranked outstanding.

The point I was making -- and thankfully I had more than 280 characters to do so, because it's a pretty complicated subject -- is, what's happening now is that people are very bravely coming forward, whether it's Rose McGowan or Barbara Comstock or Leigh Corfman with accusations of things that they felt they could never come forward with before. That it's taken a tremendous amount of bravery, and it's important. What happened with Bill Clinton is a complete false equivalency. There's no human being in the United States whose personal life, their infidelities, were looked at more than Bill Clinton. His accusers were afforded the opportunity to confront him. He was afforded the ability to defend himself. And my point about the 70- million is that it was thorough."

First of all, when you call Senator Gillibrand a hypocrite, are you admitting now that a lot of Democrats, back in the late '90s, did not call for President Clinton to resign over his relationship with an intern because they wanted him to stay in power? They wanted Democrats to keep power. Gillibrand wanted the Clinton money, she wanted the endorsements, so she didn't really speak her conscious?"

Actually, I was going to shift gears, but when you mentioned Roy Moore, I know it was interesting, I believe it was yesterday after Ivanka Trump had said about Roy Moore that there's a special place in hell for people who prey on children. You tweeted on November 16th, \"She took her sweet time, she didn't say Moore should drop out.\" So, by your logic, isn't Senators Gillibrand right, at least, that if there's alleged misconduct, Bill Clinton should've stepped aside? You're saying, Roy Moore, should step aside. You haven't litigated it. You don't know what's true and what's not. And yet, yesterday, you went out there, Philippe, and you said that Ivanka Trump should have told him to step aside, and instead you said about her, \"There's a special place in hell for those who exist only to cover for Donald's sins,\" meaning the president. Aren't you being a hypocrite as well?"

One, the larger point, is that for the last year and a half starting with the campaign, we've seen Ivanka play a role where she really was mostly enabling and then covering for her father.

They've been spending the last week thinking up every conceivable plan to get rid of him. The Trumps, including Ivanka, are out of step.

She would have said, this is unacceptable. We're going to figure this out, we're going to go after them.

This is a much bigger picture because I just don't buy this sudden moral compass that the left has with regards to the way men are treating women. This is all about political expediency and we know this, because Senator Gillibrand who's out there now suddenly finding her moral compass after taking tons of money from the Clintons, hasn't said anything about Bob Menendez and the allegations about him with underage prostitutes, hasn't demanded anyone resigned today and we're seeing this all play out before our eyes."

It goes to a broader issue of sexually predatory behavior that we see not just on Capitol Hill, we see it in Hollywood, and some of us see every day as we walked on the street.

And now, the Reuters news agency is identifying the man whose testimony could make or break the investigation. He is William D. Campbell, a lobbyist, who at the time of the Uranium One sale was a confidential informant for the FBI in a bribery investigation involving the head of Tenex. Tenex is a U.S. subsidiary of the Russian giants, Rosatom, the very same Rosatom that acquired Uranium One.

For her part, Hillary Clinton says the congressional investigation is trying to shift attention away from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russian meddling investigation, and Clinton calls talk of the appointment of a special counsel could look into Uranium One an \"abuse of power.\" There is still no word exactly when William D.

And having worked at the State Department and knowing that there were these numerous cases under this CFIUS Committee going on, never did I know that a secretary of state was ever involved in them. And the idea that the other agencies that had to vote on this would have somehow cared about the Clinton Foundation or its donations. I mean, truly, I served in this administration, nothing could be further from the truth. So, sure, let's hear from this confidential informant.

And they went through two whole years, 24 months of examination as a close and historic ally of the United States. And at the end of their CFIUS examination, they were forced to never speak to the company they purchased in America ever again. In contrast, Rosatom got approval to the Uranium One -- the purchase of Uranium One in 90 days.

The first is the intelligence community. This is not Marie Harf's perspective. The nonpartisan intelligence community has said that the Russian government intervened in our election to help elect Donald Trump because they didn't like Hillary Clinton. Now with the special counsel looking at it's whether there were people it in the Trump world working with the Russians. I don't know the answer to that and none of us do yet. Sure, did the Clinton Foundation do some things I wouldn't have done? Of course, but that is very different than a foreign power working to undermine our democracy. That's a very, very thing."

But we also understand that there's a legislative process that the people of the senate have to get something put together, we could have a coalition of at least 50 votes plus the vice president, and that they're working on that right now and we support that process. And if they have budget rules that they have to follow to make some of the stuff expire, then they're going to have to do that in order to have a bill that changes the law. But right now the law is completely unacceptable. And so, if they get something passed then it will be a step in the right direction. And then, what will happen, I really firmly believe, is that the tax cuts will have a positive effect on the economy and it will become easy to extend if there's something (INAUDIBLE)"

He talked in the campaign about finally doing away with the carried interest loophole, which really helps hedge fund managers and others, and they get to be able to have their income tax in at much lower rate than the 39.6 percent. How does keeping that in this GOP plan help the forgotten man, forgotten woman that the president talked about helping the campaign?"

And, you know, I think that I firmly believe that this tax bill is something that will help the economy. That will help the middle-class. I've written for more than a decade about how it benefits blue-collar workers to bring jobs back home. And now it could be that I'm incorrect about that. It could be Senator Hatch is incorrect about that. But to say that we're just, you know, the tools of the rich, so we're just trying -- that's just inaccurate and incorrect. And I just think that the debate would be much more productive if people would just think a little bit about what it looks like from a different perspective. Again, if you look at President Obama, he proposed a 28 percent corporate tax rate. They cited a lot of the stuff that we're citing.

They ended up settling the case of to the side. And we really didn't know what the terms are of that. But one thing that the New York Times discovered and when they looked into the case was that Winston was never questioned by the police, and the school seemed to go out of its way not to really investigate the allegations very seriously.

It was successful. And now a surgery on a live person might be imminent. If you had one person in the world who you think could get a head transplant, who would it be?
