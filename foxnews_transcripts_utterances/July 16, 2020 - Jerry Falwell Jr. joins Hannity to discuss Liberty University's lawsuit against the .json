      "sentences": "Fox News alert: Major developments on multiple fronts. After an extremely successful trial period, Moderna's coronavirus vaccine is now ready to enter the final phase of testing. We have other vaccines also on the horizon. We'll have full coverage. This is remarkable, maybe by the fall, a record- breaking progress. Our medical A-Team, Dr. Oz, is here tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also breaking tonight, the 2020 election has now officially changed in a dramatic and a big way. The president is now bowing to take actions in American cities with warzone-like conditions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the bumbling barely there, corrupt Joe Biden is now embracing, well, the most radical socialist wing of his party. We're going to explain in detail how this is a sign between Bernie and AOC and Schumer and Pelosi, he is embracing this out of weakness. I'll explain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He's also now, by the way, willing to redirect funds away from the police. That, of course, has become the enemy. Defund law enforcement, or to use his words, we'll reallocate the moneys. We're going to explain that coming up tonight in a report. Plus, we'll show you what is the latest cringe-worthy blunders from the Biden basement campaign. Spoiler alert, he now thinks if you're in the great state of Arizona, apparently you don't live in a state, you live in a city -- according to Joe, the forgetful one. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, we do start with a developing story surrounding a garbage so- called newspaper. We have an information crisis like we've never had in this country before. In this case, the New York, I call it \"toilet paper Times\", because that's basically all it's good for. They have been exposed yet again. Now, they are facing a brand new lawsuit from Liberty University. By the way, Liberty has told me, and they will join us in just a moment, Jerry Falwell Jr., in what is a powerful defamation suit filed earlier today. The university is blasting \"The New York Times\" for intentionally false reporting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This stems from their hysteria-filled coronavirus coverage alleging that Liberty suffered a coronavirus outbreak when the school reopened its campus after spring break. According to this lawsuit, prepared by attorney Michael Bowie, in two separate headlines, The Times all but accused Liberty of willfully spreading the deadly virus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Quote: Liberty brings back students and the coronavirus, too, and a university reopened and students got sick. The paper even reported that nearly 12 students became sick with COVID-19 symptoms. In a separate article, The Times accused Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. of creating his own personal viral hot spot. In reality, the truth at the time, zero on-campus students were diagnosed with COVID- 19. Not a single one. Not 12, not 11, not ten, not one, zero. Remember, the same paper, remember, they are the ones who infamously accused yours truly of killing grandma and grandpa because of our coronavirus coverage when we are way ahead of them, especially, and the rest of the mob in warning people about the virus and asymptomatic people that would spread the virus and supporting the travel ban ten days after the first known case of corona. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It was the leftist New York Times -- let's look at their track record. They're the ones that ran the headline: Who says it's not safe to travel to China? The coronavirus travel ban is unjust and doesn't work anyway. I wonder how many people took their advice and what might've happened to them if they did. Don't forget, the same paper, who's criticized by its former top editor, Jill Abramson, for, quote, making horrible mistakes left and right. And, of course, this lawsuit comes at a troubling time for that paper. The New York Times now reeling after getting clobbered in a scathing editorial out this week by another former top editor, her name, Bari Weiss. And she recently resigned after months of workplace harassment, hostility over -- she's not a conservative, at best I'd say centrist views, willing to listen to the other side views. Far left \"Times\" employees calling her a Nazi and a racist and a liar, and a bigot. Others demanding she'd be rooted out of this organization while posting ax emojis next to her name in public forums. Wow. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Weiss wrote: The far left Twitter have become the ultimate editor of The New York Times whose concerns have profoundly removed from the lives of most people. A perfect example of what I call, and why you define modern media as a mob. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The fake news media mob is now 99 percent of news outlets, media outlets, smears, lies, slander, libel, besmirchment, conspiracy theories, hoaxes, here, there, and everywhere, truth telling nonexistent. They're all about advancing the far left radical socialist views of this new, extreme Democratic Party, and they have outright contempt and hatred for all things President Trump -- and by the way, all of his irredeemable, deplorable, smelly Walmart-shopping supporters like me. And for them, truth, facts, reality, none of it matters. But in the real world, actions have consequences. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tonight, Liberty University is holding them accountable. Joining us now with the report is Liberty president himself, Jerry Falwell Jr. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, they wrote all these headlines. Not one kid got COVID-19. They apparently -- you have no trespassing signs -- they came from an actual hot spot to a place that wasn't a hot spot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They had to cut a deal with local prosecutor to keep from going to jail. That's how dumb they are. And they got their information -- they are here for a few days, I think. But they got their information from a doctor who has a practice 10 miles away from Liberty, who had seen a few Liberty kids who had a cold and upper respiratory problem. And none of it was anything like COVID symptoms, he told them that, and he told their reporters to go talk to our on-campus doctor, at a clinic on campus, and they wouldn't do it. They didn't talk to us. We tried to get them correct all of the false headlines that you just recited, they wouldn't do it. They actually doubled down, lied some more. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so, we had no choice, they left us no choice but to defend our reputation because it scared parents. We had 1,200 kids here, you know, some of them had elderly -- elderly relatives living in their home, didn't have high-speed Internet. So, they couldn't do online education at home. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They were international students.

Kanye said he could only spare 10 million bucks, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos said he'd shell out $50 million. Some messages were quickly reposted when deleted and a lot of folks actually fell for the bitcoin bit, with Biden's account receiving over $100,000 in cryptocurrency. Now, a short time ago, the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted, of course: Tough day for us. You see that's an earlier statement from Twitter about that security incident. Just a short time ago, Jack Dorsey tweeted tough day for us to Twitter, we all feel terrible this happened.

Key FBI document surrounding the bureau's interview with one of Christopher Steele's dirty dossier sources -- sub source in other words. Remember the FBI -- they knew in January 2017 -- January 21st, they interviewed the sub source, the full dossier, full of lies. It was bar talk. They kept using him to spy on Team Trump anyway. That raises questions for Mueller. Well, now, Senator Graham said, in fact, he will pull in. Speaking of Senator Graham's upcoming race, a lot of money is pouring into South Carolina. Hollywood liberals Alyssa Milano, Kathy Griffin have publicly, well, supported Graham's opponent. Big contributions, Rosie O'Donnell, Barbra Streisand, Hillary Clinton, MoveOn.org. Wow.

Great Dr. Oz is with us, our medical A-Team. Dr. Oz, I talk to you today and you made me feel very hopeful and happy. MEHMET OZ, MD, \"THE DR. OZ SHOW\" HOST: Well, it's a big day for vaccines. There are 150 possible vaccines, by the way. There are 17 in human trials. The two you mentioned have made the most progress. Moderna reported its phase one results last night. Oxford is going to release it over the next few days. But it's pretty good news. One is old school, one is new school, we had different approaches. There -- we'll see who wins the race. But 45 patients reported by Moderna, they got two doses in over a month period. There is a little bit of side effects like mild fatigue, or headaches, chill like symptoms, about half of the people had that, but nothing major. But here's the big news, 100 percent of the 45 patients all of them, had antibodies against COVID-19 and they had it at levels higher than if they had been naturally infected by the virus. Now that doesn't prove effectiveness and doesn't prove it will be around for a long time because I don't know about duration, but the fact that you have a lot of antibodies at a high level is a good sign. And as you point out, now, they're going to be moving into phase three, which is 30,000 people tracked over two years. We're going to compare people who get a placebo to folks who should get the vaccine, and we're going to figure out when they're exposed in real-world conditions to COVID- 19, are they protected and do they have side effects? And, ideally, we'll get success which the U.S. government defines will reduce senior (ph) symptoms by 50 percent.",

We have other vaccines also on the horizon. We'll have full coverage. This is remarkable, maybe by the fall, a record- breaking progress. Our medical A-Team, Dr. Oz, is here tonight. Also breaking tonight, the 2020 election has now officially changed in a dramatic and a big way. The president is now bowing to take actions in American cities with warzone-like conditions. But the bumbling barely there, corrupt Joe Biden is now embracing, well, the most radical socialist wing of his party. We're going to explain in detail how this is a sign between Bernie and AOC and Schumer and Pelosi, he is embracing this out of weakness. I'll explain. He's also now, by the way, willing to redirect funds away from the police. That, of course, has become the enemy. Defund law enforcement, or to use his words, we'll reallocate the moneys. We're going to explain that coming up tonight in a report. Plus, we'll show you what is the latest cringe-worthy blunders from the Biden basement campaign. Spoiler alert, he now thinks if you're in the great state of Arizona, apparently you don't live in a state, you live in a city -- according to Joe, the forgetful one. But, first, we do start with a developing story surrounding a garbage so- called newspaper. We have an information crisis like we've never had in this country before. In this case, the New York, I call it \"toilet paper Times\", because that's basically all it's good for. They have been exposed yet again. Now, they are facing a brand new lawsuit from Liberty University. By the way, Liberty has told me, and they will join us in just a moment, Jerry Falwell Jr., in what is a powerful defamation suit filed earlier today. The university is blasting \"The New York Times\" for intentionally false reporting. This stems from their hysteria-filled coronavirus coverage alleging that Liberty suffered a coronavirus outbreak when the school reopened its campus after spring break. According to this lawsuit, prepared by attorney Michael Bowie, in two separate headlines, The Times all but accused Liberty of willfully spreading the deadly virus."

The paper even reported that nearly 12 students became sick with COVID-19 symptoms. In a separate article, The Times accused Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. of creating his own personal viral hot spot. In reality, the truth at the time, zero on-campus students were diagnosed with COVID- 19. Not a single one. Not 12, not 11, not ten, not one, zero. Remember, the same paper, remember, they are the ones who infamously accused yours truly of killing grandma and grandpa because of our coronavirus coverage when we are way ahead of them, especially, and the rest of the mob in warning people about the virus and asymptomatic people that would spread the virus and supporting the travel ban ten days after the first known case of corona."

I wonder how many people took their advice and what might've happened to them if they did.

And, of course, this lawsuit comes at a troubling time for that paper. The New York Times now reeling after getting clobbered in a scathing editorial out this week by another former top editor, her name, Bari Weiss. And she recently resigned after months of workplace harassment, hostility over -- she's not a conservative, at best I'd say centrist views, willing to listen to the other side views. Far left \"Times\" employees calling her a Nazi and a racist and a liar, and a bigot.

They're all about advancing the far left radical socialist views of this new, extreme Democratic Party, and they have outright contempt and hatred for all things President Trump -- and by the way, all of his irredeemable, deplorable, smelly Walmart-shopping supporters like me. And for them, truth, facts, reality, none of it matters. But in the real world, actions have consequences. Tonight, Liberty University is holding them accountable. Joining us now with the report is Liberty president himself, Jerry Falwell Jr. So, they wrote all these headlines. Not one kid got COVID-19.

So, we got warrants out for their arrest. They had to cut a deal with local prosecutor to keep from going to jail. That's how dumb they are. And they got their information -- they are here for a few days, I think. But they got their information from a doctor who has a practice 10 miles away from Liberty, who had seen a few Liberty kids who had a cold and upper respiratory problem. And none of it was anything like COVID symptoms, he told them that, and he told their reporters to go talk to our on-campus doctor, at a clinic on campus, and they wouldn't do it. They didn't talk to us. We tried to get them correct all of the false headlines that you just recited, they wouldn't do it. They actually doubled down, lied some more. And so, we had no choice, they left us no choice but to defend our reputation because it scared parents. We had 1,200 kids here, you know, some of them had elderly -- elderly relatives living in their home, didn't have high-speed Internet. So, they couldn't do online education at home. They were international students. They had no choice. But out of 8,000 normally here, we had about 1,200 here this spring, we abided by all of the governor's rules, and not one case.

Now, Sean, you know, the secret of crime-fighting, there's not really a secret, but anyone who studied criminology, been a cop, knows a sliver of the population commits an overwhelming number of the crimes. Why does that matter? Well, it matters because when you arrested that very small portion of people and incarcerate them, crime goes down dramatically, which we saw over two decades in New York. You're not seeing that anymore. Now, I know for a fact this is at the top of president Trump's mind. Here's what he needs to do. He needs to get the FBI, the DEA, the Secret Service, the ATF, the IRS, get this task force together, plant them in these big cities. And let me be crystal clear, he is not asking.

This is the greatest sign that Joe Biden, he -- most candidates when you get the nomination, you go to your base. Then for the general election, you move to the center. He needed to shore up Bernie Sanders' base and AOC's base. And he's looking to Schumer and Pelosi, and he's gone along with radical -- the most radical socialism of Bolshevik Bernie, the most radical New Green Deal. This is most radical candidate in the history of this country. Clearly, he will say and do anything to shore up their support. Defund the police, reallocate, sure. Let crimes spiral out of control. Why not? He didn't do anything, along with Barack, when they had eight years as president and vice president. Oh, get rid of all bail altogether. That's worked out great in New York. Turn America into a lawless, socialist hellhole. Well, their wish apparently is Biden's command. Look at this team of radicals, it starts with Bolshevik Bernie, now Biden's de facto economy czar. AOC is leading his extreme, and radical, and unaffordable climate efforts, that also gets rid of, oh, about 10 million jobs or, let's see, fracking and oil. We are now energy independent, the world's largest producers, say goodbye to all of that. And also, coal. Beto, oh, he says -- yes, of course, we're coming for your guns.

If these policies are enacted, America, liberty, freedom, capitalism, you can say goodbye to it. That dream team of radical socialists, those 325 years of failure at this point. The only thing they can't control is Biden's cognitive abilities which appear to still be declining rapidly. He actually said today that he thought Arizona, the state, was a city. He can't make it up. He doesn't know what day it is, doesn't know what office he is running for.

He says, surplus military equipment for law enforcement, they don't need that. They show up with an armed Humvee and it makes them look like in military, and they become the enemy.

He says, what -- but do we agree that we could redirect some of that funding. To me, the key word there is but. He's sort of saying, OK, I get you, but that's the side issue. What about getting rid of funding? But we do agree that we can rid some of the funding? Biden says yes, absolutely. And, by the way, not just redirect, condition them or then.

And he says yes, absolutely. But he is now acting as if that had to do with the surplus military equipment. So, he's now flipped."

That's why the Trump campaign needs to be very focused on making these points deliberately each day about how -- he's -- how he is saying one thing, and then when e gets into trouble saying something else, and holding him to account each and every day, in a targeted, focused, disciplined way."

If you sent $1,000, I'll send back $2,000, only doing this for 30 minutes, enjoy. Billionaire Elon Musk had a similar message posted on his account, claiming he was feeling grateful. Corporations including Apple were victimized, too. Part of a widespread hack attack across the social media platform, with preset limits apparently. Kanye said he could only spare 10 million bucks, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos said he'd shell out $50 million.

We should learn from that. All right. More developments tonight, our quest to hold those who abuse power accountable, Senator Graham now seeking declassification. Key FBI document surrounding the bureau's interview with one of Christopher Steele's dirty dossier sources -- sub source in other words. Remember the FBI -- they knew in January 2017 -- January 21st, they interviewed the sub source, the full dossier, full of lies. It was bar talk. They kept using him to spy on Team Trump anyway. That raises questions for Mueller. Well, now, Senator Graham said, in fact, he will pull in. Speaking of Senator Graham's upcoming race, a lot of money is pouring into South Carolina. Hollywood liberals Alyssa Milano, Kathy Griffin have publicly, well, supported Graham's opponent. Big contributions, Rosie O'Donnell, Barbra Streisand, Hillary Clinton, MoveOn.org. Wow. Now, Lindsey Graham, senator from the great state of South Carolina -- so I'm wondering if Hillary, Rosie, and Kathy Griffin, and Barbra Streisand -- I'm wondering if their money is going to be impactful to the people of South Carolina which I imagine really don't want Hollywood liberals or liberal politicians telling them what to think and how to vote."

I think we'll put a proposal together here soon. But let me tell you what's coming up from the Judiciary Committee. You have followed this more than anybody probably in the country. Remember the Horowitz report indicated that an intel analyst and a case agent interviewed the Russian sub-source in January for three days, and again in March. And they actually produced a memo of about 40 pages detailing how unreliable the dossier was. You also have to remember that they renewed the warrant in April and June of 2017. Here's what I'm here to tell you. I want that memo out to the public so they can read it for themselves. I think we're days away from having it declassified it, not weeks. And here's my point, anybody that read that memo or was briefed about the memo and continue to use the dossier to get a warrant against Carter Page in April and June of 2017, they're in big time trouble."

They actually found the guy who put the dossier together. He wasn't a sub- source for Christopher Steele. He was an employee of Christopher Steele. The Russian was on Christopher Steele's payroll, he wasn't a contractor. But after you talked to the guy who put the memo together, and you got a 40-page document explaining why it's not reliable, and you use it after that, you're really in trouble with --"

Rod Rosenstein, he has to be verified by career officials. We now know it was completely unverifiable. And they're only looking into its veracity after two of the warrants were already signed off on? That means they use unverifiable information, and they were also warned about it. So, there's no excuse any way you look at this."

The mob and the media, the cancel culture. Yesterday, they found out, well, a new victim. L.A. Times contributor declared Judy Rosen declared it's time to replace \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Really? Joining us now with reaction, the host of the \"Rubin Report\", Dave Rubin, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. You know, Congressman, I'll start with you. Years ago -- they do this to all conservatives. I don't call for anyone's firings, I don't support boycotts, I never will. Because it's really an effort to silence speech you don't agree with. I think people are smart enough, they make decisions which shows they watch, radio stations they listen to, and out of nowhere, this incredible audience on this channel and my radio show, they started busting (AUDIO GAP) buying 500 of them (AUDIO GAP) nice people who were defending me, and by the way, it worked.

The reason our National Anthem matters, our statutes matter, our history matters, our businesses like Goya Foods matter because they create a sense of national identity. We want that national identity to be strong so that people are patriotic and love our country, and fight for our country to be the very best version of itself. But the left is attacking all of this because they want us to love our people and our history and our \"Star- Spangled Banner\" less because they want to replace our country with something else. I guess the \"Los Angeles times\" wrote that they should replace the \"Star- Spangled Banner\" with \"lean on me\", Sean. But if that's the case, it would most certainly violate the social distancing rules because I don't know how you can lean on someone from 6 feet apart.

And that's not all. Another vaccine has already entered phase 3 human trials. This potential remedy is being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. Great Dr. Oz is with us, our medical A-Team. Dr. Oz, I talk to you today and you made me feel very hopeful and happy. MEHMET OZ, MD, \"THE DR. OZ SHOW\" HOST: Well, it's a big day for vaccines. There are 150 possible vaccines, by the way. There are 17 in human trials. The two you mentioned have made the most progress. Moderna reported its phase one results last night. Oxford is going to release it over the next few days. But it's pretty good news. One is old school, one is new school, we had different approaches. There -- we'll see who wins the race. But 45 patients reported by Moderna, they got two doses in over a month period. There is a little bit of side effects like mild fatigue, or headaches, chill like symptoms, about half of the people had that, but nothing major. But here's the big news, 100 percent of the 45 patients all of them, had antibodies against COVID-19 and they had it at levels higher than if they had been naturally infected by the virus. Now that doesn't prove effectiveness and doesn't prove it will be around for a long time because I don't know about duration, but the fact that you have a lot of antibodies at a high level is a good sign. And as you point out, now, they're going to be moving into phase three, which is 30,000 people tracked over two years. We're going to compare people who get a placebo to folks who should get the vaccine, and we're going to figure out when they're exposed in real-world conditions to COVID- 19, are they protected and do they have side effects? And, ideally, we'll get success which the U.S. government defines will reduce senior (ph) symptoms by 50 percent."
