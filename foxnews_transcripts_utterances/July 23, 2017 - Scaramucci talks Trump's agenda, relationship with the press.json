This is something that Steve Hadley, President Bush's national security advisor, captured brilliantly in May. He said there’s two models here for the entire administration. There is the Nixon/Clinton model where you treat it as a criminal investigation. You lawyer up, you have your hand in the pot every day, you push back as hard as you can. Or there is what he called the Reagan model that he chose during Iran-Contra, which is, you take a step back, you have respect for the process and you let the chips ultimately fall where they may.

My argument, Chris, is that we need to do it sooner rather than later, which is the argument that the president made, because this thing is spiraling out of control. ObamaCare is in a death spiral. You have seen, since 2013, premiums in this country in the individual marketplace have more than doubled. You've got markets that are in a free fall, in a collapse, and something has to be done sooner. And I think that's why we need to get on the bill and start this debate. And then if people want to amend it, it is an open amendment process. There will be unlimited amendments that can be offered and in the -- and the United States Senate will have an opportunity to work its will. But that can't happen. We can't change the status quo less w get on the bill. And I think we have a responsibility and a duty to the American people that we committed and promised that we would repeal and replace ObamaCare with something that's better.

We had no hearings on the health care bill that the Republicans are considering. Let's work together. We've worked together on the FY '17 budget. We want to improve the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it.

On the budget issues, we have members of the authorizing committees on both their Democratic and Republican side. The Environmental Public Works Committee, this week, will be passing out some authorization bills that deal with the budget. We need to deal with a realistic budget for FY '18 that reflects the progress we made in FY '17 working together. If we do that, it's going to be in the best interests of the American people.

McCain has a special place in Washington, Chris, because he's in a time of polarized politics that we live in. He's able to operate across party lines.

You think of his efforts going overseas tirelessly traveling to places in the midst of war to say, this is the American policy. I want to know what's going on, on the ground.

    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, I actually don't think that's the hard part. I think the hard part is to get reorganized and figure out -- one of the first things I want to do, is mission to be (ph), we’ve got to get the leaks stopped, Chris. I know that it's Washington, so it's going to be impossible to stop all of them, but I think what's going on right now is a high level of unprofessionalism and it's not serving the president. So, my three simple things is I would like to reset the culture inside the comms department so that people recognize that I’m actually there to serve them and they’re going to be working with me, not for me. That's a very big distinction. And that all of us are there to serve the president of United States and his agenda. So, first thing for me is I want to hit a cultural reset button, second thing is we’ve got to get the leaks stopped. If we don't get the leaks stopped -- I am a businessperson and so, I will take dramatic action to stop those leaks. And the third thing is, I’ll be traveling with the president this week and we’re going to focus and refine the messaging from the White House. He’s one of the most effective communicators that’s never been born and we’re going to make sure that we get that message out directly to the American people and I think that albatross spread, the gap between how certain people think of him and how I see him -- or say like someone like Ivanka sees him, that will start to narrow soon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I want to pick up on the leaks. You say you’re willing to take drastic action to stop them. Now, these are leaks both coming from inside the White House and also from what's called the deep state, people in the bureaucracy, particularly the intelligence agencies or law enforcement. What kind of drastic action?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "I’m being very, very clear with people. As far as I’m concerned that staff has amnesty. We’ll see how they do with me at the helm. If the leaks don't stop, I’m going to pare down the staff because it's just not right, Chris. I think it's not fair to the president. It's actually not fair to America or the people in the government. I’m not going to be able to stop the leaks in the intergovernmental agencies and all that other stuff, that's a whole different ball of wax. But something is going on inside the White House that the president does not like and we’re going to fix it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, you say pare down the staff. I mean, this isn't coming just from the communications team. Are you saying that you've been given carte blanche -- you’ve given authority by the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "No, I’m just -- I’m just focused on the communications team. As far as I’m concerned, it's a new start for everybody in that team and everybody in that team can stay as long as they follow the protocol of not leaking, because at the end of the day, the president is super upset about the leaks, it's unprofessional. And so, you’re asking what the four steps are, that’s going to be one of my first steps."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Do you believe that the mainstream media deliberately puts out fake news about this president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "There is some fake news, unfortunately. When you see the mainstream media, I think that's a very broad statement. And so, what I would like to say, and what I would like to believe, there still a level of objectivity in the mainstream media, but unfortunately, there are specific individuals that do stretch stories or do fabricate things. I’ve been the victim of it myself, and so, it's definitely there, Chris. I don't think we can dial that down, but we can use the mechanisms of social media and the president's presence in social media to hop over that if necessary. But what I would say to you is that the good news here is that it's a fresh start for everybody. I certainly want to engage the mainstream media. I expect that they’re going to want to hold me and the White House accountable, but we’re going to sort of want to hold them accountable, too. So, I’m hoping that it will be symmetry in that relationship."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "You say that there are certain individuals, certain outlets. Do you want to call any of them out by name?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "No, no. Again, it's more specific to specific stories for that matter. And so, it's not necessary to call anybody out by name. I’m hoping to create an era of a new good feeling with the media, give everybody a fresh start, let's see if we can reset this and create a more positive mojo among everybody. And again, like I said, we have a story that we want to tell. It's a phenomenal story for the American people. There's a policy agenda in place, but I think it's phenomenal for the American people. If you look at the last six months, I think there's been some distortion in terms of how successful we've actually been and I think we want to clear that up. I think the president made that clear in his press release on Friday that we are doing very, very well, lots of the American people are super happy. And we just need to close that gap, if you will, and make that connection more forcefully."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, one of those areas where the president has said there's been a lot of fake news has been in the Russia investigation and the potential for a scandal there. President Trump reportedly wanted you because you are a tough street fighter like he has. Is he putting together a ward staff and the White House to take on the various Russia investigations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, I sort of see this -- a two-prong as it relates to that. I mean, we want to refine our rapid response team. In some ways, we want to deescalate things and have there be a level of diplomacy. In other ways, we want it to be very hard-hitting and war-like. And so it’s sort of a blend of those two things, Chris. But as it relates specifically to Russia, you know, there’s certain things that I can talk about from inside the White House and there’s certain things I’m not allowed to talk about. And I really haven’t been briefed yet by White House Counsel Don McGahn as to what I can and cannot talk about --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, let me ask you --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Here’s what I’ll say to you, if you don’t mind me saying this."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Go ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "I worked intensely on that campaign, and I think that the Russian situation is completely overblown. I was falsely accused of things related to Russia. I know other people are being falsely accused of things related to Russia. And I’m confident that tomorrow when Jared Kushner speaks, and I’ll keep my fingers crossed in saying this you, it’ll probably the last time that he has to talk about Russia. And so for me I’d like to get this behind us. I’ll tell you, one of the things I do not like about Washington, I sort of feel like it’s scandals incorporated down in Washington, that we have to make up things about each other, Chris, so that we can personally destroy each other to make us less effective as public servants. I don’t like it all. I’m going to try lead --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let me interrupt for a minute. You’ll learn we do this in Washington. But on the specific question, could you say that -- you know, part of it is diplomacy and part of it is hard-hitting. Do you see anything wrong with going after the special counsel and his team when it comes to possible conflicts of interest, or when it comes to your feeling, or the president’s feeling, that he is expanding the scope of his investigation too far into the president’s business affairs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "I want the president to be the president, and I want him to express the full nature of his personality. Corey Lewandowski used to say early on, on the campaign, let Trump be Trump. A little disrespectful now that he’s president, so let’s let the president be the president. And my point is if he wants to talk about things like that, I’m not going to want to stop him or be able to stop him. I want to be there to help aid and abet his agenda. So for me, I have a different personality style from this president in some ways; in other ways we’re very similar. I just want to there to be fairness and objectivity. And so, let’s see how the whole thing rolls out, but my feeling about this thing is it’s overblown, it’s completely unfair, it’s designed to take people off message and off of our agenda. And we’re going to get people on our message and on our agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you one last Russia question, then I want to talk about agenda. In a tweet this week, the president said this, this weekend. He asserted his complete power to pardon."

      "speaker": "Question",
      "utterance": "if he and his people have done nothing wrong, why even talk about pardons?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "See, this is one -- again, this is one of those things about Washington and it’s the convolution and the nature of the things. I’m in the Oval Office with the president last week, we’re talking about that. He brought that up, he said but he doesn’t have to be pardoned. There’s nobody around him that has to be pardoned. He was just making the statement about the power of pardons. And so, now, all of the speculation and all the spin and oh, he’s going to pardon himself and do all this other nonsense -- the president does not need to pardon himself. And the reason that he doesn’t need to pardon himself is he hasn’t done anything wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "And so for me we can micro-analyze every one of the president’s tweets, that’s fine, we can go in that direction, but what I want to do for people is get it back on the president’s agenda. This is a president -- this is a jobs president. This is a president who’s going to help middle class families, lower middle class families. You want to talk about gaps, Chris? There is a wide income gap that many elites do not feel, but the president feels it. And members of his staff feel it. And people in the middle of America feel it. And you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to put policies together that close that gap. If people want to talk about these nonsensical scandals, I’ll let them do that, but I’m going to be missile-locked on focusing on the president’s agenda, and helping people to understand the president the way I know him and the way I love him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I got to ask you one last question, and I hesitate to do that. But does the president still have confidence in his attorney general? He’s had some tough things to say about Jeff Sessions this weekend and his decision to recuse, and then this new story in The Washington Post that the Russian ambassador told -- supposedly told his superiors that he had talked with Sessions about campaign matters, but Session denies. So, does the president still have confidence in Sessions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "See, this is something that I think is super important. A question like that, I want to leave that for the president and Attorney General Sessions to talk about themselves. My guess is that he’s in the seat and so therefore the president still has confidence in him. I’m sure, like all of us, there’s things that Attorney General Sessions has done this president doesn’t like, and let them have that conversation among themselves and hopefully we can fix it. But, Chris, here’s the thing: the good news about President Trump is that he wears a lot on his sleeve. We know exactly where he comes from and where he stands on things. The reason why the American people love him and the reason why he became president is because he’s a, you know, wears heart on his sleeve type of person, very caring. But also as a business executive, he sort of tells people how he feels."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",

I don’t -- I don’t think that’s how it works in American business, and so, we sort of need to stop doing that in the political system."

What I was worried about in 2012, in urban centers, if you don’t have a little level of gun control, it could lead to more violence. But truth be told, and is why I deleted the tweets, Chris, it’s a total distraction. It’s total nonsense.

To the point about the attorney general, his dealings with Russian Ambassador Kislyak are the reasons he recused himself from the investigation from the get-go. So, he did that voluntarily, it’s something the president has now said he resents. It was completely his decision to do that. And I would just say, in terms of the attorney general and this ongoing investigation, there's really -- to build on a point Julie made, there’s really two models that the president can follow. This is something that Steve Hadley, President Bush's national security advisor, captured brilliantly in May. He said there’s two models here for the entire administration. There is the Nixon/Clinton model where you treat it as a criminal investigation. You lawyer up, you have your hand in the pot every day, you push back as hard as you can. Or there is what he called the Reagan model that he chose during Iran-Contra, which is, you take a step back, you have respect for the process and you let the chips ultimately fall where they may. The Trump administration is clearly choosing the former model. They could still reverse course if they wanted to, and I think certainly, they would be politically smarter for making that decision."

So, you have that, but then the big surprise was, as you point out, The New York Times interview to go after his old attorney general and you have to wonder about the subsequent leaks about the attorney general. It could be -- given what he said about Robert Mueller and trying to discredit Robert Mueller, who is the investigator, that he now thinks if I can get rid of Sessions, I can get somebody over there who will fire Mueller and make it easier for me as we go down that path. So, I think what we are right now is we’re on war footing. I mean, this is an explosive moment for the president, for the legal system, for the Constitution."

Joining me now to discuss the Trump agenda from South Dakota, the chair of the Republican conference, Senator John Thune, and from Baltimore, Democratic Senator Ben Cardin. Gentlemen, before we get to ObamaCare, I want to talk you all about an agreement that congressional leaders in both parties have apparently reached over the weekend about a bill to impose new sanctions on Russia and to limit the president's ability to lift those sanctions. Senator Thune, is the president going to sign that bill?"

That, I think, will pass probably overwhelmingly again in the Senate and with a veto-proof majority. So the president would -- I think it's in his best interest for a lot of reasons to sign it, and I believe he will."

We can't change the status quo, which is skyrocketing premiums and collapsing markets out there for way too many Americans less we get on the bill. So the vote will be at some point this week to proceed to consideration of the bill. It's a procedural vote. At which point all amendments become an order. There will be an unlimited opportunity for Democrats, for Ben Cardin and some of his colleagues to offer their amendments, for Republican colleagues to offer theirs to try and improve and strengthen the bill. But you can't do that unless you get on the bill. So the first vote, which will occur sometime this week, will be to proceed to that consideration of that legislation and to -- and to at least have a debate where we can have an open amendment process and give people a chance to be heard."

If we can reach an agreement among Republicans about the Senate bill -- and I -- my own view is, and I'm speaking myself, I hope we do because I think the Senate bill does strike the right balance. But one way or the other, we need to get on the bill in order to have that debate. And the leader will make that decision at some point about whether that's repeal, repeal and replace. I hope it's repeal and replace. But whether -- which camp you're in, you can't have a debate about either unless we get on the bill. So we need a \"yes\" vote.

All Americans are at risk of losing quality insurance coverage. So if we get on this bill, we're under what's called reconciliation. And many of the amendments will not be in order because they have to deal directly with the fiscal issues because it's reconciliation. So we don't have an open process if we get on the bill.

We are going to vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The question is not -- it's not a question of if, it's a question of when. My argument, Chris, is that we need to do it sooner rather than later, which is the argument that the president made, because this thing is spiraling out of control. ObamaCare is in a death spiral. You have seen, since 2013, premiums in this country in the individual marketplace have more than doubled. You've got markets that are in a free fall, in a collapse, and something has to be done sooner. And I think that's why we need to get on the bill and start this debate. And then if people want to amend it, it is an open amendment process. There will be unlimited amendments that can be offered and in the -- and the United States Senate will have an opportunity to work its will. But that can't happen. We can't change the status quo less w get on the bill. And I think we have a responsibility and a duty to the American people that we committed and promised that we would repeal and replace ObamaCare with something that's better. And so they need to hold us accountable. And I think the sooner we get on the bill and debating these issues, the more quickly we will get a -- we will get a result, which takes us in a better direction with lower premiums and stable markets and liberating people --"

In response to Senator Thune, if Democrats and Republicans work together, we can get things done. Senator Alexander, the Republican chairman of the Health Committee, says he'll schedule hearings. We had no hearings on the health care bill that the Republicans are considering. Let's work together. We've worked together on the FY '17 budget. We want to improve the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it. And there are ways we can do that, by bringing down overall health care costs and making, particularly in the individual marketplace, health insurance more affordable. On the budget issues, we have members of the authorizing committees on both their Democratic and Republican side. The Environmental Public Works Committee, this week, will be passing out some authorization bills that deal with the budget. We need to deal with a realistic budget for FY '18 that reflects the progress we made in FY '17 working together. If we do that, it's going to be in the best interests of the American people. We can improve the health care system. We can get a reasonable budget. And we can move this country forward."

And we're back now with the panel. So, Julie, what do they really think at the White House? Do they think that repeal and replace is dead or do they somehow think that at the last moment, faced with a vote, that some of these senators who have come out against it will vote for it?"

      "speaker": "PACE",
      "utterance": "It kind of depends what day you ask them that question. There have been some days recently where they have been pretty down on this, where they can't exactly see how they're going to get back, particularly with Senator McCain being out at the -- a crucial vote for this. Look, they planned to spend the next couple of days trying to see if there's a way through here, trying to see if repeal and replace could get the votes, trying to see if repeal only could get the votes. When you talk to Republicans, though, they -- mixed messages. The constant shifting from the president, sometimes within the same day, is hugely unhelpful because Republicans also want to move forward on this. They want to put a bill on his desk and have that bill signed. But it's really unclear day to day what bill the president actually wants to sign."

The president has not made -- since he took office -- a single major speech that was really devoted to repeal and replace. And say what you will about ObamaCare, and I know you've got a lot of problems with it, but President Obama barnstormed the country at least pushing it. So the question is, how do you answer F.D.?"

I think at this point the White House communication is, let's just have something. We need some sort of victory. You know it's sort of like Al Davis from the Oakland Raiders, just win, baby. Just get -- just put something up on the board. I mean now that they're playing with live ammunition, you've got a lot of Republicans that are getting squishy. So it's ultimately the responsibility know of the Senate. Here's a motion to proceed. It's a motion to, are we going to have a debate, from what is supposed to be the most deliberative body on the face of the planet, and we can't even get Republicans to agree to debate the bill."

I want to just say a special expression to Meghan McCain, our Fox colleague, you know, to her and her dad, much love, much respect. McCain has a special place in Washington, Chris, because he's in a time of polarized politics that we live in. He's able to operate across party lines. You think to McCain-Feingold, for example, on finance reform. You think of McCain-Kennedy on immigration reform. You think of his efforts going overseas tirelessly traveling to places in the midst of war to say, this is the American policy. I want to know what's going on, on the ground. And he takes people who are politically opposite, like Elizabeth Warren, with him to show them what is actually taking place on the ground. So he operates in a way that I think gives him some special cachet, if you will, because everybody wants to talk to him, everybody embraces him. And I would add, given his status as a military hero, there's no one like him in that sense in this generation. You think about the idea that he stayed in a prison camp and said, I'm not leaving despite the statue of my father and grandfather. I'm not leaving till my men do."

But that -- the loss of his Senate service, whenever it comes, whatever he steps aside, constitutes a national security crisis for the GOP, but by extension for the country, in the sense that this is a person who has been the primary voice on national security issues for a decade. This is somebody who explains the ISIS threat to us starting in 2014 when they first emerged on the scene. He has explained the threat posed by our nuclear adversaries around the world. And I don't see, on the Republican side, I don't see any current leader who rival him and I don't see the next generation of leaders who are going to have that same -- you know, have that same voice on these issues."

He doesn't want to sit back. He wants to take the -- take the fight to the enemy. And -- and he'll do that till -- every step of the way. And, you know, his fight with cancer touches all of us.
