I'm Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story” in America tonight. We are now 61 days from the presidential election. This race is getting tighter all the time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Today, Joe Biden flew to Wisconsin. He met with the family of Jacob Blake there. He also met with community leaders and law enforcement. And tonight, right now in the live shot here, we just saw Air Force One land moments ago. President Trump about to disembark at the Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, which is the home of Rolling Rock beer. If you didn't know that. We do expect him to criticize Joe Biden for being silent on the recent rioting while playing up his law and order message that has been basically the theme of the past few days. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In 2016, he won this county handily. It is Western and it is rural in Pennsylvania. He's there tonight to drive up that vote even more in that region this time around. For the Trump team, it's not necessarily about Philadelphia where there's a high concentration of voters, but perhaps it's about the whole rest of the state to win Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes. So, let's take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The most recent Monmouth poll, Biden, and Trump now inside the margin of error on that poll in Pennsylvania. Several weeks ago, back in July, Biden was up by 13 points in the state of Pennsylvania. Monmouth is a pretty solid poll, a good one to keep an eye on. So that does indicate a tightening here. We are going to be joined by Newt Gingrich, also Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, a longtime family history in Pennsylvania. His father was the governor there for a long time. Donald Trump Jr. is also with us this evening. But first, as we await the president, Newt Gingrich, Fox News Contributor and author of Trump and the American Future. Newt, good to have you with us tonight. You wrote a piece today, America's Fight. Thank you. America's Fight, Civilization versus Anarchy, and talked about how unprecedented the moment that we're living in is. But what I thought was very interesting was how you took it back to the roots of similar riots in the 1960s and the people who sort of were born in that era or were in that era. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You had radicals who were robbing banks, killing bank guards, and they literally became sort of the vanguard once they were suppressed. They went into college campuses, they went to a variety of other places, continued to educate and there's a whole new generation of district attorneys who come out of that background. George Soros has come in and funded around the country, a whole series of district attorneys, for example, in Portland, who refused to try anybody as a criminal.

It's really if you look, and they'll criticize me for saying this, fake news media, which is back there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } With their fake polls, it's the same as last year, we could just put it all on tape, the fake polls, the fake everything, the fake, they're called suppression polls, they're meant to make you depressed. Are you depressed? You don't look depressed. The real numbers and we have the real numbers, we're leading everywhere, we are leading everywhere, I'll tell you, I think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago and there's far more enthusiasm, our base is bigger, it's stronger, and we've done the greatest job. Again, if we didn't get hit by the plague from China, this thing we wouldn't have even - between us. I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldn't have needed a rally. That's a little bit unfair, but that's OK. That's what China has done to our nation. They've screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China. And I've taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took in $0.10 from China. And I gave 28 billion, right, 28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China and our farmers (inaudible). I don't think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town, I know we have a lot of boilermakers. We've got a lot of boilermakers, I'll be talking about them, Look at those guys. Nobody is going to mess with them, I'll tell you, we're going to be talking about them in a minute. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But for the entire summer, Biden was silent. As Far Left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians and just recently marched through the streets chanting Death to America. This is what we have, Death to America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, we could end it like immediately, you saw what we did in Wisconsin. It ended. Took a while for the governor, they have to ask us in, it's like otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it's totally unnecessary. The National Guard is fantastic. I went to see them two days ago. Biden went there today. There was nobody there. There's nobody there. He was a little late. I was going to say, hey, listen, we ended that problem, but we could end it in Portland. Wise guys in Portland, anarchists, they're agitators. They're looters. We could end it in Portland in a half an hour. We did it in Seattle. We told them we're coming in. You either end it or we're coming in. Congressman, we were going in the next day. We're all set. I was actually disappointed. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20 percent of the city. Do you believe this? And the mayor said, no, it's going to be a summer of love. These people are crazy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what we're doing is we're holding back funds for cities that don't know what they're doing, where they allow crime to run rampant. And we put a 10-year prison sentence on anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordnance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don't get things like that. Today, they think that you should just have no cash bail. You know, they do the no cash bail. You kill somebody, there's no bail. Don't worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordnance. I gave a new executive order; it says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was like three and a half months ago. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere. And amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down, no statues. And we're actually prosecuting people for having done it, we made it retroactive to the beginning, terrible. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing, it's real easy, but the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda is an agenda, it's what they want. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. They both want to cut funding for police. They want to end that cash bail. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They want to hire Far Left prosecutors and judges and let the criminals run wild. The radical Left district attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name has released hundreds of rioters and announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance. Oh, it's worse, it's worse, you have somebody in Philadelphia who's worse, right? Whereas in his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that's what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You know, you notice now. No, no, I never said about fracking. I never said, if you don't do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I don't think you should have it. OK. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No, but he said in the manifesto plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where no fracking. No this. No that. I mean, no guns. How about guns? No guns, no Second Amendment. Biden has pledged to appoint prosecutors who will extend these insane Far Left policies nationwide. That's what he's done. That's called the manifesto. He agreed to all this. The craziest thing, you're supposed to bring it to the Right. He actually brought it further Left. Bernie never dreamt that this was possible. Crazy Bernie. You know, Crazy Bernie. You know, I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage. You know why? Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade, the trade because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I. Nobody else got it, especially Biden. Never got it. He never got it. Still doesn't get it. Now he really gets nothing, I'll tell you. He didn't get it in prime time. Now he really doesn't get it. But it's OK for them to make every city look just like Portland, which is a disaster. And again, we could clean it up, we just go right through it. 5000, 10,000 right through it. These guys are tough, they're smart, and they love our country. They love our country. We'll clean it up in one half hour. It'll be over. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Did you see this radical left, Mayor Wheeler? His name is. The radical left mayor. They chased him, Mike. They chased him out of his home last night. And all he does is be nice to them because they don't understand nice. They only understand one thing, strength. That's the only thing they - they don't understand tonight. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them and prosecute them. And I will always defend law abiding citizens. That's why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people. We have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida. All of them. All of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I don't know if there's anybody. And I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry. What are you doing here, Rick? Rick Perry, one of the greats. But they're all voting for me. This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, I'm delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like sort of grew up with these people. I don't know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. But I'm endorsing I'm getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. And last year you had the single greatest year, economic year in the history of your whole operation, right, of your whole operation. You've never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been prior to the plague coming in. It's been the Commonwealth's greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth the state, you have two places? You always have to say, well, wait a minute, is this one the Commonwealth, two places you know, the other places, name it. That's right. How did you know that Congressman? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But this commonwealth, it's a great commonwealth, it's a great place, and the Boilermakers local union, local 154, they chartered in Pittsburgh. 125 years ago, none of you are around to see it. And it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. And I want to thank John Hughes and the Boilermakers here today. It's a great honor to have you. Let me. Who's John? Where the hell is John, stand up, John? John, we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he's got the worst location. I said, where's John, I'm looking in the front row. Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. He's good. You've got my vote, John. Hey, Boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do, you're the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. That's a great endorsement. That's a great endorsement. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations, and I've spent the last four years bringing them back home and we're bringing them back home, bringing a lot of things back home. I ended the last administration's eight-year pure war on Pennsylvania oil and coal and fracking and national. If you look at the natural gas, what they've done to this state, what they were doing to this state, it was sort of easy. I just open it up and I said, do it. And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record setting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But again, you had the greatest year you've ever had, last year prior to the virus. You're going to be set now with what we're doing. I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced interestingly, just prior to the election. So, I'm putting myself on the line, but I know what's going to happen. The numbers are going to be great and next year is going to be one of the greatest years, not only for Pennsylvania, but for the entire country.",

The next quarter is going to have 20 to 30 percent economic growth. And that's -- and people are going to -- and people are going to feel that. And then on the pandemic, he said he use the phase, we are rounding the turn. I think that's right. The cases are going down, the deaths are going down, and as if that continues in the fall and we get a vaccine, I think that negative will turn into a positive. And then on the violence, you know, he said this is something that clearly the Biden campaign is worried about because they are erratically changing strategy every day practically.

And I think that Biden is doing a great job of that as reflected in the recent polling that shows that he is winning on the issue of law and order. Only 35 percent of Americans feel like they are safer under Trump, whereas over 46 percent say that they feel like they would feel safer under a Joe Biden administration. But I just want to call Mars out on his generosity as a former speechwriter for saying that this was good speech from Donald Trump. It was a stream of consciousness with some of the most random phrases I could ever imagined. Like if Democrats win, you're going to have no oil, no guns, no God.

But the story continues here in America. So, we'll see you back here tomorrow night at 7 o'clock. Stay tuned because Tucker Carlson is coming up right after this.

      "utterance": "Another beautiful story, people coming together with music in Bakersfield. Thank you, Bret. Good to see you tonight. And good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story” in America tonight. We are now 61 days from the presidential election. This race is getting tighter all the time. Today, Joe Biden flew to Wisconsin. He met with the family of Jacob Blake there. He also met with community leaders and law enforcement. And tonight, right now in the live shot here, we just saw Air Force One land moments ago. President Trump about to disembark at the Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, which is the home of Rolling Rock beer. If you didn't know that. We do expect him to criticize Joe Biden for being silent on the recent rioting while playing up his law and order message that has been basically the theme of the past few days. In 2016, he won this county handily. It is Western and it is rural in Pennsylvania. He's there tonight to drive up that vote even more in that region this time around. For the Trump team, it's not necessarily about Philadelphia where there's a high concentration of voters, but perhaps it's about the whole rest of the state to win Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes. So, let's take a look. The most recent Monmouth poll, Biden, and Trump now inside the margin of error on that poll in Pennsylvania. Several weeks ago, back in July, Biden was up by 13 points in the state of Pennsylvania. Monmouth is a pretty solid poll, a good one to keep an eye on. So that does indicate a tightening here. We are going to be joined by Newt Gingrich, also Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, a longtime family history in Pennsylvania. His father was the governor there for a long time. Donald Trump Jr. is also with us this evening. But first, as we await the president, Newt Gingrich, Fox News Contributor and author of Trump and the American Future. Newt, good to have you with us tonight. You wrote a piece today, America's Fight. Thank you. America's Fight, Civilization versus Anarchy, and talked about how unprecedented the moment that we're living in is. But what I thought was very interesting was how you took it back to the roots of similar riots in the 1960s and the people who sort of were born in that era or were in that era."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you can literally create a sort of genealogical map and you'll find that in the late 60s we had 2500 bombings in 1971, 1972. Now, we had a Black Panther movement that openly said they wanted to kill policemen. You had radicals who were robbing banks, killing bank guards, and they literally became sort of the vanguard once they were suppressed. They went into college campuses, they went to a variety of other places, continued to educate and there's a whole new generation of district attorneys who come out of that background. George Soros has come in and funded around the country, a whole series of district attorneys, for example, in Portland, who refused to try anybody as a criminal. So, the police can arrest them. the DA just won't try. And this has become a huge, huge problem. All of that is coming together. And what we're now seeing, whether it's ANTIFA or if you go to Kenosha, of the first 200 people who were arrested in Kenosha, over half of them were from out of town, I think 44 different cities, it says various radicals came together to try to cause trouble and destroy things. It's a very important point in American history."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Indeed, it is. One of the questions is what is driving at this point, because back then, obviously the core of it was people who were protesting the Vietnam War. That was a real galvanizing part of that movement. I don't know how many people in this - some of these crowds could truly articulate what it is they're fighting for at this moment. But there's clearly a lot of unrest. But Joe Biden has changed his tune on this over the past several days, clearly recognizing that this is something that's happening. It's undeniable in this country. Here he is today in Kenosha. Listen to this."

    },
    {

    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Martha, he sounds like Mayor Wheeler of Portland. I spent Sunday afternoon, watching the mayor of Portland's 45-minute press conference, which was beyond pathetic. I mean, here's a guy who's had 96 or 97 days of continuing violence. His press conference comes down to begging people to quit being violent. The following day, a mob shows up at his condominium, which is a 24-story building, burns out the ground floor retail stores. He's now announced he's moving away from the condominium. So, instead of defeating the mob, the mob has defeated him and what Biden just said was nonsense. I have no idea what Biden is talking about. He represents a party which in every major city runs the city has failed to defeat crime, has allowed ANTIFA to become a nationwide anti-American group. And that's the key thing to understand. These people are anti- American. They openly, publicly say their goal is to destroy America. And Biden has no capacity to take these people head on."

      "utterance": "Ted Wheeler has really appeased these groups, as many leaders have in many of these cities, and I think what he found out when they came to where he lives is that that doesn't work. Appeasement does not work in these situations. Newt, thank you. Stand by if you would. We're waiting for the president to come out of Air Force One. There we are. We're going to bring in Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, Bob Casey. Senator, good to have you with us this evening. Give us your take on your state right now as you look at this. Clearly, it's going to be a very tight race, as it often is in Pennsylvania. And the president believes that he can drive up more people in his base in these western and rural areas."

      "utterance": "Martha, I expected to be close because if you look at the last 20 years, other than the 10-point Obama win, it's been a three point state, so it's going to be close. I do think that Joe Biden has an advantage going into that, mostly because people know him and trust him. And they also see that he's got a plan to create jobs in a state where we've got 886,000 people out of work, 13.7 percent. In the county the president's going into its 13.5. So, I think the economic and jobs planning out is going to help. And I think they know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, we will see. In terms of this mail-in-voting statistics, I want to play this for you from an interview that Attorney General Barr did yesterday about his concerns about all of that. Watch this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "The bipartisan commission chaired by Jimmy Carter and James Baker said back in 2009 that mail-in-voting is fraught with the risk of fraud and coercion. Since that time, there have been in the newspapers, in networks, academic studies, saying it is open to fraud and coercion. The only time the narrative changed is after this administration came in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, there - your state is not a universal mail-in state, but you'll have a lot of mail-in-vote. And from the latest perspective on that, it looks like Democrats, 68 percent of them say that they will be much more likely to mail in their vote, as opposed to only 17 percent of Republicans. Given that, do you think that it could be a long time before we know or several days at least before we end up knowing how Pennsylvanians did vote?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASEY",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, I wouldn't expect of a definitive number election night. That was certainly evident in the primary. I think most people know that we're in a time of a pandemic and it's going to take a little longer. But the idea that there's some kind of problem here with fraud is really just the data and the studies show that's just not true. And I think it's important for the administration, whether it's the president, the attorney general, at a time of a pandemic and a real crisis to do everything in their power, to make sure that people can vote no matter what, no matter how they're voting. And that's why the attempts to undermine the votes though, as well as other stuff they're taking are really not in further into - guaranteed the right to vote."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And we'll see what happens if a lot of people do this who don't usually do it before everybody wants this vote to be clean across the board. Thank you very much. I want to bring in Donald Trump Jr., Trump Organization Executive Vice President and author of the brand-new book Liberal Privilege, Joe Biden and the Democrats Defense of the Indefensible. Don, good to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for being here. I actually want to start - your father is walking out now. I think it'll be a couple of minutes before he gets to the podium here. But I wanted to get your reaction to what Governor Cuomo said today, because this was pretty out there. Listen to this."

He's going to walk down the street in New York, forget bodyguards. He better have an army if he thinks he's going to walk down the street in New York. No, New Yorkers don't want to have anything to do with him."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP JR., AUTHOR OF LIBERAL PRIVILEGE",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, I think Andrew Cuomo is doing his tough guy shtick. He's had and led the biggest failed state as it relates to COVID-19 by any measure, by any medical metric. Andrew Cuomo has had a disaster here. Now, Andrew Cuomo, Bill de Blasio, Nancy Pelosi said it was racist and xenophobic when my father shut down travel from the epicenter of a viral outbreak. So, I'm not sure how they're doing that. They wanted to keep it open to further overwhelm our systems. While he made the tough decision to shut it down, Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order that puts sick people with COVID-19 back into elderly homes, hospice care areas that killed 10,000 to 11,000 people when we all knew that the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions were the people most susceptible to it. So, Andrew Cuomo is doing the New York thing and media will make him a darling because he'll say mean things about Trump. But, A, he was totally incompetent in his response. B, this is the typical violent type response that we're seeing from Democrats and other Joe Biden voters who've decided it's OK to burn down their country. This is the only time in America, Martha, where you'll get in more trouble for opening your business to feed your family than you will for looting or burning down someone else's business. That's Democrat policy for you today."

      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Win four more years in the White House. Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China, you know that. His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing. He wants to surrender your nation to the radical Left-wing mob. He's trying to change now, that's not working because we're going up, but he's dropping like a rock and water. And before the China virus, this election was over. Now I had to go back to work, that we've done a great job on it. We don't get the credit. We don't get the credit. We made a lot of governors look very good. But I will keep your jobs in America, and I'll bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice. That's what we're doing right now. We have over 400 right now under arrest, these are bad people. Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, rebuilt the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate, 100 percent. Secured American, energy independence, and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we're going to do it again, have to do it again. Got to do it again. And it's happening, you see what's happening, job numbers, retail sales numbers are all at records. It's happening very fast. It's actually happening in the Super V, not a V, it's a super V, and you'll see that, and big numbers are coming out and have come out. And just watch your set or watch your newspaper - read your newspaper, you're seeing numbers that Congressman, we haven't seen those numbers ever before actually, we've never seen them. And by the way, we have record stock markets. We have record everything. You're going to have an incredible economic year, next year, your stocks are going up, your 401(k)s are through the roof. Had a little pause today, people wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way, but the stock markets at record levels. Think of it, in the hopefully rounding the turn of the pandemic, we're rounding that turn and vaccines are coming along great. You know that the job that they've done, the doctors, everybody else, we're years ahead of schedule. Anybody else's president, you wouldn't be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now, I'll tell you right now. That I can tell you, Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family. He is a puppet of the socialist, Marxists and the cop hating extremists, and they are cop. And we love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. And by the way, we have - I don't know if you saw this, if there's any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and we're trying to get them in. And I'd love to get them in. I mean, it's an airport. Let them go to the runways, OK? Let them in. We have - I mean, literally there, we landed. I actually thought that was the crowd. We're doing the hangar thing now because the arenas can't do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while. But in certain ways, I like this better. I don't have to travel. I get off the plane, I make a speech, I get the hell out of here. Now, these are great. You remember the last days before the campaign, I do a lot of them a day, get off that plane was a little different plane, it was black and white instead of the blue and white. But we had some time and that was an important - that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016. But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country. And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today with all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have. But we had record enthusiasm in 2016. By the way, was that the greatest evening ever? November? And now it's going to be November 3rd and we'll keep it going and we'll get it all like a tree, you move that tree, it takes a little while to plant your tax cuts. They're going to raise your taxes. They're going to take away your guns. It's really if you look, and they'll criticize me for saying this, fake news media, which is back there. With their fake polls, it's the same as last year, we could just put it all on tape, the fake polls, the fake everything, the fake, they're called suppression polls, they're meant to make you depressed. Are you depressed? You don't look depressed. The real numbers and we have the real numbers, we're leading everywhere, we are leading everywhere, I'll tell you, I think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago and there's far more enthusiasm, our base is bigger, it's stronger, and we've done the greatest job. Again, if we didn't get hit by the plague from China, this thing we wouldn't have even - between us. I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldn't have needed a rally. That's a little bit unfair, but that's OK. That's what China has done to our nation. They've screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China. And I've taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took in $0.10 from China. And I gave 28 billion, right, 28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China and our farmers (inaudible). I don't think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town, I know we have a lot of boilermakers. We've got a lot of boilermakers, I'll be talking about them, Look at those guys. Nobody is going to mess with them, I'll tell you, we're going to be talking about them in a minute. But for the entire summer, Biden was silent. As Far Left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians and just recently marched through the streets chanting Death to America. This is what we have, Death to America. And by the way, we could end it like immediately, you saw what we did in Wisconsin. It ended. Took a while for the governor, they have to ask us in, it's like otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it's totally unnecessary. The National Guard is fantastic. I went to see them two days ago. Biden went there today. There was nobody there. There's nobody there. He was a little late. I was going to say, hey, listen, we ended that problem, but we could end it in Portland. Wise guys in Portland, anarchists, they're agitators. They're looters. We could end it in Portland in a half an hour. We did it in Seattle. We told them we're coming in. You either end it or we're coming in. Congressman, we were going in the next day. We're all set. I was actually disappointed. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20 percent of the city. Do you believe this? And the mayor said, no, it's going to be a summer of love. These people are crazy. So, we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what we're doing is we're holding back funds for cities that don't know what they're doing, where they allow crime to run rampant. And we put a 10-year prison sentence on anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordnance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don't get things like that. Today, they think that you should just have no cash bail. You know, they do the no cash bail. You kill somebody, there's no bail. Don't worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordnance. I gave a new executive order; it says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was like three and a half months ago. And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere. And amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down, no statues. And we're actually prosecuting people for having done it, we made it retroactive to the beginning, terrible. And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing, it's real easy, but the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda is an agenda, it's what they want. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. They both want to cut funding for police. They want to end that cash bail. They want to hire Far Left prosecutors and judges and let the criminals run wild. The radical Left district attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name has released hundreds of rioters and announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance. Oh, it's worse, it's worse, you have somebody in Philadelphia who's worse, right? Whereas in his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that's what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You know, you notice now. No, no, I never said about fracking. I never said, if you don't do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I don't think you should have it. OK. No, but he said in the manifesto plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where no fracking. No this. No that. I mean, no guns. How about guns? No guns, no Second Amendment. Biden has pledged to appoint prosecutors who will extend these insane Far Left policies nationwide. That's what he's done. That's called the manifesto. He agreed to all this. The craziest thing, you're supposed to bring it to the Right. He actually brought it further Left. Bernie never dreamt that this was possible. Crazy Bernie. You know, Crazy Bernie. You know, I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage. You know why? Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade, the trade because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I. Nobody else got it, especially Biden. Never got it. He never got it. Still doesn't get it. Now he really gets nothing, I'll tell you. He didn't get it in prime time. Now he really doesn't get it. But it's OK for them to make every city look just like Portland, which is a disaster. And again, we could clean it up, we just go right through it. 5000, 10,000 right through it. These guys are tough, they're smart, and they love our country. They love our country. We'll clean it up in one half hour. It'll be over. Did you see this radical left, Mayor Wheeler? His name is. The radical left mayor. They chased him, Mike. They chased him out of his home last night. And all he does is be nice to them because they don't understand nice. They only understand one thing, strength. That's the only thing they - they don't understand tonight. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them and prosecute them. And I will always defend law abiding citizens. That's why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people. We have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida. All of them. All of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I don't know if there's anybody. And I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry. What are you doing here, Rick? Rick Perry, one of the greats. But they're all voting for me. This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, I'm delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like sort of grew up with these people. I don't know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. But I'm endorsing I'm getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. And last year you had the single greatest year, economic year in the history of your whole operation, right, of your whole operation. You've never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been prior to the plague coming in. It's been the Commonwealth's greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth the state, you have two places? You always have to say, well, wait a minute, is this one the Commonwealth, two places you know, the other places, name it. That's right. How did you know that Congressman? But this commonwealth, it's a great commonwealth, it's a great place, and the Boilermakers local union, local 154, they chartered in Pittsburgh. 125 years ago, none of you are around to see it. And it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. And I want to thank John Hughes and the Boilermakers here today. It's a great honor to have you. Let me. Who's John? Where the hell is John, stand up, John? John, we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he's got the worst location. I said, where's John, I'm looking in the front row. Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. He's good. You've got my vote, John. Hey, Boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do, you're the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. That's a great endorsement. That's a great endorsement. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations, and I've spent the last four years bringing them back home and we're bringing them back home, bringing a lot of things back home. I ended the last administration's eight-year pure war on Pennsylvania oil and coal and fracking and national. If you look at the natural gas, what they've done to this state, what they were doing to this state, it was sort of easy. I just open it up and I said, do it. And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record setting. But again, you had the greatest year you've ever had, last year prior to the virus. You're going to be set now with what we're doing. I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced interestingly, just prior to the election. So, I'm putting myself on the line, but I know what's going to happen.

So, I guess Biden, pretty soon, is going to be coming out saying, no, no, I never said that. Check out all of the statement he's made on everything, and now he's going the opposite way, but he's agreed to the manifesto entirely. So maybe he'll do that and then he figures later on, he'll go.

They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of -- a senator, it's been a while -- against a young, good-looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts.

Here now with some final thoughts, they've been watching along with us, Marc Thiessen, co-host of American Enterprise Institute's podcast What the Hell is Going On, Jessica Tarlov, a senior director of research Bustle.com.

And actually, that Monmouth poll that you he said at the top of the show, if you look at likely voters it's only one to three points. So, it's within the margin of error. And look, the ground is shifting in Donald Trump's favor. The economy, he said we're going to have, not just have a v-shaped recovery, we are going to have a super v. The next quarter is going to have 20 to 30 percent economic growth. And that's -- and people are going to -- and people are going to feel that. And then on the pandemic, he said he use the phase, we are rounding the turn. I think that's right. The cases are going down, the deaths are going down, and as if that continues in the fall and we get a vaccine, I think that negative will turn into a positive. And then on the violence, you know, he said this is something that clearly the Biden campaign is worried about because they are erratically changing strategy every day practically. From hide -- winning from the basement a few weeks ago to not going to Pennsylvania to going to Pennsylvania, to not going to Kenosha to going to Kenosha.

Going to be activities that happened before 9 or 10 p.m. in the activities that happened afterwards are no good. And I think that Biden is doing a great job of that as reflected in the recent polling that shows that he is winning on the issue of law and order. Only 35 percent of Americans feel like they are safer under Trump, whereas over 46 percent say that they feel like they would feel safer under a Joe Biden administration. But I just want to call Mars out on his generosity as a former speechwriter for saying that this was good speech from Donald Trump. It was a stream of consciousness with some of the most random phrases I could ever imagined. Like if Democrats win, you're going to have no oil, no guns, no God. I mean, praise be to Donald Trump for coming up with something like that. But I think that we are going to be seeing a lot more of this, potentially in your hour, Martha, heading to the 7 p.m. to get into the going taking over prime time."

Also, just to draw attention there's an Atlantic story that talks about the president's views on the military. That's going to get some attention. We'll talk about that on the next program. But that's going to get some attention tonight, as well. No doubt. President Trump speaking in Latrobe, Pennsylvania this evening. And that is “The Story” for tonight, Thursday, September 3rd, 2020. But the story continues here in America. So, we'll see you back here tomorrow night at 7 o'clock. Stay tuned because Tucker Carlson is coming up right after this. As the president winds up his campaign stop in Pennsylvania, a state that is now looking more close than ever. More coverage as we continue tonight, take care everybody."
