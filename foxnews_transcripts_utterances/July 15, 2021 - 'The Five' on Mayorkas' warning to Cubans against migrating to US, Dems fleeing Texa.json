And when you request the ballot by mail you have to write your signature and you have to write your I.D. that's on your license, or if you don't have a driver's license the last four numbers of your social security number. Done. How is that restrictive? It's not, they actually expand voting hours all across the board and companies are required to allow workers to go leave work on election day and go vote. Here's actually what makes it harder to cheat in Texas and why the Democrats are howling. You can't kick poll watchers out of polling stations and the polling workers have to be able to see the counts. And if you are in a big city, they have to livestream the counting rooms. Also, counties have to clean up this old dusty voter rules, all votes have to have a paper trail so they can't just disappear in a machine, and paying for votes becomes a felony, Democrats don't like that, and of the machines have to have software that aren't allowed to change votes and officials can't just mail out ballots without having them requested so no mass mailing of ballots and no ballot harvesting. So, read the bill, tell me what you object to or just e-mail Greg Gutfeld at his e-mail address and you can tell Greg what is so objectionable.",

Now this last election, more people voted than ever before. There seem to be fewer regularities based on 60-state and federal court challenges including two decisions about a Supreme Court which dismissed these efforts. So, it would seem to me, I like sports. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers who won the Super Bowl last year. If the coach came to the owner and said look, I found a new quarterback, he's bigger, he's stronger and he's got better vision than Tom Brady. If Bruce Arians said we are going to switch quarterbacks after winning the Super Bowl, people would say he's nuts. Why would you change the rules from last year's elections if your goal is to get more people to vote? Now you can be upset with the outcome. Now, if we want to make sure if there are challenges around the integrity and voter I.D., I'm a believer there ought to be voter I.D. rules. But I didn't hear, those challenges were not, at least were talked about in any serious, relevant, prevalent way in Texas. So, these efforts here I don't understand what they are trying to get.",

What this gun shows you, OK, this is -- this is my professional -- like, I'm pretending, OK, what this gun shows you is that almost everything you put on a gun is decorative. So, an AR-15 is a rifle, but it has all this stuff on it that makes all the liberals go oh my God, it's an assault weapon. No, it's not. ArmaLite stands for ArmaLite rifle, but they put a lot of bells and whistles on it. People -- the problem we have with guns, and it's everybody's right, is that people like to dress up guns like the same way people pimp out their ride, except they're pimping out their gun. This is a pimped-out gun. It's very creative, innovative. I've never heard of this company. Now, I've heard of it. So. I think it's never been made. This is it. It's one of a kind.

And when you request the ballot by mail you have to write your signature and you have to write your I.D. that's on your license, or if you don't have a driver's license the last four numbers of your social security number. Done. How is that restrictive? It's not, they actually expand voting hours all across the board and companies are required to allow workers to go leave work on election day and go vote. Here's actually what makes it harder to cheat in Texas and why the Democrats are howling. You can't kick poll watchers out of polling stations and the polling workers have to be able to see the counts. And if you are in a big city, they have to livestream the counting rooms. Also, counties have to clean up this old dusty voter rules, all votes have to have a paper trail so they can't just disappear in a machine, and paying for votes becomes a felony, Democrats don't like that, and of the machines have to have software that aren't allowed to change votes and officials can't just mail out ballots without having them requested so no mass mailing of ballots and no ballot harvesting. So, read the bill, tell me what you object to or just e-mail Greg Gutfeld at his e-mail address and you can tell Greg what is so objectionable."

Now this last election, more people voted than ever before. There seem to be fewer regularities based on 60-state and federal court challenges including two decisions about a Supreme Court which dismissed these efforts. So, it would seem to me, I like sports. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers who won the Super Bowl last year. If the coach came to the owner and said look, I found a new quarterback, he's bigger, he's stronger and he's got better vision than Tom Brady. If Bruce Arians said we are going to switch quarterbacks after winning the Super Bowl, people would say he's nuts. Why would you change the rules from last year's elections if your goal is to get more people to vote? Now you can be upset with the outcome. Now, if we want to make sure if there are challenges around the integrity and voter I.D., I'm a believer there ought to be voter I.D. rules. But I didn't hear, those challenges were not, at least were talked about in any serious, relevant, prevalent way in Texas. So, these efforts here I don't understand what they are trying to get."

If Democrats lose ground on crime and immigration are seen as weak on those two issues, we won't be in the majority in the House and we will likely lose the majority in the Senate.

I love this gun. Just to make it interesting. What this gun shows you, OK, this is -- this is my professional -- like, I'm pretending, OK, what this gun shows you is that almost everything you put on a gun is decorative. So, an AR-15 is a rifle, but it has all this stuff on it that makes all the liberals go oh my God, it's an assault weapon. No, it's not. ArmaLite stands for ArmaLite rifle, but they put a lot of bells and whistles on it. People -- the problem we have with guns, and it's everybody's right, is that people like to dress up guns like the same way people pimp out their ride, except they're pimping out their gun. This is a pimped-out gun. It's very creative, innovative. I've never heard of this company. Now, I've heard of it. So. I think it's never been made. This is it. It's one of a kind.

Thanks to British inventor Richard Browning, you can now have an electric jet suit and fly just like the Marvel character. Browning showcase the electric suit at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, a motoring event in southern England. The current batteries are only powerful enough to get a human airborne for a matter of seconds. But that same power could also power a small sheet of homes. In recent months, the company has even demonstrated their jet students to the Royal Marines to test how their product can assist maritime boarding operations."

This is what you do with a float while relaxing in the pool. Look at them hanging out. They're just too cute. I'm going to teach my poodles how to do this. Now, he gets on and the other one moves over, and then they just float around together on the float all afternoon. Isn't that -- sharing is caring. It's a wonderful thing."
