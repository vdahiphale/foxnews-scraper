Joe Biden is claiming it -- blaming it on the global problem and Joe Biden said thank goodness for my American rescue plan. And all of you stop worrying about it, it's only transitory. We know it's not transitory. And here's the bottom line. The more they talk, more Americans are going to buy less with the money that they make and they can talk all they want about increase in wages and all of this. You can't afford to buy what you bought a year ago, you want to buy used car it's 37 percent higher than it was last year.

The other thing is, what did we do in the United States that might have been different from other places.

The second point is, you know, there's -- The Telegraph has reported that the U.K. and the U.S. scientists thought it was likely that COVID escaped from a lab but feared further debate would harm science. So that was another thing that was shut down by the experts and it raises a big question. This pandemic was human caused. It was created in a lab under idiotic circumstances.

Well, guess who that would be? AOC, for example. She's very good at fundraising with small dollars. Marjorie Taylor green, for example. Ted Cruz has a tweet that says, why would you guys want to give me $24 million? Because basically, if you look at his small-dollar donations, if you win six to one, as what this bill says you could do. That's incredibly unpopular all across the country. The other thing is, yesterday, the President said we must federalize elections, because democracy is at stake. And then you ask the White House, what do you think about New York allowing 900,000 non-citizens to vote in municipal elections? And they'll say, oh, that's just a local issue.

She had a lot more influence over Barack Obama than Joe did. Then when Obama was done, he basically anointed Hillary, told Joe to step aside, it was her turn.

They look at some of these other polls, do you think the economy is getting better or getting worse are saying about the same. Worse at 54 percent. This has become a political issue. The other thing is, what did we do in the United States that might have been different from other places. If all this was because of the pandemic, you would expect Europe, for example, to be experiencing the same rate of inflation, and they are not. What was different here?

But if you're a media approved voice, right, if you are respectable, then you can just parrot everything we say and everybody goes, wow, that's really sensible. We knew the answer two years ago would come down to an adult assessment or adult notion of risk assessment, the understanding that there is no such thing as zero risk and you could lock down forever and get as close to zero but that's a different sort of death. The second point is, you know, there's -- The Telegraph has reported that the U.K. and the U.S. scientists thought it was likely that COVID escaped from a lab but feared further debate would harm science. So that was another thing that was shut down by the experts and it raises a big question. This pandemic was human caused. It was created in a lab under idiotic circumstances. It's true it may have been a mistake but if they understood that there is a risk of this mistake and they must be held accountable. What is the punishment for manslaughter when it's in the millions?

But you know what, 842,000 deaths, let's say half of them are not COVID as the prime cause, that's still an enormous number of dead people, historic really. I'm not seeing anything like this is a hundred years. So, I think we have to be careful now about the minimizing this profoundly unsettling devastating experience that the nation has gone through.

This has nothing to do with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 when there was still slavery in this country. What this is about is unregulated mail-in voting, which was a function of the COVID crisis and the voter ID. What's so -- what's the big deal about having voter ID? I think, as I said yesterday, everyone in this country should have an ID. Why is that such a big deal? Why is it -- are Puerto Ricans inherently incapable of getting a voter -- an ID. I think that the federal government should issue IDs to every American. I know a lot of conservatives don't like that. Too bad. I think everyone should have the same ID. You got to vote, here it is. At the very least, there's nothing wrong with having a driver's license, Social Security card. Everybody has got a Social Security card. There should be some easy way to prove who you are so it's not just, you know, as if it was a carwash coupon, you receive ballots in the mail, there's three adults, so you get three ballots, and then some political operative comes and collects them in a great big basket. I think it's bogus. It really do. And it is an insult. The Democrats are insulting me. This has nothing to do with Bull Connor. This has nothing to do with you know, Strom Thurmond. It has nothing to do with George Wallace, Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy, the Civil War.

If you look at the percentages, that's like one of the only truly bipartisan agreements that we have in this country is voter ID. So, there's one thing against him. One other thing that people don't realize is in this bill is that it would allow states to take this option of spending taxpayer dollars to fund political campaigns, especially for anybody who is able to raise a lot of small dollar donations. Well, guess who that would be? AOC, for example. She's very good at fundraising with small dollars. Marjorie Taylor green, for example. Ted Cruz has a tweet that says, why would you guys want to give me $24 million? Because basically, if you look at his small-dollar donations, if you win six to one, as what this bill says you could do. That's incredibly unpopular all across the country. The other thing is, yesterday, the President said we must federalize elections, because democracy is at stake. And then you ask the White House, what do you think about New York allowing 900,000 non-citizens to vote in municipal elections? And they'll say, oh, that's just a local issue. I'm not going to pay attention to that. That doesn't make sense. So, the RNC, the Republican National Committee, has sued in New York on that very issue. And also, this sort of went by me. In Vermont, they pass the same thing. The RNC is suing there, and it's likely that because especially in New York, in our Constitution, it says you must be a citizen to vote.

They spell it with a K. And they're very upset about what's happened as you can imagine. They are probably thinking of changed their name. It made me think of all the other names that have been ruined, right? You think of Corona beer, Delta Airlines, a Kovid, Alexa, Karen -- that's our producer there, Karen Funaro. She goes to Starbucks and says her name is Lauren. Then you got Brandon. You all know what that's all about. That's our NASCAR driver there. And just be careful so that they don't make exclamation point in primetime one of those names."

I think that if you have any children or elderly in the room, you should get up and leave. Let's roll the tape. This is just hideous. This is a large sea of pom-poms. Pomeranian dogs, there must be about 70 of them together, a mob of pom-poms. It's absolutely disgusting. I don't know where these tapes come from but it's absolutely hideous to see these little dogs having so much fun. Anyway, I'll shut up now. Judge you're up."

He lives in South Carolina. And every time guests come over, because Rocky gets crazy, she put squirrels on television or on an iPhone. The dog will not bother the guests. He does not get crazy. He's totally focused on the screen. Now, haven't you always wondered whether or not a dog can see what's on television? Look at that, an iPhone. I'm going to go home tonight and try it on Ted."

And now it's back in the -- in that lovely body of water. But that's what they do in Germany. Get some disoriented birds and they throw them in bodies of water."
