Well, it's been a new twist after new twist today in the soap opera known as the Russian investigation. President Trump delivering a stunning tweet earlier writing, quote, I am being investigated for firing the FBI director by the man who told me to fire the FBI director. Witch hunt. Sources tell Fox News the tweet is in reference to deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein's overseeing the Russian investigation. Also, a source close to Trump's legal team tells Fox that President Trump was, of course, not confirming in that tweet that he was under investigation for possible obstruction. Instead they say he was just referencing the Washington Post report that claims an obstruction probe is underway. And that's just the tip of the iceberg today. All right, Eric, I know the legal team said he's not confirming, but what else could I am under investigation possibly mean?",

But I guess Fox's asked the team, they said Rosenstein. But think about this, Rod Rosenstein did recommend that they did fire Mueller. So Rod Rosenstein is the guy who -- I'm sorry, fire Comey, but Rod Rosenstein is the guy who hired Mueller. So now we're hearing -- get ready for this, Rod Rosenstein might recuse himself because he feels like he may be too involved in the Russia story, so that would bring on -- let me see, Rachel Brand, who is the associate attorney general. Now she's the third in line at the DOJ. So, I mean, it's getting crazy. Let me just leave you with this thought.

Well, it's been a new twist after new twist today in the soap opera known as the Russian investigation. President Trump delivering a stunning tweet earlier writing, quote, I am being investigated for firing the FBI director by the man who told me to fire the FBI director. Witch hunt. Sources tell Fox News the tweet is in reference to deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein's overseeing the Russian investigation. Also, a source close to Trump's legal team tells Fox that President Trump was, of course, not confirming in that tweet that he was under investigation for possible obstruction. Instead they say he was just referencing the Washington Post report that claims an obstruction probe is underway. And that's just the tip of the iceberg today. All right, Eric, I know the legal team said he's not confirming, but what else could I am under investigation possibly mean?"

But I guess Fox's asked the team, they said Rosenstein. But think about this, Rod Rosenstein did recommend that they did fire Mueller. So Rod Rosenstein is the guy who -- I'm sorry, fire Comey, but Rod Rosenstein is the guy who hired Mueller. So now we're hearing -- get ready for this, Rod Rosenstein might recuse himself because he feels like he may be too involved in the Russia story, so that would bring on -- let me see, Rachel Brand, who is the associate attorney general. Now she's the third in line at the DOJ. So, I mean, it's getting crazy. Let me just leave you with this thought. The stock market, the Dow made a brand new high, all-time record high to close that high, 21,384 or 5 or so, and record of unemployment, 4.3 percent, it's not been this low since 2001, 16 years ago. Meanwhile, this special counsel, Mueller said he hired 13 new lawyers -- this is today or yesterday, 13 new lawyers. Eboni, a thousand bucks an hour, probably?"

All right. So let's start with that tweet from President Trump today, what it means for Rod Rosenstein involvement in the Russia probe. What do you think? I'm being investigated, Jessica.

Trump saying you can't have a president that's being investigative by the FBI. Well, lo and behold, we do have a president who is being investigated. I think it's better to have all of that out there. I think that he should engage in the conversation. If you want twitter to be his official statement, he should certainly talk to his lawyer beforehand when he does things like that. I sure his legal team is none too pleased with what's going on. But if this is his mode of communication, I rather he be honest, frankly, than telling us lies."

But what he's also has done, he said, you know what, Cuba if you want diplomatic relations with us, you need to sit back down at the table and we'll talk about returning those American prisoners, and we'll talk about your human rights violations.

However, the White House coming out strongly today to say that no final decision has been made on the long-term fate of the program. All right. So, Eric, there are those that were very quick to jump on this, particularly the New York Times came out with a headline right away saying that basically this is Trump not needing a campaign promise.

But if officially verified, will this impact the onslaught of recent attacks across the globe by ISIS? Now Erin, I'll start with you. I think this is big news. I think demoralizing to ISIS.

You cut off its head, two grow in its place. Or eight grow in its place. And I'll tell you this, I went to a Pentagon briefing about last month. When they said Raqqa might not be the final battle. If anti-ISIS forces take back Raqqa, that just means the ISIS fighters who are left are going to go find another territory to claim. And you have to think about this leadership in the same way. Even if their leader is killed, another leader will come in its place."

Frankly, Raqqa -- I mean, I think a lot of people have already moved away from the area and we know that. So I think that, really, what we need to do is attack ISIS on a multi-front type of thing and just get a whole bunch of people at one time.

It was so central to Barack Obama's presidency as well that he could have those moments where he could come out and say we've got a big one. And I think that when we are facing the threat of terror attacks, lone wolf attacks here, and people are afraid to go to Europe -- I mean, I'm heading to Europe tonight and I've certainly had conversations with people that were unpleasant to go to France and to England. And there's great concern there, so I think that it is good for morale, for the nation. Not that you shouldn't be afraid anymore, but to say, we are making some advances and we can work with coalition partners that we are still in the midst of sanctioning, but maybe Russia can be useful to us in some way.

I need to know the breed, I need to know how long you've had your dog -- since I'm a new doggy mommy -- and I love that your dog is named after Benjamin Franklin."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCPIKE",
      "utterance": "I like having a real name. And people say to me that Franklin's a great name. And I've had people say, oh, he must be the smartest dog in puppy class, because his name is Franklin."

      "utterance": "So tell us about your book."
    },

    },

      "speaker": "BOLLINGS",
      "utterance": "Blissful."

      "utterance": "No -- what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLINGS",
      "utterance": "That could be the first time anyone talked about working with Doug as being blissful. But OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Doug is watching. I didn't say that. Anyway, so actually, it's not a partisan book. It's a --"

      "speaker": "BOLLINGS",
      "utterance": "No."
    },

      "speaker": "BOLLINGS",
      "utterance": "It's Friday. We have 30 seconds left in this show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Anyway, it's a road map, a bipartisan road map to how we can address about 10 or 11 key issue areas, and leave whole solutions from the left and from right -- center left and the center right, actually -- to show how we can come together on, like, health care, and the economy, and national security. And it's really good. Thank you so much."
