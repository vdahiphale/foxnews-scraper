      "sentences": "Well, that was amateur hour with Kamala. What a goofball. But January 6th sucked, Dana. It sucked. Everybody knows it sucks. We watched it. I hated seeing what I saw. It hurt the brand and gave the left and excuse to crack down on innocent Trump supporters. But here is an objective analysis on what had culminated. The populist wing erupted that day. The Trump wing, the populist wing of the Republican Party had felt disrespected for many, many years. They had propelled Trump to victory in 2016 and immediately every powerful interest in this country launched a scorched earth campaign against that guy. They went to war with him. Illegal leaking of the tax returns, racial hoaxes, rape hoaxes, illegal targeting, spying, fabricating evidence, planting evidence. Vicious stuff, they tried everything. Then COVID hit and they sued to change the election laws and then blasted out millions of ballots like no one's ever seen. Then all of a sudden Zuckerberg drops half a billion with a B to pay for these private election activists to layer on top of the state election officials, unprecedented. Then big tech spikes the laptop from hell the Republican's October surprise. And then it takes nearly a week to count the votes after the election, so republicans genuinely felt cheated. They felt robbed. They couldn't prove it in court, but they felt after four years of the shenanigans that something was off. It was a culmination of a lot of just nasty skullduggery. Here are the facts, though, Dana. Reuters reports FBI has found no evidence that the January 6th attack was the result of an organized plot to overturn the presidential election. No evidence that Trump or his team were involved in organizing the violence. No seditious conspiracy, no grand scheme. And the vast majority of the people charged were charged with trespassing, which by the way isn't even a crime in Manhattan anymore. \"New York Times\" reported there was an FBI informant, at least one, inside the mob. And mysteriously, we still don't have an answer as to why the capitol was left so unprotected that day. The feds are fighting us in court, withholding the video evidence of that day. Now professor Watters, history major would like to share a few things with you guys because the Democrats are acting like oh, they have never had a soft spot for a political violence. In 1954, Puerto Rican nationals, they shot up the House chamber. They injured five members of Congress, Jimmy Carter commuted their sentence. In 1983, American communists bombed the Senate. They were targeting Republicans. Blew up the Senate wing on the second floor. Who commuted their sentence? Oh, wait, that was President Bill Clinton. William Harris, whether (ph) underground bombed the Pentagon, his team. Barack Obama, best buds. And if I -- I mean, it has not been that long, but I think we all remember that it was the Harris/Biden ticket that bailed out the rioters who set the whole country on fire causing 30 deaths. So, just want make sure everybody knows that little history before they start pointing fingers.",

He, basically, what he did was he scolded millions of Americans for what he believes something very bad that they did. He is presuming their guilt. He is assuming they are guilty. That's not what a president should do. He just reversed the presumption of innocence concluding that all of those people there were guilty, and he is doing it from the highest office in the land. This is exactly what he did with the border patrol agent. This is exactly what he did with Kyle Rittenhouse. There isn't a citizen in America that he wouldn't bash if it suited him politically without the actual facts, without the truth. He keeps talking about the truth, but in every one of those instances, there are lies. There are lies. America -- what America needs right now is a triple vaccine dose of fair and balance because we are being force-fed brainwash from a media in an orgy of self-congratulation in a deliberate and coordinated scam to basically target their political enemies as Jesse pointed out. And as usual, the Democrats are working in tandem with the media the same way they did with the Hunter Biden laptop cover up, the same way they did with Russian collusion, the same way they did with the shadow campaign. The \"Time\" magazine boasted about that saved, saved the 2020 election. They bragged about that. How can you not see this coordinated effort when you see everybody involved including the cast of \"Hamilton\" for god sake? The fact is, why are we, probably the majority of Americans, letting anyone dictate a phony narrative under the guise of an anniversary unless it's about the anniversary of Ashley Babbitt's murder because that's more valuable than anything we listen to today. And it's easy to commemorate one day, right, one day. Good luck commemorating the riots after George Floyd or the riots after Jacob Blake, or the riots after Trump was elected in 2016. You'd have to commemorate every single day. You would run out of damn candles if you commemorated that stuff. But this is easy. This is easy. Its one day. They are trying to turn it into Pearl Harbor. They are trying to turn it into 9/11, but you can't commemorate their crimes because then you'll realize how little the media and the Democrats cared about your actual suffering during those riots. So they do this to place the targets of the backs of their political enemies, the rubes. And they are doing it as a coordinated effort and they want this thing to be permanent. Every year we are going to have to do that. I say no, F you.",

I watched last year on this Dana. I served in that capital. Some of those people that -- in that -- on that floor are my friends, still are my friends. I don't distinguish my friends Democrat or Republican. I watched as I saw those people walking through the capitol, those Americans who I think were in every which way, I don't know who they might be. Greg, you're right. We should not cast blame or cast guilt until they have a chance to defend themselves. But I never seen a scene like that. I know the capitol. I've taken children and young people and older people on tours in the mornings, in the nights and the evenings there. So, it touched me in a different kind of way. I read the things in the paper by Karl Rove saying, who I don't agree with on a lot of political or substantive issues, but one thing I do agree with him on is I love my country. You talked about, Jesse, I thought rightly some of the things that you disagree with that some presidents have done in terms of commuting sentences, but I would remind all of us that in the Adams Jefferson race, that race was decided on the House floor. Adams won. Imagine that we had an effort to do what happened on January 6th, or even that Jackson Adams race where Jackson lost to Adams. And as Dana knows, President Bush, George W. Bush when he beat Al Gore. I'll never forget being on that floor and I'll say watching on that floor and watching Al Gore say that I lost the race and asking Congresswoman Waters to not to challenge it. We happened that day, I hope we can at some point forget about it, but we shouldn't wash it over. And I don't mean -- I think we separate some of the things that you guys have raised. But there was an effort to subvert the two most important things, one of the most important things Congress has, which is either to declare war and confer an election on the new president, which is where we peacefully transfer power. So, I hope one day we can forget this day, but I don't think we have gotten to that point yet.",

So this would seem like an effort to goad Trump into running again and to poke the bear so to speak because that's their best shot at winning. This is the only issue that the Democrats have that they can run on, and that is January 6th. So if Donald Trump tries to run again, this is the one thing that they will talk about over and over again. That if you have a Ron DeSantis running as the nominee with a Tim Scott as his running mate, that pair is going to win 40 states. And who did -- who did Joe Biden convince today? Anybody who saw this as a horrible riot and not an insurrection and no threat to democracy, they're not going to listen to him and they're not going to believe him. But I would love to see Joe Biden be this forceful and give at least some small damn for the people who are truly suffering under this man's presidency. Because of the leadership or rather lack thereof, whether it's giving a damn about the 13 service members who were killed because of his shoddy withdrawal from Afghanistan, or the -- all the murder victims and their families in Democrat-run states from coast-to-coast, because again, criminal justice is about the criminals and not the victims. Fentanyl, tens of thousands dead because Fentanyl is pouring over the wide open border because of Joe Biden.

I want to say one thing about the suggestion that if you think that that speech was partisan then you must believe the lie, that's ridiculous. Never believed that. Never believed that the election was stolen, never said that. And I can still listen to that speech, but don't just take it from me. When Biden left Statuary Hall, he walks out, two reporters are there. They shove two questions to him. The first two are about why he gave such a divisive speech. Okay. So, maybe you think those reporters believe the big lie, I guess. I don't know. That was kind of ridiculous. I also want to mention one other thing. There is something that all of these reporters are missing. And that the answer to making sure this never happens again is right there for the Democrat's taking because the Republicans have come forward and said, we want to clarify the Electoral Count Act. They're like, how it's done. It's called the Electoral Count Reform Act, which would clarify the language so that it's not ambiguous at all so that this could never happen again. Mitch McConnell said we are ready to do this today. President Biden could have said today, take him up on it. I'm going to stop by his office on the way out of here. We can work out the details.

I do hope that one of the things we take away from all of this is one of the lessons we learned just earlier, late last year, rather, when we saw elections happen in Virginia and New Jersey and voters went out and cast their ballots for the person they want to represent them as governor.

And at the time, he was too young to recall his birth name, but he began drawing what he could remember of his home village every day as a kid. And 33 years later, after being inspired by other stories of Chinese children being reunited with their families, he drew the map once again and share the photo on social media. It gained traction and authorities got involved. And through a DNA match, they found his local -- I'm sorry -- they found his birth mother. And there's the reunion there. When they first talked on the phone, she said, if you have a little scar on your chin, and that's how he knew that he had found her. So, it's pretty incredible story that at 4 years old, he can remember that map in his mind and draw it. So, a happy ending there, Greg.",

      "utterance": "Well, that was amateur hour with Kamala. What a goofball. But January 6th sucked, Dana. It sucked. Everybody knows it sucks. We watched it. I hated seeing what I saw. It hurt the brand and gave the left and excuse to crack down on innocent Trump supporters. But here is an objective analysis on what had culminated. The populist wing erupted that day. The Trump wing, the populist wing of the Republican Party had felt disrespected for many, many years. They had propelled Trump to victory in 2016 and immediately every powerful interest in this country launched a scorched earth campaign against that guy. They went to war with him. Illegal leaking of the tax returns, racial hoaxes, rape hoaxes, illegal targeting, spying, fabricating evidence, planting evidence. Vicious stuff, they tried everything. Then COVID hit and they sued to change the election laws and then blasted out millions of ballots like no one's ever seen. Then all of a sudden Zuckerberg drops half a billion with a B to pay for these private election activists to layer on top of the state election officials, unprecedented. Then big tech spikes the laptop from hell the Republican's October surprise. And then it takes nearly a week to count the votes after the election, so republicans genuinely felt cheated. They felt robbed. They couldn't prove it in court, but they felt after four years of the shenanigans that something was off. It was a culmination of a lot of just nasty skullduggery. Here are the facts, though, Dana. Reuters reports FBI has found no evidence that the January 6th attack was the result of an organized plot to overturn the presidential election. No evidence that Trump or his team were involved in organizing the violence. No seditious conspiracy, no grand scheme. And the vast majority of the people charged were charged with trespassing, which by the way isn't even a crime in Manhattan anymore. \"New York Times\" reported there was an FBI informant, at least one, inside the mob. And mysteriously, we still don't have an answer as to why the capitol was left so unprotected that day. The feds are fighting us in court, withholding the video evidence of that day. Now professor Watters, history major would like to share a few things with you guys because the Democrats are acting like oh, they have never had a soft spot for a political violence. In 1954, Puerto Rican nationals, they shot up the House chamber. They injured five members of Congress, Jimmy Carter commuted their sentence. In 1983, American communists bombed the Senate. They were targeting Republicans. Blew up the Senate wing on the second floor. Who commuted their sentence? Oh, wait, that was President Bill Clinton. William Harris, whether (ph) underground bombed the Pentagon, his team. Barack Obama, best buds. And if I -- I mean, it has not been that long, but I think we all remember that it was the Harris/Biden ticket that bailed out the rioters who set the whole country on fire causing 30 deaths. So, just want make sure everybody knows that little history before they start pointing fingers."

      "utterance": "Well, this was the guy that was supposed to unite the country and we've -- we have pretty much seen what he's turned out to be. He, basically, what he did was he scolded millions of Americans for what he believes something very bad that they did. He is presuming their guilt. He is assuming they are guilty. That's not what a president should do. He just reversed the presumption of innocence concluding that all of those people there were guilty, and he is doing it from the highest office in the land. This is exactly what he did with the border patrol agent. This is exactly what he did with Kyle Rittenhouse. There isn't a citizen in America that he wouldn't bash if it suited him politically without the actual facts, without the truth. He keeps talking about the truth, but in every one of those instances, there are lies. There are lies. America -- what America needs right now is a triple vaccine dose of fair and balance because we are being force-fed brainwash from a media in an orgy of self-congratulation in a deliberate and coordinated scam to basically target their political enemies as Jesse pointed out. And as usual, the Democrats are working in tandem with the media the same way they did with the Hunter Biden laptop cover up, the same way they did with Russian collusion, the same way they did with the shadow campaign. The \"Time\" magazine boasted about that saved, saved the 2020 election. They bragged about that. How can you not see this coordinated effort when you see everybody involved including the cast of \"Hamilton\" for god sake? The fact is, why are we, probably the majority of Americans, letting anyone dictate a phony narrative under the guise of an anniversary unless it's about the anniversary of Ashley Babbitt's murder because that's more valuable than anything we listen to today. And it's easy to commemorate one day, right, one day. Good luck commemorating the riots after George Floyd or the riots after Jacob Blake, or the riots after Trump was elected in 2016. You'd have to commemorate every single day. You would run out of damn candles if you commemorated that stuff. But this is easy. This is easy. Its one day. They are trying to turn it into Pearl Harbor. They are trying to turn it into 9/11, but you can't commemorate their crimes because then you'll realize how little the media and the Democrats cared about your actual suffering during those riots. So they do this to place the targets of the backs of their political enemies, the rubes. And they are doing it as a coordinated effort and they want this thing to be permanent. Every year we are going to have to do that. I say no, F you."

I watched last year on this Dana. I served in that capital. Some of those people that -- in that -- on that floor are my friends, still are my friends. I don't distinguish my friends Democrat or Republican. I watched as I saw those people walking through the capitol, those Americans who I think were in every which way, I don't know who they might be. Greg, you're right. We should not cast blame or cast guilt until they have a chance to defend themselves. But I never seen a scene like that. I know the capitol. I've taken children and young people and older people on tours in the mornings, in the nights and the evenings there. So, it touched me in a different kind of way. I read the things in the paper by Karl Rove saying, who I don't agree with on a lot of political or substantive issues, but one thing I do agree with him on is I love my country. You talked about, Jesse, I thought rightly some of the things that you disagree with that some presidents have done in terms of commuting sentences, but I would remind all of us that in the Adams Jefferson race, that race was decided on the House floor. Adams won. Imagine that we had an effort to do what happened on January 6th, or even that Jackson Adams race where Jackson lost to Adams. And as Dana knows, President Bush, George W. Bush when he beat Al Gore. I'll never forget being on that floor and I'll say watching on that floor and watching Al Gore say that I lost the race and asking Congresswoman Waters to not to challenge it. We happened that day, I hope we can at some point forget about it, but we shouldn't wash it over. And I don't mean -- I think we separate some of the things that you guys have raised. But there was an effort to subvert the two most important things, one of the most important things Congress has, which is either to declare war and confer an election on the new president, which is where we peacefully transfer power. So, I hope one day we can forget this day, but I don't think we have gotten to that point yet."

That right now the only chance that they have of retaining the White House is if Donald Trump runs again. Biden didn't win in 2020, he -- it was Trump that lost for him. So this would seem like an effort to goad Trump into running again and to poke the bear so to speak because that's their best shot at winning. This is the only issue that the Democrats have that they can run on, and that is January 6th. So if Donald Trump tries to run again, this is the one thing that they will talk about over and over again. That if you have a Ron DeSantis running as the nominee with a Tim Scott as his running mate, that pair is going to win 40 states. And who did -- who did Joe Biden convince today? Anybody who saw this as a horrible riot and not an insurrection and no threat to democracy, they're not going to listen to him and they're not going to believe him. But I would love to see Joe Biden be this forceful and give at least some small damn for the people who are truly suffering under this man's presidency. Because of the leadership or rather lack thereof, whether it's giving a damn about the 13 service members who were killed because of his shoddy withdrawal from Afghanistan, or the -- all the murder victims and their families in Democrat-run states from coast-to-coast, because again, criminal justice is about the criminals and not the victims.

And you got to remember, they were bragging about their ratings to the after the riots. They weren't expressing outrage. They were expressing excitement that it was the biggest ratings day ever because they realized that their success is predicated on Americans being at each other's throats. We've talked about this. Division is what pays for their so-called news division. And it helps pay for Toobin's porn and Stelter's hoagies. CNN has to go all in on this because they are in a -- they are in a huge mess. They have multiple anchors accused of sexual harassment. There are like two producers accused of alleged like deviant pedophile crap that would make John Wayne Gacy blush. So they have to -- they have to instead obsess over, hey, did Fox News call it an insurrection or not? Well, we haven't called it an insurrection because no one has been found guilty of it. But I understand why you would -- why you'd be chasing that idea. Lastly, again, I go back to the coordination factor. You got the new republic \"USA Today,\" \"A.P.,\" \"Hollywood Reporter.\" They are all doing stories in which the media is interviewing the media. And it tells you that thing that I always say before that nothing happens in this world unless it happens to the media. They have to be the center of the story. The fearless media battling PTSD to revisit this trauma. That's why they didn't care about the riots. They didn't care about Portland because it wasn't about them.

I mean, that's when you know that they are ready to, basically orchestrating the whole day including Lin-Manuel Miranda for example. I want to say one thing about the suggestion that if you think that that speech was partisan then you must believe the lie, that's ridiculous. Never believed that. Never believed that the election was stolen, never said that. And I can still listen to that speech, but don't just take it from me. When Biden left Statuary Hall, he walks out, two reporters are there. They shove two questions to him. The first two are about why he gave such a divisive speech. Okay. So, maybe you think those reporters believe the big lie, I guess. I don't know. That was kind of ridiculous. I also want to mention one other thing. There is something that all of these reporters are missing. And that the answer to making sure this never happens again is right there for the Democrat's taking because the Republicans have come forward and said, we want to clarify the Electoral Count Act. They're like, how it's done. It's called the Electoral Count Reform Act, which would clarify the language so that it's not ambiguous at all so that this could never happen again. Mitch McConnell said we are ready to do this today. President Biden could have said today, take him up on it. I'm going to stop by his office on the way out of here. We can work out the details. We could have that done by Monday."

I think perhaps on today there is some -- there is probably more pent-up resentment around it because the issue is such a serious one. And probably would've been better if, you know, if the president had not given such -- I thought there were elements of his speech that were a little bit more divisive than need be, but I thought the speech overall was a powerful one. I think Dana is right, you could disagree with the speech and not believe that the election was fairly and rightly won by Joe Biden. I do hope that one of the things we take away from all of this is one of the lessons we learned just earlier, late last year, rather, when we saw elections happen in Virginia and New Jersey and voters went out and cast their ballots for the person they want to represent them as governor. And Democrats didn't fare well. That's how you, in a democracy and a republic, that's how you show politicians that they're not performing the way you want them to perform.

Every president looks at their schedule every day and thinks, I don't have any time to even think and -- or do whatever they need to do. Their days are very scheduled. I do think that the President has had many, many days where you just think, well, what is he doing? Part of it is that you have to continue to feed the beast, and they decide not to do that. So, then they don't -- they don't hold the reins when it comes to -- I'm thinking of reins, the whip law, the whipping ---they don't hold the reins when it comes to driving the new cycle. And then that's when you get questions like this because people are like, well, where is he? And I'm sure that he's busy. I think she could have also just said, don't worry about him, he's busy."

Reagan was shot in his first year. A bullet came this close to his heart. And then for the next seven years, Reagan went out and delivered some of the most eloquent and inspiring speeches of all time. Perfect execution. He gave the whole country the chills. And not only that, he was at the ranch horseback riding. He was out, you know, chopping wood. I don't see Joe Biden chopping wood in Delaware. He barely plays golf, Harold. I think it's the worst kept secret in Washington that Biden's firepower, not there."

When you email them, it should come back, sorry, I'm out of the office for whatever. I don't want a -- I think we -- I think we don't need a president. I don't think we need a government.

So, when he was young, at 4 years old, he was abducted from his village. He was trafficked all across China. And at the time, he was too young to recall his birth name, but he began drawing what he could remember of his home village every day as a kid. And 33 years later, after being inspired by other stories of Chinese children being reunited with their families, he drew the map once again and share the photo on social media. It gained traction and authorities got involved. And through a DNA match, they found his local -- I'm sorry -- they found his birth mother. And there's the reunion there. When they first talked on the phone, she said, if you have a little scar on your chin, and that's how he knew that he had found her. So, it's pretty incredible story that at 4 years old, he can remember that map in his mind and draw it. So, a happy ending there, Greg."

I think we might even have -- there, fighting in the snow. Snow makes them aggressive apparently according to scientists. They have been studying. That's a bison, they're actual animals, Dana.
