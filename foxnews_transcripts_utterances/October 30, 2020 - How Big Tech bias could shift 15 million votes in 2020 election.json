      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The President in the final days of this race in nonstop rally mode. He has crisscrossed the country all day. He is doing it again tonight, of course, if news happens, we'll go there. Well, for five years, we have watched the news media treat Donald Trump in a way that no American President has ever been treated. Richard Nixon himself disgraced, impeached, forced from office in the end got a pass by comparison to Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Reporters hate Trump with an all-consuming mania. They hit him so intensely that at times it's been amusing to watch. If Donald Trump announced a cure for cancer at tonight's rally in Minnesota, CNN would denounce him for fixing drug prices. That's true. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you're a fair-minded person, it has been infuriating to watch this. It's too dishonest. It's also patronizing because it's almost unbelievably stupid. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Trump spied for Russia. Trump works for Putin. Trump is a racist because he likes borders and doesn't want to live in Haiti. Yes, okay. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Clearly all the smart kids went in to finance. America's websites and TV stations got the rest. Unfortunately, we've got to live with the consequences of that. But we should also say, if we are being entirely honest, that as grating as all of this is, unremitting hostility to the President of the United States is far from the greatest threat America faces. Reporters are supposed to be tough on people with power. That's why we have if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } journalism: to keep a close eye on those who have outsized influence over our lives. The people we should watch carefully would include business moguls, the Intel agencies, prominent academics, cultural figures, military leaders, and most obviously, our politicians. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The rest of us can't really know what these people, the people in charge are doing at all times. A reporter's job is to find out and tell us. So in the end, the real threat to America isn't too many nasty questions from reporters. It's the opposite of that. The real threat is collusion. When journalists strike secret alliances with the very people they are supposed to be holding accountable, we are in deep trouble. Lies go unchallenged. Democracy cannot function. And that's what we are watching right now. Yesterday -- and this may be the starkest example of all -- we learned that the F.B.I. is conducting an active investigation into Joe Biden's son for business deals that apparently included his father, the former Vice President. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now that is not speculation, it is confirmed. Former Biden business partner, Tony Bobulinski sat for a five-hour interview with six F.B.I. agents just the other day -- a week ago. They asked him about his business dealings in China with the Biden family. Now, we don't know if this investigation will result in indictments, obviously. We know that it could. And that is significant because Joe Biden, as you may have heard is running for President. The election is on Tuesday. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So by any possible measure, this is a blockbuster, stop the presses news story. It's not some naughty picture from somebody's laptop. This is a criminal investigation into business deals that we know for a fact Joe Biden was party to. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So why haven't you heard more about this? If you don't watch this, you've likely heard nothing at all, not a word. And you know why? Because the media are collaborating. They are collaborating with the Democratic Party. They are collaborating with the Intelligence Agencies that spy on Americans with impunity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They are collaborating with the tech monopolies that have choked off the average person's access to legitimate information. We're not overstating any of that we wish we were. Watch the people you're supposed to be able to trust, dismiss a completely legitimate verified news story as quote, \"a Russian plot.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They are not trying to help you or inform you, just the opposite. These people are your enemies. They are misleading you so that you will obey and maybe it will work, honestly. Maybe they will get Joe Biden elected President next week without even asking the most basic questions of the candidate, the most basic questions or vetting him in any way. That can work. That's the gambit. But what then? Many of these people you just saw on the screen will then go to work for Biden, officially. We'd expect that because without Donald Trump to hyperventilate over, the business models at many news outlets will collapse, and these people will need jobs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can't hire everyone at NBC.

Miranda, it is good to see you tonight. Tell us what we know. MIRANDA DEVINE, COLUMNIST, \"THE NEW YORK POST\": You, too. Well, look, we have continually, every single day, we have the liberal media colluding with Big Tech and the Intelligence Agencies to cover up a story about Joe Biden, which shows that he is corrupt or has been corrupt, and the evidence has piled up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You've reported.

He said that we could have just made it all go away and we could have had our account back if we just deleted the tweets and then did what Twitter wanted, and then we could retweet something else afterwards, which is so pathetic.

Most importantly, putting kids in class does not impact the spread of the coronavirus. One study by Yale University of 57,000 childcare providers found there were no differences in the percentage of them who got COVID with their facilities open and those whose facilities closed. In other words, no heightened risk from working with kids. And a Spanish study found no increase in infections in teachers or kids who went back to school and those who didn't. One researcher said, \"What we found is that the school being opened makes absolutely no difference in the number of cases.\" Another researcher in a similar study of schools in 191 countries discovered the same thing. What the data suggests is that opening schools does not inevitably lead to increased case numbers. Here in the States, pediatricians say they are seeing far more negative impacts from keeping kids out of class, suffering mental health problems, hunger, obesity due to inactivity, missing routine medical care and a greater risk of abuse. But the reasons for going to school include meals, physical activity, healthcare and a far improved education. Consistent findings of no spike for students or teachers and more harmful effects for those who stayed home; and by the way, Tucker, seven states, D.C. and Puerto Rico still have full or partial closures in effect -- Tucker. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Witnesses in the area, according to the Associated Press were able to identify and point out the suspect for responding officers. A witness at a nearby shop said they heard several loud popping noises. So people heard the gunfire. Some people saw the gunman apparently and pointed him out to responding officers, but again, we have two police officers ambushed in the French Quarter by a passenger in a pedicab. He opened fire on those two officers. One of them shot in the cheek in stable condition; the other with wounds to his arm -- Tucker.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The President in the final days of this race in nonstop rally mode. He has crisscrossed the country all day. He is doing it again tonight, of course, if news happens, we'll go there. Well, for five years, we have watched the news media treat Donald Trump in a way that no American President has ever been treated. Richard Nixon himself disgraced, impeached, forced from office in the end got a pass by comparison to Donald Trump. Reporters hate Trump with an all-consuming mania. They hit him so intensely that at times it's been amusing to watch. If Donald Trump announced a cure for cancer at tonight's rally in Minnesota, CNN would denounce him for fixing drug prices. That's true. If you're a fair-minded person, it has been infuriating to watch this. It's too dishonest. It's also patronizing because it's almost unbelievably stupid. Trump spied for Russia. Trump works for Putin. Trump is a racist because he likes borders and doesn't want to live in Haiti. Yes, okay. Clearly all the smart kids went in to finance. America's websites and TV stations got the rest. Unfortunately, we've got to live with the consequences of that. But we should also say, if we are being entirely honest, that as grating as all of this is, unremitting hostility to the President of the United States is far from the greatest threat America faces. Reporters are supposed to be tough on people with power. That's why we have journalism: to keep a close eye on those who have outsized influence over our lives. The people we should watch carefully would include business moguls, the Intel agencies, prominent academics, cultural figures, military leaders, and most obviously, our politicians. The rest of us can't really know what these people, the people in charge are doing at all times. A reporter's job is to find out and tell us. So in the end, the real threat to America isn't too many nasty questions from reporters. It's the opposite of that. The real threat is collusion. When journalists strike secret alliances with the very people they are supposed to be holding accountable, we are in deep trouble. Lies go unchallenged. Democracy cannot function. And that's what we are watching right now. Yesterday -- and this may be the starkest example of all -- we learned that the F.B.I. is conducting an active investigation into Joe Biden's son for business deals that apparently included his father, the former Vice President. Now that is not speculation, it is confirmed. Former Biden business partner, Tony Bobulinski sat for a five-hour interview with six F.B.I. agents just the other day -- a week ago. They asked him about his business dealings in China with the Biden family. Now, we don't know if this investigation will result in indictments, obviously. We know that it could. And that is significant because Joe Biden, as you may have heard is running for President. The election is on Tuesday. So by any possible measure, this is a blockbuster, stop the presses news story. It's not some naughty picture from somebody's laptop. This is a criminal investigation into business deals that we know for a fact Joe Biden was party to. So why haven't you heard more about this? If you don't watch this, you've likely heard nothing at all, not a word. And you know why? Because the media are collaborating. They are collaborating with the Democratic Party. They are collaborating with the Intelligence Agencies that spy on Americans with impunity. They are collaborating with the tech monopolies that have choked off the average person's access to legitimate information. We're not overstating any of that we wish we were. Watch the people you're supposed to be able to trust, dismiss a completely legitimate verified news story as quote, \"a Russian plot.\""

Vladimir Putin didn't invent the two separate meetings that Tony Bobulinski had with Joe Biden to discuss business in China, the business the F.B.I. is now investigating and an active criminal investigation. That's all entirely real. It happened. It is happening now, and the people you just watched on the screen know that it did. Yet, they are you it is all fake, a concoction of a hostile foreign power. So you have to ask yourself at some point, why would they tell you that? They know it's not true, they are saying it any way. They are expecting you to believe it. Why are they doing that? Well, because these people are not your allies. They are not trying to help you or inform you, just the opposite. These people are your enemies.

Maybe they will get Joe Biden elected President next week without even asking the most basic questions of the candidate, the most basic questions or vetting him in any way. That can work. That's the gambit. But what then? Many of these people you just saw on the screen will then go to work for Biden, officially. We'd expect that because without Donald Trump to hyperventilate over, the business models at many news outlets will collapse, and these people will need jobs. But Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can't hire everyone at NBC. Some of these people have to continue to be quote \"journalists.\" And the question is, can they really do that?

Well, look, we have continually, every single day, we have the liberal media colluding with Big Tech and the Intelligence Agencies to cover up a story about Joe Biden, which shows that he is corrupt or has been corrupt, and the evidence has piled up. You've reported. You did the interview with Tony Bobulinski. We reported at \"The New York Post\" on the material that was on Hunter Biden's laptop. It all points to Joe Biden's involvement in his family's influence peddling scheme in China and Ukraine and other countries. Now, this is a legitimate story. We've heard nothing from Joe Biden because of course, he doesn't have to answer these allegations. He doesn't answer any questions because he is not being asked. And because the rest of the media is running interference for him, they are accusing us, \"The New York Post\" and you as well, I guess and Tony Bobulinski of being agents of Russia and peddling Russian disinformation. And I just think this is not journalism, and any journalist who is complicit in this cover up, this corrupt cover up just ought to resign."

Called for \"The New York Post\" to become complicit in its own censorship. I never thought I would live to the age where a news anchor, a journalist, a reporter would say something like that. What do you make of it?"

      "utterance": "Well, that's Jake Tapper. So \"The New York Post,\" we were locked out for two weeks by Twitter. Only tonight has Twitter been kind enough to let us have our account back. But for two weeks, we were held hostage by Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter, who said that we could only get our account back if we deleted the tweets pointing to our stories about Hunter Biden's laptop. There was nothing inaccurate in those tweets. There was nothing inaccurate in the stories. The stories were not hacked material as everyone now admits. Initially, we were locked out because Twitter said we had violated their hacked material rules. They then accepted we hadn't. But they wouldn't unlock us until we deleted those completely blameless tweets. And so we refused to do that because we have integrity and honor, and Jake Tapper, obviously has other ideas. He said that we could have just made it all go away and we could have had our account back if we just deleted the tweets and then did what Twitter wanted, and then we could retweet something else afterwards, which is so pathetic. You know that that tells you that the rest of the media is not aware of the danger of censorship from these old powerful organizations that control this of information that we all use. And you know, the proof of that is that now, more than half of Americans think that the Hunter Biden laptop story is Russian disinformation. So it has worked and this is right before an election campaign, real evidence of corruption that points to Joe Biden being involved in this influence peddling scheme, making millions of dollars with his family out of selling out this country to China in particular, and to Ukraine, and yet that's been covered up by the media and censored by Big Tech, and other journalists think that's okay."

Now, it is obvious that is happening. There's no question about it. So far, the tech monopolies have censored reporting on the Biden's family business practices. They've silenced politicians they don't like. They've deplatformed any user who deviates from a narrowly prescribed set of approved ideas, and they also have other less obvious ways to influence the election. Google can offer bias search suggestions and does. YouTube gets to pick the next video that you watch. What's the effect of all of this? Much more profound than anything any foreign country is doing to us. Dr. Robert Epstein has been studying tech and its effect on politics for years.

We've been measuring that now with about 600 field agents in the swing states, and just based on the 150,000 searches that we've looked at, that's about 1.5 million search results and over a million web pages, we are finding very substantial, pro-liberal bias in all 10, or at least nine out of 10 search results on the first page of Google Search Results, strong liberal bias. Not on Bing or Yahoo, though. And we're seeing that bias in every single demographic group. In fact, in one report we generated recently, we saw more liberal bias in Google content going to conservatives than going to liberals."

They're all very frustrated. I think we do it with monitoring systems, with large scale Nielsen-type monitoring systems. As I say, we have more than 600 field agents this year in the swing states. We will probably have 700 or 800 by the Election Day, and what happens in that case is with their permission, we are using software to look over their shoulders and see what these tech companies: Google, Bing, Yahoo, Facebook, and more -- see what these tech companies are showing them."

      "utterance": "Hey Tucker, several studies both here and abroad reaching virtually the same conclusion. In person schooling is better for kids than homeschooling in pretty much every way. Most importantly, putting kids in class does not impact the spread of the coronavirus. One study by Yale University of 57,000 childcare providers found there were no differences in the percentage of them who got COVID with their facilities open and those whose facilities closed. In other words, no heightened risk from working with kids. And a Spanish study found no increase in infections in teachers or kids who went back to school and those who didn't. One researcher said, \"What we found is that the school being opened makes absolutely no difference in the number of cases.\" Another researcher in a similar study of schools in 191 countries discovered the same thing. What the data suggests is that opening schools does not inevitably lead to increased case numbers. Here in the States, pediatricians say they are seeing far more negative impacts from keeping kids out of class, suffering mental health problems, hunger, obesity due to inactivity, missing routine medical care and a greater risk of abuse. But the reasons for going to school include meals, physical activity, healthcare and a far improved education. Consistent findings of no spike for students or teachers and more harmful effects for those who stayed home; and by the way, Tucker, seven states, D.C. and Puerto Rico still have full or partial closures in effect -- Tucker."

And that's why, by the way, I'm working on a novel about bioengineered virus, but I put it on the shelf, because I don't want to inflict any more fear. And the biggest fear monger of them all, Alfred Hitchcock was asked, \"How dare you scare everybody with the birds, with psycho, people with blood pressures going up?\" And you know what he said? He said, you get to turn the camera off and go home after the movie. Well, you don't get to go home here, and Michael Bay should listen to that before he dumps -- before he jumps into deep water. He should stick with \"Transformers,\" Tucker. He is talking about a major mutation occurring to COVID-19 and it becomes COVID-23 and the world is wiped out. Well, I talked to the head of the N.I.H. last week who said this virus is not mutating in that direction. It is not becoming more severe. But meanwhile, in Michael Bay's movie, you have a virtual reality where the couples meet KJ Apa and Sofia Carson meet virtually. They have a virtual relationship. Well, we talked about this, Tucker. Zoom meetings with masks on. There's one person in particular I want to say, he should have worn an entire face mask if you know what I mean, Tucker? And then of course, other people are suggesting that people wear masks during sex. Well, it's even worse in the Michael Bay movie because you have a virtual marriage going on.

They convinced a great deal of government employees that that was the case, too. I mean, these people were going home at night and listening to CNN every day. So, when they come in to work, they feel -- they have sort of a false imperative to do their own thing and to disregard the instructions from the Commander-in-Chief and the Chain of Command, and there's nothing really more dangerous than convincing the entire Federal government that the President is a foreign asset.

It doesn't occur to me to end friendships over those views, not because they are not real views. They are, but because friendship and loyalty are the most important things."

They are not people who think differently than you. They are bad people. And thus, you can cut them loose. It's essentially, you're playing chess with someone who can beat you at chess, but you label him a racist and then you win the game."

      "utterance": "No, it's such a good point and a reassuring point. Adam Carolla, great to see you tonight. Thank you. So one unexpected twist in this race full of unexpected twist is that Donald Trump is getting praise from some of the world's most famous rappers. Kanye West, Lil Wayne 50 Cent, even Zuby in the U.K. All have expressed some degree of support for the President. Not everyone is happy about that. Why? And what does it mean exactly? Jason Whitlock after the break."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's one of our favorite rap stars, a man called, Zuby, huge in the U.K., not well known in this country kind of like the Beatles in 1962. On this show, a year ago tonight, he came and he expressed his concerns about the changing political atmosphere. He is one of a handful of rappers who have faced backlash for thinking for themselves and defying Democratic Party orthodoxy. Another example is rapper, Lil Wayne, who visited the White House yesterday after tweeting out his support for Donald Trump. That did not go over well on the internet. He was attacked on social media pretty aggressively as some kind of sellout as many others have been before him. Things didn't go better for rap star 50 Cent. He endorsed the President because of his tax policy and said he didn't want to become 20 Cent. Here's an example of the reaction he got."

He's a partner at Outkick.com. We're happy to have him tonight, Jason, why just the kind of mania about trying to force certain people to stay in their prescribed lane? Why not just kind of ignore it. Let it go. Like, you know, some rapper wants to vote for Trump. Okay, who cares? But they do care. Why?"

      "utterance": "Oh, because white liberals just being very honest, like Chelsea Handler, think it's their job to control, maintain, and limit the amount of freedom that black people enjoy here in America. We are supposed to be beholden and dependent upon them and it threatens them when people like Lil Wayne, Ice Cube, 50 Cent and any of these guys stray from their prescription or course of action that they want us to take. It threatens them. And it is her job as basically a modern day overseer to whip us back in line, and it really is that simple."

      "utterance": "It means that he is more powerful. And I honestly believe that not all, but there are a lot of white liberals who are threatened by the independence and the self-determination of black people. They want us dependent upon them. There is a superiority complex. There is a \"You guys can't do it without us\" complex. And there is a \"We want your vote and we want you in line with our feminist agenda. We want to meld the two off of the back of oppression that black people have faced. We want to advance all these other things that have nothing to do with black people.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    {
      "speaker": "WHITLOCK",
      "utterance": "Well, look, the greatest beneficiaries of the Civil Rights movement and a lot of people's view and certainly in mine has been white women. And I'll go a step further, women have advanced off of oppression of black people, white women in particular. And Tucker, I'm just going to go all the way there. I think we are now seeing the LGBTQ community latch on to black oppression and try to use it to advance their call, and anybody that strays from those agendas and that support any person, black person that puts their advancement and their priorities ahead of the feminist movement and the LGBT movement is going to face stiff repercussion over social media in particular. And there's going to be celebrities, white and black, that are used like attack dogs to make sure that certain black men and others stay in line with the movement that the elite liberals want us to stick to and that's the matriarchy, the empowerment of women, and the empowerment of the LGBT community."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Boy, you are not allowed to say any of that, which makes me think, you know, I wanted to hear more about it. But it almost sounds like some of the people who are jumping up and down and making the most noise about how deeply they care about black people may not actually care quite as much as they say they do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITLOCK",
      "utterance": "Well, one of the biggest mistakes we, as black people made is we mistake affinity, affection for respect and freedom. And affinity is not a substitute for respect. Affinity, a lot of times, and affection has almost everything to do with the giver. When you understand affection that pleasures the giver as much if not more than the receiver. Respect pleasures the receiver and reveals the character of the giver. And so I just think one of the biggest mistake that we, as black people make with, oh my god, they like us. That doesn't mean they respect us. That doesn't mean they have their best interest -- our best interest in heart. What it means is they like the pleasure they receive from the show of affection."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
