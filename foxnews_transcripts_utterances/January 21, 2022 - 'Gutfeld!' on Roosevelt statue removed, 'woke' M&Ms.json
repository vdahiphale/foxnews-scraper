      "sentences": "Clap. Clap you jerks. Clap. Happy Friday, everyone. Jesse Watters is here. No, no, no, don't change it. Don't change it. It's going to be great. Trust me. So finally, Justice has arrived after all the rampant, crime the smash and grabs, the subway covers, the brutal random murders of young women. Our leaders are finally doing something about it. Late Wednesday night, a statue of Theodore Roosevelt. That's a president, Kat. Was removed after standing in front of the American Museum of Natural History for more than 80 years. Yes, instead of removing the vagrants who have been dedicating doing drugs and assaulting people go after the inanimate stiff, that'll make life better. But hey, Teddy was evil. Those glasses, that mustache. He probably wore those as a disguise while he was beating up people of color. So get lost your jerk and take your racist horse with you. And what a heroic feat to rid us of Teddy or at least a statue. So typical of Libs to pick on something that can't hit back. By the way, the removal cost the city two million bucks. So where are they sending Teddy to? Private school? Antifa could have done it for free with ropes. With CNN looking the other way. Hell, Kat would have done it for two Sixers. The beer not the players. But where else would you like that money to go? For more policing in the subways or the streets where crime is rampant? Shut up your bigot. Did you know the statue was deemed so offensive they covered it with a massive orange tarp. The same one Brian Stelter uses as a towel in the Steam Room. The monument is now in a library in North Dakota. So like all residents fleeing New York to Florida, it's probably safer. In the New York Post, they quote one of Teddy's descendants, \"Theodore Roosevelt the fifth, who cheered the removal, saying the statue is being relocated to a place where its composition can be recontextualized to facilitate difficult, complex and inclusive discussions. Well, thank you, you pretentious (BLEE) If Teddy were alive, he dressed you up like a white rhino and chase you through Central Park with a 12 gauge. And you think I care about these statues? I don't. I'm not into statues, except for the nudes. And even then the security at the museum keeps a pretty good eye on me. But this is part of a larger problem. Americans care about crime. They don't care about statues any more than they care about trans bathrooms or pronouns. But someone does. It's our Craven leaders who are under the thumb of a tiny woke mob. This as crime explodes in every city run by Libs. We hear the tragedies every day, but they don't get the outrage. You saw over statues in those heady days of the George Floyd riots, when statues were dropping like Jeffrey Toobin's pants during Zoom call, never gets old. Now many were of confederate soldiers toppled by protesters, but it didn't stop there. And even the city leaders joined in just as one guy predicted",

      "sentences": "That's a police bust. So as crimes banana control, our media saw progress in this pointless purge. Abe Lincoln statue was toppled in Portland. I guess they're siding with John Wilkes' booth. Both Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were also knocked down in that town. Then they destroyed the city. Of course there's no correlation there. Andrew Jackson in Mississippi, Francis Scott Key in San Francisco, Ulysses S. Grant also toppled in S.F. Probably to be replaced by a giant bronze pile of human feces. Even Frederick Douglass wasn't safe. He was torn down in Rochester, New York. Like Brian Kilmeade's flees, that's a head scratcher. The Virgin Mary decapitated in Tennessee. Jesus Christ decapitated in Miami, probably because it needed a nose job. Gandhi, even Gandhi was vandalized in Davis, California. And we all remember what a jerk he was. And yet the media and our politicians thought it was progress that this would help cities and help people. But like what Disney did the Star Wars they destroyed something and replaced it with something worse. The rest of us though, we knew this was an excuse for mayhem, a gateway for more than just destroying statues. And what came next? Businesses and police precincts destroyed, nothing was sacred. And when looting is defended as a good thing. Society is backwards as Chris Cross's pants. There's a reference. Wow, it's the broken window theory on meth. You let society go to hell. And it quite literally goes to hell. We have criminals released from prison to commit more crime on New York subways, L.A. bus stations, high-end furniture stores. They'll stab you because they're soulless and cold as the statues being torn down. And yet even now, the statues are still a priority. Because fake virtue signaling is easier than dealing with real suffering. And politicians were just more terrified of the mob than they were of you. Bill de Blasio, Ted Wheeler, Jacob Frey, if they were any more yellow, they'd be on The Simpsons. And now people are dying, in part because leaders felt a piece of stone was more harmful than a dude with a knife. When the truth is sometimes a statue is the only thing between you and the dude with a knife. So now the only safe statue is the one in the White House until they make a real one of them. Then they'll tear it down in a heartbeat.",

I wonder if the FBI will get a producing credit. Billy Ray, the guy behind the miniseries, the Comey rule will direct this movie. So you'll know it'll be more slanted than in A-frame house. Of course, January 6 has become like a never ending Super Bowl for the left. That's a distraction that only matters to them. And as predicted, it's getting the movie treatment. And like say the story of Harvey Weinstein or anyone else that hits too close to home. Says the director, \"The goal was to do a ground level view of a momentous day. It's about protesters who became rioters and cops who became defenders of democracy.\" So Wow. Now Hollywood likes the cops and guns apparently. Sorry, it sounds like this version of January 6 will be as phony as AOC's version of January 6. You know when she was taken hostage and nearly murdered probably by Ted Cruz and a mask.

High School in Fairfax County Virginia, aren't they all has defied state curriculum laws by asking students to take part in privileged bingo, unlike a bingo enjoyed by older people playing this will make you wish you were dead? In a game called identifying your privilege, some bingo spaces include having parents that are married, being a military kid, being white male and having your own bedroom. Well, you might say some of those things are irrelevant, some are good luck and some are just signing your family has its act together. Of course, you would say that, you racist. By the way, I don't even have my own bedroom and I still, I still share it with Stuart Varney, and that is a privilege. Especially when I get the top bunk. On his first day in office, Virginia's Governor Glenn Youngkin ban divisive concepts like this, but the school ignored them. The Assistant Superintendent for the school district said the exercise encourages students to reflect on their own biases instead of reflecting, you know, on silliness, like learning how to count and learning how to read. But many parents in particularly military families took issue with military kid being considered a privilege, you know, because yes, I'm sure when their grand dad's were storming Normandy, all they could think was, boy, do I have it easy. Plus, military kids move as soon as they make friends and are literally called brats. After the backlash, a spokesperson for the district apologized, instead they removed the category. You know, I bet they missed the good old days when they could call children racist, and the governor wore blackface. But no wonder schools stink when all they're taught is crap. We'll be right back.

      "utterance": "Clap. Clap you jerks. Clap. Happy Friday, everyone. Jesse Watters is here. No, no, no, don't change it. Don't change it. It's going to be great. Trust me. So finally, Justice has arrived after all the rampant, crime the smash and grabs, the subway covers, the brutal random murders of young women. Our leaders are finally doing something about it. Late Wednesday night, a statue of Theodore Roosevelt. That's a president, Kat. Was removed after standing in front of the American Museum of Natural History for more than 80 years. Yes, instead of removing the vagrants who have been dedicating doing drugs and assaulting people go after the inanimate stiff, that'll make life better. But hey, Teddy was evil. Those glasses, that mustache. He probably wore those as a disguise while he was beating up people of color. So get lost your jerk and take your racist horse with you. And what a heroic feat to rid us of Teddy or at least a statue. So typical of Libs to pick on something that can't hit back. By the way, the removal cost the city two million bucks. So where are they sending Teddy to? Private school? Antifa could have done it for free with ropes. With CNN looking the other way. Hell, Kat would have done it for two Sixers. The beer not the players. But where else would you like that money to go? For more policing in the subways or the streets where crime is rampant? Shut up your bigot. Did you know the statue was deemed so offensive they covered it with a massive orange tarp. The same one Brian Stelter uses as a towel in the Steam Room. The monument is now in a library in North Dakota. So like all residents fleeing New York to Florida, it's probably safer. In the New York Post, they quote one of Teddy's descendants, \"Theodore Roosevelt the fifth, who cheered the removal, saying the statue is being relocated to a place where its composition can be recontextualized to facilitate difficult, complex and inclusive discussions. Well, thank you, you pretentious (BLEE) If Teddy were alive, he dressed you up like a white rhino and chase you through Central Park with a 12 gauge. And you think I care about these statues? I don't. I'm not into statues, except for the nudes. And even then the security at the museum keeps a pretty good eye on me. But this is part of a larger problem. Americans care about crime. They don't care about statues any more than they care about trans bathrooms or pronouns. But someone does. It's our Craven leaders who are under the thumb of a tiny woke mob. This as crime explodes in every city run by Libs. We hear the tragedies every day, but they don't get the outrage. You saw over statues in those heady days of the George Floyd riots, when statues were dropping like Jeffrey Toobin's pants during Zoom call, never gets old. Now many were of confederate soldiers toppled by protesters, but it didn't stop there. And even the city leaders joined in just as one guy predicted"

      "utterance": "That's a police bust. So as crimes banana control, our media saw progress in this pointless purge. Abe Lincoln statue was toppled in Portland. I guess they're siding with John Wilkes' booth. Both Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were also knocked down in that town. Then they destroyed the city. Of course there's no correlation there. Andrew Jackson in Mississippi, Francis Scott Key in San Francisco, Ulysses S. Grant also toppled in S.F. Probably to be replaced by a giant bronze pile of human feces. Even Frederick Douglass wasn't safe. He was torn down in Rochester, New York. Like Brian Kilmeade's flees, that's a head scratcher. The Virgin Mary decapitated in Tennessee. Jesus Christ decapitated in Miami, probably because it needed a nose job. Gandhi, even Gandhi was vandalized in Davis, California. And we all remember what a jerk he was. And yet the media and our politicians thought it was progress that this would help cities and help people. But like what Disney did the Star Wars they destroyed something and replaced it with something worse. The rest of us though, we knew this was an excuse for mayhem, a gateway for more than just destroying statues. And what came next? Businesses and police precincts destroyed, nothing was sacred. And when looting is defended as a good thing. Society is backwards as Chris Cross's pants. There's a reference. Wow, it's the broken window theory on meth. You let society go to hell. And it quite literally goes to hell. We have criminals released from prison to commit more crime on New York subways, L.A. bus stations, high-end furniture stores. They'll stab you because they're soulless and cold as the statues being torn down. And yet even now, the statues are still a priority. Because fake virtue signaling is easier than dealing with real suffering. And politicians were just more terrified of the mob than they were of you. Bill de Blasio, Ted Wheeler, Jacob Frey, if they were any more yellow, they'd be on The Simpsons. And now people are dying, in part because leaders felt a piece of stone was more harmful than a dude with a knife. When the truth is sometimes a statue is the only thing between you and the dude with a knife. So now the only safe statue is the one in the White House until they make a real one of them. Then they'll tear it down in a heartbeat."

I wonder if the FBI will get a producing credit. Billy Ray, the guy behind the miniseries, the Comey rule will direct this movie. So you'll know it'll be more slanted than in A-frame house. Of course, January 6 has become like a never ending Super Bowl for the left. That's a distraction that only matters to them. And as predicted, it's getting the movie treatment. And like say the story of Harvey Weinstein or anyone else that hits too close to home. Says the director, \"The goal was to do a ground level view of a momentous day. It's about protesters who became rioters and cops who became defenders of democracy.\" So Wow. Now Hollywood likes the cops and guns apparently. Sorry, it sounds like this version of January 6 will be as phony as AOC's version of January 6. You know when she was taken hostage and nearly murdered probably by Ted Cruz and a mask.

In a game called identifying your privilege, some bingo spaces include having parents that are married, being a military kid, being white male and having your own bedroom. Well, you might say some of those things are irrelevant, some are good luck and some are just signing your family has its act together. Of course, you would say that, you racist. By the way, I don't even have my own bedroom and I still, I still share it with Stuart Varney, and that is a privilege. Especially when I get the top bunk. On his first day in office, Virginia's Governor Glenn Youngkin ban divisive concepts like this, but the school ignored them. The Assistant Superintendent for the school district said the exercise encourages students to reflect on their own biases instead of reflecting, you know, on silliness, like learning how to count and learning how to read. But many parents in particularly military families took issue with military kid being considered a privilege, you know, because yes, I'm sure when their grand dad's were storming Normandy, all they could think was, boy, do I have it easy. Plus, military kids move as soon as they make friends and are literally called brats. After the backlash, a spokesperson for the district apologized, instead they removed the category. You know, I bet they missed the good old days when they could call children racist, and the governor wore blackface. But no wonder schools stink when all they're taught is crap. We'll be right back.

Jesse Watters is going to be hosting \"JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME,\" starting Monday and we're looking forward to it like we look forward to scabies, I kid, but it's all part of Dana Perino's plan to gradually ease him off \"THE FIVE,\" on advice of her therapist. Unsurprisingly, the logo looks like a bunch of natty light cans after Jesse gets done smashing them on his head in a stadium parking lot. But because I'm such a kind generous person I've decided to devote this segment to giving him advice on how not to completely screw it up. If it's already not too late. Anyway, Jesse, I just hope you don't continue this tradition. I was going to say that never gets old, but that gets old. Kat, any tips for Jessie?"
