There are serious questions for Joe Biden this evening following the publication of e-mails allegedly belonging to his son Hunter that contradict or seem to the nominee's insistence the two never discussed business dealings with Ukraine. There are concerns about the authenticity and how this hard drive makes it to the FBI. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But as we look into that, two social media giants are hitting pause on the potential viral story until fact checkers weigh in and that's creating its own uproar.

She took questions today concerning whether a president could legally pardon himself and whether her involvement in the disputed election of 2000 disqualifies her to rule on a similar matter should it occur this year. But much of the inquiry had harsh political overtones. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Fox News chief legal correspondent, anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\", Shannon Bream has highlights tonight from the confirmation hearing room.

Likewise, the Hillary Clinton email scandal. No reductions!\" But this week attorneys with the Justice Department in a court filing said hold on, the declassification of information were not in order to the Department of Justice to declassify materials in this case.

There are concerns about the authenticity and how this hard drive makes it to the FBI.

But we begin with the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. She took questions today concerning whether a president could legally pardon himself and whether her involvement in the disputed election of 2000 disqualifies her to rule on a similar matter should it occur this year. But much of the inquiry had harsh political overtones. Fox News chief legal correspondent, anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\", Shannon Bream has highlights tonight from the confirmation hearing room. Good evening, Shannon."

After the tabloid disclosed e-mails indicating a meeting between Biden's father and that energy executive in Ukraine, Facebook said it would limit the stories distribution while an outside fact checker reviewed it, which is done \"If we have signals that a piece of content is false.\" Now, Twitter is resorting to outright censorship blocking its users from sharing the Post's piece, even through direct messages. The Post saying late today, the Twitter is now locked its account by arguing that the paper has violated its rules against sharing hacked material, that's a quote. Now, this will fuel criticism by President Trump and many others that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter -- excuse me, Twitter chief Jack Dorsey have acknowledged that their companies are accused of being biased against the right. Some top reporters who challenged the document obtained by Rudy Giuliani as Mike mentioned, are taking heat from the left. New York Times' Maggie Haberman said the sketchy story left unclear when Giuliani obtained the document. Politico's Jake Sherman added, yes, and how did Rudy get it? Liberal Times columnist Michelle Goldberg responded, you're really going to help Giuliani and Steve Bannon wonder this bull through the news cycle. Senator Ted Cruz today accused Twitter of an obvious and transparent attempt to influence the election and of hypocrisy for allowing shoddy or stories about other politicians. A top producer for MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell tweeted, no one should link to or share the New York Post report, but such efforts may be backfiring bringing even more attention to this story, Bret."

They do what they think is right and that means to them filling the vacancy. I think you can say the same thing about the Republicans. I think that's what our founders intended. The provisions of the constitution about vacancies on the United States Supreme Court are unaffected by the electoral Cabinet.

If President Trump wins reelection, he might be in the market for a new attorney general. That is the word on the street. Correspondent David Spunt is with us tonight from the Justice Department. Good evening, David. What are they saying about that?"

      "utterance": "Bret, good evening. Quite a story, a senior administration official tells FOX News they are defending Attorney General Bill Barr after President Trump criticized him in an interview airing on \"Newsmax\" this evening. The president said reportedly he is, quote, \"not happy\" and he has no comment when asked if he would keep Attorney General Bill Barr for a second term. I want to read this statement from this administration official to FOX News. It says, quote, \"The great irony in the president's remarks is he is only a position to complain because Bill Barr saved his presidency and everyone knows it.\" The president, upset with the Justice Department in recent weeks, put out a tweet last week, quote, \"I have fully authorized the total declassification of any and all documents pertaining to the single greatest political crime in American history, the Russia Hoax. Likewise, the Hillary Clinton email scandal. No reductions!\" But this week attorneys with the Justice Department in a court filing said hold on, the declassification of information were not in order to the Department of Justice to declassify materials in this case. I'm told they will declassify on an as-need basis. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he says he is on a mission to declassify and release some emails from his predecessor, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And Bret, he says this is not political. Listen."

      "speaker": "SPUNT",
      "utterance": "Yes, \"The Washington Post,\" Bret, reporting that this unmasking investigation is not yielding any charges, and there will be no report. This is something President Trump has talked about extensively. We first reported on this unmasking back in May. We reported that several Obama era officials at top levels requested to reveal the name or unmask someone in a report that turned out to be former national security advisor Michael Flynn. Attorney General Bill Barr farmed out the investigation into the U.S. attorney in west Texas, John Bash. Bash left the Department of Justice last week. The DOJ is declining to comment on that investigation. And Bret, more news from the Department of Justice tonight. Just a few hours ago the Senate intelligence committee released some transcripts of FBI interviews with former DOJ employee Bruce Ohr. He was involved as what was called the back channel for the Steele dossier. We are told that in those notes, Ohr let people know at DOJ, the FBI and the Hillary Clinton campaign some of the contents of that Steele dossier. And we also found out that Bruce Ohr left the department. He quit two weeks ago. Bret?"

I was told by a source it would be wrapping up by the end of summer. I said when is that going to be. They said summer ends September 21st. There was not report there. The latest we are getting from several sources over here at the Justice Department, it does not appear that this is going to come before the election. After all, as you said, the election just three weeks away. Of course, things could always change, but at this point it doesn't look like it. Bret?"

As talks between Great Britain and the European Union over a post Brexit trade agreement remain unsettled, an EU summit begins Thursday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that date as a deadline for a deal. And the first of its kind clergy sex abuse trial begins in the Vatican's Criminal Tribunal. A priest accused of molesting an altar boy, another priest accused of covering it up. The scandal is considered particularly grave because the abuse allegedly occurred within Vatican City itself. Just some of the stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back."

It is a long, sordid, and, frankly, sketchy tale about how this all comes to be. Here is the owner of that computer shop talking about how it gets to the FBI."

OK, where are we on this? We are trying to figure out the authenticity of this story, we are trying to figure out the authenticity of the emails. The Biden campaign put out a statement saying that the meeting between this Burisma official and Vice President Biden never happened according to their calendar. They didn't get into the authenticity of the emails. Charlie, what do you think about this 20 days from an election? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Well, I guess it's maybe another example of 2020. It is definitely strange. And yes, there are parts of this story that seem a little bit sketchy, but not nearly as sketchy as the idea that the son of the vice president would get $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company and not do something for them on their behalf using his connections to the White House. There are lots and lots of questions that need to be answered here, but the only wrong answer to this is to not try to get to the bottom of it. And the idea that you have social media companies wanting to censor this stuff, not only is it completely idiotic and a violation of everything that we believe in about free speech and open debate, robust debate, in an election, I also think it won't work because you're not holding back interesting, curious information like this by squelching certain Twitter or Facebook users."

Well, there were a lot of warnings given by our own government to Rudy Giuliani as well as Senator Ron Johnson, who has been investigating Burisma and Hunter Biden about their sources and about the fact that they are dealing with people who are conduits for Russian disinformation in that current campaign against Joe Biden in the 2020 election. That aside, if this were to be true, it is not a pay-to-play scandal, and it is not a heart attacks and stroke and a big pile like Senator Kennedy described because \"The New York Post\" got it wrong about Vice President Biden. He was behind an international coalition to get rid of a prosecutor general who was not investigating corruption in Ukraine, in many companies, including Burisma. Had that happened, it would have been a problem for Burisma, and therefore Hunter Biden. Part of the group supporting that coalition included Republicans like Senator Ron Johnson, and it's documented from 2016 that he was behind it. \"The New York Post\" reported that incorrectly in the piece. What you played that clip from Savannah Guthrie, what this arrangement was about was absolute influence peddling, nepotism that is completely legal and that our government permits."

He knew that his son was making money off of his name. And we just heard during the Coney Barrett hearings all the Senate Democrats say you have to recuse yourself on Obamacare and you have to recuse yourself in the election because of an appearance of a conflict of interest. What about Joe Biden? He had at least the appearance of a conflict of interest because his son was making millions of dollars from Burisma that was fighting this prosecutor. So even if he did nothing wrong, he had the appearance of a conflict of interest, and Democrats are complete hypocrites on this."
