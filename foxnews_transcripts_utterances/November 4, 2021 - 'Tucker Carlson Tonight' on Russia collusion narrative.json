They are accusing anybody who voted for him of being a tiki-torch carrying white supremacist. More on that in a minute. But first, Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee for President in mid-July of 2016. Just days later, a Russian national living in this country made a claim that would upend Donald Trump's candidacy and eventually his presidency. It's a claim that changed the course of U.S. politics for the next four years. A Russian national, a man named Igor Danchenko said he had just received a phone call proving that Donald Trump's campaign was conspiring with the Russian government. The phone call supposedly came from a U.S. citizen who was serving as President of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce. That alleged phone call became the central piece of evidence in the Steele dossier written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele. That dossier in turn was a key piece of evidence in the F.B.I.'s warrant applications to spy on the Trump Campaign. The government leaked information on those supposedly secret warrant applications to the media and the Russian collusion narrative began. In January, BuzzFeed published the Steele dossier online. BuzzFeed's editor justified publishing the document by saying the F.B.I. was supposedly taking it seriously.",

      "sentences": "Today, thanks to an indictment from U.S. Attorney John Durham, we learned the truth. It turns out that there was no late July 26 phone call to Igor Danchenko about Russian collusion. Igor Danchenko wasn't speaking to the head of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce about Donald Trump or about anything at all. Instead, according to today's indictment, the source of much of Danchenko's information was a Democratic Party operative and a former Hillary Clinton adviser. We can identify that Clinton adviser tonight. His name is Charles Dolan. In other words, Hillary Clinton's team wasn't just funding the Steele dossier, they were effectively writing it, too. Dolan by the way has extensive connections to Russia, closer connections than anybody on Donald Trump's team had from 2006 to 2014. For example, Dolan did PR work on behalf of the Russian government and a Russian energy company. According to Durham's indictment in August 2016, Danchenko told Dolan that he was working on quote, \"A project against Trump,\" unquote. Dolan responded by saying, he had just received dirt on Paul Manafort who was Donald Trump's Campaign Manager at the time from a quote, \"G.O.P. friend.\" It was all a lie. According to today's indictment, quote: \"Dolan later acknowledged to the F.B.I. that he never met with a G.O.P. friend in relation to this information that he passed to Danchenko, but rather fabricated the fact of the meeting and his communications with Danchenko. Throughout 2016, Dolan and other political operatives continued to feed Danchenko more lies about the Trump Campaign. The indictment states for example that one of Danchenko's sources believed the ex-Clinton aide would quote, \"Take me to the State Department if Hillary wins.\" Danchenko himself also lied about traveling to the Moscow Hotel in the summer of 2016, a trip where he supposedly gathered information about the infamous pee tape. Danchenko lied about all of this to the F.B.I. He never told them he was working for a former Hillary Clinton aide, so the big question is, how did Danchenko's lies and all of his bogus conversations with these sources get into the Steele dossier who connected Danchenko to Christopher Steele? Well, the indictment says that a member of the National Security Council named Fiona Hill first introduced Danchenko to Steele. If that name sounds familiar, it's because Fiona Hill was one of the Democratic Party's witnesses against Donald Trump in his first impeachment trial. Now, she has popped up again as one of the key figures behind the Steele dossier. That's either an incredible coincidence or a sign that our National Security establishment is even more corrupt than we thought it was. But it gets worse. The F.B.I. it turns out knew for years that Danchenko's sourcing was garbage. They included his claims in search warrant applications against the Trump Campaign, regardless; declassified footnotes from a D.O.J. Inspector General report revealed that the F.B.I. suspected Chris Steele's dossier was a part of an elaborate Russian disinformation campaign. One of the footnotes said the bureau, quote: \"Did not have high confidence in this subset of Steele's reporting and assessed that the reference subset was part of a Russian disinformation campaign to denigrate U.S. foreign relations.\" That subset referred to the activities of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen who Steele's dossier claimed to have traveled to Prague to meet with Russian agents. Special Counsel Robert Mueller couldn't find anything to support that claim and Cohen denied it. It was totally made up. Durham's indictment today makes it even more clear that the F.B.I. knew the dossier was a scam. According to today's indictment, June 2017, F.B.I. agents interviewed Danchenko in Virginia. Agents asked Danchenko about his contacts with the Clinton aide, Charles Dolan. Danchenko lied and said he didn't talk to Dolan. The F.B.I. agent documented at the time he knew it was a lie, but nothing happened. The F.B.I. didn't prosecute Danchenko. Robert Mueller didn't even mention any of this in his report, until today, until John Durham's indictment, no one in the government did a thing. Now Danchenko faces five Federal charges including lying to the F.B.I. to hide his conversations with Dolan. And this could just be the beginning. We're learning a lot about the collusion hoax very quickly. Weeks ago, John Durham indicted a D.N.C. lawyer named Michael Sussman for lying to the F.B.I. about a secret channel of communications between the Trump organization and a Russian bank. Durham has also secured a guilty plea from an ex-F.B.I. attorney who lied about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Now, we're learning that Hillary Clinton allies gave information to a Hillary Clinton contractor and laundered it -- all of it into the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice. More than four years after that fabricated July 26th phone call, some of these criminals are finally going to jail. Kim Strassel is a columnist with \"The Wall Street Journal\" and she joins us. It's like we've been reporting for years, but finally have it. All of the arrows, Kimberley, turn right back and point at the Clinton Campaign.",

We were told and it lasted for almost a year that we had this really credible former Russia or former British Intelligence agent who had provided credible information to the U.S. government before and out of the goodness of his heart, after he stumbled across this information on Trump and Russia collusion, he brought it to us. No. This was one of the biggest political cons in U.S. history, one that five years on, we're only starting to get the real facts about, and I'm still waiting for everyone's apology who kept it going for all those years.",

Well, it's that kind of cold inhuman calculation as a pretext for racial harmony that is extremely destructive, and the reaction to it that we've seen in this current election is by my life, is a wonderful thing.

Now there was no river of fire for me, okay, but I was isolated and ice cold air blowing on me 24 hours a day. I couldn't stop shivering from the whole time I was in there, and part of the thing about being in solitary confinement is, it's supposed to be punishment. Well, what the heck had I done? I hadn't even been to trial for anything, but I was put in what amounts to a super max with the most hardened criminals that they had in that particular facility. But there was really -- it was kind of a situation where you were off kilter. You didn't know if it was day or night. You didn't know what time it was. Now this prison that I was put in, this is not a happy little prison like on \"Andy of Mayberry\" where Otis the drunk would come in, let himself into the cell, sleep it off. Aunt Bee brings him breakfast in the morning and he goes home. No, this was a concrete box. It was -- it was a coffin. I was in a concrete coffin with a huge steel door and I was absolutely alone. What hell is, is isolation, and it is hopelessness and you know, sometimes, it's definitely quiet in hell. But sometimes it's very, very loud. There is life in a manner of speaking going on around you, but you don't have any interface with people and people are herd animals.

This is terrible. This is terrible stuff. And don't think for a minute that people who are locked up in that hell don't think about those things. I shared with Sharon the other day, one of the other things about this hell that I was in, is you think about the anguish of the other people that are in the same situation that you are in, and in the middle of the night or the middle of the day, you could hear screams -- screams echoing down the passageway of people that were either hurt or they were in anguish or something and it was -- it was actually absolutely, absolutely horrible.",

They are accusing anybody who voted for him of being a tiki-torch carrying white supremacist. More on that in a minute. But first, Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee for President in mid-July of 2016. Just days later, a Russian national living in this country made a claim that would upend Donald Trump's candidacy and eventually his presidency. It's a claim that changed the course of U.S. politics for the next four years. A Russian national, a man named Igor Danchenko said he had just received a phone call proving that Donald Trump's campaign was conspiring with the Russian government. The phone call supposedly came from a U.S. citizen who was serving as President of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce. That alleged phone call became the central piece of evidence in the Steele dossier written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele. That dossier in turn was a key piece of evidence in the F.B.I.'s warrant applications to spy on the Trump Campaign. The government leaked information on those supposedly secret warrant applications to the media and the Russian collusion narrative began. In January, BuzzFeed published the Steele dossier online. BuzzFeed's editor justified publishing the document by saying the F.B.I. was supposedly taking it seriously."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Today, thanks to an indictment from U.S. Attorney John Durham, we learned the truth. It turns out that there was no late July 26 phone call to Igor Danchenko about Russian collusion. Igor Danchenko wasn't speaking to the head of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce about Donald Trump or about anything at all. Instead, according to today's indictment, the source of much of Danchenko's information was a Democratic Party operative and a former Hillary Clinton adviser. We can identify that Clinton adviser tonight. His name is Charles Dolan. In other words, Hillary Clinton's team wasn't just funding the Steele dossier, they were effectively writing it, too. Dolan by the way has extensive connections to Russia, closer connections than anybody on Donald Trump's team had from 2006 to 2014. For example, Dolan did PR work on behalf of the Russian government and a Russian energy company. According to Durham's indictment in August 2016, Danchenko told Dolan that he was working on quote, \"A project against Trump,\" unquote. Dolan responded by saying, he had just received dirt on Paul Manafort who was Donald Trump's Campaign Manager at the time from a quote, \"G.O.P. friend.\" It was all a lie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "According to today's indictment, quote",
      "utterance": "\"Dolan later acknowledged to the F.B.I. that he never met with a G.O.P. friend in relation to this information that he passed to Danchenko, but rather fabricated the fact of the meeting and his communications with Danchenko. Throughout 2016, Dolan and other political operatives continued to feed Danchenko more lies about the Trump Campaign. The indictment states for example that one of Danchenko's sources believed the ex-Clinton aide would quote, \"Take me to the State Department if Hillary wins.\" Danchenko himself also lied about traveling to the Moscow Hotel in the summer of 2016, a trip where he supposedly gathered information about the infamous pee tape. Danchenko lied about all of this to the F.B.I. He never told them he was working for a former Hillary Clinton aide, so the big question is, how did Danchenko's lies and all of his bogus conversations with these sources get into the Steele dossier who connected Danchenko to Christopher Steele? Well, the indictment says that a member of the National Security Council named Fiona Hill first introduced Danchenko to Steele. If that name sounds familiar, it's because Fiona Hill was one of the Democratic Party's witnesses against Donald Trump in his first impeachment trial. Now, she has popped up again as one of the key figures behind the Steele dossier. That's either an incredible coincidence or a sign that our National Security establishment is even more corrupt than we thought it was. But it gets worse. The F.B.I. it turns out knew for years that Danchenko's sourcing was garbage. They included his claims in search warrant applications against the Trump Campaign, regardless; declassified footnotes from a D.O.J. Inspector General report revealed that the F.B.I. suspected Chris Steele's dossier was a part of an elaborate Russian disinformation campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "One of the footnotes said the bureau, quote",
      "utterance": "\"Did not have high confidence in this subset of Steele's reporting and assessed that the reference subset was part of a Russian disinformation campaign to denigrate U.S. foreign relations.\" That subset referred to the activities of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen who Steele's dossier claimed to have traveled to Prague to meet with Russian agents. Special Counsel Robert Mueller couldn't find anything to support that claim and Cohen denied it. It was totally made up. Durham's indictment today makes it even more clear that the F.B.I. knew the dossier was a scam. According to today's indictment, June 2017, F.B.I. agents interviewed Danchenko in Virginia. Agents asked Danchenko about his contacts with the Clinton aide, Charles Dolan. Danchenko lied and said he didn't talk to Dolan. The F.B.I. agent documented at the time he knew it was a lie, but nothing happened. The F.B.I. didn't prosecute Danchenko. Robert Mueller didn't even mention any of this in his report, until today, until John Durham's indictment, no one in the government did a thing. Now Danchenko faces five Federal charges including lying to the F.B.I. to hide his conversations with Dolan. And this could just be the beginning. We're learning a lot about the collusion hoax very quickly. Weeks ago, John Durham indicted a D.N.C. lawyer named Michael Sussman for lying to the F.B.I. about a secret channel of communications between the Trump organization and a Russian bank. Durham has also secured a guilty plea from an ex-F.B.I. attorney who lied about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Now, we're learning that Hillary Clinton allies gave information to a Hillary Clinton contractor and laundered it -- all of it into the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice. More than four years after that fabricated July 26th phone call, some of these criminals are finally going to jail. Kim Strassel is a columnist with \"The Wall Street Journal\" and she joins us. It's like we've been reporting for years, but finally have it. All of the arrows, Kimberley, turn right back and point at the Clinton Campaign."

We were told and it lasted for almost a year that we had this really credible former Russia or former British Intelligence agent who had provided credible information to the U.S. government before and out of the goodness of his heart, after he stumbled across this information on Trump and Russia collusion, he brought it to us. No. This was one of the biggest political cons in U.S. history, one that five years on, we're only starting to get the real facts about, and I'm still waiting for everyone's apology who kept it going for all those years."

He seems to want to get this information out. He is building a story so that people can understand what really happened, but he has left out there in a long trail of people that he could potentially go after and bring into this, and we'll have to just see where it goes next."

We needed to change that. We needed to go in, disregard their rights, and cut that down to 50 percent. Well, it's that kind of cold inhuman calculation as a pretext for racial harmony that is extremely destructive, and the reaction to it that we've seen in this current election is by my life, is a wonderful thing.

    {
      "speaker": "KINNETT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. There is this very clever trick that a lot of administrators will pull. In education, there are two things that consist of learning. We have curriculum, which is what the students are learning, and then we have pedagogy, which is how it's taught. So we can officially tell parents, we are not teaching critical race theory. It's not in the Indiana academic standards, but all of a sudden, the classroom door shuts and the teacher starts teaching through a lens of this race essentialism that pits students against each other based on their color."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So give some advice to parents out there, perhaps they don't know if CRT is in the school that their kids are going to. How would they go about discovering it and if it is infected in the school district there where they live, what's their next step?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KINNETT",
      "utterance": "Well, the first thing you should really be doing is talking to your kid's teachers. So many of my parents had great conversations with me weekly on what was going on not just inside my classroom, but inside the school. There is this very interesting myth by the left that all of the teachers are on the left and the right believes it. A lot of teachers really just want to go in and teach and they are happy to have discussions with parents. However, if you find that a teacher is being uncooperative, they are teaching things that really shouldn't be taught in a classroom, they are treating your kid different based on a color, you have a responsibility to go to the principal, then to the superintendent. And if that doesn't work, you really should look into electing a much better School Board that's going to serve your community based on merit, not on color."

      "utterance": "Oh it's horrific. You get into high school courses where a teacher will open things up for discussion and we see this in English classes a lot. They'll talk about a piece of poetry, they'll talk about something that a writer has brought to bear, and then the teacher will portray it through a societal lens like critical race theory and then provide this Orwellian two minutes of hate and the students will be expected to talk about things in the essay or in cases in like Manhattan, students will be expected to say things from home that were brought up in a very racist way and all of the students are expected to participate in this, to chip in a little bit of progressive ideology. And it gets really sketchy really quickly for a kid that doesn't buy into the rest of the stuff."

      "utterance": "I certainly hope that nobody ever has to go through that, but I tell people that I went to hell. It was hell. Now, if you ask somebody, Tucker, what is hell? And people will say, well, there's fire and there's this and there's that. Okay, I get that. Here is what hell really is, okay. Hell is isolation. Now there was no river of fire for me, okay, but I was isolated and ice cold air blowing on me 24 hours a day. I couldn't stop shivering from the whole time I was in there, and part of the thing about being in solitary confinement is, it's supposed to be punishment. Well, what the heck had I done? I hadn't even been to trial for anything, but I was put in what amounts to a super max with the most hardened criminals that they had in that particular facility. But there was really -- it was kind of a situation where you were off kilter. You didn't know if it was day or night. You didn't know what time it was. Now this prison that I was put in, this is not a happy little prison like on \"Andy of Mayberry\" where Otis the drunk would come in, let himself into the cell, sleep it off. Aunt Bee brings him breakfast in the morning and he goes home. No, this was a concrete box. It was -- it was a coffin. I was in a concrete coffin with a huge steel door and I was absolutely alone. What hell is, is isolation, and it is hopelessness and you know, sometimes, it's definitely quiet in hell. But sometimes it's very, very loud. There is life in a manner of speaking going on around you, but you don't have any interface with people and people are herd animals. And so one of the things that you want to do is you want to be around people. One of the problems with this COVID lockdown is people get tremendous anxiety when they're separated from their family and everything that they know, and we know that people commit suicide and this and the other thing. This is terrible. This is terrible stuff. And don't think for a minute that people who are locked up in that hell don't think about those things. I shared with Sharon the other day, one of the other things about this hell that I was in, is you think about the anguish of the other people that are in the same situation that you are in, and in the middle of the night or the middle of the day, you could hear screams -- screams echoing down the passageway of people that were either hurt or they were in anguish or something and it was -- it was actually absolutely, absolutely horrible."

MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": You would think so. I mean, there is no better illustration of the fact that we have a barely sentient figurehead in office than this and look, he doesn't even have a head, it's really just a figure -- a figurehead without the head. I mean, we talk about -- we hear so much about this and that as being an attack on democracy and you know, the right somehow is undermining our institutions. Well, how about the fact that you know, we don't actually know who is running the country, and the guy that we have in office, there could be a plan like this, this significant and this harmful. He says it is garbage and he is right about that, it is a garbage plan -- that he doesn't even know about. I would think that that is a pretty significant attack on our institution."

Another way of putting it into perspective is that the Biden administration just announced that starting on January 4th, they are going to start charging businesses $140,000.00 a pop per violation for employees who aren't vaccinated. So they're going to start taking money from American businesses and American families and putting businesses out of business destroying businesses left and right, while they're handing $450,000.00 to illegals. By the way, is there going to be a litmus test to make sure they're vaccinated at least before they get these payments? Something tells me, probably not."

I've got some more numbers here. This is unbelievable. The kind of money that we're talking about for this reparations for illegals program this could put 78,000 homeless people in a home for an entire year."

The fact that this is going to obviously encourage more -- I can't think of a plan that would more directly encourage illegals to come. You come across, you get $450,000.00.

And as you say, it could have reduced hospitalization and death by, you know up to 50 percent.

And so, Dr. Bright, would have to take primary responsibility for what happened here, unfortunately, and you know, you look -- it is at least a misjudgment because you see that Merck and Ridgeback, those two companies, just a couple of months later decided to fund this drug out of their own money, and it is successful now in the U.K. and probably on the brink of authorization here in the United States. So at the very least, that was an error in judgment. That's bad enough, but if you look beyond that, you know hopefully we're not seeing here an example of politicized science where, you know someone for political reasons decides to take sort of a jab at a particular project.
