      "sentences": "The beauty of the American system is that if you think your state is run by corrupt morons who are making your life worse, you have a choice. You can get in the car and move to another state that is not run by corrupt morons who derive pleasure from tormenting you. So not surprisingly, an awful lot of people have moved to Florida recently. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As a result of that -- that voting by foot -- Governor Ron DeSantis has now become perhaps the single biggest threat to the Biden administration and its moral authority. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The White House has noticed this and they're worried.

We'll speak to Ron DeSantis about that in just a minute. But first, good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In the fall of 1998, Susan Wojcicki had just turned 30 years old and was working at the marketing department of some big company in the Bay Area. Wojcicki was hardly a failure, she had a college degree, and a job. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine that anyone who knew her at the time thought she was going to become rich and powerful someday. But things change fast. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In one of those amazing windfalls of good fortune they used to write movies about, Wojcicki rendered her garage to the two guys who founded Google and voila, 23 years later, she is worth more than half a billion dollars and runs YouTube, the largest digital platform in the world. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We tell you this not to attack Susan Wojcicki's life story. Good luck is a great thing, but simply to remind you that many of the people now in charge of your life have no relevant qualifications to justify the power they now hold. They just fell into it as people do. What's infuriating is that they won't admit this. They pretend that the control they wield is part of the natural order of things somehow, that they deserve it -- that they are God. Most of them forget that not so long ago, they worked in the marketing department. Here is Susan Wojcicki announcing that she plans to censor any information about COVID that she doesn't like even if that information has been posted by physicians who are treating COVID. Watch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

True. She is from the marketing department.

Rand Paul was not just guessing about this, the science is very clear. No honest person will deny that, but Susan Wojcicki doesn't think you should know that because that will make you harder to control, so she pulled Rand Paul's video from YouTube. Here's part of what she tried to censor. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It was true, it was provably true, people know what they're talking about it, agree with it, including the people in charge of our COVID response. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it was censored anyway, and the fact that YouTube did censor it anyway is a scandal. It's one of many such scandals playing out in our country right now. Now, you'd think the media might be on this story, you'd imagine that people who make their living on the First Amendment would defend it and lead the charge against censorship, but no, just the opposite in this bewildering time. Those people encourage censorship. They're out there in public begging the tech companies to suppress news and information, to make certain the public never sees it. Doing that makes them feel powerful and protects their monopoly, so now they're attacking Rand Paul. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We've gone on and on and on, you're not shocked. You see this sort of thing so often you can't be shocked by it anymore. But some perspective, three years ago, this was a free country. Now, it feels like everything that we hear has been written by a committee at the propaganda ministry downtown. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What's the long-term effect? Pretty soon, no one is going to believe anything ever again and that shouldn't shock you because censorship is always counterproductive. It doesn't work. People know they are being lied to, so they tune it out. The role of the vaccines for example earlier this year was so heavy-handed, so Soviet that you've got to wonder how many people it scared away. We would definitely have a higher vaccination rate if they just treated us like adults, but they can't, because they don't think we're adults. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Obviously, this can't continue. You cannot have a self-governing country in which people aren't allowed to read what they want. A Free Press is not an optional feature of a democracy, it's the center of democracy. That's obvious. It's written down in our founding documents, it's always been obvious. So for years now, we have been waiting for the big legacy media outlets -- NBC News, CNN, \"The New York Times\" -- to wake up and recall that they must oppose censorship. It's their duty, it's why they exist. So, as much as we criticize them, we've assumed at some point they'll recall that, but no, that's not going to happen. Let's be honest. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They are not going to oppose censorship, they benefit from it. So what's our option? The rest of us living in this country who don't have another passport, who are going to stay here? We have to replace them. We need something new. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Glenn Greenwald has been working on that for quite some time. He spent the last couple of months gathering a group of free thinkers and planning a move to an alternative video platform called Rumble. At Rumble, free speech is the whole point, they don't have censorship. You can say what you want like you lived in America. So naturally, the totalitarians are infuriated by this idea to challenge their hegemony. YouTube, Susan Wojcicki from the marketing department has pulled down at least one video promoting Rumble. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Jeff Bezos's newspaper attacked it today, that means \"The New York Times\" will soon be on it along with \"The Atlantic\" and \"The Daily Beast\" and all the rest of the Praetorian Guard. Your job, ignore it. You know they are liars, they are frantically defending a system that no one believes in anymore. If there is going to be a renaissance in journalism and we desperately need one, it will be led not by them, but by people like Glenn Greenwald who joins us now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. I'm not even going to ask you any questions. Everyone watching this understands no matter who you voted for, no matter what you believe, we have to have a Free Press in a democracy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Period. We no longer do. You are doing something about this and I'm just going to stand back and let you describe what that is. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

YouTube has gotten insane. Remember, YouTube is owned by Google, which is a huge video platform that now exercises immense power over our political discourse and is increasingly refusing to allow any dissent, not just crazy dissent, but even informed dissent, to official decree. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, the only thing that can be heard are official decrees, Rumble, a site that I didn't know much about was actually founded by a Canadian liberal in 2013. It is not a MAGA site, it wasn't funded by a right-wing ideologue. It was funded by somebody who started a website and he said, you know what? I don't think I'm actually qualified to make judgments about complex scientific judgments in the middle of a pandemic or even questions like whether there was fraud in an election. I'm an entrepreneur. I started a technology company, why should I have the responsibility to dictate to everybody else what they can and can't say as though I'm vested with some special competence that as you pointed out, that YouTube person convinced herself somehow she actually wields presumably because people around her tell her that. So, it's one thing to denounce this censorship and to warn about it as I've done many times on your show and as you and others have done, but to do something about it, we need to support the platforms that actually are fighting against it and working to create a space on the internet where free discourse can happen.",

They may be great people, but they are coming here in a way that we should be ashamed of. And by the way, tens of thousands of those illegal aliens we learned today have COVID. That's not a big deal now? Many of them committed serious crimes, including rape and murder. Drug traffickers meanwhile are moving huge amounts of fentanyl, unprecedented amounts of fentanyl, over the border into this country. Oh fentanyl, not a big deal.

So they made sure the President, the Commander-in-Chief could not pull us out of Afghanistan, but now here is Joe Biden who claims he is going to pull us out of Afghanistan, now why is he -- first of all, as soon as he announced it, he started ramping up the bombing? I don't know if you know that. He started -- he bombed Shaheed Anwar Khan High School and a health clinic that killed 20 people, a lot of them women and children. So he is ramping up the bombings as he is saying, we're pulling out, and I don't know what that is if that's dementia or what, but that's the guy who is ordering the strikes that's happening right now. So, let's just remember that they increased the military budget. So, why is Joe Biden being allowed to pull out of Afghanistan? Well because he's agreed to start bombing in Somalia. I don't know if you know that's happening. Joe Biden is now bombing the poorest people in Africa, half the country are no more -- like 40 percent of the country are nomads, and Joe Biden is now bombing Somalia.

You can get in the car and move to another state that is not run by corrupt morons who derive pleasure from tormenting you. So not surprisingly, an awful lot of people have moved to Florida recently. As a result of that -- that voting by foot -- Governor Ron DeSantis has now become perhaps the single biggest threat to the Biden administration and its moral authority. The White House has noticed this and they're worried. How worried are they? Well, the C.D.C. was just caught fabricating numbers to discredit the State of Florida and its Governor. We'll speak to Ron DeSantis about that in just a minute. But first, good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. In the fall of 1998, Susan Wojcicki had just turned 30 years old and was working at the marketing department of some big company in the Bay Area. Wojcicki was hardly a failure, she had a college degree, and a job. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine that anyone who knew her at the time thought she was going to become rich and powerful someday. But things change fast. In one of those amazing windfalls of good fortune they used to write movies about, Wojcicki rendered her garage to the two guys who founded Google and voila, 23 years later, she is worth more than half a billion dollars and runs YouTube, the largest digital platform in the world. We tell you this not to attack Susan Wojcicki's life story. Good luck is a great thing, but simply to remind you that many of the people now in charge of your life have no relevant qualifications to justify the power they now hold. They just fell into it as people do. What's infuriating is that they won't admit this. They pretend that the control they wield is part of the natural order of things somehow, that they deserve it -- that they are God. Most of them forget that not so long ago, they worked in the marketing department. Here is Susan Wojcicki announcing that she plans to censor any information about COVID that she doesn't like even if that information has been posted by physicians who are treating COVID. Watch."

To restate, Susan Wojcicki has no medical background at all. She is not a doctor. She is not a researcher. She is hardly an eminent epidemiologist. In fact, Susan Wojcicki's main contribution to science is drawing the doodles that appear on Google's homepage. True. She is from the marketing department. In no sane country would Susan Wojcicki be in charge of determining what constitutes quote, \"problematic medical disinformation,\" and she certainly in a sane country would not be allowed to silence physicians who are treating the virus. But because of the way our system is structured, Wojcicki is certainly allowed to do that, and so she is. This week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky who by the way is an actual doctor, not just some guy who rented his garage to Larry Page in the 90s tried to make an obvious point and it's this -- the masks that you buy at the airport in order to comply with the Federal law will not keep you from getting COVID. Rand Paul was not just guessing about this, the science is very clear. No honest person will deny that, but Susan Wojcicki doesn't think you should know that because that will make you harder to control, so she pulled Rand Paul's video from YouTube. Here's part of what she tried to censor."

And in fact, if you're in the upper Midwest right now, anybody who is wearing their face cloth covering can tell you, they can smell all the smoke that we're still getting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right. If you can smell the smoke, you can get COVID. Got it. The point is, there was nothing kooky or inaccurate about Rand Paul's video on masks. It was true, it was provably true, people know what they're talking about it, agree with it, including the people in charge of our COVID response. But it was censored anyway, and the fact that YouTube did censor it anyway is a scandal. It's one of many such scandals playing out in our country right now. Now, you'd think the media might be on this story, you'd imagine that people who make their living on the First Amendment would defend it and lead the charge against censorship, but no, just the opposite in this bewildering time. Those people encourage censorship. They're out there in public begging the tech companies to suppress news and information, to make certain the public never sees it. Doing that makes them feel powerful and protects their monopoly, so now they're attacking Rand Paul. We've gone on and on and on, you're not shocked. You see this sort of thing so often you can't be shocked by it anymore. But some perspective, three years ago, this was a free country. Now, it feels like everything that we hear has been written by a committee at the propaganda ministry downtown. What's the long-term effect? Pretty soon, no one is going to believe anything ever again and that shouldn't shock you because censorship is always counterproductive. It doesn't work. People know they are being lied to, so they tune it out. The role of the vaccines for example earlier this year was so heavy-handed, so Soviet that you've got to wonder how many people it scared away. We would definitely have a higher vaccination rate if they just treated us like adults, but they can't, because they don't think we're adults. Obviously, this can't continue. You cannot have a self-governing country in which people aren't allowed to read what they want. A Free Press is not an optional feature of a democracy, it's the center of democracy. That's obvious. It's written down in our founding documents, it's always been obvious. So for years now, we have been waiting for the big legacy media outlets -- NBC News, CNN, \"The New York Times\" -- to wake up and recall that they must oppose censorship. It's their duty, it's why they exist. So, as much as we criticize them, we've assumed at some point they'll recall that, but no, that's not going to happen. Let's be honest. They are not going to oppose censorship, they benefit from it. So what's our option? The rest of us living in this country who don't have another passport, who are going to stay here? We have to replace them. We need something new. Glenn Greenwald has been working on that for quite some time. He spent the last couple of months gathering a group of free thinkers and planning a move to an alternative video platform called Rumble. At Rumble, free speech is the whole point, they don't have censorship. You can say what you want like you lived in America. So naturally, the totalitarians are infuriated by this idea to challenge their hegemony. YouTube, Susan Wojcicki from the marketing department has pulled down at least one video promoting Rumble. Jeff Bezos's newspaper attacked it today, that means \"The New York Times\" will soon be on it along with \"The Atlantic\" and \"The Daily Beast\" and all the rest of the Praetorian Guard. Your job, ignore it. You know they are liars, they are frantically defending a system that no one believes in anymore. If there is going to be a renaissance in journalism and we desperately need one, it will be led not by them, but by people like Glenn Greenwald who joins us now. Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. I'm not even going to ask you any questions. Everyone watching this understands no matter who you voted for, no matter what you believe, we have to have a Free Press in a democracy. Period. We no longer do. You are doing something about this and I'm just going to stand back and let you describe what that is."

And it gets worse and worse and worse, the censorship grows and grows and grows. So, I think you know, one of the things obviously in the last nine months being on \"Substack\" which is a platform designed to allow journalists the freedom to write, Rumble is in a sense the kind of video version of that. It looked at what YouTube was doing. YouTube has gotten insane. Remember, YouTube is owned by Google, which is a huge video platform that now exercises immense power over our political discourse and is increasingly refusing to allow any dissent, not just crazy dissent, but even informed dissent, to official decree. So, the only thing that can be heard are official decrees, Rumble, a site that I didn't know much about was actually founded by a Canadian liberal in 2013. It is not a MAGA site, it wasn't funded by a right-wing ideologue. It was funded by somebody who started a website and he said, you know what? I don't think I'm actually qualified to make judgments about complex scientific judgments in the middle of a pandemic or even questions like whether there was fraud in an election. I'm an entrepreneur. I started a technology company, why should I have the responsibility to dictate to everybody else what they can and can't say as though I'm vested with some special competence that as you pointed out, that YouTube person convinced herself somehow she actually wields presumably because people around her tell her that. So, it's one thing to denounce this censorship and to warn about it as I've done many times on your show and as you and others have done, but to do something about it, we need to support the platforms that actually are fighting against it and working to create a space on the internet where free discourse can happen."

You can find me on there or her on there, lots of conservatives, lots of leftists, people who believe in free speech are there, and I really encourage people who believe in this cause to support it and \"Substack\" as well.

Earlier this month, the C.D.C. claimed that 28,000 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in Florida on a single day, and that sounded pretty scary, but it turned out not to be true. Health officials in Florida proved the actual number is 30 percent lower than that. Oh, so how did the C.D.C. get that number wrong? That is an interesting question. Now, part of the answer may be Ron DeSantis runs the State of Florida. DeSantis, one of 50 governors, but gotten more publicity than any other over the past year because again people are moving to his state. So, in Washington, they looked down at Florida and think, oh, there's a potential challenge for the White House, and they get the C.D.C. involved to make up numbers. That looks like what happened. Ron DeSantis joins us now with his view of what happened. Governor, thanks so much for coming on. So, the C.D.C. is what we, in the business call the gold standard for medical data.

We were the only big state to have it all year for all the parents, and it was a success. We know now about masks or no masks. You know how we know? Because there's a lot of schools throughout the United States and Europe that didn't have mask, including in Florida. We had some districts that had them last year, some districts that didn't, and there's no statistical difference in results from COVID as a result of this. And so our view is, you shouldn't have government forcing kindergartners to wear masks for eight hours a day. That should be a decision for the parent, and so parents in Florida have the ability to make that choice. Joe Biden and the White House, they think the Federal government should force masks on kindergartners for eight hours a day when they admit they do not know the long-term consequences of doing so."

Secretary -- air quotes around that -- had a press conference today and if you watched it, you'll know that the Biden administration is no longer denying that they have opened the border to the world. The data are clear, they can't deny it. U.S. Border Patrol observed more than 200,000 illegal immigrants crossing the southern border last month alone. That is five times the number of illegal aliens seen at the border in July of last year, and again, those are just the migrants the Border Patrol saw. So by the end of this year, we're on pace to import at least two million foreign nationals illegally into this country from all over the world, people who are not invited, who violated our law, who made a mockery of our system, who are giving us the finger. They may be great people, but they are coming here in a way that we should be ashamed of. And by the way, tens of thousands of those illegal aliens we learned today have COVID. That's not a big deal now? Many of them committed serious crimes, including rape and murder. Drug traffickers meanwhile are moving huge amounts of fentanyl, unprecedented amounts of fentanyl, over the border into this country. Oh fentanyl, not a big deal. The drug that has changed the demographics of the United States? That has devastated rural America? Check out the new census data on this. It's like chemical warfare against the country's rural population, happening in real time, but no one seems to notice. In fact, some people approve of it openly. So, you've got to wonder what the people sent to Washington to represent us really worry about, if not that. What scares them? It's not the flooding of America with opioids, it's not hundreds of thousands of criminals coming into our country. No. None of that bothers them. You know what bothers them? Well, listen to Eric Swalwell. It turns out the thing that scares Eric Swalwell is not Americans dying from opioid ODs or criminals killing them, it's not even the Chinese spies he sleeps with the STDs he may have, no. The real threat says Eric Swalwell is unarmed women who don't share his politics. Anyone who shoots these women in the throat is a hero."

This is crazy. You don't have to agree with what Ashli Babbitt did, you can like us, disapprove of it, but let's be real, she didn't kill anybody. She didn't have a weapon, she was not a jihadist. She was just mad because she thought the election was stolen. In that respect, actually, that was very different from another recent subject of MSNBC's fixation, a career criminal called Jacob Blake. Now, Jacob Blake you remember actually fought with a cop and then reached for his knife while resisting arrest, but no one on television suggested that he was a domestic terrorist, we didn't, because he wasn't. He was some guy resisting arrest with a knife. No one ever shamed the politicians who talked to his family. When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris personally consoled his relatives and canonized him as a Civil Rights hero, in fact MSNBC applauded, and they applauded violence for a year around the country. Now, they're telling us that Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by some unnamed Capitol Hill policeman is a domestic terrorist and the Republicans on the Hill who are cowards are telling us that guy is a hero. Why? Because they were afraid. Meanwhile, drug traffickers, murderers, millions of foreign nationals whose names we don't know using fake IDs, some infected with COVID, they're totally cool. They're not Ashli Babbitt, they don't deserve to die. This is too crazy, we need to pull back. We showed you last night footage of a teacher who resigned in front of her School Board this week.

Jimmy Dore is the host of \"The Jimmy Dore Show.\" He joins us. Thank you, Jimmy Dore for coming on tonight. You've got to wonder, 20 years of training the Afghan Military by The Pentagon, you know what did they do with all that time and all that money? JIMMY DORE, HOST, \"THE JIMMY DORE SHOW\": Well, you know it's kind of interesting. I mean if we -- just imagine if we weren't in Afghanistan for the last 20 years, the Middle East might be unstable. So I mean, you remember Trump tried to pull -- Trump tried to pull us out. By the way, this war is bipartisan, right? As all wars are, they are very bipartisan right now. The military industrial complex has a stranglehold on both parties, so Trump was trying to pull us out of this war because it turns out, you can't just invade other people's countries, set up a Starbucks and a McDonald's and think they're going to be just like us. They're not just like us."

      "utterance": "We've had fathers and sons and pretty soon, we're going to have grandsons fighting in Afghanistan, so it's a nice way for Americans to make multigenerational memories, I guess. But what happened when Trump tried to pull out, if you remember Congressman Crowley and Cheney -- Liz Cheney got together bipartisan, and they put a stop, and they said Trump wouldn't be able to pull out unless he met these certain criteria, which we'll never meet. So they made sure the President, the Commander-in-Chief could not pull us out of Afghanistan, but now here is Joe Biden who claims he is going to pull us out of Afghanistan, now why is he -- first of all, as soon as he announced it, he started ramping up the bombing? I don't know if you know that. He started -- he bombed Shaheed Anwar Khan High School and a health clinic that killed 20 people, a lot of them women and children. So he is ramping up the bombings as he is saying, we're pulling out, and I don't know what that is if that's dementia or what, but that's the guy who is ordering the strikes that's happening right now. So, let's just remember that they increased the military budget. So, why is Joe Biden being allowed to pull out of Afghanistan? Well because he's agreed to start bombing in Somalia. I don't know if you know that's happening. Joe Biden is now bombing the poorest people in Africa, half the country are no more -- like 40 percent of the country are nomads, and Joe Biden is now bombing Somalia. So that -- right now -- and he's occupying a third of Syria right now. So this never gets talked about, right? This never gets talked about, so he is just switching his imperialism. And I really appreciate you giving me a chance to come on and talk about this because they'll never talk and stand up against imperialism at CNN or MSNBC or anywhere else, so I just want to say thanks for that."

      "utterance": "What we need right now is a real anti-war movement to rise up in America to stop these wars. They gave Joe Biden an extra $25 billion to do war. I thought we were getting out of Afghanistan? Why does he even need an extra $25 billion? And let's remember how much $25 billion is. $20 billion they say could end homelessness. So, we just don't have the political -- where every pothole -- those $25 billion worth of bombs made in another country is a pothole that's not getting fixed in America. We can bomb every borough, but we can't feed our own people. I live in a democratically controlled state that's got a Democratic governor and we've got people living under every bridge in California. How about we start spending some of that money back here at home?"
