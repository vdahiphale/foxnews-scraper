We're going to talk to John Solomon for part two of a huge story he just broke on Hannity on a possible conflict of interests by Special Counsel Bob Mueller. Meanwhile amid protest from Palestinians, there's gratitude in Israel as the U.S. opens its embassy in Jerusalem. Picture Davis Hanson and Mike Huckabee, he was there, are here to put it all in perspective. Also, President Trump wasn't elected to make China great again. What's going on with that? So, why is he suddenly trying to save Chinese jobs? Let's ask Marco Rubio about that coming up. And commencement speakers say the most darned thing. You got to hear these attempts that words for the ages. But first, results versus resistance. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Today, the world watched as Donald Trump made good on this promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

I mean, look, if the old guard, the so-called wise men of diplomacy knew so much, such smart guys, why are we still struggling in2018 to bring peace to the region? You had your shot and it didn't work. Let's face it. Now, it's Trump's turn. So, what the critics failed to acknowledge is that President Trump is engaged in an international strategy that is already paying some dividends. He's remaking alliances in the Middle East and taking the old bargaining chips off the table. He's changing the old and frankly the stale dynamic that was in place. Trump is reordering the status quo and he's forcing our international partners into new ways of thinking and acting even if it seems uncomfortable. Say what you want and a lot of you do about the President's approach. But he has reinvigorated the prospects of peace in places we never would have thought change would ever happen and he's created new possibilities. Now, who would have thought? Only a year ago that North Korea would be willing to melt down its nuclear testing facilities or even come to the negotiating table, no one thought that except maybe President Trump himself. At home, the economy is booming and the President is demonstrating that bold, innovative leadership can get real results abroad and at home. Now, he's appointing topnotch legal minds to the federal bench. We know that. He's untangling regulations that choke, stifle American businesses large and small. And now, he's even tackling prescription drug prices. He did that last week and he's going to be working on that. So, even as the media are loath to cover any of this at least fairly, the public I think gets it. So, Trump's numbers are climbing. But the only group of course that hasn't gotten the memo is the resistance media and their pals in politics. They consistently ignore the President's achievements while grasping at any straw to assail him. Well, today's straw was a side comment made last week by a White House aide during a private meeting about ailing Senator John McCain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "I'm sorry. I had to be awakened from that montage. Come on. This staffer called McCain's family and personally apologized. Of course, they want a public apology for what was a private, leaked comment. And I was thinking about this, this afternoon. Can you imagine what team Obama said about Trump and his staff, his team, or any of his supporters behind closed doors? I shudder to think what they said. Come on. You know what this is really all about, trying to revive the President's comments about McCain made during the campaign, about the being a POW which were unfortunate comments. But to do that in an effort to somehow hurt Trump now -- now, it didn't work then and I don't think it will work now. While the media and their friends in politics obsess about thoughtless comments and nonessentials, few members of the media seem interested in doing their actual jobs, pursuing the stories that actually touch and affect our lives. What about holding our institutions accountable, accountable to the people that pay the bills? Why are the media so incurious about the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton and Comey's decision not to indict her? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What about the reports of partisanship in the FBI, possible corruption within the Mueller probe or the reporting on Devin Nunes' attempts to get the Justice Department to hand over documents explaining how the FBI's Russian collusion probe started and who actually started it. I mean, Nunes had to threaten Rod Rosenstein with impeachment basically to get a response and he still hasn't seen all the documents in question. Now, isn't that worth investigating? Put Trump aside and what you think about Trump aside. The Justice Department and the FBI stonewalling those with actual oversight responsibilities or have porn stars and Russian collusion conspiracy theories sapped all the media's manpower and all of their energy resources? If the press, think about this, spent just a little bit of time covering some of those stories, well, maybe more Americans might listen when they reported critically on the President. But so long as the press is just a wing of the resistance, their audience will scatter. It will dwindle and soon, most of Americas will just tune them out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, I think go ahead and cover criticism of the President, but once in a while, just try balancing out with some honest coverage of some of the groundbreaking successes and the real achievements. We all need the press to hold everyone accountable, Trump surely, but also the other sectors of government as well, including the FBI, and that's the Angle. In the last hour, you heard The Hill's John Solomon tell us about Special Counsel Bob Mueller's possible conflict of interest due to his ties to a Russian oligarch. John is now here with an even newer breaking series of developments that were just posted moments ago on The Hill. Nobody sorted this before. It's stunning stuff. John, what else should we know? I mean, I read through your piece about half an hour ago when it was posted. Now, we find out that in September of 2016...",

The facts are ridiculous. The intent is ridiculous. That's absurd\" and the FBI basically said \"Keep an open mind\". That's wild. Robyn, I want to go to you.

He's concerned about a potential conflict. He said if the operation with Deripaska contravenes federal law, this figure could be viewed at a potential embarrassment for Mueller. The question is whether he could implicate Mueller -- it could implicate Mueller in propriety and then Alan Dershowitz saying this. He also had similar concerns about a potential conflict.

Meanwhile amid protest from Palestinians, there's gratitude in Israel as the U.S. opens its embassy in Jerusalem.

So, why is he suddenly trying to save Chinese jobs? Let's ask Marco Rubio about that coming up. And commencement speakers say the most darned thing. You got to hear these attempts that words for the ages. But first, results versus resistance. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Today, the world watched as Donald Trump made good on this promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Three previous American Presidents had promised to do this. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, 42nd PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Jerusalem is still the capital of Israel and must remain an undivided city accessible to all. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As soon as I take office, I will begin the process of moving the United States ambassador to the city of Israel as chosen as its capital.

I mean, look, if the old guard, the so-called wise men of diplomacy knew so much, such smart guys, why are we still struggling in2018 to bring peace to the region? You had your shot and it didn't work. Let's face it. Now, it's Trump's turn. So, what the critics failed to acknowledge is that President Trump is engaged in an international strategy that is already paying some dividends. He's remaking alliances in the Middle East and taking the old bargaining chips off the table. He's changing the old and frankly the stale dynamic that was in place. Trump is reordering the status quo and he's forcing our international partners into new ways of thinking and acting even if it seems uncomfortable. Say what you want and a lot of you do about the President's approach. But he has reinvigorated the prospects of peace in places we never would have thought change would ever happen and he's created new possibilities. Now, who would have thought? Only a year ago that North Korea would be willing to melt down its nuclear testing facilities or even come to the negotiating table, no one thought that except maybe President Trump himself. At home, the economy is booming and the President is demonstrating that bold, innovative leadership can get real results abroad and at home. Now, he's appointing topnotch legal minds to the federal bench. We know that. He's untangling regulations that choke, stifle American businesses large and small. And now, he's even tackling prescription drug prices. He did that last week and he's going to be working on that. So, even as the media are loath to cover any of this at least fairly, the public I think gets it. So, Trump's numbers are climbing. But the only group of course that hasn't gotten the memo is the resistance media and their pals in politics. They consistently ignore the President's achievements while grasping at any straw to assail him. Well, today's straw was a side comment made last week by a White House aide during a private meeting about ailing Senator John McCain."

      "utterance": "I'm sorry. I had to be awakened from that montage. Come on. This staffer called McCain's family and personally apologized. Of course, they want a public apology for what was a private, leaked comment. And I was thinking about this, this afternoon. Can you imagine what team Obama said about Trump and his staff, his team, or any of his supporters behind closed doors? I shudder to think what they said. Come on. You know what this is really all about, trying to revive the President's comments about McCain made during the campaign, about the being a POW which were unfortunate comments. But to do that in an effort to somehow hurt Trump now -- now, it didn't work then and I don't think it will work now. While the media and their friends in politics obsess about thoughtless comments and nonessentials, few members of the media seem interested in doing their actual jobs, pursuing the stories that actually touch and affect our lives. What about holding our institutions accountable, accountable to the people that pay the bills? Why are the media so incurious about the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton and Comey's decision not to indict her? What about the reports of partisanship in the FBI, possible corruption within the Mueller probe or the reporting on Devin Nunes' attempts to get the Justice Department to hand over documents explaining how the FBI's Russian collusion probe started and who actually started it. I mean, Nunes had to threaten Rod Rosenstein with impeachment basically to get a response and he still hasn't seen all the documents in question. Now, isn't that worth investigating? Put Trump aside and what you think about Trump aside. The Justice Department and the FBI stonewalling those with actual oversight responsibilities or have porn stars and Russian collusion conspiracy theories sapped all the media's manpower and all of their energy resources? If the press, think about this, spent just a little bit of time covering some of those stories, well, maybe more Americans might listen when they reported critically on the President. But so long as the press is just a wing of the resistance, their audience will scatter. It will dwindle and soon, most of Americas will just tune them out. So, I think go ahead and cover criticism of the President, but once in a while, just try balancing out with some honest coverage of some of the groundbreaking successes and the real achievements. We all need the press to hold everyone accountable, Trump surely, but also the other sectors of government as well, including the FBI, and that's the Angle. In the last hour, you heard The Hill's John Solomon tell us about Special Counsel Bob Mueller's possible conflict of interest due to his ties to a Russian oligarch. John is now here with an even newer breaking series of developments that were just posted moments ago on The Hill. Nobody sorted this before. It's stunning stuff. John, what else should we know? I mean, I read through your piece about half an hour ago when it was posted. Now, we find out that in September of 2016..."

And then, two months before the election, he's asleep in his apartment in New York and he gets a knock on the door by some of the same FBI agents that worked with him on the early operation.

They had a falling out and he said \"He stole my money, took it into the United States\". So, the guy they go to is an enemy of Paul Manafort and they say, \"Well, can you help us prove that maybe Manafort is colluding with Putin to throw the whole election to Donald Trump?\" And he laughs. He brings out a laugh and saying \"It's preposterous.\" And they said, \"No, seriously, take this seriously.\" And, \"No, I'm telling you. It's not true. I don't like the guy. Listen. I'd love to smear him. I'm telling you. There's no chance that Russia is using Paul Manafort to coordinate an election.\" And that's important for two reasons. It's two months before the election. It's before the FISA application and here is someone that the FBI trusted previously to give them reliable information, spend his own money doing FBI work and now, they're telling them, no collusion.

John Solomon has done some of the most important reporting on this case on Mueller, on the FBI for months now and now this. Tom, I want to start with you. You knew Bob Levinson, going back to the first part of this narrative. You knew him. You worked with him when I think he was at counter-terror and you were at the FBI and now we hear more details on this Russian billionaire spending $25 million, two times, he had a good handle on getting him out of the country twice and he was waived off twice.

I happened to be at that time the legal attach, in Paris where Oleg Deripaska often would stop by himself actually. He spent a lot of time in Paris. But Levinson, we would try to do everything we could to get every part of the government moving on him. I was retired when he went missing.

Show me the file I'm such a bad guy. Show it to me\" and he starts working with them. Like, again, motivations aside, that would have been a great thing to get him out of the country.

And so, that said, this gentleman and most wealthy people in his position don't do things out of necessarily the goodness of their heart. It would have been an interest in it for him. And having good relations and ability to come and go from the United States is literally worth over $10 billion to his businesses. And so, naturally, he wanted to help and do a good thing as long as it didn't blow back on the Russian government. And so, he was assured of that. He did what he was asked.

How do you keep an open mind if you're asked that the crime occur? I mean, keep an open mind about it, what does that mean? That is incredibly shady and suspect. But, now, we have a second instance here, Laura, of clearly the Department of Justice and FBI not giving all the information to the FISA court because this is what we could call exculpatory evidence of in a criminal investigation where you ask somebody did Manafort collude with the Russians on behalf of the Trump investigation, Deripaska who would know said, \"Absolutely not. Are you kidding me? I hate his guts. He's cheating me in a business deal,\" but he didn't do that. I am quite certain as Solomon just said that that was not revealed to the FISA court because if it were, a judge would take a second look at that.

If you just tuned in, Bob Levinson, 30-year veteran of the CIA held now for 11 years in Iran. We learn more details tonight about the efforts of a Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska, now on the U.S. sanctions list to secure his release on two different occasions, spending $25 million. And now, we learn that Oleg Deripaska was approached by the FBI in September of the election year, September 2016 where they floated an idea of, \"Well, Manafort might be colluding with Trump and what do you think about that?\" And he's like, \"I don't even like Manafort. The facts are ridiculous. The intent is ridiculous. That's absurd\" and the FBI basically said \"Keep an open mind\". That's wild. Robyn, I want to go to you. Of course, you are on this Levinson case from the beginning. Now, we're learning more about how this effort was strung along, shut down at least on one occasion now by Hillary Clinton.

He's concerned about a potential conflict. He said if the operation with Deripaska contravenes federal law, this figure could be viewed at a potential embarrassment for Mueller. The question is whether he could implicate Mueller -- it could implicate Mueller in propriety and then Alan Dershowitz saying this. He also had similar concerns about a potential conflict. I think we have the full screen. He said, \"The real question becomes whether it was proper to leave him, Deripaska, out of the Manafort indictment and whether that omission was to avoid a kind of transparency that is really required by the law.\""

You said something really powerful, \"We don't leave any men behind.\" Think about how desperate the FBI had to be to go to our Russian oligarch and say, \"Could you fund this because the United States government wouldn't fund it?\" The Obama administration, the State Department, the CIA would not go back and get their own man for the level that the FBI thought it deserved. So, they go and reach out to this guy and they had to fund an extracurricular activity to rescue one of our own men. I think that's one of the saddest parts of this tale that gets overlooked."

But the moment as you witnessed it, tell us. FORMER GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE, R—AK:I think it's a powerful moment, and when everybody talks about President Trump made this decision, he did. But what he did, he affirmed the decision that King David made3,000 years ago when he made Jerusalem the capital of the Jewish people. And they are the only people for whom Jerusalem has ever been the capital. So all of the people who are tugging at their hair over the fact that Jerusalem has now been officially recognized by the United States ought to remember that there's never been a people ever and all of human history that have named Jerusalem as its capital other than the Jewish people.

      "utterance": "It's part of a theme, isn't it, that reality has returned and what we consider normal, somebody pulled the curtains away and we see it was abnormal. So Trump comes in with an outlier and he says Jerusalem is the capital and the Palestinians are no more refugees, and 13 million Germans who were ethnically cleansed in the same year in 1945, they are not refugees. And then he starts looking at the world and he says what was normal is abnormal. And people who say they are normal or abnormal. NATO, why can't affluent Germany and France pay two percent? Why does China have to expropriate technology as the price of doing business. Why are we in the Paris peace accords when we already meet the climate so-called regulations by fracking?"

He said \"Death in Gaza result of utter disregard of Mr. Trump and Netanyahu for Palestinian rights and homeland. By moving the embassy to Jerusalem Trump played politics, destroyed U.S. peacemaker role. New generation of Israelis, Palestinians need to isolate extremists to find path to peace.\" So I guess Trump is the extremist along with Bibi here."

      "utterance": "And \"The New York Times\" tried to make this whole incident with the embassy is what caused Hamas to push people out into the open, trying to rush a border, do something that they were warned not to do, break laws, invade another country, and somehow it's Israel's fault that Hamas is a terrorist that used human beings as shields, that encourage people to violence? I've read one account that said it was peaceful protest. It was not peaceful process. It was burning up tires, it was throwing Molotov cocktails. It was throwing rocks. It was trying to charge a border and overrun it. And Hamas was telling them that they had already breached the border and that millions were rushing toward Jerusalem, and these poor people who need food, who need shelter. Instead the millions of dollars of aid that go to Gaza ends up in the hands of these murderous terrorists in Hamas, and that is a tragedy that these innocent people who have been exploited and duped and now many of them are dead, and it is not Israel's fault. It is the fault of terrorists. That's who it's the fault of."

Then a quote from 23-year-old Mohammed Mansoura. \"We are excited to storm and get inside,\" he said. \"When asked what he would do inside Israel he said whatever is possible to kill, throw stones.\""

      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "Two thoughts. No country in the world would allow people to storm their country and try to kill people, so obviously a country has a right to protect its sovereignty. But more importantly I feel like this whole thing is fossilized, ossified. The chief worry in the Middle East right now is the existential threat from nuclear Iran. So if you talk to people in these countries off the record they used to be, but now they are publicly saying it, that they are more worried not about the Palestinians who need to get a life and go on like the Germans who left Prussia. Or one million Jews were ethnically cleansed after the Six-Day War and they got a new life. So it's time for the Palestinians to build a humane state and let the Arab world work with Israel about an existential threat, Iran."

Trump may ease off the U.S. ban on exports to Chinese telecom maker and big giant ZTE, tweeting too many jobs in China laws. However the heads of the FBI and CIA have warned Americans by buying ZTE phones because they are considered a national security risks. Senator Marco Rubio says it's crazy to help ZTE. I spoke with him just a short time ago."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Senator Rubio, you have been writing and speaking a lot about the China threat over the last several months, and this really took me by a complete surprise today with this seeming reversal of what I thought was a very commonsense approach to the Chinese telecom giant. What is your reaction tonight? The White House seemed to try to back off a little bit in reaction today. China will have to make concessions on its past cheating, frankly, but what is your reaction as of tonight? SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R—FLORIDA: First of all, I don't feel bad for these companies because, frankly, they have benefited greatly and continue to benefit great greatly from the theft and intellectual cheating which is what the government does on behalf of their companies. What's really concerning is telecommunications is one of the 10 or 12 industries that China intends to dominate the world in. And so to be selling American technology to ZTE is going to allow them to get it and then reverse engineer it, and then they will make it themselves and they won't need us anymore. They do that in every industry. But remember, this enforcement action against ZTE was not a trade issue. It was because they got caught helping North Korea and helping Iran evade sanctions and they were punished for it. But frankly we should not be in the business -- ZTE should not be operating unfettered in the United States and they shouldn't have access to American technology."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Senator Rubio, there's always this tension between the national security side of things and the economic side of things. And it seems that Trump is trying to triangulate on this. Obviously there is concern about farmers and the soybean tariff that China has threatened to put on them, also with the upcoming talks with North Korea. Without a doubt China has played some role in facilitating perhaps how we've gotten to this point this far. Do you take that into consideration as you judge this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "No, because without national security you have no economy. And in the case of China, part of our national security threat is they intend to wipe out United States industries in 10 key sectors. It's called Made in China 2025. They have telegraphed it very clearly. They intend to dominate the world in these 10 industries, and one of the ways they do it is they take American secrets, they either spy on us and steal them or they get American companies to do business with them and then they take whatever it is we invented and they learn how to make it themselves even though they are not allowed to under the law, and then they get rid of us and then they start competing with us, subsidized by their government. You do that in enough industries and it becomes a national security threat. And then in their case of ZTE and telecommunications, these are devices that could be theoretically used -- not theoretically. They can be used to track people, to listen in without any court orders or anything of that nature. If this was a farm dispute that's one thing, but this is a direct threat to our national security and our economic well-being, which are interrelated."

    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "No, I don't. I just think there's a lot of people tripping over there. Every day some group of CEOs comes marching into the White House and tries to talk the president down from the strong stand that he has taken on China. There's a lot of voices, perhaps even some people within the administration that want to back down a little bit on the China thing. This confrontation with China is by far the most important thing facing this country on a global scale. This is going to define the next 80 years. They intend to replace us."

This is what -- on another issue, on the tax bill, this is what you were quoted in the \"Washington Post\" as saying about the GOP tax bill. You said if you look at all the benefits that are flowing to corporations, it was important to be able to go back and do more for working families, again in reference to the tax bill, otherwise the message is what it has been for 25 years for both parties, that is when push comes to shove, we want your vote but we are not all that concerned about the working class. This is what Trish Reagan said."

    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "I don't know what she is referring to when they say that. I am for lower taxes. I think the whole debate began with this. We have a corporate tax rate of 35. The Republican bill lowered it to 20. I said why don't we lower it to 21, which is still massive. Again, we are talking C-corporations. We're talking about Apple and Google, these multinationals, not talk about S-corporations, your everyday small business, midsize business. I'm talking about big, multinational corporations for the most part. I said instead of lowering to 20, let's lowered to 21, still a dramatic cut, and -- actually said 20.9, and let's use that 0.9 to fully expand the child tax credit for working families, people making, $30, $40, $50, $60,000 a year. And my argument was that 0.9 was better in the hands of these workers that have already been hurt by all these changes in the economy."

      "utterance": "I get you, Senator Rubio, but it's over. I see where you're coming from, but that's over and now we have the midterms. And it's like Republicans have to be unified on this issue. And I can see the argument -- with all that to hang together here on this tax bill. It's what we have. It's not perfect. There's a lot more I wanted, we didn't get it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "The criticism is not about the tax bill. It is what it is and on that it's a positive. The issue is the attitude. The attitude that some people had towards that child tax credit that it's better off in the hands of these big corporations than it is in the hands of a working family. That attitude is going to be ongoing, and we cannot continue because working people in this country have been crushed over the last 20 years by all these changes. We need to think about that."

Like I said, I saw the same article. Suffice it to say that here's the bottom line. Mr. Mueller is conducting this investigation. If there is a conflict of interest at some point and it's born to be true, it would jeopardize the investigation. I'm not prepared to say that. We don't know all the facts. I think we'll see as this thing rolls forward and as he brings out -- this investigation has to end at some point. People will be able to look at who he went after and who he didn't and then ask these questions. But we should wait until that moment arrives. But on this particular case we have that article. I don't even know quite frankly how any of that is classified or not at this point and so I would be personally cautious. I'm trying to be evasive. I don't want to get in trouble here and go beyond where I should. But suffice it to say, for purposes of an investigation Bob Mueller should be able to finish his work and then -- it has to end at some point and we will be able to look at it all and say, hey, why did you do this or not do that?"
