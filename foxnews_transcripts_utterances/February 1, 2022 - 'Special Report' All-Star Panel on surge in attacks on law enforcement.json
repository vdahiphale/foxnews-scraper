I want to just update you guys to let you know that we are learning tonight from multiple sources now, multiple outlets reporting that two police officers in Richmond were killed on the scene of that shooting earlier today at Bridgewater college. Our hearts go out to the families and the communities there. Katie, you heard from the bereaved in that soundbite we just played off the top here, Officer Rivera's widow at his eulogy last week and then again today remarks from law enforcement in Houston. It sounds an awful lot like law enforcement is starting to push back against politicians.",

And so that is a perfect example of the failure of these new rules and laws that have been put into place by progressive D.A.s in cities like New York, San Francisco, L.A., and communities across the country. And the bottom line is that there is a deep-seated ideology on the left that believes that a lot of this criminal behavior is justified because they think the system is systemically racist or that it's unfair to certain communities, and, therefore, criminals deserve some kind of break in order to reform, tear down the system, and implement something that they believe in. But when it comes to what's happening in Washington, D.C., the Biden administration does have a role to play here. The White House has been asked multiple times about these soft on crime policies. Jen Psaki was caught over the weekend laughing about this issue, saying she doesn't even know what that quite means. But the Department of Justice can play a role in federal charges. Some of the reporting that I have done on this very issue, criminals are not necessarily always afraid of what the local D.A. may charge or what local criminal penalties may bring. But they are afraid of federal charges. And the Biden administration has failed so far to implement something like Operation Legend like the Trump DOJ did to really go after the criminals who were pulling the trigger and getting out right after they do so.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think we have politics at play here. Obviously, Republicans did vote against the bill, and the bill was one that would have put a lot of money in the hands of police, and so Democrats say that is an anti-police bill. Of course, Republicans say that Democrats are for defunding the police. But the politics of it, Gillian, tonight you hear about these officers who were killed on the campus in Virginia, you hear about the officer who lost his life at the traffic stop in Houston, we know about the officers who were killed in the domestic violence incident in New York, and I've got to tell you, I think all of us on the panel tonight just grieve and have a sense of loss for their lives as public servants, as people who were doing their job. And my point, from my political perspective is, in all these incidents, Houston, Virginia, New York, in every case, what the real issue to my mind, and I think most police officers agree, is that the criminals have easy access to guns. And we need to deal with that issue, and we have not dealt with that issue. We -- some of these shootings, we had a shooting outside of Washington recently where it was a ghost gun. Two kids having a fight. One kid has a ghost gun. There is even more availability of guns. And some people say oh, it's liberals and it's liberal policies and it's big cities. Of the -- I think the 10 states with the highest murder rate last year, eight of them were states that voted for trump. Most in the south. They don't have big cities. So what we need to do is talk honestly with each other about the fact that guns are out of control in this country. New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, just all elected Democratic mayors who are tough on crime, tough on guns. They do want reforms, but they are anticrime.",

We had data that that was harmful, and yet, the harm continued. We have data that masking children in schools makes no appreciable difference, and yet it continues in a lot of places in this country in the face of science. And it seems like the mistakes that have been made, in some cases, are still being made, and this type of study that you reference, it's not the first, it won't be the last. And I think we will have one indictment after another about the restrictions and the decisions made by many leaders, some of the same leaders who made mistakes in the past who are now insisting that we listen to them today and not listen to the leaders who actually got a lot of big things right last year, for example.
