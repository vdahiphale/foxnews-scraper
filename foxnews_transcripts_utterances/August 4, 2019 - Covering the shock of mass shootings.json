KURTZ: Are you suggesting that that perhaps should not be allowed? That people should be -- DOMENECH: I think it's not just about banning people from the sites. I think it goes further than that. We now live in an environment which these corporations make a lot more determinations about the way that we live and what's allowed on their different platforms and on the servers that they have than anything that Congress can do to change the laws in different respects. Is it responsibility of Silicon Valley in the sense to say there are certain things that you're not even going to -- you're going to have to build your own server to make this kind of thing happen as oppose to allowing this type of stuff to foment (ph) where these people share information, where if they were engage in Islamic terror or something like that, everyone would be in favor of shutting these places down. KURTZ: That is certainly worth debating.

You don't get to a point where essentially almost the entire field is running against your signature domestic policy Obamacare, wanting to either replace it with Medicare for All or dramatically change it and have a circumstance where you can't talk about it.

Why didn't Joe Biden -- and may be this comes to the criticism of his performance -- knock back harder and simply - - look at the stock market. I mean, we covered on Fox Business, over President Obama's eight years, it recovered by more than 100 percent of gains for the Dow and Nasdaq. It was very impressive. He didn't bring up that.

Right now, the area around the shooting is blocked off as police investigate this massacre. It happened around 1:00 a.m. in Dayton's popular Oregon District that was filled with people at bars and restaurants. Police say the unidentified shooter came prepared with body armor and extra magazines. Police were in the area and responded in about a minute, shooting and killing the suspect.

They say this is not only a horrific and devastating scene but it is also a massive one, so it's going to take some time to methodically and thoughtfully go through all of the evidence that scattered throughout the Walmart area in and around where the shooting happened. What makes this shooting a little more unique compared to some other ones is that it happened around 10:30 a.m. local time and there were about, according to some estimates, 3,000 people shopping. They are taking advantage of the tax-free holiday, doing some back to school shopping. Witnesses say the suspected shooter, a 21-year-old white male, who we aren't identifying, was shooting at anyone who was moving.

Joining us now here in New York: Ben Domenech, founder and publisher of The Federalist; Liz Claman anchors \"The Claman Countdown,\" weekdays at 3:00 on Fox Business; and Jeanne Zaino, commentator who teaches government and media at Iona College. Liz, we in the media have, I got to say, been through so many of these mass tragedies, these mass shootings. There's certain numbness and certain fatigue. The stories don't last this long and yet this one feels almost especially shocking, the one in El Paso."

Even when there is a huge shooting yesterday, 13 hours later, last night it was wall- to-wall coverage immediately, all commercial breaks blown out, and then you look today and people are back to their regular programming."

This is what it has come to. So, yes, it is extremely disturbing. KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And then we know the pattern, which is inevitably there will be political finger pointing and speculation about how this could happen. For example, this morning on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Jake Tapper had some democratic candidates on, says to Pete Buttigieg, is Trump -- Donald Trump -- President Trump a white nationalist? Buttigieg, yeah, at least he is -- at best, he is condoning and encouraging white nationalism. Beto O'Rourke, yes. So, somehow this is being linked to the president, the actions of a crazed gunman."

And I think that unfortunately, I think a lot of the reactions come from a sort of impossibility. The president tweeting differently is not going to prevent these types of events from happening. The Congress, even if they had taken the actions that were proposed in the wake of Las Vegas, for instance, wants that every Senate Democrat voted against of putting, you know, people who are on the terror watch list, making them impossible to purchase firearms. That also apparently at least would not have prevented the El Paso situation."

KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Are you suggesting that that perhaps should not be allowed? That people should be -- DOMENECH: I think it's not just about banning people from the sites. I think it goes further than that. We now live in an environment which these corporations make a lot more determinations about the way that we live and what's allowed on their different platforms and on the servers that they have than anything that Congress can do to change the laws in different respects."

KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That is certainly worth debating. Jeanne, MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi said you are certainly at greater risk in 2019 and America being a victim of white nationalism than you are being a victim of ISIS Islamic terrorism.

So if there is one thing I always tell my students, it is that you must reserve judgment. The Washington naval yard 2013, much of the coverage of that was proven incorrect. You go to Gabby Giffords shooting. You go forward. You go to shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise. There are so many examples of where blames placed mistakenly. So you have to reserve judgment and talk about real policy issues once we have the fact."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "This seems to be a turning point in the coverage of President Trump that we didn't even see after Charlottesville. Many in the media feel empowered to say just flat out he is racist. He sends racist tweets rather than, you know, use language like why they view this racist, why they criticize this racist. The media seems to be taking a stand on President Trump on this volatile issue. CLAMAN: OK, in a single week, though, you had the Cincinnati rally, right, where he did not necessarily call out the \"Squad,\" the four women of color who are serving in Congress on the democratic side, but he did talk about how they were out there and they are now the face of -- of being against everything that Americans hold dear. Then he takes on Al Sharpton and of course Elijah Cummings. Look, if you look at the four corners of exactly how president speaks, President Trump is doing what he does. He comes out swinging. It's almost like he is color blind, if you're just simply looking at the action. However, he does not help his own cause when it turns out that every single one of these people is either African-American or brown, had some type of color to their skin, and therefore it gives people an easier pathway to say in the aggregate, it sure looks like he is taking on when it comes to his rhetorical battles, high profile black and brown people."

But one of them, as I mentioned, Al Sharpton, MSNBC host and a long time civil rights activist, who has a history of what some would call racial ambulance-chasing. I covered the Tawana Brawley hoax, which Al Sharpton has never apologized. She was a white woman in upstate New York who claimed she had been gang raped -- excuse me, a black woman -- a black teenage -- by six white men. And yet he has a platform on MSNBC and sometimes ends up covering himself when he goes in stage protests."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Sharpton is someone with a long history and a lot of questionable behavior within the states. I agree with you, Howie, on that point. To me, the larger conversation here is one that I think is really worsened by the media's aggression and trying to make everything about the president though. How does -- how do we have these kinds of scenarios with urban decay, the Baltimore last year being the homicide capital of the country and not have that be a bigger front page subject within the media until the president gets into a political scrum with Elijah Cummings? This is the type of thing that I think the media ought to be covering in a way that says, actually, you know, how we reached this circumstance, are we going to ignore what's going on in San Francisco just because it's another city in which Democrats and policies have failed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "I think that the conversation about this and the willingness of the media to just say the president is racist in every circumstance where he's going someone with whom he has political disagreement is overblown and if you think that he only does this kind of aggression toward people of color, I'd like to introduce you to someone named John McCain. KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But it is true that by in large the media don't cover much of the problems of cities until the president takes on Elijah Cummings. The president drives the news coverage of these things. He is very good at it. Some people say we are too quick to follow. ZAINO: Absolutely. You know, let's be honest, the media wants a fight, and Donald Trump is great at bringing them the conflict. What they don't do is follow up, to your point with, and Ben's point, what is the root of the problem? Why are these cities suffering? Why the endless cycles of poverty? Why the housing problems? We don't hear about that why because I will tell you, when you go out and give policy talks, it's boring. People don't click and watch and listen, and the media will not cover it for that reason. They want to fight."

      "speaker": "DON LEMON, CNN HOST",

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm just stating a statement of fact. I'm not condoning anything. You know, I worked in the same town, the same region, the same part of Baltimore that Freddie Gray (INAUDIBLE) from years ago when I was a kid under the leadership of John Perkins, a prominent civil rights pastor, and we worked there on the House. This is where I first met -- met the first politician I ever met in my life, Jack Kemp, HUD secretary there, and there's a willingness on the part of a lot of African-American pastors leading civil rights voices to reach out across partisan lines and work with people to try to better their communities."
    },

      "utterance": "Right. If you're inviting someone on to provide another point of view and then you start questioning his Christianity, I just question that. At the debate, Lemon was the opinion guy in the panel, called President Trump bigot. Let me get a break here. When we come back, we are going to talk about those democratic debates and more on the mass shootings, straight ahead."

CLAMAN: Howie, this is a case of media objectivity. I'm not sure that Vice President Biden deserved much more incredible praise here. We are talking about fumbling for words. He wasn't exactly crystal clear. And therefore, he got kind of a B-minus, which is not very exciting."

DOMENECH: Because he is popular as Barack Obama is personally. His policies are far less popular. You don't get to a point where essentially almost the entire field is running against your signature domestic policy Obamacare, wanting to either replace it with Medicare for All or dramatically change it and have a circumstance where you can't talk about it."

CLAMAN",
      "utterance": "This is a crazy strategy for every Democrat on that stage to have adopted. I mean, he has got a 90 percent positive rating with Democrats when it comes to President Obama. Why didn't Joe Biden -- and may be this comes to the criticism of his performance -- knock back harder and simply - - look at the stock market. I mean, we covered on Fox Business, over President Obama's eight years, it recovered by more than 100 percent of gains for the Dow and Nasdaq. It was very impressive. He didn't bring up that. He doesn't bring up a bunch of other issues, whether it was the fact that he was commander in chief when bin Laden was killed. You know, he did not operate on that level. And therefore, I think that these other Democrats pounced. It just seemed counterproductive for the team."

They are going to need to win in the Rustbelt. That's not a winnable strategy. But we also have to look at who got the most out of the first debate. It was Kamala Harris because she attacked Biden. Every one of those candidates that came back for second debate learned if we want press coverage which we need to get to the September debate, we darn well better attack Biden, which means attacking Obama.

Local hospital officials say that several are in serious or critical condition. At least 15 others have been released.

People are tired of hearing fake news delivered with an anger that is not to be believed. Sad, when the show was sane, they helped me get elected.

It was only 45, and he played a supporting role. Solid reporting has torpedoed a striking number of Trump nominees, and he this when asked about the lack or apparent lack of White House vetting."

I want to read you his tweet from 8:00 a.m. this morning. He said \"the FBI, local, and state law enforcement are working together today in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio. Information is rapidly being accumulated in Dayton. Much has already been learned in El Paso. Law enforcement was very rapid in both instances. Updates will be given throughout the day.\" We've also heard from the president's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.

It's a pattern after every shooting. Often, it's about gun control. And I understand that the president's actions and the verbiage he uses about illegal immigration are going to be part of this debate. But to suggest that he's responsible, that he's encouraging, that he's condoning the actions of a crazed man, a gunman, seems to me to be horribly unfair on the media's part. Politicians can do it. They are running for office. But should the media."

I certainly don't agree with President Trump on immigration. However, I have already seen a few columns. There is one in the (Inaudible) that came out basically same thing that Beto is saying that Trump is responsible for this. And that's just insane. Obviously, Trump doesn't want to see all these people murdered. Nobody wants to see somebody like this. These are crazed lunatics that if this manifesto does turn out to be from this shooter, then yes. I would absolutely call it domestic terrorism and white supremacist terrorism, anti-immigrant terrorism just like the New York Post did. But to blame President Trump, that's just -- it's illogical in addition to being unfair."

During Obama administration some times when police officers were killed, certain conservative commentators will go in the air and say Obama has blood on his hands, because of his anti-law enforcement policies. Well, he did not. And President Trump did not. It is fair to challenge his rhetoric and handling of the immigration issue, but to suggest that he wouldn't in any way be condoning the shooting of so many innocent people. It's something I think the media needs to be really be careful about."

It's not for us to give our opinion. So I am not giving my opinion as an immigrant how I feel about the situation. But the Spanish media reported what happened, gave it to the viewers.

We have to be really careful making this thing, and I know on that point you would both agree.

Those are facts based on statistics. And everybody wanted to focus on whether they were appropriate. The narrative on the left was very much these are racists. I mean as you mentioned before, Don Lemon called even called him racist when he was supposed to be, you know, a moderator, was supposed to be completely non-bias"

That wasn't my topic. But always, there were always ideas. And we just don't see that much anymore. And we need that and some in the United States, Louisiana, Mississippi in the south. There are red states that are suffering right now with red governors. So let's talk policy. Let's clear up America. We have so many issues and so many poor cities across the entire United States. So the secretary of HUD, what a great opportunity for the conversation, but people don't want to talk policy it sounds like."

Does the media really care about the inner cities, because these are not the viewers and the readers who are most priced by advertisers. There's a sense of exhaustion, I think, after decades of efforts to help these cities, going back to LBJ's great society. And I wonder, Kat, whether or not, you know, the reason we're more (Inaudible) politics is because as a collective struggling (Inaudible) while these problems are never going away in cities and it's not just Baltimore. There are sections here in New York and in Washington and in Chicago and elsewhere where you have ramped crime, drugs, and poverty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I think that a lot of people in the media now rather than just having their goal to be reporting, a lot of them have a goal that's an outside agenda, some political agenda in some way. So they see a story, and they say how can this be used to support that agenda and further -- further, you know, promote it. And so people see it that Trump makes the comments about Cummings, they say, oh, look, racist. Just like we have been saying Trump is racist, and they're more focused on their angle than they are actually reporting, let alone actually caring about the people who are suffering and, you know, pressuring people for solutions."

There are sections that Cummings district that are actually much better off. But saying the things are terrible in some parts of Baltimore, does that neutralize the president's attack because now we have to circle back to, yeah, but in every administration, many administrations have failed to do much about it, including the Obama administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "Yeah. But in defense of reporters, I mean often reporters can't control what they are going to do. The editors give an angle."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "Well, they absolutely -- the story is going to about how the HUD secretary grew up. When I worked for the Washington Post -- how did HUD secretary grow up, what's his background, how did he become HUD secretary. So I couldn't talk about policy or statistics. I had to talk about his growing up and what it was like. It was factual. But that wasn't my topic. I had to stay on an angle. So to create a story about policy and get people interested maybe more about the feelings behind it, and Jimmy Carter addressed trying to address cities and poverty. And that was a fascinating story. And I was able to write about that, because he was fascinating and made it interesting to readers."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right. They certainly don't get much attention. I don't know if that's because people don't know what to do, because we have already tried to throw a lot of money at this problem. Federal government has given so much money to Baltimore, and clearly it hasn't been used in the best way or maybe they're not sure what to do with it or who knows. The problem is no one is asking that question. People are asking instead was Trump's rhetoric OK, or how is this politically. People are not asking the question, OK, so what do we do about it because statistically there's real suffering."

And I am also wondering, you know, the typical formula on television is go on and say it's President Trump's fault. He created the climate, and others will say that's ridiculous. And it's slanderous. I don't think ultimately their argument gets anywhere. It's the fault of the people who pull the trigger in these situations. And I think the media ought not to play an inflammatory role.
