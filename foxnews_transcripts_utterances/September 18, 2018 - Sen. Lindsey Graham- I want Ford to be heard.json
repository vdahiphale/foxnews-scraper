So, I want Miss forward to come forward and tell us what she knows. I'm all for that. Judge Kavanaugh has got a lot of support from women throughout the legal community and everybody he's interacted with all of his life, they say he's a good man.

But I've certainly been tweeting about it, because I truly believe that the American public deserves to know and especially Congress. There was an Israeli diplomat named Christian Cantor, who absolutely detested Trump, who one day in London decided to introduce me to his so- called girlfriend, a girl named Erica Thompson, who just also happened to be an intel officer from Australia, and a senior advisor to Alexander Downer. Now this was in April of 2016. I learned about the dirt from Joseph Mifsud in late April, 2016. Now why was an Australian intelligence officer meeting with me, probing me about my ties to the energy business in Israel, why were they -- why was she probing me about what the campaign was up to regarding Russia in April before Joseph Mifsud even told me about the dirt. Now, fast forward to the beginning of May. All of a sudden I give an interview to the Times of London in which I essentially humiliate, by accident I guess, the U.K. prime minister, by asking him to apologize or detract his derogatory statements about candidate Trump about his idea of a Muslim ban, which I thought, you know, David Cameron should have never been calling Donald Trump stupid or idiotic for those comments. And it doesn't matter if the U.K. is an ally or not, their prime minister shouldn't have intervened in the democratic process in this country. Now a couple of days after that interview, all of a sudden I'm approached by two officials from what I think are the defense intelligence agency of the U.S. embassy in London who decide to meet with me.",

This is a one person story versus another person's story. We've been down this road many times in the past couple of years, and many lives have been damaged along the way. An editorial in The Wall Street Journal, today says this. \"A story this old and unprovable cannot be allowed to delay a Supreme Court confirmation vote.\" They call it a calculated political ambush.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court hanging in the balance since his female accuser has not yet confirmed that she will appear before the Senate and his male friend who may be the only eyewitness who says this never happened has already told the Senate he's not going to appear. Kavanaugh spent his second straight day right here prepping for sworn testimony where he will deny there was a sexual assault. Practicing here at the White House, where President Trump said his nominee and his family simply do not deserve these attacks. Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge, said again today, he has no memory of the alleged incident but has RSVP'd no to the Senate because he does not want to speak publicly other than saying, \"I never saw Brett act in the manner that dr. Ford describes.\" Now, Dr. Ford has not yet responded to the panel. As I noted, her attorney Debra Katz revealed today, they claim they've claimed there is at least one other girl at the party in question but they have not said it's not up to Dr. Ford to corroborate her own story.

We can't tell us when it happened and where it happened. I know a lot about Judge Kavanaugh that speaks that he is not the kind of guy to do this. But she deserves to be heard, and she will be challenged. Kavanaugh deserves to be heard and be able to defend himself. But if she does not want to come Monday, publicly or privately, we're going to move on and vote Wednesday. Well, let me ask you this, do you feel that adequate outreach has been done? We -- Senator Grassley, said four e-mails were given to her then there's some backlash on that saying -- you know, her lawyer needs to get a phone call, she needs to get a phone call. Has it been adequate outreach?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, right. It's been more than -- what's been inadequate is the fact that the Democrats knew about this allegation July the 6th, the Democratic congresswoman received the anonymous letter July the 30th. Senator Feinstein had the information. She claims that this -- that was credible and went to the character of the nominee. She never chose to confront Judge Kavanaugh until Thursday before -- Thursday of last week. She had plenty of chances to bring it up, she did not. We're not going to play this game anymore. We won't Miss Ford to be heard but clearly to me, in August, she hired a lawyer who's a very activist lawyer, who does not like President Trump and paid for a polygraph. So, they were thinking about coming forward. Why would you hire a lawyer and take a polygraph in August if you had no desire to come forward? Miss Ford may be the victim of circumstance here, but we're going to go forward. We're going to hear her out if she chooses, we're going to vote on Wednesday."

      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure some of this out. The Democrats knew about this for weeks, July, they never raised it in that timely fashion they said on it. They never confronted Judge Kavanaugh. So, that says a lot about their tactics. Miss Ford hired a lawyer in August and took a polygraph in August. So, it makes it pretty hard for me to believe they never intended for this to come out. Whether Miss Ford intended to come out or not, I don't know but the people she hired very much intended for it to come out. They are the people who want to sink Kavanaugh and get Trump. So, you don't have to be that, that sharp to figure out there's something going on here. She'll have her day, Monday if she chooses to come."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "utterance": "We need to judge Brett Kavanaugh not just on what he may or may not have done but how he treats a woman's pain. And that is something I'm in paying attention to on Monday.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, let's step back a bit and look at the evidence so that we have about Judge Kavanaugh and women. It's pretty impressive record of hiring women, of having a lot of women step forward that he worked with, that he's mentored, that he went to school with, that he dated coming forward saying this is a good man. The allegations that I've heard about here recently did not fit the man that I know. But, you got to realize this, what about Judge Kavanaugh, this is trying to ruin his life here. He's been accused of a horrible thing. There is no dating, no date for him to go by, there is no place for him to remember. It's just a general accusation 36 years old. And what about his pain? So, I want Miss forward to come forward and tell us what she knows. I'm all for that. Judge Kavanaugh has got a lot of support from women throughout the legal community and everybody he's interacted with all of his life, they say he's a good man. I'm going to consider that."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, again you don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what's going on here. If you think this was serious enough for the FBI to get involved, why didn't you raise it July the 30th when you first heard about it? Why did you set on it for weeks over a month and do nothing about it? Why now do you want an FBI investigation to delay this past the midterms? It gets really was it --"
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They don't investigate state crimes, they don't investigate things that you can't prosecute. They do background checks. This information came forward last Thursday."

      "utterance": "So, it would follow under that category then, potentially."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Right. So, here is the point. If they really wanted the FBI involved, if they really wanted to find all this information, how they would have told us in July when they had the information? Why are they doing it now to delay the hearing? It's pretty obvious to me that when they first heard about this, the FBI was the last thing on their mind. Now, they're asking for the FBI to investigate to delay the hearing. If you can't figure that out, you probably shouldn't be driving."

Intelligence officials are scrambling right now to comply with the sweeping order that includes the FISA warrants and the unredacted text messages from Former FBI Director James Comey, Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the FBI couple, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, plus all the interviews, known as the 302s that were conducted with Bruce Ohr when he answered all those questions for the FBI. A tall order that will likely answer a lot of questions about the origins of the investigation, but critics including many Democrats, claim that releasing these documents could jeopardize National Security. Here now, Andrew McCarthy, a Former Federal Prosecutor and Fox News Contributor, Andy, good evening, good to see you tonight. You say that you are shocked at the pushback on this, because we often hear about greater transparency, and we know that a lot of these things that the economy has already looked at, minus these text messages, so why the pushback?"

      "speaker": "ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it's because it's all political. I mean, if you think back, Martha, on the, say, the CIA interrogations program, where a lot of people in the intelligence community said we need to keep these under wraps, because we don't want to teach terrorists how we do interrogations, whether it's enhanced techniques or not. And some of the same people who are now worried about National Security, back then, told us the truth had to come out, everything had to be laid bare. So, you know, a lot of people retreat to their partisan corners when this kind of stuff comes out. I must say, with the country having been royaled by this for two years, it really surprises me that there hasn't been more push for more information. The whole point of having a special counsel is because when the government gets investigated, nobody gets to be the judge and jury of their own -- of their own cause. You have to have an independent investigation. And here, we're talking about the FBI and the justice department, which by the way, are not in the constitution. They're creatures of Congress, they're creatures of statute. Congress has a right and duty to do oversight on them. And there's going to be a fine opportunity for people in the intelligence community to pick out and seal things that would actually compromise methods and sources of intelligence."

April 16, 2016 in the U.K., George Papadopoulos claims he was told by a professor with extensive ties to Russia that the Russians had obtained thousands of Hillary Clinton e-mails. Keep in mind this was several months before hacked Democratic Party e-mails were released and hacked e-mails from Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta were posted on WikiLeaks. Then in August of 2016 over drinks in a London bar, Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that the Russians had derogatory information on Hillary Clinton. Downer reportedly passed that information along to western intelligence sparking the investigation. Papadopoulos has been asked repeatedly if he ever told other members of the Trump campaign about the Russians having Clinton e-mails. Watch."

I retraced my steps of what actually led up to that meeting with Downer. And the environment and the people I was meeting that led to that meeting with Downer were incredibly suspicious.

There was an Israeli diplomat named Christian Cantor, who absolutely detested Trump, who one day in London decided to introduce me to his so- called girlfriend, a girl named Erica Thompson, who just also happened to be an intel officer from Australia, and a senior advisor to Alexander Downer. Now this was in April of 2016. I learned about the dirt from Joseph Mifsud in late April, 2016. Now why was an Australian intelligence officer meeting with me, probing me about my ties to the energy business in Israel, why were they -- why was she probing me about what the campaign was up to regarding Russia in April before Joseph Mifsud even told me about the dirt. Now, fast forward to the beginning of May. All of a sudden I give an interview to the Times of London in which I essentially humiliate, by accident I guess, the U.K. prime minister, by asking him to apologize or detract his derogatory statements about candidate Trump about his idea of a Muslim ban, which I thought, you know, David Cameron should have never been calling Donald Trump stupid or idiotic for those comments. And it doesn't matter if the U.K. is an ally or not, their prime minister shouldn't have intervened in the democratic process in this country. Now a couple of days after that interview, all of a sudden I'm approached by two officials from what I think are the defense intelligence agency of the U.S. embassy in London who decide to meet with me."

You have another tweet out there, that basically says that there was spying on an American -- that the British, the Australians, they knew that there was spying happening on an American citizen and that Obama, Brennan, and Clapper also knew. Because that is the question here. You're suggesting that these individuals were setting you up to create a pretense to start investigating the Trump campaign for meddling with Russia.

Now, the same day, this is where things get incredibly weird, the same day after looking back in my notes, that Stefan Halper met with me in London the British ministry of foreign affairs invited me to their offices to meet with their diplomats. And the British, and I tweeted about this, I have never knowingly met a Russian official in my life. However, while I was on the campaign I had incredible amount of interaction with British diplomats to the extent that they personally delivered Theresa May's letter to me, about Trump, when he was elected president.

So \"Sesame Street,\" the guy who's been writing the Bert and Ernie characters since 1984 but they've been around since like, I don't know, 1970 or something when the show first came out. He now says that Bert and Ernie are gay that he wrote them that way and he always thought about his partner when he was writing the characters. But \"Sesame Street\" begs to differ. They say we, as we have always said, Bert and Ernie are best friends. They were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with people who are very different from themselves even though they are identified as male characters and possess many human traits and characteristics, they remain puppets, and they do not have a sexual orientation."

Although personally I'm having a really hard time carrying whether or not they are gay because when it comes to real people, I don't care whether or not they are gay. Live your best life and be you. I don't care. So if I don't care if real people are gay, I'm finding a really hard time caring whether or not people who are like not people--"
