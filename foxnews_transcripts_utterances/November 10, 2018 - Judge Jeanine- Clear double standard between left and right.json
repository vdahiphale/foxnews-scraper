      "sentences": "Breaking tonight, Florida's Secretary of State orders a recount in the state's key Senate and Governor races while Democrat Andrew Gillum withdraws his concession in the Governor's race. Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for keeping \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals\" on \"New York Times\" bestsellers list for over three straight months. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We've got a big show on deck for you tonight with all the late breaking details on the Florida recount, plus live reaction from Congressman Matt Gaetz, Corey Lewandowski, Katrina Pierson and Brian Kilmeade to name a few. But first, my open. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is a clear double standard between the left and the right. Behavior that you only see on the left and not the right. If you need further proof that there is a double standard, that the left has brain washed society, look no further than Florida. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The fraud going on in Florida as an acceptable solution to our election process is the last straw. How after four days are the same two counties that we have repeatedly had trouble with in the past still able to say their election is not final. How is that possible? How is that okay? As I speak to you, Florida's Secretary of State has officially declared a recount for Governor and United States Senator in Florida on election night though both Republicans were declared the winners over their Democrat opponents. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Republican Rick Scott was declared the winner over Democrat Bill Nelson for Florida's US Senate seat. Republican Congressman Ron deSantis was declared winner against Democrat Andrew Gillum, a local mayor. But tonight, everything is in flux. Democrat Gillum, the lose candidate who conceded on election night has just today officially pulled back his concession to Republican Ron deSantis. So what's going on? The Democrats are refusing to accept the declared results of the national media. Theirs is a double standard if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You say we lost, we will say we won, and in the words of DNC lawyer Marc Elias, an operative from Clinton Fusion GPS Christopher Steele fraudulent dossier intended also to disenfranchise us on the national presidential election, we'll do a recount and we will win. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So how do they do this? Lo and behold, they find missing ballots. And where do they finds these ballots? In deep blue counties run by Democrats in Florida, Broward and Palm Beach. Now, Broward and Palm Beach Counties may sounds familiar to you because in 2000, there was a hand recount in Palm Beach County because the Democrats didn't want to accept the results of a presidential election. In 2006, there was another recount started by the Democrats. In 2016, another recount and in 2018, another recount in the same two counties. Now, folks, there are 3,141 counties and county equivalents in the United States. So you tell me how 3,139 counties can get their votes in 30 minutes after the polls close, but not these two. The other counties get it right. There is even a county that suffered a category 4 hurricane in Florida that was able to turn in their ballots 30 minutes after the election, but these same two deep blue Democrat controlled counties in Florida where Republicans won in the two most of important races can't get their act together. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it's not the first time. There is one person who seems to be at the center of this, a Ms. Brenda Snipes, the election supervisor in Broward County shown here. Now you know about Brenda because in 2016, a judge called her out for destroying ballots that benefited her friend, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. So election night, Broward reports thousands of votes, 634,000 and now there are reportedly thousands more votes. You're kidding, right? A primer. Every county is supposed to hand in all early voting and absentee balance lots within 30 minutes of the polls closing. Most counties already count those ballots before election night. But now in a lawsuit brought against Ms. Snipes, Governor Scott argues it's Snipes who is refusing to comply with the campaign request for voter and ballot information. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At an emergency hearing yesterday in Florida, the Governor asked the court to have ordered Ms. Snipes turn over records detailing how she counts and collects ballots. Snipes, as might be expected is refusing to turn over the records, saying it's inappropriate for a court to intervene this time simply because Scott wants the counting process sped up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What is even more outrageous is that after Snipes destroyed ballots illegally in the 2016 election, her premature destruction of the ballots under court review in the pending lawsuit was described as unlawful and in violation of the Public Records Act. That court in 2016 cited a similar case where the individual was dismissed, saying dismissal under these circumstances is an appropriate sanction. But the court went even beyond saying that about Snipes. They said her violation was twofold. Number one, Snipes violated state and Federal retention requirements, and number two, Snipes violated the affirmative responsibility to preserve evidence. Why was this woman not fired? Yet today, Ms. Snipes lives on to mess up yet another, or overturn yet another election in Florida. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And if that's not enough to infuriate you, after the court's decision about Ms. Snipes, the state of Florida announced it would be monitoring Broward's 2018 election. Now, let me tell you what a mess we are in. There are reportedly thousands of newfound ballots. Each one is five pages long. Do you think a woman who doesn't tally or canvass along the way loses thousands of ballots, who doesn't want to turn them in within 30 minutes after the polls are closed like 3,139 other counties, too, should be trusted? Do you think she should be allowed to view five times, because that's how long the ballots are, five pages, of thousands and thousands of missing ballots? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Folks, this is lunacy. Voter fraud is insidious. It causes people to think their vote doesn't matter, but it's worse than that, folks. There are reportedly transcripts now that prove that when the Democrats say they want every vote counted, they mean it. Yes, that's what I said. But it's not just your votes, it's illegal votes that some lawyers in these canvassing hearings for Democrats want counted. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A report out today says lawyers for Democrats Gillum and Nelson are objecting to the rejection of votes cast by non-citizens. So when a lawyer for Democrats, Marc Elias famous for his role in the dossier creation that was an attempt to disenfranchise our duly elected President says he's going down to Florida to win, he should have added, by any means. That's my open. If you love my opening statements, you will love my new book, \"New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And here reaction to my open and all the developing news in the Florida recount drama, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz joins me now. All right, good evening, Congressman. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

After the judge ruled that they had to allow us to inspect the information by 7:00 that night, I showed up with Governor Scott's lawyers to try to see if we could learn more and we were stood away.

      "utterance": "Breaking tonight, Florida's Secretary of State orders a recount in the state's key Senate and Governor races while Democrat Andrew Gillum withdraws his concession in the Governor's race. Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for keeping \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals\" on \"New York Times\" bestsellers list for over three straight months. We've got a big show on deck for you tonight with all the late breaking details on the Florida recount, plus live reaction from Congressman Matt Gaetz, Corey Lewandowski, Katrina Pierson and Brian Kilmeade to name a few. But first, my open. There is a clear double standard between the left and the right. Behavior that you only see on the left and not the right. If you need further proof that there is a double standard, that the left has brain washed society, look no further than Florida. The fraud going on in Florida as an acceptable solution to our election process is the last straw. How after four days are the same two counties that we have repeatedly had trouble with in the past still able to say their election is not final. How is that possible? How is that okay? As I speak to you, Florida's Secretary of State has officially declared a recount for Governor and United States Senator in Florida on election night though both Republicans were declared the winners over their Democrat opponents. Republican Rick Scott was declared the winner over Democrat Bill Nelson for Florida's US Senate seat. Republican Congressman Ron deSantis was declared winner against Democrat Andrew Gillum, a local mayor. But tonight, everything is in flux. Democrat Gillum, the lose candidate who conceded on election night has just today officially pulled back his concession to Republican Ron deSantis. So what's going on? The Democrats are refusing to accept the declared results of the national media. Theirs is a double standard You say we lost, we will say we won, and in the words of DNC lawyer Marc Elias, an operative from Clinton Fusion GPS Christopher Steele fraudulent dossier intended also to disenfranchise us on the national presidential election, we'll do a recount and we will win. So how do they do this? Lo and behold, they find missing ballots. And where do they finds these ballots? In deep blue counties run by Democrats in Florida, Broward and Palm Beach. Now, Broward and Palm Beach Counties may sounds familiar to you because in 2000, there was a hand recount in Palm Beach County because the Democrats didn't want to accept the results of a presidential election. In 2006, there was another recount started by the Democrats. In 2016, another recount and in 2018, another recount in the same two counties. Now, folks, there are 3,141 counties and county equivalents in the United States. So you tell me how 3,139 counties can get their votes in 30 minutes after the polls close, but not these two. The other counties get it right. There is even a county that suffered a category 4 hurricane in Florida that was able to turn in their ballots 30 minutes after the election, but these same two deep blue Democrat controlled counties in Florida where Republicans won in the two most of important races can't get their act together. But it's not the first time. There is one person who seems to be at the center of this, a Ms. Brenda Snipes, the election supervisor in Broward County shown here. Now you know about Brenda because in 2016, a judge called her out for destroying ballots that benefited her friend, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. So election night, Broward reports thousands of votes, 634,000 and now there are reportedly thousands more votes. You're kidding, right? A primer. Every county is supposed to hand in all early voting and absentee balance lots within 30 minutes of the polls closing. Most counties already count those ballots before election night. But now in a lawsuit brought against Ms. Snipes, Governor Scott argues it's Snipes who is refusing to comply with the campaign request for voter and ballot information. At an emergency hearing yesterday in Florida, the Governor asked the court to have ordered Ms. Snipes turn over records detailing how she counts and collects ballots. Snipes, as might be expected is refusing to turn over the records, saying it's inappropriate for a court to intervene this time simply because Scott wants the counting process sped up. What is even more outrageous is that after Snipes destroyed ballots illegally in the 2016 election, her premature destruction of the ballots under court review in the pending lawsuit was described as unlawful and in violation of the Public Records Act. That court in 2016 cited a similar case where the individual was dismissed, saying dismissal under these circumstances is an appropriate sanction. But the court went even beyond saying that about Snipes. They said her violation was twofold. Number one, Snipes violated state and Federal retention requirements, and number two, Snipes violated the affirmative responsibility to preserve evidence. Why was this woman not fired? Yet today, Ms. Snipes lives on to mess up yet another, or overturn yet another election in Florida. And if that's not enough to infuriate you, after the court's decision about Ms. Snipes, the state of Florida announced it would be monitoring Broward's 2018 election. Now, let me tell you what a mess we are in. There are reportedly thousands of newfound ballots. Each one is five pages long. Do you think a woman who doesn't tally or canvass along the way loses thousands of ballots, who doesn't want to turn them in within 30 minutes after the polls are closed like 3,139 other counties, too, should be trusted? Do you think she should be allowed to view five times, because that's how long the ballots are, five pages, of thousands and thousands of missing ballots? Folks, this is lunacy. Voter fraud is insidious. It causes people to think their vote doesn't matter, but it's worse than that, folks. There are reportedly transcripts now that prove that when the Democrats say they want every vote counted, they mean it. Yes, that's what I said. But it's not just your votes, it's illegal votes that some lawyers in these canvassing hearings for Democrats want counted. A report out today says lawyers for Democrats Gillum and Nelson are objecting to the rejection of votes cast by non-citizens. So when a lawyer for Democrats, Marc Elias famous for his role in the dossier creation that was an attempt to disenfranchise our duly elected President says he's going down to Florida to win, he should have added, by any means. That's my open. If you love my opening statements, you will love my new book, \"New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And here reaction to my open and all the developing news in the Florida recount drama, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz joins me now. All right, good evening, Congressman."

It's like a banana republic and when you have got supervisors of elections that violate transparency laws, which stand in the way of the constitutional rights of Floridians to see information, then you undermine our confidence in the election process, that's why getting the records, getting the ballots and getting a just result is so important to all of us."

What is that about?"

In Broward County, they simply ignored those laws and then when we tried to use our Public Records Act to get information, they stood in the way. After the judge ruled that they had to allow us to inspect the information by 7:00 that night, I showed up with Governor Scott's lawyers to try to see if we could learn more and we were stood away. We were told to come back at 10:00 the next morning. So time and again, you see the supervisor of elections violating court orders, violating state statutes and that is the type of thing that allows fraud to grow. The good news, Judge --"

He is under half a point, but our expectation is, there could be - yes, his margin of victory is beyond the scope of any fraud. So he will have a machine recount. We have no objection to that whatsoever. We want every legitimate legal vote to be counted."

Would you please tell me why this woman was not dismissed given the fact that the judge's decision suggests she should be and we have Rick Scott, the Governor who should have dismissed her who is now suffering because he didn't dismiss her as a candidate for Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Brenda Snipes is either too stupid or too corrupt to be running elections and counting ballots in Florida. The case you laid out is compelling. The reasons for her removal are just irrefutable. Unfortunately, Governor Scott hasn't used his authority to suspend her and put the state supervisor of elections in charge of this office so that we can find what the hell is going on in Broward County. So I think there's plenty of basis for removal, there is legal authority allow that would allow the Governor to remove Dr. Snipes and there is a court order that she violated yesterday. So I think that we should not be waiting around any longer to see if new trucks show up with new ballots or who knows what other shenanigans could be possible. We need to have all the cards face up ..."

It could have been furniture they were moving in the middle of the night, but when I tried to videotape it, there were armed police that said that I was a safety hazard and I was not allowed to videotape what was being moved in and out of the Broward supervisor of elections office at night."

This one in New Mexico where my next guest has not yet conceded in her race for that's state's southern second district congressional seat. She believes the race is being stolen away.

      "speaker": "HERRELL",

We have seen it in New Mexico. But we've also seen it in Arizona. We see in Arizona where Martha McSally, the congresswoman who is running for the retiring seat of Jeff Flake was up by about 24,000 votes on election night, now all of a sudden, the Democrats are saying they are finding more votes and she is down 9,000 votes. It's a swing of 35,000 votes and there are thousands more votes in Maricopa County that haven't been counted. Now, they are saying that a woman who is probably going to be t declared the victor on election night, Martha McSally is probably going to lose that race. Now, in Florida, here is what you see, I know it's the home of Mickey Mouse, but talk about a Mickey Mouse operation in Broward County, I mean, this is ridiculous. Look, Ron deSantis, his recount is going to be perfunctory. He has a recount that is going to go through the machine ..."

I can't believe in 2018 with all the ballot integrity issues that we talked about in the last election cycle, all of the outside influence, all of the supposed people who are trying to influence the election and trying to break into our election system, we still have people in Florida who can't count to the number two in the number of ballots that were cast.

And the state said, we are now going to monitor Broward in 2018. Is the state incompetent?

Donald Trump won it in an overwhelming fashion against Crooked H, but we know it's going to be competitive in 2020 and if Democrats are going to be controlling areas like Palm Beach County and Broward County where the plurality of the Democrat votes are coming in, it remind me of Texas when LBJ ran.

That's where it seems to be all the problems are.

Rick Scott should actually be thanking the incompetence of the Broward County commissioner who designed a ballot that caused 25,000 people in a heavily Democratic district not to vote for US Senate in that race. If there is any wrongdoing there, that was it. It was not intentional, I don't think. But if the machine recount doesn't count those, people then just skipped over it because of a poor ballot design and that might just make Rick Scott the US Senator probably would make a difference in this race."

Every vote should count. Now we are hearing that illegals are voting. And if you look at what happened in Broward Country today, they have illegal ballots mixed with provisional good ballots, so they don't know which one is which in these boxes. You had a citizen just stumble upon a Broward Country election equipment including a box of provisional ballots? That was completely unattended that were turned in today. I think it's pretty obvious, what's happening here. Yes, we can do a recount by machine, but the goal here is to find enough votes to get the margin close enough to do a hand count because as every good socialist and communist knows, it's not about the number of votes that get to determine the election, it's who counts them and that's what they are going for."

But all of these allegations that are being thrown around are just not founded on anything. The Secretary of State and the police that were sent there by Governor Scott both said that there has been no wrongdoing there."

This is not her first election either. So she just what? Suddenly did the wrong ballot? She created a bad ballot? No, that's not what's happening here. They are not even reporting the numbers to the office in the required amount of time. They are not being transparent here. Again, all of the other counties can seem to manage to get this done, but they can't? You have to pretend to not know what's going on in order to make the argument, Chris, something is not right in Broward County and they need to get to the bottom of it, wouldn't you agree?"

Now keep in mind, yes, it was 70, I get it, but they say, if you - they are going now do a recount by machine. They're going to get that done by next week. They say the 12,500, you may think it's smaller than it was, and you're right, but for this to be overturned it would be five times larger than any recount in history. For the most of part that you will never get 12,500 votes to flip on a machine recount or a hand recount."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Well, here is the thing, they are only going to hand recount after the machine recount. They are only going to be looking at under votes and over votes. Under votes meaning, no governor and under votes meaning, they didn't check the box for Senator because it was down to the left and they only checked the box for Republicans. So they believe the under votes, over votes after the machine votes. They think they are going to be fine. They are disturbed beyond disturbed, but they think they have steadied the ship and they are optimistic that things are going to be okay, deSantis is fine at 36,000."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's my understanding that deSantis and fine and you know the thing that aggravates me is when you hear about incompetence in this Brenda Snipes and she is still there. Rick Scott could have fired her, but he didn't, I don't know why he didn't, but he didn't and now he's suffering the consequences."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "A couple of things. You know this better than I will ever know this. But I did talk to this guy, and I said, why wouldn't you fire her, appointed by Jeb Bush but she wins reelection, to go in and fire somebody that was into elected office is much more difficult than going into IBM and saying Mr. Vice President you are gone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But, Brian, here's the bottom line, when you have a judge in a case who is willing to not only outline the laws she violated and say she is guilty - she has violated those laws, but then reference another case saying it's the kind that's appropriate for dismissal, the guy is giving them runway for that. But I want to talk about your book for one second. Now, you have got this \"New York Times\" best seller \"Andrew Jackson.\" They compare him to Donald Trump. But you, when you see what's going on in America today, we've got half of the country this way, half of the country the other way, people are at each other's houses, yelling in their face. Congress people like Maxine Waters, you make a crowd, you get them out. Is this as bad as it's going to get?"

We actually weren't supposed to exist in the Revolutionary War. A mysterious fog rolls in and allows George Washington's army to get out. In 1812, they burned the Capital to the ground. Now, 5 foot 3 inches President is sitting on his horse by himself, he doesn't know if his wife survived ..."

Andrew Jackson did in the Battle of New Orleans, reversed everything. If you understand where we came from, you will not panic. We are the number one economy with the number one military. Everyone is trying to get here. Still, things have never been better. They could be better because we always want to be better that's part of democracy. We fight in public and people think we are coming apart. That's just the way we do things. Are there rough patches? Yes. We'll come through it.

If it wasn't for this kid, this 41-year-old self-taught military general who was able to take his army of 1,200 and make it 5,000 and feed an army of 9,000 in 45 minutes, we would not be the same country."

With record low African-american unemployment and a thriving economy, Donald Trump has been stealing African-american voters away from the Dems. But should he have more support from the African-American community? And what will this all mean for 2020? Joining me now, Director of Urban Engagement at Turning Point USA, Brandon Tatum.

You know, some of the polls that we have seen and we have one here that's quite old actually, it shows that President Trump's approval among black voters is at 14%; disapproval, 86%. Now that's Pew and that's from June - July, August, September, October, November - like five months ago. Do you have any numbers like that? What is the standing given all the benefits to the African-Americans have been making under this President?"

    {
      "speaker": "TATUM",
      "utterance": "Well, one of the polls that I like to look at on the Rasmussen poll was one of the most accurate polls in 2016 has the African-American support at 36%, double from last year. So I mean, people can talk about polls all they want to, I like the polls, I support it. But the polls don't really tell the true number of support and I have seen firsthand African-American support increase from my social media to people that I talk to every day. Young black leadership, 400 leaders going to the White House a couple of weeks ago. I can see the enthusiasm in the black community, and I think it is just going to grow exponentially as we go forward."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, let's assume that the number is somewhere between Pew and the one that you quote. It still should be higher and because African- Americans have never had the benefits of employment as they have under this President who campaigned under what have you got to lose? What else does the President need to do to get more African-Americans to actually admit that they believe in this guy and the economy that he has created?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TATUM",
      "utterance": "There is three major things that the President needs to do. First thing, this is non-negotiable, prison reform has to get done. We cannot have just verbiage or rhetoric alone. We have to get there is done, have to get it handled. African-American people need relief from policies that were implemented from Bill Clinton in the 1994 crime bill. I mean, those things need to be reversed. We need to support black leaders going who are going out, going into the community, wanting to be political, activists or people who are going to run for office at some point. Someone like John James who is a tremendous candidate. We have to promote those. And the President, he has to be strong in his rhetoric and support who for grassroots organizations like Blexit, organizations like what we have ..."

It's an opportunity for young African-American people who are sick and tired of the Democrats failing them time and time again, we are going to exit and not only are we going to exit the Democratic Party, but we have to go to something sustainable, and I think the President is on to a good start, but he has to improve."
