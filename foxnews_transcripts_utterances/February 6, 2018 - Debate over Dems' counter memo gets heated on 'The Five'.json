Adam Schiff will run to the podium, probably like pull a leg muscle trying to get there in time to be like, look at this, like show it's all redacted. So, it's a made-for-TV moment and that's what they're hoping for to say it's so bad and damaging for the president, wants to keep all of this out, to keep it from the American people, only wants to release what's favorable to him. He did this as an attempt to distract, that's the argument of what they'll say. So, there is a little bit of a risk, you can't release one, really, and not release the other."

It should be released in the name of transparency, which was the argument last week about releasing the Devin Nunes memo. The only problem there was, of course, that there was so much classified information not attached so it's hard to fully gauge whether or not they're making a serious case or it's just about discrediting the FBI, the department of justice and undermining the Mueller investigation. In this case, you also have questions about classified information that's attached. And the issue for me is once you agree to let out the Republican memo, how can you not let out the Democrats response? And the only issue here it seems is whether or not President Trump, feeling that he's being intentionally lured into a trap, decides no, I'm not going to do it, and doesn't give a hoot what anybody has to say even though he's the one, by the way, who put on the dog and pony show that started this."

I don't trust Schiff. He's a proven liar and a leaker. Remember he leaked the Don Jr. testimony that blew up in his face when he got the date wrong. And then, he said this Nunes memo was going to jeopardize national security, it was going to compromise methods, and it was going to be tampered with. All of those things were not true. So he's trying to trap the president into redacting something that makes him look like an obstructer. Who knows what the president is going to do. He's going to side on the side of national security. They know they have to play games because they can't address the abuse that they undertook at their own justice department and FBI. Now, the real collusion is with Hillary and the Russians. She was the one that paid for an agent to go to Russia. She was the one that paid for fake Russian dirt, and she was the one that paid for the wiretap on the Trump campaign. Comey better lawyer up because Comey knew that it was unverified and salacious. Comey testified to the senate that it was unverified and salacious. Yet, he was the one that brought this unverified and salacious document to the FISA judge. That is against the law. You cannot present unverified information to a FISA judge. So he's in big trouble. Also, why did he deliver this unverified document to president-elect Trump when he knew Hillary paid for it but didn't tell the president-elect that Hillary paid for it? And the day after he briefed the president on the dossier, it leaks. Very suspicious. He should maybe stop writing his book and lawyer up."

And it had to refresh my memory on this because it's always around terror cases up until President Trump was elected. And as you know, Kimberly, the judge sits there by himself.

So there's two things that's going to be very interesting to find out in this 10-page memo. Number one, they say they're going to put in context Andrew McCabe's statement when he came out and said we would not have gotten this FISA warrant without the dossier. They say it's taken out of context but the quote is accurate. So I can't wait to see how they put that in context. I guess through laughter or something. I'm not sure. The second thing is the footnote at the bottom of the page that says it was a political organization that paid for the dossier where it didn't say Hillary for America or Democratic National Committee or anything.

We'll show the government down. They'll shoot themselves in the foot twice. They did it before. They'll probably do it again. Trump is going to stare them down and they're going to blink.

Republicans didn't stand up for Obama. I actually think that for the media, though, in covering it incessantly, it just kind of makes his point that it's ridiculous. There are so many big issues. Like one of them I couldn't even get to today on the 2 p.m. show, in Syria, Assad has been using chlorine gas against his own people. And we have a big decision to make in this country.

It's part of putting on an outstanding show, which gets him big ratings and big crowds. That's why it's not just a political rally to see him. You never know what he's going to say. But I was able to see other politicians that we know who have said things very similar. Like Joe Biden. Biden says of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, \"They bet against America all the time.\" Like Paul Krugman, that famed economist: \"GOP opposing global warming legislation is treasonous.\" David Plouffe, who got President Obama elected twice, says \"House GOP committing acts of treason by shutting the government down.\" This has been -- this have been a common phrase.
