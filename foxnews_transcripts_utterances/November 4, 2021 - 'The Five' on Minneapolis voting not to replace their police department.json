The truly ironic part of this is that for decades, the left has capitalized on the cry. What about the children? Whenever a Republican did anything, what about the children? The climate, what about the children? Greta. Poor Greta, they are having nightmares as children. And then when it came to education, they abandoned the kids and the Republicans took it and ran. It's -- and the Republican, maybe it's not even Republicans, just parents in general were legitimately asking, what about my children? And that is what did it. And you saw this is kind of the tea party for parents. Finally -- or not finally, because I might go for about 17 minutes, the Lincoln Project has to face a reckoning. Because you could argue that it would not have turned out this way if it wasn't for that hoax that they perpetuated with those -- with the tiki torches and tried to paint Youngkin as a racist, because that's really, really, really hurt the Democrats. I think the Democrats have learned, if you go to bed with unstable perverts, you are going to wake up with more than fleas. You're going to wake up with a Republican governor and you got -- you have the Lincoln Project to blame. Lastly, lastly, the Democrats seem to learn a lesson from 2016. It wasn't the Republicans that elected Trump, it was the Democrats and their policies which were distinctly, to your point, anti-American and woke. They didn't learn it this time either. They should've said, look, we're are going to lose if we repeat ourselves and do it again. And that's what they did with the help of, you know, Lincoln Project, CNN, MSNBC. They elected Youngkin. And I think the Democrats should like learn from the Republicans, or at least embrace divided government. Like, the Republicans know that Democrats make them better, because you've got to work harder. The Democrats should feel the same way.

We've already gotten rid of something like 250 police officers who have left the force, so there's an uptick in crime in Minneapolis. The intercity doesn't want the police to be defunded and the number reduced. And instead what we have are people like Ilhan Omar and Keith Ellison saying that, let's get rid of the police. No, the people don't want that. Fifty-seven percent don't want that. And across the country people are saying this no cash bail doesn't work. We can't get rid of the police. They are the ones who are defending us. And so, this is, you know, we're chap and CHAZ and all these anti-police and anti-American locations were.

The truly ironic part of this is that for decades, the left has capitalized on the cry. What about the children? Whenever a Republican did anything, what about the children? The climate, what about the children? Greta. Poor Greta, they are having nightmares as children. And then when it came to education, they abandoned the kids and the Republicans took it and ran. It's -- and the Republican, maybe it's not even Republicans, just parents in general were legitimately asking, what about my children? And that is what did it. And you saw this is kind of the tea party for parents. Finally -- or not finally, because I might go for about 17 minutes, the Lincoln Project has to face a reckoning. Because you could argue that it would not have turned out this way if it wasn't for that hoax that they perpetuated with those -- with the tiki torches and tried to paint Youngkin as a racist, because that's really, really, really hurt the Democrats. I think the Democrats have learned, if you go to bed with unstable perverts, you are going to wake up with more than fleas. You're going to wake up with a Republican governor and you got -- you have the Lincoln Project to blame. Lastly, lastly, the Democrats seem to learn a lesson from 2016. It wasn't the Republicans that elected Trump, it was the Democrats and their policies which were distinctly, to your point, anti-American and woke. They didn't learn it this time either. They should've said, look, we're are going to lose if we repeat ourselves and do it again. And that's what they did with the help of, you know, Lincoln Project, CNN, MSNBC. They elected Youngkin. And I think the Democrats should like learn from the Republicans, or at least embrace divided government. Like, the Republicans know that Democrats make them better, because you've got to work harder. The Democrats should feel the same way. But they don't, they just want to be the only party, hence this disaster."

All right? And that's how America works. So now what we have are a few naysayers who want to get rid of police departments. We've already gotten rid of something like 250 police officers who have left the force, so there's an uptick in crime in Minneapolis. The intercity doesn't want the police to be defunded and the number reduced. And instead what we have are people like Ilhan Omar and Keith Ellison saying that, let's get rid of the police. No, the people don't want that. Fifty-seven percent don't want that. And across the country people are saying this no cash bail doesn't work. We can't get rid of the police. They are the ones who are defending us. And so, this is, you know, we're chap and CHAZ and all these anti-police and anti-American locations were.

They listened to a few screamers on the streets. They took a slogan and they put it into law. And that caused a huge crime wave. And then when they put it to the people in a proposition, the people rejected it. They refunded the police. Now, Dana, how many times in the history of this great nation have the politicians done the opposite of what the people wanted? You could say that the history of this country is that.
