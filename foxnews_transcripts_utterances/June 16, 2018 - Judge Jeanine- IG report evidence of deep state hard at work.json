      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. And thank you once again for making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. Kellyanne Conway, Congressman Ron DeSantis, Anthony Scaramucci and Tomi Lahren are among my guests tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, a very important opening statement. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I am a believer. I believe in the system and I believe in justice. I dedicated more than 30 years to the criminal justice system and the assignment of blame. Tonight I am not angry. I am just dumbfounded, disheartened and disappointed over the long awaited, often delayed Inspector General's report on the actions of the Department of Justice and the FBI in the handling of the Clinton e-mail investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The report's conclusion, 568 pages later, FBI Director James Comey was insubordinate. There were a few mistakes and a few errors in judgment, and although there was some bias, there was no evidence of bias in the handling of the e-mail investigation. This report mimics Comey's conclusions in the email case itself. Both the Inspector General and Comey make out a provable case, then conclude there is no case. Nothing changes. The deep state hard at work. I don't know about you, but I am so tired of lessons learned. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They say Comey deviated from the rules, deviated from the rules? Comey and his FBI cabal fixed a case. Hillary not indicted for her crimes yet an effort to frame Donald Trump for no crime. And no bias in the conclusion because no one said \"Yes, I was biased,\" or said simply \"I am not biased.\" That's it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Every day in this country, murder cases are tried for where there is no admission of guilt, and only denials. And yet, jurors decide the accused intentions based on what they say, what they do what they don't do. Determining someone's intent is not that difficult. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Intent can be determined like this, take a look at these texts. \"We'll stop him from being president.\" It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die when you are 40. Hillary should win 100 million to zero. \"America will get what the public deserves.\" And let's add a new one folks, from an FBI lawyer. \"Viva la resistance.\" Gee, isn't that Obama and Hillary's mantra. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand those statements. They not only indicate a biased hateful state of mind, they imply unequivocally a willingness to take official action to impact the election. How do you pledge resistance against the President while you are investigating him, and the inspector general says, there was no evidence of improper considerations impacting the investigation? Folks, Comey didn't just deviate from well-established practices. He didn't even do an investigation. He covered for it by having the same people handle both the Hillary case and the Trump frame up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Folks, it doesn't happen this way. This case is not about mistakes or errors in judgment. It's about a deep state trying to drag a crook across the presidential finish line and trying to destroy the man Americans wanted in the Oval Office. Example, Jim Comey said he had to step into Loretta Lynch's role because she wouldn't recuse herself after secretly meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac. That's baloney. He didn't just step into her role to prevent an injustice, he stepped in to her role to declare Hillary not guilty, and Jim if you are such a champion of truth and justice, why did you go along with Lynch calling a year-long criminal investigation a matter. Why did you say Hillary was extremely careless so as to not use the words grossly negligent, which would make her actions criminal and when brought before Congress, Jim, you punt and say, don't think grossly negligent applies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First-year law students across this country laughed at you. You take a case from normal field agents to investigate with no grand jury, no search warrant, no subpoenas and you give away immunities like candy with no requirement that those immunized testify against anyone. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Investigators across the country laughed at you. And when you found Hillary's deleted emails that were marked \"C\" for classified, you decide to believe her when she said it was only a reference to the letter \"C\" in the alphabet in spite of the fact there was no A or B before C. People in the intelligence community laughed at you, Jim, and when you wrote an exoneration of Hillary months before you interviewed her and 16 main witnesses saying it's done all the time, attorneys across the country laughed at you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Come on, Jim, you acquitted her because like Hillary, you, Lynch and even Obama communicated government information via private e-mails, and you placed as many Trump haters as you could like your friend Mueller in charge of the make believe Trump collusion on the case. I want to know from this Inspector General's report, why don't we know what judge signed the FISA warrant? Who renewed the FISA warrant? And what actions they are taking now, now that they know they were conned by a corrupt FBI agent? And why was Peter Strzok arguably the most of corrupt FBI agent in American political history put on the Mueller team to destroy Donald Trump with his girlfriend Lisa Page? Why is he still working and why am I paying his salary? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why is Rod Rosenstein allowed to refuse to provide records and documents to Congress. And why is he allowed to threaten to subpoena records of those in Congress without any criminal investigation? Why Rosenstein didn't hand over the most of incriminating of all the texts, \"He won't win president. Don't worry, we'll stop him.\" A clear and unequivocal attempt to obstruct a Presidential campaign. Why are the DOJ and the FBI allowed to lie to a Federal judge and say, \"We have no e-mails between us on the Loretta Lynch- Bill Clinton tarmac meeting.\" Why can Loretta Lynch lie and use a personal e-mail and a fake name for government business? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tell me how many times does someone have to lie to an Inspector General before they are just not believable? Why does Hillary Clinton just days after she meets Bill the attorney general on that tarmac say she will keep Loretta Lynch on as AG if she wins as president? We are not stupid, and why does the IG not recommend a leaked prosecution when there are 65 phone calls from a reporter to a top FBI official? Why did Christopher Wray have to be brought to the White House to be convinced that McCabe needs to go? Isn't the FBI supposed to figure that stuff out on its own? I am worried. I am really worried. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This report is nothing more than a white wash of the deep state by the deep state itself. There are great people in the FBI -- men and women -- and I have had the honor of working with them. But they are embarrassed because they know how bad Comey and company destroyed America's confidence and that esteemed FBI. And there are great people in government, many of whom you have seen on this show. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Congressman Ron deDantis, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Devin Nunes, Lee Zeldin, Matt Gates, Andy Biggs, Senators Lindsey Graham, Ron Johnson, Chuck Grassley. These people are fighting the deep state as obstructionist Democrats like Pelosi, Schumer and Schiff stare into the cameras and turn truth on its head. They are not real Democrats, they are demon rats. That's what I said, demon rats. And until the Republicans learn to fight like they do and go with a narrative no one veers from, they and socialism will run amok in this country. We need people in Washington who believe in truth and justice and are not offended by the term law and order and believe in consequences. This is not a banana republic. This is the United States of America with a justice system that needs to be protected. It's time for those people who are not interested in supporting President Trump to get out of his way and that means you, Jeff Sessions. It's time for to you put on your big boy pants and start acting like the AG, and if you can't get on board with this President, then get the hell out of his way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let me be clear to all you critics. I am not looking for that job. I am an ordinary American who was brought up to believe in truth and justice. And like thousands and hundreds of thousands of men and women in law enforcement, we are just damn embarrassed and hang our heads in shame with the likes of Comey and his cabal as well as the impotent inspector general's report which is nothing more than proof the deep state is alive and well in Washington, DC. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine. Now, joining me now to react to my opening and all of the development this week, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right, Kellyane, good evening. I am very disturbed by the inspector general's report. What is your take on it?",

      "sentences": "Everyone should be disturbed and I am very disappointed that so many people just want to react rather than report. Really dig through all 550-plus pages, Jeanine because there is so much to unpack here, and people really should not just cherry pick the results of this report depending on their political point of view or conclusions that are in search of evidence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They really should be very disturbed in unison that we have people at the top echelon in the FBI, not the rank and file, good and decent men and women who do their job well every day, at the tippy top of the FBI, really trying to tip the scales. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, they lack such political instincts. They didn't see the Donald Trump revolution coming. They of course view what Hillary Clinton did a month or so later, which is insult his followers. Call into question their intelligence and mental fitness. Who they are. These are cultural leaks in the deep state under our nose, people laugh sometimes and flick it away when folks talk about the deep state, it is right there. Read the inspector general's report. Now, this should be the beginning, not the end perhaps of this conversation. Folks can ask -- I think they can ask Mr. Horowitz for more information. Congress if they are interested in learning more, they can certainly continue to pursue this and perhaps, they should in the interest of transparency and accountability. Jeanine, let me make very clear, folks, don't kids yourselves, we would know zero, we would know none of this if Hillary Clinton had been elected, and not Donald Trump. You wouldn't know what was going on at the tippy top echelon of the FBI. And who the heck was giving Jim Comey a hero's welcome two short months ago for this silly book about leadership and morality of all things. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I don't need a lecture from Jim Comey about loyalty, morality, and leadership. It's embarrassing that people killed the fatted calf and rolled out the red carpet for his book tour when yet again, we see him putting himself before the process, a grandstanding, showboating, but more importantly, subverting the process. He was insubordinate and he went outside of Loretta Lynch's, the attorney general's responsibilities, I think, to act on his own and people should be very concerned about all of that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. And thank you once again for making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. Kellyanne Conway, Congressman Ron DeSantis, Anthony Scaramucci and Tomi Lahren are among my guests tonight. But first, a very important opening statement. I am a believer. I believe in the system and I believe in justice. I dedicated more than 30 years to the criminal justice system and the assignment of blame. Tonight I am not angry. I am just dumbfounded, disheartened and disappointed over the long awaited, often delayed Inspector General's report on the actions of the Department of Justice and the FBI in the handling of the Clinton e-mail investigation. The report's conclusion, 568 pages later, FBI Director James Comey was insubordinate. There were a few mistakes and a few errors in judgment, and although there was some bias, there was no evidence of bias in the handling of the e-mail investigation. This report mimics Comey's conclusions in the email case itself. Both the Inspector General and Comey make out a provable case, then conclude there is no case. Nothing changes. The deep state hard at work. I don't know about you, but I am so tired of lessons learned. They say Comey deviated from the rules, deviated from the rules? Comey and his FBI cabal fixed a case. Hillary not indicted for her crimes yet an effort to frame Donald Trump for no crime. And no bias in the conclusion because no one said \"Yes, I was biased,\" or said simply \"I am not biased.\" That's it. Every day in this country, murder cases are tried for where there is no admission of guilt, and only denials. And yet, jurors decide the accused intentions based on what they say, what they do what they don't do. Determining someone's intent is not that difficult. Intent can be determined like this, take a look at these texts. \"We'll stop him from being president.\" It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die when you are 40. Hillary should win 100 million to zero. \"America will get what the public deserves.\" And let's add a new one folks, from an FBI lawyer. \"Viva la resistance.\" Gee, isn't that Obama and Hillary's mantra. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand those statements. They not only indicate a biased hateful state of mind, they imply unequivocally a willingness to take official action to impact the election. How do you pledge resistance against the President while you are investigating him, and the inspector general says, there was no evidence of improper considerations impacting the investigation? Folks, Comey didn't just deviate from well-established practices. He didn't even do an investigation. He covered for it by having the same people handle both the Hillary case and the Trump frame up. Folks, it doesn't happen this way. This case is not about mistakes or errors in judgment. It's about a deep state trying to drag a crook across the presidential finish line and trying to destroy the man Americans wanted in the Oval Office. Example, Jim Comey said he had to step into Loretta Lynch's role because she wouldn't recuse herself after secretly meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac. That's baloney. He didn't just step into her role to prevent an injustice, he stepped in to her role to declare Hillary not guilty, and Jim if you are such a champion of truth and justice, why did you go along with Lynch calling a year-long criminal investigation a matter. Why did you say Hillary was extremely careless so as to not use the words grossly negligent, which would make her actions criminal and when brought before Congress, Jim, you punt and say, don't think grossly negligent applies. First-year law students across this country laughed at you. You take a case from normal field agents to investigate with no grand jury, no search warrant, no subpoenas and you give away immunities like candy with no requirement that those immunized testify against anyone. Investigators across the country laughed at you. And when you found Hillary's deleted emails that were marked \"C\" for classified, you decide to believe her when she said it was only a reference to the letter \"C\" in the alphabet in spite of the fact there was no A or B before C. People in the intelligence community laughed at you, Jim, and when you wrote an exoneration of Hillary months before you interviewed her and 16 main witnesses saying it's done all the time, attorneys across the country laughed at you. Come on, Jim, you acquitted her because like Hillary, you, Lynch and even Obama communicated government information via private e-mails, and you placed as many Trump haters as you could like your friend Mueller in charge of the make believe Trump collusion on the case. I want to know from this Inspector General's report, why don't we know what judge signed the FISA warrant? Who renewed the FISA warrant? And what actions they are taking now, now that they know they were conned by a corrupt FBI agent? And why was Peter Strzok arguably the most of corrupt FBI agent in American political history put on the Mueller team to destroy Donald Trump with his girlfriend Lisa Page? Why is he still working and why am I paying his salary? Why is Rod Rosenstein allowed to refuse to provide records and documents to Congress. And why is he allowed to threaten to subpoena records of those in Congress without any criminal investigation? Why Rosenstein didn't hand over the most of incriminating of all the texts, \"He won't win president. Don't worry, we'll stop him.\" A clear and unequivocal attempt to obstruct a Presidential campaign. Why are the DOJ and the FBI allowed to lie to a Federal judge and say, \"We have no e-mails between us on the Loretta Lynch- Bill Clinton tarmac meeting.\" Why can Loretta Lynch lie and use a personal e-mail and a fake name for government business? Tell me how many times does someone have to lie to an Inspector General before they are just not believable? Why does Hillary Clinton just days after she meets Bill the attorney general on that tarmac say she will keep Loretta Lynch on as AG if she wins as president? We are not stupid, and why does the IG not recommend a leaked prosecution when there are 65 phone calls from a reporter to a top FBI official? Why did Christopher Wray have to be brought to the White House to be convinced that McCabe needs to go? Isn't the FBI supposed to figure that stuff out on its own? I am worried. I am really worried. This report is nothing more than a white wash of the deep state by the deep state itself. There are great people in the FBI -- men and women -- and I have had the honor of working with them. But they are embarrassed because they know how bad Comey and company destroyed America's confidence and that esteemed FBI. And there are great people in government, many of whom you have seen on this show. Congressman Ron deDantis, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Devin Nunes, Lee Zeldin, Matt Gates, Andy Biggs, Senators Lindsey Graham, Ron Johnson, Chuck Grassley. These people are fighting the deep state as obstructionist Democrats like Pelosi, Schumer and Schiff stare into the cameras and turn truth on its head. They are not real Democrats, they are demon rats. That's what I said, demon rats. And until the Republicans learn to fight like they do and go with a narrative no one veers from, they and socialism will run amok in this country. We need people in Washington who believe in truth and justice and are not offended by the term law and order and believe in consequences. This is not a banana republic. This is the United States of America with a justice system that needs to be protected. It's time for those people who are not interested in supporting President Trump to get out of his way and that means you, Jeff Sessions. It's time for to you put on your big boy pants and start acting like the AG, and if you can't get on board with this President, then get the hell out of his way. Let me be clear to all you critics. I am not looking for that job. I am an ordinary American who was brought up to believe in truth and justice. And like thousands and hundreds of thousands of men and women in law enforcement, we are just damn embarrassed and hang our heads in shame with the likes of Comey and his cabal as well as the impotent inspector general's report which is nothing more than proof the deep state is alive and well in Washington, DC. That's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine. Now, joining me now to react to my opening and all of the development this week, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. All right, Kellyane, good evening. I am very disturbed by the inspector general's report. What is your take on it?"

    {
      "speaker": "KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Everyone should be disturbed and I am very disappointed that so many people just want to react rather than report. Really dig through all 550-plus pages, Jeanine because there is so much to unpack here, and people really should not just cherry pick the results of this report depending on their political point of view or conclusions that are in search of evidence. They really should be very disturbed in unison that we have people at the top echelon in the FBI, not the rank and file, good and decent men and women who do their job well every day, at the tippy top of the FBI, really trying to tip the scales. By the way, they lack such political instincts. They didn't see the Donald Trump revolution coming. They of course view what Hillary Clinton did a month or so later, which is insult his followers. Call into question their intelligence and mental fitness. Who they are. These are cultural leaks in the deep state under our nose, people laugh sometimes and flick it away when folks talk about the deep state, it is right there. Read the inspector general's report. Now, this should be the beginning, not the end perhaps of this conversation. Folks can ask -- I think they can ask Mr. Horowitz for more information. Congress if they are interested in learning more, they can certainly continue to pursue this and perhaps, they should in the interest of transparency and accountability. Jeanine, let me make very clear, folks, don't kids yourselves, we would know zero, we would know none of this if Hillary Clinton had been elected, and not Donald Trump. You wouldn't know what was going on at the tippy top echelon of the FBI. And who the heck was giving Jim Comey a hero's welcome two short months ago for this silly book about leadership and morality of all things. I don't need a lecture from Jim Comey about loyalty, morality, and leadership. It's embarrassing that people killed the fatted calf and rolled out the red carpet for his book tour when yet again, we see him putting himself before the process, a grandstanding, showboating, but more importantly, subverting the process. He was insubordinate and he went outside of Loretta Lynch's, the attorney general's responsibilities, I think, to act on his own and people should be very concerned about all of that."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this, you know, for me and you're so right, I mean, I have read a lot of these 568 pages. I don't know how much it weighs, but the bottom line, Kellyanne is that they didn't make a criminal referral. They have said five FBI agents should be referred for disciplinary actions. Everybody is still working. No one is forced to be fired. There is no criminal referral as they did with McCabe. How do you think the American people are going to react to this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "I hope they will react because -- but only if this is given a little bit more oxygen. That is my initial point that there is not a ton of coverage on this IG Report in the mainstream media right now. A little bit here and there. They checked the box on it. But we deserve a deeper dive. Jeanine, you can't with a straight face credibly say that we've spent over -- well, actually two years, next month will be two years since the Russia investigation started. Just the Mueller investigation is a year old. If for two years they have been investigating something against this president that doesn't exist, and yet people think that we should all go spend all this money and go on indefinitely about that. We are here -- you actually have some information that should -- I think animate Americans to want to hear more. But it's being ignored by those -- and I think some in the media are uncomfortable that people in the media were accepting -- excuse me, giving tickets to games and meals to FBI agents. That's very uncomfortable."

I think we've got that tweet, yes, on the screen for a change. This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at three things -- high taxes, high crime and obstruction.\" What now -- there is going to be a meeting, Kellyanne on Capitol Hill on Tuesday regarding the whole issue of immigration. What do you think is going to happen?"

He wants to have a sovereign nation that has physical borders. He wants to build the wall, obviously, but he also wants catch and release to end. He wants a merit based immigration system. He wants more ICE agents. You know, the Democrats think what the president is trying to say there is that these Democrats refuse to provide the funding necessary so that you can expand the detention centers, that you have more ICE agents -- some common sense measures and they have been saying -- and by the way, Donald Trump got here a year and a half ago. The immigration issue including at the border has gone on for a long time and if the two Presidents before him tried to deal with it also, Operation Streamline under President George W. Bush and President Obama (inaudible) in 2014..."

It's insulting to people who have had families in concentration camps who then perished. But I want to put that very charged rhetoric aside and make the very clear point that this President, he brought Democrats to the White House. They held court for an hour. But all the Democrats wanted to talk about was DACA. They just wanted to talk about the Dreamers. They never raised this with him."

They were not really willing to draw the obvious conclusion on some of this stuff. Guys like Peter Strzok should be prosecuted. Let's look at this text message on August 8, Jeanine that we didn't have access before this where Lisa Page is going to Peter Strzok said, \"Trump can't be President, can he? Can he?\" And Strzok says, \"No. No, he can't. We'll stop it.\""

They never produced that text message to Congress. Somebody deleted it. The OIG and the report said that they were able to get it forensically."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "That message that we're just hearing about, hold on, the message that we are just hearing about was deleted?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "I think it was either withheld from production or the IG says they think it may have been deleted. Bottom line is, all of the other text messages from that day were produced. There was some human agency, I think that had to be involved to not produce that because all of those text messages were initially produced in 2017. Well what was happening in 2017? You had all the hoopla about the collusion investigation. Had this text message landed before Mueller was appointed and people see the guy who is running the whole thing said we are going to use it to stop Trump. That would have totally taken the blue out, so whether it was Strzok, whether it was Page, whether it was somebody else, we need to know who did that. To me, that was a major obstruction of justice."

      "utterance": "Congressman, listen, I am so fed up with this because you guys have been doing this with all due respect. And I gave you credit in my open. You know, I think you guys do a great thing. My viewers are fed up. They want to know why is there a different system of justice for the ordinary Americans than for them. They can destroy evidence. They can tamper with evidence. They can conceal evidence. They can change the rules. They get away with it and ordinary men -- look at Manafort. Not that I give a darn about Manafort. But this guy is in jail right now and people have violated the law and they are getting a check from us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge, you are looking at the person who wrote the original criminal referral to Sessions where I had 15 members of Congress join me to refer all these people, Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page. We've already referred them to the justice department. The OIG was not willing to do that. We did it in Congress. Sessions has not gotten back to us. So a lot of us are on the case, and I think this damning text message, the fact that it was not produced, to me that's obstruction whether it was Page, Strzok, somebody else in the bureau, we need to get that answer. We're happy to have Horowitz come testify. We are going to ask him about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes, but that's just so -- Congressman, okay, you're going to ask him about it. let's just assume that we find out that they actually you know, were obstructing, there is no one in the Justice Department to prosecute. There is no special -- second special counsel, and I have got to go. So you and I can talk until we're blue in the face, if there is no one at the Justice Department doing anything, what difference does it make to quote a very famous woman."

All right, Anthony, are you at all surprised by the IG Report which actually doesn't recommend any criminal charge or any further investigation. It just said, you know, there were a few errors in judgment when there are so many fundamental flaws that all went in the favor of Hillary Clinton. And I am not going to ask to you repeat the report. But where do we go from here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "The problem is that I am sure the President is probably disappointed with this report because it's not 100% accurate. They've sanitized and glossed over things that actually happened and so you are getting the teeny top tip of the iceberg, Judge, and what is down deep below that is a real manifestation of corruption against the Trump campaign, the candidate Trump, and then eventually when he was president. And so I think that Director Comey, I just find the sanctimony of his book, now, I have read the book in preparation for some interviews, and I went back to it tonight to look through the levels of sanctimony. He knew this report was coming out. He knew his friends in the FBI would protect him and sanitize this report. And I have got to tell you something, the president once again correct. He talked about people eavesdropping on him. They talked about informants or spies whatever you want to talk about. He made the right judgment in firing James Comey, despite the fire fight that ensued thereafter. And so for me, I am disappointed in the report, but I am not surprised, Judge that these people protect each other."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, you're not surprised. You're disappointed in the report. Everybody feels the same way. Where do we go from here? What do we have to do to change things so that people are accountable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I think this what the president is absolutely best at. And so, I think once he steps back and he digests all the information, my guess is he is going to appoint people that he trusts that are on both sides of the aisle for that matter and they are going to come up with a protocol to protect these agencies from these sinister rogue type people and so, my guess is by the end of the year or certainly maybe after the election, the president will probably have a protocol or a suggested protocol to use on a going forward basis to protect Republicans and Democrats. And so what you know being a judge, that we are all subject subservient to the rule of law in our country, the president knows that better than anybody and so it is going to be incumbent upon him and I believe it will be one of his legacies, Judge, that he returns the luster and the glory to these organizations that they deserve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, he can't do it -- Anthony, he cannot do it with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein running the place and if the Dems win the House, you know as well as I do what they plan to do. And so, we can't wait until after the election."

    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "No, I understand all that. But I do think that even if -- and by the way, I predict that we are going to keep the House. But even if we don't keep the House and they move for the nonsense towards impeachment, the President's poll numbers will likely get stronger. I mean, the American people are on to the political intrigue and the political shenanigans and the politics of personal destruction that take place in Washington. I think they believe the President and take him at his word that there was absolutely no collusion inside the campaign."

This president has said he has a zero tolerance policy for illegal immigration, yes, as Americans we feel for anybody that is crossing the border because we know this is the greatest nation on the face of the earth. However, this is a nation of law. So, I say to those parents and to those children, if you do not want to be separated, do not cross the border illegally. Follow our laws, follow the process. That's the best way to ensure that your family stays together."

You are following a procedure. It's at that point that this administration has decided to take those parents and separate them from the children. That not only violates international law, it violates Matthew 25, and anybody who believes in that should be ashamed of this policy."

Now, for those who are come across illegally -- wait let me finish the question, for those who are coming across illegally, and not seeking asylum, some of whom have already been deported who are bringing children. The law is the same as it was when Barack Obama was President, and Bush was president. So the president has not changed anything. In fact, this President offered the Democrats the opportunity to keep the -- some of the DACA kids here, 1.8 million of them and the Dems wouldn't go with it.

This is very important because I know you and many on your side of the aisle talk a lot about compassion, and I agreed with you when you show compassion as a Christian, I believe in that as well, but where is the compassion for American citizens? Where is the compassion for legal immigrants living in this country that expects the rule of law to be followed and expect border security and border enforcement? Where is the compassion for those individuals? Does that not exists because President Trump is going to make sure it exists and that is why we elected him?"

I believe in what you are saying about compassion but the thing is this, you can't have a nation without a border. We need to make sure the borders are secure. I know you are going to keep telling me that all of these individuals that are crossing the border are seeking asylum. But we know that that is not true. We have got 11 to 20 million illegal immigrants living in this country and those individuals are not seeking asylum. We have a problem at the border. This president has a zero tolerance policy for it, so if the Democrats want to come to the table. That's fine.

It's almost as if what they say when they are serious has become comedy and when they say, when they are trying to make a joke isn't very funny at all.

They are selectively talking about these deportation centers where allegedly, these kids are being held immorally. Now, look, you have to remember, a lot of the images that were spread on the internet of these were during the Obama administration. Where was Chelsea Handler calling out President Obama back in 2014? Was she down there picketing and protesting? Hey, Nancy Pelosi, were you there visiting with the rest of your Democrat colleagues when all of these images were actually taken? Of course not. They are using selective outrage on a very particular issue that they want to try to drum up outrage and hatred in support of this president, you know why? Because he's succeeding across the board. He is the most successful president in our lifetime. He's bringing peace to the world. The economy is roaring. They have to pick some micro issue that by the way, President Obama ignored himself."
