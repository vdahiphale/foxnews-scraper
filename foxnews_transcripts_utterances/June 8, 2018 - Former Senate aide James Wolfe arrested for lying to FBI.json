He'd had harsh words for them, as well. But the president appeared pretty much at home, he sticks to his policy that when he does things, America just has to come first. Even if it means at the G7, it becomes the G1. And late tonight, it looks like he may be making a bit of progress.

Totally unfair to our farmers, workers, and companies. Take down your tariffs and barriers and we will more than match you.\" Of course, all this is happening on a day that also as you put it out saw the president suggest Russia should be here taking part in the conversation that did not go well in terms of our relations with some of our allies overseas. You saw the U.K. saying, you have to be very careful when it comes to Russia. They have been disruptive around the globe. And so, the idea of including them in the G8 is something that was certainly take a lot more demonstration on the part of the Russians before that could ever happen.

Literally, last week, Lavrov, the foreign minister was in North Korea saying, \"Let's get rid of the sanctions on North Korea.\" Well, what has brought North Korea to the negotiating table are those sanctions. There is nothing the Russians have done that have been helpful to us, and the president who seems to source says, \"I want to have bilateral relations with my friends, but I want have multilateral relations with our adversaries.

But look, I think, Karl is absolutely right in terms of Russian conduct which surely should be the measure of broader cooperation. There is no rational excuse for them being part of the G7 at the moment, they have been a hindrance on North Korea. Smuggling, try to push as Karl noted that a movement away from tougher action in the international community have been poisoning. People on British soil with their nerve agents, their conduct in Syria, airstrikes against civilian infrastructure, cyber campaigns across much of Europe, coercive campaigns blackmail in Europe, they're pushing ahead with this Nord Stream pipeline that would degrade the stability and sovereignty of nations there. So, there isn't really a rational baseline to be there, but I suppose on the president's part, he simply sees, look, the audit is against it.

So you can't really do it unless you get Russia to the table. I just found all that fascinating, but in terms of our allies in these trade deals, Karl, you know you see a little bit of the negotiation Trump who we've learned a lot about over the past year which is that, yes, he brings them to Washington, everybody's, you know, it was all the hugging and kissing and all, everybody's getting along great. And then, he says, \"Yes, but I'm sticking to my guns here.\" I've always felt really strongly it since his early days as a businessman that America gets ripped off in these trade deals.

What I -- what I worry about is, is whether or not there's going to be a recognition that some of these side issues that are not connected with the tariffs. So, I'll give you two examples, with Canada, the president is insisting that our trade deal exists for five years, and then, go away unless renewed. Automatically go away unless renewed. And second of all, that we get rid of what are called alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Well, that's a way for American businesses to get quick resolution of trade disputes with Canada which was so we want it, and no company is going to invest in the supply -- international supply chain if that arrangement is going to go away in five years. So, that the Canadians who are probably going to be willing to give on the tariff somewhat as long as they get the alternative dispute resolution mechanism kept in place. And they get -- and once we make a treaty, we keep a treaty unless we want to renegotiate it."

And the opportunity I suppose from the president should -- the President Trump's point of view is that American car manufacturers specialized in durable quality cars, but perhaps, not at the same fashion level. So, more affordable if you can get those into Europe which, of course, has very high gas taxes comparative to the United States that could be quite a boom. And so, you know, you can see the sort of opportunity there.

Wolfe denied knowing about the reporter's sources and when confronted, admitted he lied and had personal relationships with Watkins. The indictment also notes Wolfe exchange \"tens of thousands of electronic communications using encrypted applications including signal and WhatsApp.\" The FBI gained access to that data by seizing the reporter's e-mail and phone records. In one text, Wolfe writes, I always tried to give you as much information that I could so you get that scoop before anyone else. I felt like I was part of your excitement.

The Justice Department says that is not so, that they scrupulously followed those guidelines. They did not invade her privacy or go after her metadata just for the heck of it and that there were national security grounds for doing so. It's hard to know what the truth is in this case because we don't know what kind of national security information was compromised. I obviously as a member of the press feel strongly that since Attorney General Sessions has threatened us and threatened to put more reporters in jail to stop leaks, one has to be suspicious. And we know that in my case, for example, no national security information was compromised, the FBI and the Justice Department were trying to make a political case. But we don't know enough yet.

The leaking of classified information has been outrageous going back to before the time that Trump was sworn into office. And at the same time, we have to have a free robust press. And I think Judy's case, for example, is a cautionary tale of what happens when you have a case that isn't meritorious enough to use this kind of extreme measure that the government has. On the other hand, having had over the years to apply these guidelines, you do have to make a balancing. And the fact of the matter is in the jurisprudence of the First Amendment, this -- the journalist is not given a privilege at least much of one above and beyond what the normal person has in terms of privacy. So I think you have to balance, is there a very serious case, is the journalist somehow implicated in it either as somebody who witnessed it, who's somebody who's participated in it, and is it a situation where only the journalist has information that the prosecutor needs in order to make this serious case? If you can't check all those boxes, we shouldn't even be talking about this."

CARTER Page was one of the stories that she wrote about and I know Andrew, you believe that there's you know sort of anti-Trump bias in what you see coming from Mr. Wolfe who we should point out, Judy, is -- has been working on the Senate Intel Committee for decades and he had a lot of access to classified information as he brought in witnesses.

I think as a journalist and we have to -- we all have to be suspicious of the government's motives, on the other hand it's also interesting to me that as the government pointed out, she was the only reporter who was -- whose records were seized, the other three reporters that wasn't the case."

Now, you know the skeptical among us will say that's because they're trying to keep under wraps that this is in such a serious case.

Countless people, over hundreds of thousands of people have claimed that in the millisecond they thought they were going to die after their attempt all they desperately wanted to do is live. It's a common thread in suicidal ideation, because people don't recognize that your thoughts don't have to become actions.

I'll never die that way. Because every time they occur I'll turn to the person to my right or to my left and I will say four words that matter, I need help now. And I will always survive the pain.

A sea lion came to my aid circle beneath me and bumping me up until the coast guard boat arrived behind you -- me. And for me that is my miracle.

Nineteen- year-old Nikki Yovino claimed that she was raped in 2016 by two Sacred Heart University football players but she then admitted that she was lying. Unfortunately, so much of the damage has already been done. Jonathan Hunt is live in our west coast newsroom with the back story here. Hi, Jonathan."

      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. Jury selection was already underway in this case what which has irremeably changed the lives of the accused and now the one awaiting sentencing and the accused to it turns out were actually the victims. Nikki Yovino had originally claimed that two Sacred Heart football players had pulled her into a bathroom at a party in 2016 and then took turns raping her. And as recently as January her lawyer had said Yovino wanted the case tried."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUNT",
      "utterance": "But this week Yovino accepted a plea deal admitting she made up the assault allegation. Because as her arrest warrant affidavit stated, quote, \"It was the first thing that came to mind and she didn't want to lose another male student as a friend and potential boyfriend.\" And the affidavit also said Yovino believed when the other student, quote, \"heard the allegation, it would make him angry and sympathetic to her.\" Investigators said the football players admitted having sex with Yovino but said it was consensual. Their attorney said the plea deal cannot make up for what Yovino has put the young men through but that, quote, \"it does send a powerful message that lying about a serious incident carries serious consequences.\" Yovino's lawyer said, quote, \"This was a very difficult decision for Nikki and a sad day for her and her family. She will now begin the process of healing and rehabilitation as she awaits her final sentence.\" Under the plea bargain, Yovino will be formally sentenced August 23 and will spend one year in prison. Martha."

They have not been named. Enough damage has already been done to them. Everybody obviously on campus knows about them. Were you shocked that she came forward? You got the jury, you are about to trial and then suddenly what, what was the catalyst?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANK RICCIO, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Suddenly the day came where I think she thought that I'm going to see the whites of the eyes of this jury and I just can't handle it. It was surprising. I have to admit it was surprising. I thought she was going to trial. I thought she wanted to present her story, her multiple stories to a jury but at the very last minute she changed her mind."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "She, I mean, it's extraordinary. Because we are in the middle of this, you know, nationwide Me Too movement where we're told all women should be believed. And that's the environment that we live in right now. Is there anything -- you know, what are the problems with that potentially?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICCIO",
      "utterance": "Well, the Me Too movement is a powerful movement. How many years women fought to have their voice heard. This does a tremendous disservice to that. What it does is it now causes someone to, they admittedly lied and now it does soil what would be, you know, otherwise valid allegations. The evidence ended up proving that there wasn't a sexual assault. She lied over and over again. First claiming that a sexual assault. Then not. Then being assaulted. Then not. It does a complete disservice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, you can't -- I feel for her as well. Obviously she has, you know, some issues that she needs to work out. But what has been the impact on the lives of these two young men?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICCIO",
      "utterance": "They're no longer in school. They don't have the experience of that school anymore. They are in the working world so they are doing the best as they can. The one year in jail that she, Ms. Yovino, is being sentenced to pales in comparison to the 20 years that these boys could have received had they been arrested, had they been convicted. So while the punishment by some may be classified as severe, it pales in comparison to what those boys were facing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And they can't go back to school. They can't restart their lives where they left off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICCIO",
      "utterance": "They can. And they are considering all of their options right now. There will be a civil suit against Ms. Yovino most likely, so all of their options are being considered. They are doing as well as they can right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, as you say, if these kinds of allegations what they do, they are problematic obviously for the people that are accused. And also for all the other cases out there that are legitimate, Me Too cases where there are cases of assault. It really muddies the water in such a dangerous, dangerous way. But it's important for people to understand that if you do come forward with a false allegation you can end up in jail."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICCIO",
      "utterance": "Yes, you can. You can be arrested. You can be put in jail and you can suffer the consequences. When you lie about a serious incident it carries serious consequences. And that's what we have here."

    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICCIO",

But in politics winning can change a whole lot of things. And President Trump recently endorsed Mitt Romney who is now running for Senate for the U.S. Senate in his home state of Utah. So last night, he was telling a crowd that he now believes that Mr. Trump will win in 2020 again. Saying this, quote, \"I think President Trump will be re-nominated by my party easily and I think he will be re-elected solidly. I think that not because of the strong -- I think that not just because of the strong economy, rather, and because people are increasingly seeing rising wages but I think it's also true because I think our Democrat friends are likely to nominate someone who is really out of the main stream of American thought.\" President Trump had to say about the comments."

And really, Mitt Romney laid it out in no uncertain terms. And like the rest of the country probably never thought that there would be a President Trump at that moment."

      "utterance": "I don't know. At the time he was talking about even that there was a danger from President Trump and what the consequences of demagoguery and all of that could be. But you know, politics is how we do this. You lay it on the line. You put everything out on the field. You do everything that you can to put your point of view across. And you hopefully do it in an honest way, you hopefully do it in a respectful way. But you put it out there. And then when you lose, you know what you got to do? Come back to the table and work with the same person that you tried to stop. And that's life. That's politics. That's grown-up."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And he obviously, he wants to get back to Washington now as the senator. I mean, I thought he was careful in that statement that he made to sort of not negate the things that he said before."

      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "I think there is nothing incongruous about what he said about Donald. And by the way, I substantially agree with his premise there. Donald Trump is on a good path right now for re-election. His approval ratings are not high but they are solid. And as long as the economy is good and the nation is at peace, incumbent presidents tend to get re-elected and Donald Trump is doing that. So I don't think there is anything incongruous at all about what Mitt Romney said today or this week and what he said before."

I said well, actually, that's how I meant to vote. And she said, well, if you want to know what's in this bill you can go over to the leadership table and they will explain this bill to you. And I said I read the bill. That's why I'm voting no. This is a staffer and I've been here like a week and she is giving me permission to vote my conscience, to vote for my constituents. It was ridiculous, but that was just the tip of the iceberg."

    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Well, so there a couple of categories here. And the movie is fascinating. Because you have members talking frankly about the influence that lobbyists have and you have members talking frankly about how much their careers are exercising in fundraising, right."

      "utterance": "yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "All of that stuff is pretty dug on gross. But I will say this, people who complain that Congress don't get enough done, people who claim that -- especially Republicans who say well, they can't ever pass anything and they don't do anything and how come they're not passing the priorities for that one. It is exactly that sort of enforcement and discipline of junior members. Of course freshmen members get told what to do by the speaker. That's the organizing principle. You just got here and you have to wait until you have some seniority and hen just maybe after you get elected the third time we'll start to listen to you. If you want stuff to get passed there has -- there has to be enforcement. Democrats do it. If you think that's tough, imagine what Nancy Pelosi does to her people. And guess what? They don't go on documentaries and squeal about it either because they know they'll get booted."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That is exactly right. I just want to give you a moment, Chris, because you wrote so beautifully in your piece about our friend Charles Krauthammer and I'm going to say something about it at the end of the show. But your thoughts had some this really awfully sad news that really sinks in for everybody today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Yes, sure. We had known for a bit but it became very real today. And I would just say this that I will dedicate myself in my public life and my public utterances to living up to the standards that Charles has set for us, which is to be decent, to be respectful and to be honest about ourselves and about other people. And that's the kind of patriotic expression that we need so desperately right and live up to his standards."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. He's such a good bench mark for us to think about in our work. And as I said, I'll say a little something about it later. Chris, thank you so much."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So today our colleague and friend Charles Krauthammer gave us heartbreaking news. After a 10-month struggle he tells us that he has weeks to live. Charles has taught us all about the things that matter. And in the end, if you understand what matters, you have a shot at living the life that you intended. He assures us that he has done just that. He writes, \"I thank my colleagues, my readers, and my viewers who have made my career possible and given consequence to my life's work. I believe that the pursuit of truth and right ideas through honest debate and rigorous argument is a noble undertaking. I am grateful to have played a small role in the conversations that have helped guide this extraordinary nation's destiny.\" And I am grateful to have worked with Charles and to have had him as a guest on my shows. We always looked forward to it around here. I love that in his life Charles has given himself the leeway to evolve and to change his mind about things over time. He is brilliant but human and we are all richer for reading and listening to Charles. As always, Charles could cut through the noise with an elegant simplicity that always leaves you thinking he's probably right. That is our story for tonight, the story goes on Monday and we will see you then. Our best to Charles and his family tonight. Here's Tucker.
