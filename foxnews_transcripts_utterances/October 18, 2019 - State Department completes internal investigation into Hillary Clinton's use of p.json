ALAN DERSHOWITZ, \"DEFENDING ISRAEL\" AUTHOR: Well, I think that the Democrats are trying to turn what is a sacred constitutional process that the framers wanted to see used only in extraordinary circumstances when high crimes and misdemeanors were evidently committed. They are turning it into what the framers didn't want it turned into, a partisan political process that normalizes impeachment, and that will set a terrible, terrible precedent on the shoe on the other foot test. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Every time a new president is elected, the opposing party if they follow this precedent will commence impeachment proceedings.

There are political sins and they are sometimes committed, conflicts of interest. Maybe what Biden Jr. did was a political sin. There are federal crimes, like failure to register as a foreign agent. Then there are impeachable offenses, high crimes and misdemeanors. And before any kind of impeachment proceeding can be opened, there has to be clear and convincing evidence that an impeachable offense has occurred or that an investigation will uncover an impeachable offense. We just aren't there and it's a very, very dangerous precedent that will be used against my party, the Democrats, the next time there is a Democrat president and a Republican majority in the House of Representatives. The framers of the Constitution would be turning over in their graves if they saw the partisan use to which this was put. The Republicans did it with Clinton. The Democrats are doing it.

The first two came up during a Republican- controlled Congress but were resoundingly defeated in a bipartisan vote. The third took place just three months ago during a Democratic majority that measure also failed, with a whopping 137 Democrats voting against it. It's no wonder speaker Pelosi is reluctant to hold a fourth vote. And get this, because the House has already voted against an impeachment proceeding, the current inquiry is totally invalid. Unless another formal vote is held. The current sham of a so-called investigation is nothing more than unconstitutional power grab and it needs to end. Meanwhile, breaking earlier today, FOX News learned that in 2015, a State Department official, specializing in Ukraine raised serious concern about Hunter Biden's role with a corrupt Ukrainian oil and gas giant Burisma Holdings that paid him millions of dollars while his father was the vice president of the United States.

Steve Scalise has asked the House parliamentarian on the House floor, and they cut off his mic. This is without precedent. This is without minority rights. And I have said the Democrats should be providing Republicans and presidents -- and the president the same exact rights that they would be demanding if the roles were reversed. And, unfortunately, where we are today is that we finished up another week where I spent the entire week with Adam Schiff in his bunker in the Capitol basement whereas Michael McCaul just said in that clip that you just played, Chairman Schiff has been building a record in secret, leaking out information, some of that information that's been out in the press is just absolutely inaccurate. And to say that President Trump did not do anything that is impeachable, we're not within a galaxy of impeachable conduct here.

But as we look at these specifics of this touch case and what Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are doing, what's your perspective? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, \"DEFENDING ISRAEL\" AUTHOR: Well, I think that the Democrats are trying to turn what is a sacred constitutional process that the framers wanted to see used only in extraordinary circumstances when high crimes and misdemeanors were evidently committed. They are turning it into what the framers didn't want it turned into, a partisan political process that normalizes impeachment, and that will set a terrible, terrible precedent on the shoe on the other foot test. Every time a new president is elected, the opposing party if they follow this precedent will commence impeachment proceedings. All you need is a handful of members of the majority in the House to conduct that. We have to understand there are several categories of conduct politically. There are political sins and they are sometimes committed, conflicts of interest. Maybe what Biden Jr. did was a political sin. There are federal crimes, like failure to register as a foreign agent. Then there are impeachable offenses, high crimes and misdemeanors. And before any kind of impeachment proceeding can be opened, there has to be clear and convincing evidence that an impeachable offense has occurred or that an investigation will uncover an impeachable offense. We just aren't there and it's a very, very dangerous precedent that will be used against my party, the Democrats, the next time there is a Democrat president and a Republican majority in the House of Representatives. The framers of the Constitution would be turning over in their graves if they saw the partisan use to which this was put. The Republicans did it with Clinton. The Democrats are doing it. Both were wrong."

But, I think at the time they felt like they didn't have a choice because they had these articles of impeachment and they were enunciated. When you go to Democrats today and you say, what enunciate for me, tell me what is it that you are charging the president with? They cannot tell you. They have no earthly idea. And when people like they respond to that by saying oh, well, you know, impeachment is not a legal issue. It's a political issue."

But I want to point out that that idea that this is a political process, it cuts both ways. And I guarantee you that if they pursue this -- and this is why Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to do it, because she is a smart lady. If Democrats pursue this, they are going to pay for it in the next election. And they are going to pay for it grievously, all up and down the ticket, because the idea of taking away the vote from the American people in the middle of an election is not going to ride well not only with the Republicans and independents, but with Democrats."

And if you were listening to those networks, you might not realize it. Listen, I was in the room for all of these depositions, you are actually being dumbed down. You had people who are guests on other shows telling you what was happening inside of these rooms. The information is just not accurate. They are cherry picking certain information that's out, and to the point the debate we just heard from Charlie and Alan about what we're -- where we are and why we are here and what our Founding Fathers intended, we are here it is because of political hate, it is about an enraged liberal activist base. It is about a pledge to resist, oppose, impeach and obstruct everything and anything. I am seeing colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are enthusiastic. They are happy. They are smiling about ripping our country in half. It is about taking down the president. It is about not accepting the results of 2016.

And the idea that you have secret hearings -- if there is a need for confidentiality for the national security, let the public know that, the public understands that. But when you try to make your case in secret and don't provide the kinds of defenses that are usually available -- every civil libertarian, whether you're Democrat or Republican, should demand that. You know, when Nixon was back in the day when they were impeaching him, I was a liberal Democrat. And yet I stood up for his right not to be named as unindicted co-conspirator by a secret grand jury where he had no opportunity to oppose that and no opportunity to go to trial and disprove it. So, I have been consistent through the Nixon impeachment, through the Clinton impeachment and now through the efforts to impeach our president. And we have to pass the \"shoe on the other foot\" test. It has to be the same rule for a Democrat as for a Republican and it has to be a rule that makes impeachment an extremely rare effort only done when there is overwhelming evidence of a constitutionally impeachable offense. Not something you make up as you go along. Not something you disagree with on foreign policy. Look, I disagree fundamentally with the president's decision to remove American troops from Syria. I think it was a serious mistake. But it's not impeachable offense. That's a good reason for deciding who to vote for in the next elections. But not a good reason for trying to invoke impeachment."

The State Department review found the 38 people were responsible for 91 security violations and protocols for safeguarding classified materials were violated another 497 times. The report described an investigation fraught with obstacles from the thousands of hard copy Clinton emails that had to be sifted to significant delays, including a request in March of 2016 from the FBI to pause their work until the bureau's schedule investigation was complete. The State Department also found then Secretary of State Clinton's use of a personal server increased the risk of security compromises. But the State Department also said they found no persuasive evidence classified information was deliberately mishandled. A source familiar with the review told Fox that it's not clear any individuals were administratively punished.

Tom, I want to start with this State Department investigation because this really, it just really gets to me. As Catherine reported, the State Department found that 38 individuals are responsible for 91 security violations but another 497 violations were found and not one person was found culpable.

Right now, there's a federal court judge considering to bring her in for questioning by Judicial Watch attorneys about what she was doing here. And, frankly, Secretary Pompeo should take this report and supporting documentation, send it over to the Justice Department, because this is now probably the 99th reason for this Justice Department to reopen a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's email usage. The last one was sham and corrupted and now, we need attorney general of the United States, Barr, to get his Justice Department finally on the ball, because right now, this Justice Department is defending Hillary Clinton in the litigation we are trying to pursue to get more answers about what went on here.

Attorney General Bondi, I got to tell you, this drives people like me and millions of people at home nuts. What is justice? How do we get to justice in this type of thing?

Plus, the Durham probe into the origins of the Russia witch hunt, remember he is the U.S. Attorney out of Connecticut, his looking into the witch-hunt has reportedly obtained a key piece of evidence, two pieces of evidence actually, in the form of two BlackBerrys used supposed by Joseph Mifsud. Now keep in mind, he was the shadowing Maltese professor who infamously told Trump advisor George Papadopoulos about the supposed existence of leaked Clinton emails. According to Comey's FBI, that conversation is what supposedly sparked months long witch-hunt that led to what we're at today. There is no evidence of anything that had gone out there."

If you read the Mueller Report, Mueller would have you believe that Mifsud's a Russian asset, he is not. I mean, either that was a misrepresentation by Mueller or is he incredibly gullible and maybe a little of both. Now, Mifsud has always been a western intelligence source. And in fact, he gives instructions to U.S. intelligence agents including the FBI. So, think about this, our own asset is feeding disinformation to George Papadopoulos on purpose to set him up as a patsy to justify an investigation of Donald Trump. And that never was the trigger for the investigation. That was all just a misdirection. It was initiated because the FBI got their hands on this dossier that was paid for, commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign."

From a legal perspective, if law enforcement is dealing under a whole different set of rules, right, when you are dealing overseas as opposed to within the United States. But to be able to have the BlackBerrys of the communications, what gyrations are they going to have to go through to be able to inspect that and be able to decipher what is going in and out of those BlackBerrys, if this report is true?"

      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Even on this one, we're running into issues and this is interesting. Here's what viewers should know about this, that the attorney for General Flynn, she was essentially begging the prosecution to turn it over, right. It's exculpatory evidence and that is why we have our faith in the justice system, so that you're confident that both sides will turn over all forms of evidence. She instead literally had to file a motion for it, so the judge could force them to turn it over. So even I think that's partly actually why this has taken so long, in part because at every turn, there's not that transparency and there's not that level of cooperation that we would hope. Another interesting point too about Durham's probe is that he had a broader subpoena power and a broader personnel power than the Inspector General did. And so that's partly why he is able to obtain such a broader breadth of information and also from the people who no longer work for the United States, which was a limiting factor for the Inspector General."

He may get some outside cooperation, but it's easily to set that aside. Durham doesn't have any of these prohibitions. And what Emily was talking about Gregg is Sidney Powell who's the attorney for Michael Flynn, General Flynn, has said, hey there might be some exculpatory information in here, you need to provide that information to us. What else do you know about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "It's called Brady material, after a famous case called Brady, and the Supreme Court has ruled that if you have any exculpatory evidence, you must turn it over to the defense. Well it appears and Sidney Powell believes and apparently has evidence that they didn't follow the law, which means that the case could be dismissed against Michael Flynn, which was always an injustice. This is a guy who was interviewed by two FBI agents, including Peter Strzok, who walked out of the interview and said the guy's not lying, there's no sign of deception. And the FBI actually dropped the case. Then Bob Mueller, in order to conjure out of thin air incriminating information against Donald Trump, decided to prosecute Flynn, a guy who told the truth, prosecuting him for lying. And the only reason Flynn threw the towel in and pled guilty was because unconscionably Mueller and his team of partisans were threatening to prosecute Flynn's son. And Flynn also went broke, had to sell his house trying to defend himself. This is the kind of thing that should never happen in American justice."

The race, there's several parts of the race, part of it's policy, but a part of it is fundraising. To put it in perspective what we hear about somebody raising $1 million over a short period of time, I think Senator Klobuchar got excited about that, versus what the RNC - the Republican National Committee and Donald Trump had been able to raise."

      "utterance": "Well there's no bigger juggernaut right now in fundraising than President Trump. The RNC and President Trump combined raised $125 million in the third quarter. We have $156 million cash on hand, and there's nobody even close. But what I see from the Democrats as they're touting these two new people that are raising a million dollars is that Joe Biden is waning, that it's been three debates he's not been able to solidify any frontrunner status. He starts a sentence, he can barely finish it, and now the donors are saying, oh my goodness we've got to find another person. Joe Biden came in with a huge lead, it's dissipating, so this is going to go on for a long time and it doesn't look like the field is going to narrow anytime soon."

There's going to be something wrong with that along the way. Yesterday, I had the pleasure of being in South Carolina, loved the state, and I couldn't believe it, I pulled up on this corner, there were 30 people wearing Trump gear doing a honk and wave. It's more than a year before the election. Can the Republicans sustain this kind of enthusiasm in the tens of thousands of people that showed up in Texas?"

I didn't think that was possible. I mean he's been in office for three years, he has sustained an energy and a momentum that we've never seen, and his supporters are with him 100 percent for the reasons you just showed. Wages are up, unemployment is at a record low, you've got jobs coming back. People know that he went out and promised these things to the American people and now he's delivering, their lives are better, and they're going to do everything they can to reelect him. And the energy is so strong and it just keeps growing, it's amazing."

      "utterance": "Well, I do think one of the challenges for Republicans, particularly in the House is can they stick together? You got Andy Biggs out there with an important piece of legislation about Schiff, and there's some 60 Republicans who can't even seem to sign on to that piece of legislation. Can the Republicans on the policy side stay united?"

      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "Well I know that our base wants to see our party stick together. It's something I hear often as I travel the country. They say, you know the Democrats I don't like them, but the one thing they do is they stick together and it'd be nice if Republicans stuck more behind our President as they've seen him face this onslaught of negativity, not just from the media, but from Democrats who continue to investigate and obstruct and resist. And they want to see our party rally around them. Our voters are rallying around them. You know the biggest poll right now is fundraising. There is nobody collecting more small dollar donations than President Trump and that shows the energy and momentum we have going into 2020. And every candidate is going to need a strong top of the ticket with this President to help us win back the House and keep our Senate majority."

I just do not understand that. Ronna, thank you so much."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. In the wake of Project Veritas releasing explosive footage of CNN staffers admitting rampant anti-Trump bias at the highest levels of the network, the Trump campaign is hitting back, demanding \"Substantial payment,\" in a letter threatening legal action against CNN. Joining me now with reaction is T.H.E. New Voice CEO Herman Cain. Mr. Cain, Herman, thank you so much for joining us here. Does the President have a case, do you think he can win this? HERMAN CAIN, CEO/PRESIDENT, T.H.E. NEW VOICE, INC.: Yes. I had the honor of Donald Trump before he was President Trump. He called me and asked my advice. It was real simple. Donald Trump, lawyer up, and that's what he needs to do. Secondly, if he doesn't go after CNN for heir open and blatant bias and negativity towards the President of the United States, others will feel emboldened to do the same. So I wholeheartedly believe that he should proceed with it and not just make it a threat."

      "utterance": "Well, but CNN is dead last in every poll, every ratings I could look at. I don't know why they would want to replicate CNN and be dead last. But, I mean it seems like it's more than just CNN, that just every day they go after this President and yet Fox News has some of the highest ratings and we have a much more balanced approach. We hear both sides."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's absolutely right. But, CNN is still a very well known channel for a lot of people. I think he should go after them anyway, even though their ratings are low. That does not matter. Other people can't feel emboldened to continue to be negative towards this President. Look, we started out, Jason, with Trump haters which are at CNN. Then we had people who suffer from TDS, Trump Derangement Syndrome, and now it has moved into TDI, Trump Derangement Insanity. And when you have at CNN all of this negativity coming from the top, he literally instructs some of his anchors and some of his reporters to report only negative stuff, and if it's positive about trump don't report it. That's why during the so-called debate the other night, they didn't talk about the economy, they didn't talk about immigration, they didn't talk about the wall, they didn't talk about energy independence. Why? Because President Trump has made brilliant decisions on all of those and we are seeing the results. That's why they don't even want to bring it up. That's why I think they should be sued for that negative bias."
