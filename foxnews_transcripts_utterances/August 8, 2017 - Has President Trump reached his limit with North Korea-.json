And for him to look down and say fire and fury, he has looked at this situation almost from the day he got the job as president-elect. He has never spoken as direct like that. And I think he's reaching his limit and knowing his chief of staff is a marine general, I sense this is the beginning of the interaction where this is where we should take this.

Although with today's breaking news with Washington Post, and now they have the ability to launch a nuclear weapon into the United States, I think obviously the rhetoric just went up this afternoon.

This has been going on for decades, right. So -- and we knew he'll always push the boundaries, always push the boundaries, and now he's at this point. The problem with Korea, North Korea and South Korea is you're right, I think the nuclear stuff is feared legitimately so. The big problem is North Korea unleashing a lot of conventional stuff right into South Korea before we can actually help them. There is going to be a lot of people -- it will be really ugly and nasty if that happens. But."

The Chinese have to play a role in this if they want to. This is the big question. Again, I know that China voted on the sanctions and it was unanimous vote.

And then it looked like they thoroughly duped the administration. Condoleezza Rice ran out of time. And we look back to Chris Hill and company, and we said what the heck happened? It wasn't that they were lazy. And then the Obama administration comes in and says I have an idea, strategic patience.

I think at some point -- I always called them a pit bull. And it's a pit bull that they were always be able to maintain some control over and they would bring that pit bull out into the yard when people were bugging them, or they want to get some attention.

Nobody is safe from this epidemic that threatens young and old, rich and poor, urban and rural communities. Everybody is threatened. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. And opioid overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled since 1999. It is a problem the likes of which we have not seen."

The commission reported that approximately 142 Americans are now dying every day due to drug overdose. Kat, I'll start with you. This is not, unfortunately, new for America. We saw heroin in the 70's, we saw crack in the 80's. Here we are now with a resurgence of this opioid addiction and its killing people. So we know that war on drugs did not work, historically. What about these answers we're seeing from President Trump. I'll go through a few that he taunted on the campaign trail. Building a wall along the U.S. border, the south apparently coming in from the southern border, also increasing recovery fund for certain programs and then, of course, treating this unlike we did with the war on drugs, treating it not with a law and order regime but with a humanitarian approach."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right. And I'm not a big fan of the wall, but treating it with a humanitarian approach I think it's about time that we take a look at doing something like that. When we put people in prison for this, we end up breaking up families. It doesn't really stop anyone for doing it. They come out. They have something on their record. They can't get a job. They go back to dealing drugs. They go back to prison, families are ripped to part. The cycle just repeats itself. I think that it's very important to take a look at that approach. I also think we need to be very careful not to crack down too hard on doctors to the point where -- we'll make it impossible for people who do need this medication for legitimate reasons, people with chronic pain, they might go to the black market, and then we'll have people with heroin problems. So I think that treating it in a humanitarian way is a good thing."

Now 75 percent of the opioid addicts are middle class, suburban, soccer moms, you know, 20 somethings. And so, who started on legal narcotics and then realized heroin is cheaper. And so it's been this whole pills to heroin pipeline. And I think part of what we have been dealing with I would say a significant part of what we've been dealing with, I would say a significant part of what we've been dealing with is we've incentivized the wrong behavior. If you look at what the centers for Medicaid and Medicare do, they're giving incentive payments to hospitals that have good response from patients. We're filling out these survey forms and getting response on how they were treated. How the providers dealt with pain. And so the response to pain and how those are filled out in the survey, and the survey, you know, incentivized responding and then giving incentive, I think we've incentivized the wrong behavior and actually increased doctor's willingness and desire because they want good rating. They want to have good ratings and get these incentive payments. So then, deal overly aggressively and overprescribe narcotics and opioids."

Don't say I'm not going to put everyone in jail. I think you've got to -- number one, you have to -- I think the good news is we're not -- we're not coming down on the family down the block that has a kid that's suddenly is out of control.

I was actually talking with a good family friend who runs multiple E.R.'s they say there's a couple other problems in incentivizing the wrong behavior. When somebody walks into an E.R., there's a 30 minute window in which we have to deal with the pain. And if they say on 8 of 10 -- you know pain -- we have 8 out of 10 on the pain scale, we actually have to address that before we even get x-rays back. It's like Motrin doesn't cut it. We actually have to prescribe narcotics."

Today The New York Times published a front-page article saying, quote, \"Climate Report Full of Warnings Awaits President\" with the sub-headline, \"Fears of Suppression.\" Wow, that sure sounds ominous. Naturally many in the media have run wild with it, but there's just one problem. The draft of this climate change report has been publicly available online since -- wait for it -- January. So apparently, the Trump administration is going to suppress a report that's already been public since January? Great job, New York Times. All right, so apparently, wasn't able to suppress it.

And most of the things that are in this report that was leaked out already online, according to the people that wrote it, was something that's already been concluded by 13 separate agencies. But they really have that little faith in the president to think that he's going to suppress this climate change report, because it doesn't go with leaving the Paris agreement? They know what the scientists say. And they also say that they have a different opinion. Climate is changing. They are not sure about the role of man's role in the fact that climate is changing."

And they're trying to shut the door on it. I think that the thing that's interesting, too, about the New York Times, they were also encouraging EPA staff to leak on Scott Pruitt. So, I find myself very skeptical about the New York Times' pledge to do better things moving forward after the 2016 elections. First of all, I haven't seen them apologizing for their story back in February about the whole Russian collusion fairy tale.

So my \"Wait, What?\" was last night, like every good American, I was watching the finale of \"The Bachelorette.\" And you know, my girl Rachel, I can't say that I understood her choice.

But I bet you he's really pretty scared. And then, you know, some people came, and they were able to remove the peanut butter jar from his head. And now he is living free in the wilderness, and he's very full of peanut butter. But look at that. What a distressing moment. And that's, just, you know, a little reminder for all of us that, you know, there's always hope."

And by the way, I just want to bring up the fact that my radio show is on every day from 9 to noon, \"The Brian Kilmeade Show.\" And I'm privileged to have on as a guest for the first time in a long time, the hero of last week for the Trump administration. Steven Miller, will be joining us and talking about the president's non-vacation. They're working on the West Wing. And Bedminster, as well as the opioid crisis and, most importantly, where we go from here on North Korea. I'll get the latest from the man who puts the words in the president's mouth. He's a speech writer."
