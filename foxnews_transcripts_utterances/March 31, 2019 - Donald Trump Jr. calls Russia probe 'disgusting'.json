It is a white supremacist ideology that suggests that western civilization is predicated not on eternal immutable principles, but is based solely on race. And western civilization is just about white people. Oddly enough, there are folks on the left who seem to think the same thing. But the alt-right believes what makes western civilization great is that it is a civilization about white people. That obviously is false, it is also stupid. I've been a long-time critic of the alt-right. I was the number one recipient of their hate in 2016. I sought higher security. Thanks to the hatred from the alt-right. So The Economist labeling me some sort of pop icon of the alt-right was obviously wrong on its face. And that's why The Economist did the right thing, pulled down the headline. And then called me a radical conservative, which is strange because I don't know what would me particularly radical. Are there any non-radical conservatives in the opinion of The Economist?

There is no ramification, there is no nothing. But they did a major disservice to the people who did do a good job, small group of people who were, you know, reasonably objective and did a good job.

They read about it maybe a little bit. I don't think they ever gave it all that much credence. But when you look at what is going on in the last two years, you know, that's a big part of it.

And even some of the reporting, it wasn't based on fact. They had to retract several stories over the past two years, because what they wanted to be true is what they were pushing. It was difference between just the pure truth and what they wanted to be true. And that's why we saw all this narrative be pushed across their network for two years, basically."

The fact that nobody -- the fact that there are no further indictments doesn't mean the stories were inaccurate, but there were a lot of high profile blunders made.

But the ratings -- CNN's ratings were up over the course. And when we're looking at motivations for pushing this narrative, it's because they did see an uptick in ratings when they started to focus on Russian collusion. And the same is true about MSNBC.

If Joe Biden, for instance -- and I don't want hike to play this game, but if Joe Biden were a conservative, he would not have gotten away with this.

I've spoken to legislators in the Senate and the House. There's no plan that is forthcoming. The only thing that might be true is that President Trump is planning, essentially, for the Supreme Court to uphold his former statements on Obamacare, uphold Obamacare. And then he can blame the Democrats in Congress for blocking any sort of reform of Obamacare, make them own the status quo as well as the possibility of Medicare For All. That could be a clever political strategy."

      "utterance": "Right. And that, again, maybe his lawyers betting that the Supreme Court, which still has the same constituency, John Roberts in the swing vote position will vote the same way they did before. And Trump can say, listen, I did the best that we I could to get rid of Obamacare. I even sided with a lawsuit to get rid of Obamacare. The Supreme Court won't let me do it. That's actually not a terrible argument to the base."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Blame it on John Roberts. In a review of your book, The Economist called you the pop idol to the alt-right, catering to hyperventilating conservatives. The other day, the British magazine retracted that description and apologized. What happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I think a lot of people who don't know what the alt- right is, I'll attribute to arrogance rather than malice and ignorance. A bunch of folks on the left seem to think everybody who's conservative is quote and unquote, alt-right. The alt-right actually has an ideology. It is a white supremacist ideology that suggests that western civilization is predicated not on eternal immutable principles, but is based solely on race. And western civilization is just about white people. Oddly enough, there are folks on the left who seem to think the same thing. But the alt-right believes what makes western civilization great is that it is a civilization about white people. That obviously is false, it is also stupid. I've been a long-time critic of the alt-right. I was the number one recipient of their hate in 2016. I sought higher security. Thanks to the hatred from the alt-right. So The Economist labeling me some sort of pop icon of the alt-right was obviously wrong on its face. And that's why The Economist did the right thing, pulled down the headline. And then called me a radical conservative, which is strange because I don't know what would me particularly radical. Are there any non-radical conservatives in the opinion of The Economist? But I guess I'm a radical conservative. I can take alt-right was not a thing I was going to allow to stand."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, you did push back. And you got the apology. From your book you say, we are angry at each other. The anger is palpable, where did it come from? So my question is you're an aggressive player in the partisan wars. Do you, does cable news, do the media contribute to and fuel this anger?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "I mean, I do think that, obviously, strong political conversation is going to lead to polarization. But the question is you can have strong political conversations where you disagree and you discuss and still love the person you're arguing with at the end of the day, if you feel you have the same shared goals, if you feel you have the same common base from which you are working. What seems to have happened is the sort of polarized battle we're seeing on cable news, I think, is a reflection of a deeper underlying unease with the fact that we don't have all that much in common anymore. The book really is an attempt to remind us we have a lot in common, with 3,000-year developmental history in western civilization. And that right, left and center, we all still should agree on certain basic principles, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, a government that is not empowered to invade our lives. These are concepts that we should all agree on, if we can't agree on those, then the arguments we're having right now actually carry an enormous amount of weight. And maybe we should be angry."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I mean, I hope that -- and I don't always succeed, but I certainly hope I'm attacking people's ideas and not them as human beings, or suggesting that they lack moral fiber, moral character, because we disagree on tax rates."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Now, when you went to speak at Berkeley, famously, protesters showed up. They shouted speech is violence, which is an interesting twist of meaning. You also say that despite the fact that you're an Orthodox Jew, you're routinely castigated as a Nazi. Where does that come from and just personally, how hurtful is that to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "I mean, obviously, on a personal level it is deeply -- it is deeply discomfiting. It is not a nice thing to be labeled a progenitor of the worst mass murder in histories against people who shared a religion with me. That's obviously ridiculous and silly and evil, frankly. But the general -- you know, the general polarization, it is -- we live in an era where it is very convenient to tear down your political opposition by labeling them lack -- by labeling them morally insufficient, that they have a lack of character. And that is a sign not only of bad politics, but bad underlying motivation. If you're slandering somebody's motivations without knowing the person, and knowing the motivation, the idea is they are innately bad because we disagree on political matters that we've disagreed on for years, year, and years. But my politics reflects white superiority because we disagree on affirmative action for example. Then you're not engaging politics. You're engaging in effectively character assassination and a certain form of tribal warfare."
