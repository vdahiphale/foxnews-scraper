      "sentences": "True story. Rambling about trains from a human train wreck. Sorry, the only Biden who knows about rails is Hunter after he snorted a few fresh ones. So, as America worries, Joe tells a debunked story about a dead Amtrak worker. This guy's memory is so bad. He's plagiarizing his own lies. As for the supply chain Fiasco, we did that story last week. But like the President's memory, it's only gotten worse. Empty shelves, escalating prices panic. Kat can't even buy hair. She's the true victim. Still nothing changed and why? Because it doesn't affect the politicians, the rich, the activist class, the very (BLEEP) who are responsible for this mess. But effects you, measly country bumpkins, and you don't rate. I mean, when was the last time you're a designer dress to a Gala event? Well, for me it was Thursday. But I digress. Sure they drag Buttigieg out of his forte made of marshmallows and kittens to make a statement. But he offered nothing but sorry, you're stuck with it. He's clever, but he's no leader. He's Eddie Haskell. Eddie Haskell from Leave it to Beaver. Except he doesn't like the beef. Never watched the show. Now I've got nothing against paternity leave. Sorry. It's Mayor Pete that gave paternity leave a bad name. Taking off a few months. It's not like he's octo mom. He didn't have eight kids by C-section. Getting a cushy federal Perkville position and then bailing for two months as the country languages. Who do you think you are? Kamala Harris? Hell, I didn't even bail in my first year at college and that was after realizing it was a Holiday Inn Express. I thought that was funny when I wrote it. Fact is no one is in charge and no one cares. Biden is a big rickety Trojan horse being dragged into your living room by Jen Psaki, Susan Rice and Ron Klain, but there are no warriors inside. Just dust. To put us into Halloween mode, this presidency is the Headless Horseman. It's not a costume. It's real and the cobwebs for the decorations come from inside Biden's head. You know how you can tell no one's in charge? Where are those infamous executive orders that Biden and least when he got in? Remember how that was meant to show he was in charge, when really it was all symbolic (BLEEP) take the border crisis. All he wanted was to reverse Trump era policy. Let the new policy failed and slightly revert back to Trump's and act like he saved us from the disaster that he needlessly put us in. Now with this massive crisis, nothing. He could do something, but he won't. And speaking to Trump. He would have nuked the supply chain crisis like it was a hurricane. The same way he solved North Korea, the Middle East with Abraham -- the Abraham Accords, and of course the vaccines. He would have targeted the issues and blown them up like they were Soleimani on the way to the airport. With the supply chain, he would have created a warp speed in a trucker hat. Just with his Hell's Angels connections alone, the shelves would already be teeming with Christmas toys. Oh wait, that's right. His tweets are sometimes abrasive. So let's replace him with a cross between Gilligan and Thurston Howell III. The result, Biden remorse. With no one claiming responsibility for solving this problem, not Pete, not Joe, not even Kamala. She's too busy avoiding the immigration crisis. Even migrants don't run from the border like she does. Meanwhile, we found out that this clown show, Merrick Garland had breezily targeted domestic terrorists, I.E. parents. Based on a fact free letter from a left-wing group that had colluded with the government beforehand. So it was all manufactured. This guy is dirtier than Dana Perino's mouth after two shots of fireball. He also says he gets most of his info from the news. I guess, meaning CNN which explains his empty head. He didn't know about the attack on the Department of the Interior or the rape in Loudon County because CNN only reports news that protects a coddled audience with room temperature I.Q.s. The politicians quote the media and the media quotes the politicians. Round and round they go. I won't use the crude expression for that kind of circle. But I don't want Jeffrey Toobin to get excited. So like Joe and Mayor Pete, Merricks and other Headless Horseman, no ideas, no, nothing. Just Stretton his stuff and leaving behind piles of horse crap for the peasants to shovel up. But now he kicked a hornet's nest with his bare feet. You think Black Lives Matters or the Tea Party was a movement? Try millions of scorn parents from all economic groups with more racial diversity than a 1980s Benetton ad. Garland kicked a mama bear and the bear has the temperament of a constipated Bernie Sanders. Now parents may be disadvantaged as activists, they're new added and also they're too busy to occupy a park. Block a highway or poop on a sidewalk. They have jobs. Real ones, but they also have kids who I hate. But I get it. You get between parents and their children. You start a battle that will be over a quicker than a typical Joe Biden workday. The Headless Horseman should be scared. He claimed he was going to unify a country and he did against him.",

The more woke smoke we're going to start hearing from this administration too because that is what this is all about. It's not just insulating themselves from accountability, but distracting people. Changing the subject. And now as this administration goes south, I predict right now, mark my words, we're going to see more declarations about racial inequity. We're going to see more discussion about transgenderism, we're going to see more discussion about the kinds of cultural issues that are designed to distract the public from their own failures.

So, on Wednesday, Chinese streaming giant, Tencent, cut the live broadcast between the Knicks and the Celtics. It was almost as fast as the White House cutting the feed when Biden starts answering questions. So, why does this matter? Well, because China reportedly accounts for at least 10 percent of the NBA's revenues, so the league is reluctant to piss off the dictatorship. Two years ago, NBA Executive Daryl Morey tweeted support for democracy in Hong Kong, and his team's games are still banned from TV there. Morey later apologized, likely pressured by the NBA to do so. Plus, the NBA and other American companies like Nike, who rely on China to sustain their growth and pretty much ignored Beijing's (BLEEP) human rights record, supporting tearing down 100-year-old statues of slave owners is one thing but publicly oppose the actual slavery we're profiting off of in 2021. Don't look at us. Maybe the NBA is just waiting to see which pronouns the slaves prefer before releasing a statement. Meanwhile, instead of Celtic games, China plans to show this instead.

Apparently, the last straw was when the guy installing the radiator showed some butt cleavage.

So, as America worries, Joe tells a debunked story about a dead Amtrak worker. This guy's memory is so bad. He's plagiarizing his own lies. As for the supply chain Fiasco, we did that story last week. But like the President's memory, it's only gotten worse. Empty shelves, escalating prices panic. Kat can't even buy hair. She's the true victim. Still nothing changed and why? Because it doesn't affect the politicians, the rich, the activist class, the very (BLEEP) who are responsible for this mess. But effects you, measly country bumpkins, and you don't rate. I mean, when was the last time you're a designer dress to a Gala event? Well, for me it was Thursday. But I digress. Sure they drag Buttigieg out of his forte made of marshmallows and kittens to make a statement. But he offered nothing but sorry, you're stuck with it. He's clever, but he's no leader. He's Eddie Haskell. Eddie Haskell from Leave it to Beaver. Except he doesn't like the beef. Never watched the show. Now I've got nothing against paternity leave. Sorry. It's Mayor Pete that gave paternity leave a bad name. Taking off a few months. It's not like he's octo mom. He didn't have eight kids by C-section. Getting a cushy federal Perkville position and then bailing for two months as the country languages. Who do you think you are? Kamala Harris? Hell, I didn't even bail in my first year at college and that was after realizing it was a Holiday Inn Express. I thought that was funny when I wrote it. Fact is no one is in charge and no one cares. Biden is a big rickety Trojan horse being dragged into your living room by Jen Psaki, Susan Rice and Ron Klain, but there are no warriors inside. Just dust. To put us into Halloween mode, this presidency is the Headless Horseman. It's not a costume. It's real and the cobwebs for the decorations come from inside Biden's head. You know how you can tell no one's in charge? Where are those infamous executive orders that Biden and least when he got in? Remember how that was meant to show he was in charge, when really it was all symbolic (BLEEP) take the border crisis. All he wanted was to reverse Trump era policy. Let the new policy failed and slightly revert back to Trump's and act like he saved us from the disaster that he needlessly put us in. Now with this massive crisis, nothing. He could do something, but he won't. And speaking to Trump. He would have nuked the supply chain crisis like it was a hurricane. The same way he solved North Korea, the Middle East with Abraham -- the Abraham Accords, and of course the vaccines. He would have targeted the issues and blown them up like they were Soleimani on the way to the airport. With the supply chain, he would have created a warp speed in a trucker hat. Just with his Hell's Angels connections alone, the shelves would already be teeming with Christmas toys. Oh wait, that's right. His tweets are sometimes abrasive. So let's replace him with a cross between Gilligan and Thurston Howell III. The result, Biden remorse. With no one claiming responsibility for solving this problem, not Pete, not Joe, not even Kamala. She's too busy avoiding the immigration crisis. Even migrants don't run from the border like she does. Meanwhile, we found out that this clown show, Merrick Garland had breezily targeted domestic terrorists, I.E. parents. Based on a fact free letter from a left-wing group that had colluded with the government beforehand. So it was all manufactured. This guy is dirtier than Dana Perino's mouth after two shots of fireball. He also says he gets most of his info from the news. I guess, meaning CNN which explains his empty head. He didn't know about the attack on the Department of the Interior or the rape in Loudon County because CNN only reports news that protects a coddled audience with room temperature I.Q.s. The politicians quote the media and the media quotes the politicians. Round and round they go. I won't use the crude expression for that kind of circle. But I don't want Jeffrey Toobin to get excited. So like Joe and Mayor Pete, Merricks and other Headless Horseman, no ideas, no, nothing. Just Stretton his stuff and leaving behind piles of horse crap for the peasants to shovel up. But now he kicked a hornet's nest with his bare feet. You think Black Lives Matters or the Tea Party was a movement? Try millions of scorn parents from all economic groups with more racial diversity than a 1980s Benetton ad. Garland kicked a mama bear and the bear has the temperament of a constipated Bernie Sanders. Now parents may be disadvantaged as activists, they're new added and also they're too busy to occupy a park. Block a highway or poop on a sidewalk. They have jobs. Real ones, but they also have kids who I hate. But I get it. You get between parents and their children. You start a battle that will be over a quicker than a typical Joe Biden workday. The Headless Horseman should be scared. He claimed he was going to unify a country and he did against him."

The more woke smoke we're going to start hearing from this administration too because that is what this is all about. It's not just insulating themselves from accountability, but distracting people.

Single handed. He didn't even drop his purchase. I mean that is impressive. You point a gun at me. I'm dropping more than my preparation H and Virginia Slims. Which by the way, go together. Splendidly. Just dip a little and then. It'll happen so quickly. The suspects never knew what hit him. The hero vet just standing there minding his own business. The two mostly peaceful dudes in busting. Their guns drawn and he takes one of the them down and then the other goes scampering off into the night terrified. I haven't seen reflexes that fast and someone spilled Parmesan cheese in front of Kat. So America, this is what heroism looks like. It's not blocking traffic, looting or whining about your pronouns on TikTok, a marine staring death in the eye and taking it down. Standing up to lawlessness and doing what's right. He said the Marines taught him not to mess around, which coincidentally is the same thing Dana Perino taught me when I tried on one of her dresses. Tom, you're a -- you're a cold blooded killer."

So, on Wednesday, Chinese streaming giant, Tencent, cut the live broadcast between the Knicks and the Celtics. It was almost as fast as the White House cutting the feed when Biden starts answering questions. So, why does this matter? Well, because China reportedly accounts for at least 10 percent of the NBA's revenues, so the league is reluctant to piss off the dictatorship. Two years ago, NBA Executive Daryl Morey tweeted support for democracy in Hong Kong, and his team's games are still banned from TV there. Morey later apologized, likely pressured by the NBA to do so. Plus, the NBA and other American companies like Nike, who rely on China to sustain their growth and pretty much ignored Beijing's (BLEEP) human rights record, supporting tearing down 100-year-old statues of slave owners is one thing but publicly oppose the actual slavery we're profiting off of in 2021. Don't look at us. Maybe the NBA is just waiting to see which pronouns the slaves prefer before releasing a statement. Meanwhile, instead of Celtic games, China plans to show this instead.

I've been to Walmart several times and I couldn't find anybody who worked there. In honor of the training, Walmart has changed their slogan to save many, save money, live better, (BLEEP) you.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was spotted breaking her own mask rules in a huge crowd at the WNBA Finals. Even more shocking, there was a huge crowd for a WNBA game. That is so something a sexist like Tom Shillue would say. Ohio college students were reportedly angry and scared after cisgender men had to enter their safe space dorm to install a radiator. Going forward, the school promises no longer to send repairman so the students can safely freeze to death. Apparently, the last straw was when the guy installing the radiator showed some butt cleavage.

When he heard about this, Joe Biden said there will be no such tests as long as I'm the president of putting.
