And allegations that there is a nasty feud going on between her staff and Joe Biden's White House. Kamala's team feels like she's being sidelined and saddled with no- win jobs but the veep once again just laughing off the controversy.",

I don't think I've ever seen that before where somebody chooses not to do the job they give you. She's worse than the cable guy. You know, the cable guy when he -- he'll be four or five hours late, but he'll fix your cable. She did not! She actually thought all she had to do was go there. Meanwhile, you know, she's a heartbeat away from the president. And the current heartbeat is owned currently by Joe Biden, which is scary. She's like the batter, the on-deck batter and the pitcher is up at the plate and you know he's going to whiff in three. She's that close. That's why people are worried. I love that Jen Psaki blames all of this criticism on racism and sexism even though it was coming from the White House, which means, I guess that makes Joe Biden a white supremacist. He did go to a funeral to the Grand Cyclops so maybe that's true. But you get the sense that this is the most inept presidential administration in history yet they've been in politics forever. This isn't like Trump who is the consummate outsider. These are insiders and elites with a combined experience of probably centuries. And they've been doing this job for decades and they suck.

Fixing problems and saving people's lives takes a lot of effort and elbow grease and rolling up your sleeves. She doesn't want to do any of those things. Again, you're not going to fix the problem now. She's not even identifying the problem in terms of immigration. People are suffering. People are suffering at the border. People are suffering in other countries. She doesn't have a plan for any of it. She's not acknowledging that it's a multipronged issue that she simply doesn't have the confidence to solve. But what has happened in this White House, staffers in the Biden administration have reached critical mass. They have decided that she's the anvil that's pulling the administration down. People -- voters look at her and realize she's the plan B and that's why her poll numbers are lower.

And she does this fact-finding karaoke. And then it's like all done and she pulls the Pontius Pilate, washes her hands. I don't think I've ever seen that before where somebody chooses not to do the job they give you. She's worse than the cable guy. You know, the cable guy when he -- he'll be four or five hours late, but he'll fix your cable. She did not! She actually thought all she had to do was go there. Meanwhile, you know, she's a heartbeat away from the president. And the current heartbeat is owned currently by Joe Biden, which is scary. She's like the batter, the on-deck batter and the pitcher is up at the plate and you know he's going to whiff in three. She's that close. That's why people are worried. I love that Jen Psaki blames all of this criticism on racism and sexism even though it was coming from the White House, which means, I guess that makes Joe Biden a white supremacist. He did go to a funeral to the Grand Cyclops so maybe that's true. But you get the sense that this is the most inept presidential administration in history yet they've been in politics forever. This isn't like Trump who is the consummate outsider. These are insiders and elites with a combined experience of probably centuries. And they've been doing this job for decades and they suck. What does that tell you? You need people who aren't in government to run government."

Anyone who's got a difficult problem, Alejandro Mayorkas, we can't wave a magic wand, we can't flip a switch, we can't do anything instantaneous. I get it, government is hard work. Fixing problems and saving people's lives takes a lot of effort and elbow grease and rolling up your sleeves. She doesn't want to do any of those things. Again, you're not going to fix the problem now. She's not even identifying the problem in terms of immigration. People are suffering. People are suffering at the border. People are suffering in other countries. She doesn't have a plan for any of it. She's not acknowledging that it's a multipronged issue that she simply doesn't have the confidence to solve. But what has happened in this White House, staffers in the Biden administration have reached critical mass. They have decided that she's the anvil that's pulling the administration down. People -- voters look at her and realize she's the plan B and that's why her poll numbers are lower. Because she is actually to a lot of people who are paying attention now, they say, I trust her less than I trust the president. And that is saying something."

You know, I don't know if it's about sexism or racism.

She was handed the attorney general position. She's never had to earn and she's never had to cultivate the hearts and minds of Californians and she's never had to earn her way. This is why she dropped out of the Iowa caucus, it's because she wasn't even popular with the Democrats. She was pulling it 3 percent when she dropped out. She raised less money than Mayor Pete. Her percentage 21 percent less than his. So there's absolutely no change from that day until now except for the position she now occupies, but the failures are par for the course.

My surmise is that things are not going well for the defendant because if they were on the road to an easy acquittal, I think that would have happened. You've had 24 hours of deliberation. So, I think that what's happening is that there's a negotiation, perhaps a compromise, a debate on whether to go with one of the lesser included charges rather than the more serious charges, the first degree charges. So, it could be that. It could be that someone is hung. That someone doesn't know or doesn't want to go along with the majority and is saying, you know, I want an acquittal and you want a conviction or vice versa. The human dynamic gets more gummy, gets more complicated the longer they are out. Now, comes the weekend. The tailing, the stalking by the NBC freelancer, although I'm right. I think Jesse is absolutely right, that every network does it. That stalking, I believe, is something that information will get to the jurors.

The version of the video was compressed. It was a smaller volume and it was less quality. And so the judge essentially wants to ascertain, okay, was this prejudicial? How much so? And he would need to rely on expert testimony to that effect. He's also not heard a rebuttal yet from prosecution to that motion. But to your point, you know, originally, the defense was arguing and they maintained this argument that there's been prosecutorial overreach this entire time. They said it's been intentional, in bad faith, its prejudiced the defendant. And at that point, they were arguing with prejudice to dismiss it with prejudice to prevent --"

But you can't just go after MSNBC. You got to throw CNN into the mix. We are realizing that the American media lied to us to protect the rioters. Kenosha was never a protest. It was never a protest. From the moment it started, it was a crime scene, right? And it was a crime scene created because an armed thug was rightfully shot. The whole protest lie was fabricated for one reason and one reason only. It was to use it as another way to emasculate the police. That ended up creating the vacuum which thuggery exploited and then drew in a person like Rittenhouse who came to help because he could see a city that he worked in, where his family lived, was being torched. So, it's all back to the media and I know you're surprised I blame them. But I don't understand Joy Reid.

Remember what happened to Bill Maher and how he got to be cancelled proof. He had the show, Politically Incorrect, on ABC network. A couple of weeks after 9/11, when everyone say those cowards attacked us, those cowards did this, Bill Maher said, wait a second, they're not cowards.

President Biden releasing a statement calling it a tragic milestone. And as critics pointed out, he had no harsh words for China. And given that most fentanyl originates there, you would think he would say something to President Xi. And not a peep about the Mexican border. He had President Obrador. He's with him right now. Not a peep about the dope coming across despite the fact that most of the deadly street drug is processed in Mexico before coming into our country to such devastating effect.

The prior president did, to your point, after not one -- not set foot for one instance into politics. Now, we have someone who told us, assured us that oh, I know everything about it, and he's been absolutely derelict. And keep in mind, guys, that for example, in Sacramento County in California where I'm from, three out of four overdoses are due to fentanyl. It will claim the lives of more residents than gun violence this year. The DEA for the first time in six years issued a public safety alert warning of these counterfeit pills. It's absolutely flooding every single state. It's why when polled, Ohio residents are most concerned about the Southern Border porousness because their families that are being ripped apart.
