      "sentences": "Joe Biden may have turned the page, we will not, 114 days now Americans trap behind enemy lines of terrorists, 127 days since Joe Biden lied and promised he'd leave nobody behind. The media mob, the big tech mob. They have all turned the page as well. And tonight in Afghanistan or the Islamic emirates of Afghanistan, they're now facing widespread starvation, economic collapse, a reign of terror, the Taliban just tortured a man to death over a critical Facebook post, some families are selling their young daughters to Taliban fighters in order to buy food, Clearly, no one is safe, including the Americans and U.S. green card holders that Joe abandoned and military family members. Make no mistake: Joe Biden, he can turn the page all he wants but they're still trapped behind enemy lines. They see, by the way, the world is watching, our enemies are all watching. They see Joe Biden on the world stage, they see his weakness, they do not respect him. They do not fear him. And that brings us to our top story tonight and that is every hostile actor on the world stage, every hostile regime on the world stage is now preparing to take full advantage of the fact that the leader of the free world, the supposed leader, Joe Biden, is weak and in an obvious and significant cognitive decline. They all know Joe has no backbone. Joe has no will and Joe has no ability to protect America and the Western world's interests around the globe. And, by the way, now, they are looking to capitalize big time. Tonight, there are three very serious crises on the horizon. Look at Russia, they are now threatening to invade Ukraine. They have a massive troop presence and deployment right on the border. China is threatening to take over Taiwan or as they call it reunification. It's a takeover. They're saying so publicly and they have no problem all day long, flying fighter jets all over Taiwan's airspace. Iran is now on the verge of getting nuclear weapons. Joe stupidly is just easing sanctions, as if that's going to work. And it appears most days, Joe Biden doesn't even know what day of the week it is. Let's break this down. It's very important. This could go south really fast. First, according to U.S. intelligence Russian dictator, the hostile actor that he is, Vladimir Putin is now planning what is a massive military invasion of Ukraine. We have satellite images. They show somewhere between 70,000 and 94,000 Russian troops already amassed at the border, around a hundred thousand more soldiers are in the process of being mobilized as we speak. And thanks to Joe Biden green lighting Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline while firing keystone xl uh pipeline workers, Putin should have no problem at all funding a large-scale operation. Joe's also begging ironically Vladimir to produce more energy so we can import it from him. Now, with each passing day, an invasion seems inevitable and let me say this one more time -- appeasement and weakness will never work. Tomorrow, Joe Biden is planning to give Vladimir -- we are told -- a stern talking to which undoubtedly will resolve nothing. I can tell you one thing the White House won't do, they won't put out a transcript of what Joe has to say because if they ever did, we could see how weak he really is. Is there any doubts that Putin is laughing behind the scenes of Joe Biden? You don't think Joe is being laughed at, being the cognitive mess he is in the Kremlin? Meanwhile, another deeply concerning international crisis is unfolding a little closer to home. China not only is saber rattling with Taiwan. They're now reportedly attempting to establish what is their first permanent military base on the Atlantic Ocean, giving China's navy the ability to operate just off the east coast of the United States. And we thought the hypersonic missile was bad. And this as China continues to ramp up hostilities as I said against Taiwan. They refuse to take any responsibility for the pandemic. They unleashed on the entire world. It keeps getting worse, one new variant after another. And let's not forget about China's forced labor, their concentration camps. It is now presently modern day being used against their minority Muslim population. So far, Biden's only response, a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in China in 2022. Oh, in other words, Tony Blinken, the weak secretary of state that he is, the pathetically weak one, he's not going to be attending the Olympics this year? President Xi is laughing as well at the cognitive mess that is Joe Biden, which brings us now to the third international crisis. Iran sadly dangerously is closer than ever to develop into -- developing a nuclear weapon. Now, surprise, surprise, Biden's polite negotiations with the mullahs in Iran have fallen apart. And now, the administration is asking China and Russia, America's two biggest foes, help out pressure Iran with us. Now, Joe begs OPEC and China and Russia. Okay, that would be the trifecta of Joe Biden foreign policy failure and, of course, the other option now being weighed by Joe Biden. Just accept a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclear- capable Iran. In other words, nuclear weapons in the hands of the number one state sponsor of terror that have this sick twisted ugly ideology of convert or die. Now, Joe, here's an idea. Maybe you can send, I don't know -- maybe send Hunter, the crack addict-turned-world-renowned artist. Hunter Biden, you can send him to China and Russia and sort everything out. After all, Hunter's been very successful raking in massive sums of cash from those two countries over the years without any relevant experience so we can find it all. And, of course, Hunter was selling access to his father. We know that. And meanwhile, we have no idea who's shelling out what up to five hundred thousand dollars for Hunter's, what, portraits of a crack addict. But I have a feeling the so-called art collectors are looking to buy more than just a terrible painting from an amateur artist. Remember, Hunter Biden is currently under investigation for international tax evasion, money laundering, but he's a Democrat. They get away with everything. The FBI reportedly in possession of Hunter's laptop from hell as Miranda Devine's book points out. Several months ago, Jen Psaki gladly referring to stories surrounding Hunter Biden's laptop as Russian disinformation. Today, she couldn't be bothered to circle back on the very important story and the lie that she told. Take a look.",

The Biden administration is facing these dizzying array of threats. And the question I think for our intelligence community right now is, is Russia planning on invading? is China going to invade Taiwan? Are they coordinating together because they have a very strong strategic relationship they conducted military exercises together this summer? Those are big issues for us. And then the question of deterrence. Deterrence happens when you demonstrate your adversary that the price of an attack is so great that it's not worth doing in the first place, and I'm not sure we've demonstrated that for Ukraine or for Taiwan. I think the United States and our allies have a lot more to do than simple diplomatic moral suasion which is what we've seen so far.",

That -- the very first meeting we had with President Xi and Mar-a-Lago, do you remember it was in April of 2017. But you know at that very same meeting during dinner, President Trump excused himself because there was a SCIF, like a little Situation Room in Mar-a-Lago and if you look it up, you'll see that was the same night that we ordered the airstrike in Syria during the meeting with President Xi in Mar-a-Lago. So if you want to compare the two where you're having a meeting with Xi, you're ordering an airstrike on Syria, you're going back up for dessert and coffee and then you're holding a press conference on what you just did to Syria after they dropped chemical weapons --",

I think the Russians have made it clear their red line is that Ukraine cannot join NATO or the European Union. The United States and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg have made it clear that that's a decision for Ukraine to make. Well, if that's what we're saying, then we need to back that up with greater support for Ukraine to defend themselves against Russia and we haven't done that unfortunately. So I think right now for me, at least, it's a question of timing, and I think that's the question for the intelligence community.

Now that prompted a response from Walgreens, quote, organized retail crime is one of the top challenges the company's facing. That's why they're closing stores in areas. Now, the issue is by the way has evolved beyond shoplifting and petty theft to the sale of stolen and counterfeit goods online. Now, of course, we have shown you night after night after night, the real world crime surge that is happening in Democratic-run cities from coast to coast -- look at your screen right there -- you got a looting of a Louis Vuitton store in beautiful San Francisco. By the way, you see that right there. That's a smash-and-grab across the bay in Oakland, California. In that case, targeting a jewelry store last month. Here's another one. In Oakbrook, Illinois, outside of Chicago -- and that's just a small sample of the left-wing lawlessness all across the country. Now, of course, this is not the first time we have seen Democrats the media mob denying what is unfolding before their very eyes. You might remember this fake news CNN banner during the Kenosha riots. Look in the background, you can see a city on fire but anyway, fiery but mostly peaceful to describe what is violent rioting. Even major corporations, they're taking notice of this crime in major cities. For example, Bank of America is now telling junior staffers in New York to dress down amid the city's crime surge. In Chicago, Lori Lightweight is out there saying we're now learning that a bus driver has been hospitalized -- get this -- after being beaten in the street, 21 juveniles being arrested in connection with that attack. And get this, out in Los Angeles, the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, there was even an armed robbery during a private Christmas party where thieves were demanding that attendees hand over all their jewelry and their phones. And it doesn't stop there. Look at your screen, of this recent follow home robbery victim. One victim attack, punched in the face by an armed gunman and, of course, this is all the result of this left-wing progressive, you know, policies defund, dismantled, no-bail policies of the Democrats, and the consequence of policies that coddle criminals and fail to protect the innocent. For example, out in Pueblo, Colorado, the police chief out there is now sounding the alarm about a new city policy that hampers law enforcement's ability to haul thieves off to jail if they steal less than two thousand dollars worth of goods. Here with reaction, host of \"Unfiltered\" right here on the FOX News Channel, Dan Bongino, along with FOX News correspondent at large Gerald Rivera.

Governor Kemp has lost the confidence of the people, of Republicans, of conservatives of Georgia. David Perdue is by far the stronger candidate to go up against Stacey Abrams. She's a formidable candidate. Kemp would also end up hurting Herschel Walker in his race against Raphael Warnock. That can't happen either.

      "utterance": "Joe Biden, he can turn the page all he wants but they're still trapped behind enemy lines. They see, by the way, the world is watching, our enemies are all watching. They see Joe Biden on the world stage, they see his weakness, they do not respect him. They do not fear him. And that brings us to our top story tonight and that is every hostile actor on the world stage, every hostile regime on the world stage is now preparing to take full advantage of the fact that the leader of the free world, the supposed leader, Joe Biden, is weak and in an obvious and significant cognitive decline. They all know Joe has no backbone. Joe has no will and Joe has no ability to protect America and the Western world's interests around the globe. And, by the way, now, they are looking to capitalize big time. Tonight, there are three very serious crises on the horizon. Look at Russia, they are now threatening to invade Ukraine. They have a massive troop presence and deployment right on the border. China is threatening to take over Taiwan or as they call it reunification. It's a takeover. They're saying so publicly and they have no problem all day long, flying fighter jets all over Taiwan's airspace. Iran is now on the verge of getting nuclear weapons. Joe stupidly is just easing sanctions, as if that's going to work. And it appears most days, Joe Biden doesn't even know what day of the week it is. Let's break this down. It's very important. This could go south really fast. First, according to U.S. intelligence Russian dictator, the hostile actor that he is, Vladimir Putin is now planning what is a massive military invasion of Ukraine. We have satellite images. They show somewhere between 70,000 and 94,000 Russian troops already amassed at the border, around a hundred thousand more soldiers are in the process of being mobilized as we speak. And thanks to Joe Biden green lighting Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline while firing keystone xl uh pipeline workers, Putin should have no problem at all funding a large-scale operation. Joe's also begging ironically Vladimir to produce more energy so we can import it from him. Now, with each passing day, an invasion seems inevitable and let me say this one more time -- appeasement and weakness will never work. Tomorrow, Joe Biden is planning to give Vladimir -- we are told -- a stern talking to which undoubtedly will resolve nothing. I can tell you one thing the White House won't do, they won't put out a transcript of what Joe has to say because if they ever did, we could see how weak he really is. Is there any doubts that Putin is laughing behind the scenes of Joe Biden? You don't think Joe is being laughed at, being the cognitive mess he is in the Kremlin? Meanwhile, another deeply concerning international crisis is unfolding a little closer to home. China not only is saber rattling with Taiwan. They're now reportedly attempting to establish what is their first permanent military base on the Atlantic Ocean, giving China's navy the ability to operate just off the east coast of the United States. And we thought the hypersonic missile was bad. And this as China continues to ramp up hostilities as I said against Taiwan. They refuse to take any responsibility for the pandemic. They unleashed on the entire world. It keeps getting worse, one new variant after another. And let's not forget about China's forced labor, their concentration camps. It is now presently modern day being used against their minority Muslim population. So far, Biden's only response, a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in China in 2022. Oh, in other words, Tony Blinken, the weak secretary of state that he is, the pathetically weak one, he's not going to be attending the Olympics this year? President Xi is laughing as well at the cognitive mess that is Joe Biden, which brings us now to the third international crisis. Iran sadly dangerously is closer than ever to develop into -- developing a nuclear weapon. Now, surprise, surprise, Biden's polite negotiations with the mullahs in Iran have fallen apart. And now, the administration is asking China and Russia, America's two biggest foes, help out pressure Iran with us. Now, Joe begs OPEC and China and Russia. Okay, that would be the trifecta of Joe Biden foreign policy failure and, of course, the other option now being weighed by Joe Biden. Just accept a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclear- capable Iran. In other words, nuclear weapons in the hands of the number one state sponsor of terror that have this sick twisted ugly ideology of convert or die. Now, Joe, here's an idea. Maybe you can send, I don't know -- maybe send Hunter, the crack addict-turned-world-renowned artist. Hunter Biden, you can send him to China and Russia and sort everything out. After all, Hunter's been very successful raking in massive sums of cash from those two countries over the years without any relevant experience so we can find it all. And, of course, Hunter was selling access to his father. We know that. And meanwhile, we have no idea who's shelling out what up to five hundred thousand dollars for Hunter's, what, portraits of a crack addict. But I have a feeling the so-called art collectors are looking to buy more than just a terrible painting from an amateur artist. Remember, Hunter Biden is currently under investigation for international tax evasion, money laundering, but he's a Democrat. They get away with everything. The FBI reportedly in possession of Hunter's laptop from hell as Miranda Devine's book points out. Several months ago, Jen Psaki gladly referring to stories surrounding Hunter Biden's laptop as Russian disinformation. Today, she couldn't be bothered to circle back on the very important story and the lie that she told. Take a look."

But you told me repeatedly that yes, I was being spied on.

And let's not forget North Korea as well, they've got a nuclear arsenal with ballistic missiles they're threatening the region and the homeland as well. The Biden administration is facing these dizzying array of threats. And the question I think for our intelligence community right now is, is Russia planning on invading? is China going to invade Taiwan? Are they coordinating together because they have a very strong strategic relationship they conducted military exercises together this summer? Those are big issues for us. And then the question of deterrence. Deterrence happens when you demonstrate your adversary that the price of an attack is so great that it's not worth doing in the first place, and I'm not sure we've demonstrated that for Ukraine or for Taiwan. I think the United States and our allies have a lot more to do than simple diplomatic moral suasion which is what we've seen so far."

And I think one of the reasons China didn't show hostility towards Taiwan is they believe Donald Trump wouldn't take that crap, and that Donald Trump will respond they feared him and they believed him.

But the other part of that quote is that weakness only invites aggression. And when you're weak at home, it invites aggression overseas and speaking of President Xi, let me just go back in time for everyone for a second and talk about what President Trump did. That -- the very first meeting we had with President Xi and Mar-a-Lago, do you remember it was in April of 2017. But you know at that very same meeting during dinner, President Trump excused himself because there was a SCIF, like a little Situation Room in Mar-a-Lago and if you look it up, you'll see that was the same night that we ordered the airstrike in Syria during the meeting with President Xi in Mar-a-Lago. So if you want to compare the two where you're having a meeting with Xi, you're ordering an airstrike on Syria, you're going back up for dessert and coffee and then you're holding a press conference on what you just did to Syria after they dropped chemical weapons --"

I mean, meeting with Putin, meeting with President Xi multiple times, meeting with the crazy guy up in North Korea, Kim Jong-un. I mean, he did it. He wasn't weak. He was aggressive and when you have this weakness at home, it's going to bring aggression overseas. Biden's got to get together because it's scary stuff. This is not a joke."

      "utterance": "I think both China and Russia are probing our defenses. We've seen that China is mounting lots of air incursions into Taiwan airspace. They're mounting full throttled cyber attacks. The Russians are doing the same thing against Ukraine. I think the question is one of timing frankly. I think the Russians have made it clear their red line is that Ukraine cannot join NATO or the European Union. The United States and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg have made it clear that that's a decision for Ukraine to make. Well, if that's what we're saying, then we need to back that up with greater support for Ukraine to defend themselves against Russia and we haven't done that unfortunately. So I think right now for me, at least, it's a question of timing, and I think that's the question for the intelligence community. I'm quite sure the Biden administration's being briefed on a daily basis about the threats. The question is, what will the policy response be and are we up to the task?"

You've got the worst inflation that we've seen 30 years. You've got a horrible jobs number. You saw 210,000 jobs, the worst jobs number we've seen in a long time. As you just pointed out, China and Taiwan, Russia trying to take Ukraine, mess on the southern border -- I mean, where do you want me to stop ramping crime all across this country right people still you know massively out of work in this country. I mean, it's a disaster. It's -- they don't have a single thing that they have accomplished. They don't have a single thing that they've done well. And you know what? A very easy, you know, secret -- people want to pay play for the winning team, right? There are no wins. These people aren't delivering any wins. If this is a losing team and it's not shocking that they know Biden won't run again, they know Kamala is no longer kind of the darling child that she used to be.

Then we got third in -- you know, a little out of order but the vice president that is not -- clearly not up to the job.

She told the paper, quote, a lot of these allegations of organized retail theft are not actually panning out, adding, quote, I believe it's a Walgreens in California that cited it, but the data didn't back it up. Now that prompted a response from Walgreens, quote, organized retail crime is one of the top challenges the company's facing. That's why they're closing stores in areas. Now, the issue is by the way has evolved beyond shoplifting and petty theft to the sale of stolen and counterfeit goods online. Now, of course, we have shown you night after night after night, the real world crime surge that is happening in Democratic-run cities from coast to coast -- look at your screen right there -- you got a looting of a Louis Vuitton store in beautiful San Francisco. By the way, you see that right there. That's a smash-and-grab across the bay in Oakland, California. In that case, targeting a jewelry store last month. Here's another one. In Oakbrook, Illinois, outside of Chicago -- and that's just a small sample of the left-wing lawlessness all across the country. Now, of course, this is not the first time we have seen Democrats the media mob denying what is unfolding before their very eyes. You might remember this fake news CNN banner during the Kenosha riots. Look in the background, you can see a city on fire but anyway, fiery but mostly peaceful to describe what is violent rioting. Even major corporations, they're taking notice of this crime in major cities. For example, Bank of America is now telling junior staffers in New York to dress down amid the city's crime surge. In Chicago, Lori Lightweight is out there saying we're now learning that a bus driver has been hospitalized -- get this -- after being beaten in the street, 21 juveniles being arrested in connection with that attack. And get this, out in Los Angeles, the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, there was even an armed robbery during a private Christmas party where thieves were demanding that attendees hand over all their jewelry and their phones. And it doesn't stop there. Look at your screen, of this recent follow home robbery victim. One victim attack, punched in the face by an armed gunman and, of course, this is all the result of this left-wing progressive, you know, policies defund, dismantled, no-bail policies of the Democrats, and the consequence of policies that coddle criminals and fail to protect the innocent. For example, out in Pueblo, Colorado, the police chief out there is now sounding the alarm about a new city policy that hampers law enforcement's ability to haul thieves off to jail if they steal less than two thousand dollars worth of goods. Here with reaction, host of \"Unfiltered\" right here on the FOX News Channel, Dan Bongino, along with FOX News correspondent at large Gerald Rivera.

What about the 535 riots? What about these smash and grabs? Where the committee investigations into these incidents? In the summer of 2020, we had dozens of Americans dead thousands of cops hurt, billions of dollars in property damage, looting and arson, where's Liz Cheney? I'm trying to find her."

She doesn't have any time for that. You know, and in regards to the opening of your uh monologue there were you discussing how AOC said that what we're watching on the TV right now I can see on return is not happening, that this is all somehow an act. You know, I wonder, having run for office, I had the unfortunate experience of meeting a lot of politicians and I came up with a conclusion, Sean, they're one of two things, but they're mostly either really dumb or they're all liars. Most of them are generally liars, they're not all stupid. When it comes to AOC and Joe Biden though, I'm genuinely not sure if she's a moron. Like she may actually believe none of this is actually happening. So I'm going to give her -- I'm not sure really like most politicians are just really good liars but I'm not sure she's bright enough to figure out if what's happening there is really happening. But just one more quick notice, you know, on a very serious note, a very small number of criminals, thank the Lord, commits the overwhelming number of crimes. So we don't want everybody committing crimes obviously, right? And when you let that small number of criminals out and you dump broken windows policing, this is the kind of stuff that happens. None of this is a surprise, Sean."

Now, when you think about these kids going home with these stolen goods, how is it that they can take them into their homes, their parents are there, their siblings are there, is that really what's happening? Or -- and I just been thinking about this over the last couple of days, is there really organized crime involvement here taking advantage of reduced sentencing in crimes? In other words, in California now, you don't get prosecuted if the shoplifting is under $950. So are the organized criminals recruiting all these kids and saying, you snatch the stuff, you get the stuff, you breast it up, you just give me the armfuls, I'll pay you cash then I'll fence it on the Internet.

Now, tonight, other breaking news out of the state of Georgia, former Republican Senator David Perdue, he is jumping into the governor's race. He is challenging the incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp for the GOP nomination. I've been saying this. Governor Kemp has lost the confidence of the people, of Republicans, of conservatives of Georgia. David Perdue is by far the stronger candidate to go up against Stacey Abrams. She's a formidable candidate. Kemp would also end up hurting Herschel Walker in his race against Raphael Warnock. That can't happen either. So, Perdue's announcement and his endorsement just earlier tonight from former President Trump should be a welcome sign for all Georgia Republicans and conservatives that actually would like to win the state of Georgia in 2022. Meanwhile, Stacey Abrams, she's out trying to rewrite history. She goes over to tin foil hat Rachel Maddow show, trying to claim that she never ever cast out on the election results back in 2018. Rachel, of course, let her get away with this lie."

So let's be clear this is not a speech of concession. We had this little election back in 2018, despite the final tally and the inauguration and the situation we find ourselves in, I do have one very affirmative statement to make. We won. I believe was a stolen election -- and I'm not saying they stole it from me -- they stole it from the voters of Georgia."

When is NBC going to care about the facts and reality? And why was there no pushback from those obvious provable lies from Abrams? Now, of course, we know why, because the mob and the media just like the big tech mob is an arm of the Democratic Party, parroting the same talking points, the same fake news and living in the same echo chamber. Here with reaction, former senator now Georgia gubernatorial candidate David Perdue. I'm glad you got in because Governor Kemp -- in my view and I've been saying this -- cannot win. He has lost confidence with every -- you know, I lived in Georgia for a while. He's lost confidence from all of my friends in Georgia and you have their confidence.

It's a sad state that the cur -- sad state of affairs that our current governor has lost the confidence of many Republicans. But, Sean, I'm excited. This has been a great day. Since our announcement this morning, this is my first interview. And as you said, just a few minutes ago, Donald Trump has given us his full endorsement in our campaign and if you'll permit me. I need your viewers to join Donald Trump and me tonight in helping us stop Stacey Abrams by going to DavidPerdueGA.com. She wants to transform our state into another failed state like California. You heard all that news about San Francisco just now. That's what she wants to bring to Georgia, and I'm going to stand in the breach and make sure she never does that."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

I would argue that we just proved Stacey Abrams lied when she went on Rachel Maddow's show. I think there might be a campaign ad there, just a humble suggestion from a -- from a member of the press, a talk show host. But in reality, the -- I really think the consent agreement that was made with the Republican Party, Raffensperger (ph) and Kemp defending it all was one of the worst decisions ever because it took away some of the integrity measures that I think every state should have. We need voter ID, signature verification, chain of custody controls. There was no accommodation made for COVID. You have a law -- correct me if I'm wrong -- in Georgia, like many other states, that says partisan observers get to watch the vote count start to finish. You can't watch a vote count from 20, 40, 100 feet away, can you?"

      "speaker": "PERDUE",

They want to know in our democracy when they vote, it's going to count and not be stolen. Let's be very clear though. Stacey Abrams is not interested in Georgia. She wants to become president of the United States, and this is the Democratic Party's way of showcasing her, and I believe that we'll be able to stop that. But I want to run a race based on my vision for our state, not looking backwards, Sean, but looking forward. I mean, we're going to make sure this never happens again but I want to eliminate the state income tax. Give education of our children back to our parents. I want to make our cities and states safe again. I want to fight Biden at every turn on these silly mandates that you call out every night. And I'll tell you one more thing, Sean. Over my dead body will we ever do what Kemp did and that is turn our elections over to Stacey Abrams. We'll never let that happen again."

You have chain of custody controls, as I understand it. Partisan observers can observe, updating voter rolls, signature verification. Can that be added before the next election? I think that should be standard in every state."

      "speaker": "PERDUE",
      "utterance": "Well, Sean, you point out the changes. Our state legislature did a good job this past year, this year, making some changes. It's not perfect yet. But we can't let Republicans not vote again. In this election, both in the primary and the general, we learn in my runoff and Kelly Loeffler's runoff, that if we don't vote, they're going to win, the other side wins. So we have to get out and vote. It's not perfect but it's good enough. It's what President Trump said in the Virginia race the night before the election, get out and vote. Let's overwhelm the shortcomings, put a new governor in and we'll get it fixed. That's my pledge to the people of Georgia."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

If that's going to be the way the system goes, you better engage it the way they do because they work hard at it. David Perdue, I'm glad you got in this race. I hope you win this primary.

And Smollett and his defense team are now trying to discredit the Chicago police and the Osundairo brothers who testified on the stand that this was a hoax. And some of the other highlights from Smollett on the stand today -- he testified that he did not call police after his alleged attack because, quote, as a black man, he does not trust police. Smollett explained that on the night of the alleged attack, he got a call from one of the Osundairo brothers who told Smollett he needed to eat some eggs in order to keep up with his meal plan. Smollett testified that's why he went to the Walgreens and the subway after 1:00 a.m. on a frigid night. Also, Smollett countered what some of the Osundairo brothers testified under oath. Smollett light saying he did have sexual encounters with one of the brothers and that he did pay one of the brothers for cocaine. Smollett also insists he has a scar beneath one of his eyes from the alleged attack even though the northwestern doctor who treated Smollett testified under oath that Smollett had no known injuries. Smollett also told the court that one of his attackers was pale skinned, and there was a security guard who backed him up saying that he saw a white-skinned male run away from the Smollett scene although that security guard only saw the male for a flash and that male had a ski mask on. Smollett is scheduled to retake the stand tomorrow, Sean."
