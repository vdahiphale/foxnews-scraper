I actually don't think, the British perspective for me is, having been here six years in America and lived here and understood things I didn't understand when I lived in the U.K., yes, it's true that in countries like the U.K. they look at this and say what is the matter with them? Why does this keep happening? Why can't they sort it out? Now that I'm here, I just understand it's not as simple as that. There's a heritage and a culture and a history here. It means that some of the solutions that may seem obvious in other countries are just not obvious here. I think it's also important to point out when we see something like this, it focuses all of our attention, these mass shootings, but most of the people that die from gun violence in America don't die in these situations. They die in ones that never get attention.

And now we are coming up almost on the 20th anniversary of columbine in 1999. It's been a generation. And so you see all the preparation that goes into not only the authorities but I think almost the students. The way they were describing their experience, some were clearly emotionally rattled. Others, though, were describing it because they are kind of used to the procedures.

There apparently been 12 school shootings in 2018 so far. We have had 45 days of 2018. Not necessarily with this kind of fatality lever, but yes, this happens too much."

      "utterance": "Getting to stopping this, Steve, is really a conundrum. It doesn't happen in Great Britain at the frequency it has here. It happens, but it doesn't happen in these numbers. You heard Senator Nelson, Senator Rubio, wait for the facts, see what the deal is. But there is a hunger to try to figure out how we as a country are going to tackle this. STEVE HILTON, HOST, FOX NEWS There is. And exactly as Mara was saying, it is just really hard to take. No child should have to see things like that and have to recount them in the way we just heard. And of course there is a natural human reaction which is to say there must be something we can do. There must be some wand, policy of some kind that we can wave and make this not happen. I actually don't think, the British perspective for me is, having been here six years in America and lived here and understood things I didn't understand when I lived in the U.K., yes, it's true that in countries like the U.K. they look at this and say what is the matter with them? Why does this keep happening? Why can't they sort it out? Now that I'm here, I just understand it's not as simple as that. There's a heritage and a culture and a history here. It means that some of the solutions that may seem obvious in other countries are just not obvious here. I think it's also important to point out when we see something like this, it focuses all of our attention, these mass shootings, but most of the people that die from gun violence in America don't die in these situations. They die in ones that never get attention. And I think the idea that there is a simple solution is just not true."

We cover them here, but in this situation, these mass school shootings, it does not appear that this guy has a terrorist tie. We don't know. But he's been expelled for disciplinary action, seemed like a troubled student who was talking about guns and bombs before."

      "utterance": "It struck me he was born in 1998, just a few months before Columbine. Really kind of inaugurated this historical epoch of the school shootings as being a major media event. And now we are coming up almost on the 20th anniversary of columbine in 1999. It's been a generation. And so you see all the preparation that goes into not only the authorities but I think almost the students. The way they were describing their experience, some were clearly emotionally rattled. Others, though, were describing it because they are kind of used to the procedures. It's become kind of a way of life, which I don't think anyone counted on when Columbine happened. Another x factor is social media. When Columbine happened, we had cable news, we had 24-hour coverage. Now, though, we have real-time accounts from students themselves. On the one hand, that gives us a perspective about what happening. On the other, however, it means sometimes misinformation and rumor can get involved as well. So we are living in this era, but there have been new changes I think that make it all the more visceral to us."

It didn't come out of Newtown where several dozen little tinny kids were gunned down it's not going to come out of this. However, I don't think there's a simple solution, but I think there are some things you could do to make these less frequent, to make gun deaths in general less frequent. Why do people on a terrorist watch list still allowed to buy guns. For instance, isn't there a better system for flagging mental health problems? I don't know what it would be, but it seems there are some things, some simple things, maybe not wave a magic wand to get rid of all of them, but this shouldn't happen this often period. I don't care if we live in a country that has a strong, proud heritage of owning firearms. This shouldn't happen this often."

      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "When we have these discussions after these horrific events, that phrase comes up a lot, mental health. I think we need to go deeper than that because there's a sense of social breakdown not just in America. I don't want to make it American, but you see it in countries, we saw in the U.K. when I worked in government there, and it was one of the things we tried to address, and it comes back to things like the disintegration of the family, children growing up not in stable, loving homes as we would want to see. There are all the other issues that we deal with piecemeal. But I go back to that notion of stability in the family home, and that is something that government can help address. And I don't see any sign of the kind of focus we need on helping make sure that every child in this country grows up in a stable, loving home. That certainly would help with this."
