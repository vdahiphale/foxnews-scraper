And I think the lesson from the last few days, from what we have seen in terms of the renewal of the spread of the virus, is that everyone needs to get vaccinated. This is now about the people's choice, not politics. And the people are going to decide whether or not we get the schools open effectively, whether or not we all get back to the office after Labor Day, whether or not we can keep this economic recovery roaring. I think that's it. And 99 percent of the people dying are unvaccinated. That's not a matter of politics. That's a matter of fact. And we all have to take that to heart. And I think particularly, we have to say, unlike what we saw between Dr. Fauci and Dr. Paul, and I will take the virus specialist over the ophthalmologist when it comes to COVID, but we have to say let's forget the politics.

They came to Washington to alarm people for a cause, and it's all backfired and be gotten them sick. And they are not going to be able to get out their message anymore. And when they get back to Texas, they will get arrested. So if you wanted to design an event that failed, this is how you do it. And I just -- the only good thing about this, it's a reminder to everybody that even if you have been vaccinated, that you can still get COVID, and that means the people who aren't vaccinated need to get vaccinated because you won't get sick and you won't go to the hospital.
