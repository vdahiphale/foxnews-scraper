A guy that's never been political, who's basically CEO for the country, whether you like it or not. He's got full employment. He's got a great economy. He got prison reform. He got drug reform. He's got trade resets whether you like it or not, and worse of being drawn down. Lot of this stuff doesn't land on one side, it's on every side. You could be a lefty and like prison reform.

The Trump's White House is trying to convince the American people that the Democrats are just doing everything political, and that's working in their favor in a lot of ways, especially when you have the chairman of the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, getting four Pinocchio's from the Washington Post for not being fully forthcoming about the committee's contact with the whistleblower before the complaint was filed. Do think though that the White House has some resetting to do as well, because the more they talk about this, the more they're not able to say on that one key message, which is the Democrats are the do-nothing Democrats, and that we're actually here doing stuff on behalf of the American people, talking about the economy, the unemployment rate down again, the 3.5 percent. The stock market is having a little bit of resurgence. I look to Dagen for that. The House really isn't a question for the Democrats, they have 235 votes. The Senate, there's very little chance, like maybe zero minuscule chance that the Republicans would ever join the Democrats in this effort. So, now, really, it's in the court of public opinion. The American people will decide. But if I were in the White House I'd reset a little bit over the weekend."

And so, I think, he was properly chastened, I think he made a mistake. And I think he made a mistake with the parity, you know. I understand it was just, you know, summarizing what the president had to say, but it's right there in front of you, so he should have just read it. My feeling is though it's pretty funny to hear the president say, this is all about corruption. I'm just concerned about corruption. I'm not concern about politics. Wait a minute, the only time I see him screaming about corruption with the Ukrainians, the Russians, anybody else, it's Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton.

And more and more, Joe Biden, from the Democrat perspective, looks expendable. He's disposable. He is political picnic cutlery, if you will. They can get rid of him. They hate Trump more than they like Joe Biden, clearly. They're betting this impeachment push completely on the Ukraine or Ukraine. It's going to mean a drip, drip, drip, drop, drop, plot, plot, about Hunter Biden coming out of the Ukraine and his -- I mean, it's obvious influence peddling, whether Joe -- whatever the vice president know about it or not. And it smells like pay to play. That's going to be the messaging. Biden already had a reputation for being undisciplined, lousy at fund- raising. He's still lousy at fundraising, rusty and unfocused, and he represents everything that the very left-wing party hates. I think that he's a goner, and he's barely leading in the national poll."

He gave donations to Republicans. He gave donations to Democrats. Now, he's found himself in this two-sided prison, right? And he's like watching people call him political who created the political environment well before he got there, and while he's there. So he's trying -- so think about this. A guy that's never been political, who's basically CEO for the country, whether you like it or not. He's got full employment. He's got a great economy. He got prison reform. He got drug reform. He's got trade resets whether you like it or not, and worse of being drawn down. Lot of this stuff doesn't land on one side, it's on every side. You could be a lefty and like prison reform. You could be a righty and like whatever else he's doing, the immigration stuff. The wars, libertarians must love this guy. So he is not a partisan person. So when you see somebody who is angry, he's angry that there's a side going against him in which he's trying to please all sides. And he realized that achievement, and they are achievements, are no match for a political party married to the media. He's getting all this crap done, but nobody cares."

She won her 12th gold medal that gives her the record for the most gold at the Track and Field World Championships surpassing even Usain Bolt. She is not trying to make her fifth Olympic team and you should know she is one of the women who got Nike to change its policy to give more support to pregnant women. \"Run, Mom, Run\"."
