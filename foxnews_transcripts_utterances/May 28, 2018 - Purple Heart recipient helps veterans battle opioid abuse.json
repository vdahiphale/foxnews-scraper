That effort continues here nearby Ellicott City, and just about 24 hours ago, he was eating at a restaurant 50 to 100 yards that's Main Street right there. We're not allowed to go to that portion, but that's where a lot of the recovery efforts are concentrated. Officials say they also performed about 300 rescues because of last night's flooding, and in today, essentially you have the cleanup. This entire area you're looking at now -- first off, much of it was underwater about 24 hours ago. And then, during the day today, cruise pulled cars, if you can see the tracks in the sand there, those were cars that cruised and were moving from this area all throughout this stream as well. And then, throughout the day you've got -- you've got tow trucks just pulling cars up from the lower part of that road down there. Police say the area down there is all washed away. This is a reminder, this is the second time that this is happened in less than two years and business owners in the area say they're getting tired of it."

And until the building started collapsing and cars are coming down the street, I honestly didn't believe that it was happening again. And once it started, I started freaking out obviously, and you know started packing a bag and planning for what was going to come next, and you know kind of going down the checklist of things that I should have done last time, but -- you know, should have had to do it again.

You know, cars are just coming down like they were -- you know, just toys, you know. And it rose up so fast and sort of ripping things out so quickly that I didn't even -- you know, even though, if I was actually safe in my apartment because it was -- it's a stone building that I live in, and I'm on the third-floor apartment. But the way things were coming down around, me, I had no idea if I was safe or not."

The -- and after the flood of 2016, we rallied and we came back as a community stronger than ever, and I became close with all my neighbors in a way that I -- we never were before. And we really rallied around each other and brought each other back, and we were almost -- you know, back to full capacity, operating like we were before. And then, now this happens, we're all just questioning if we're going to go back or not. And, you know, I live on Main Street, I work on Main Street, and my entire life is on Main Street, it is my home. And that's why I went back after 2016 is because it is home. I have built my life for myself here and I don't want to have to leave. But, honestly, experiencing this twice in under two years is incredibly traumatic, and I don't have a good answer for if I'm going to come back or not."

So, I grabbed all my toiletries, shampoo, conditioner, a change of clothes to last me for about a week. I didn't make the best decisions in my choice of clothes, but you know, whatever.

And the latest little nugget is that today President Trump spoke on the phone with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the White House said that that the two agreed to meet in person and I quote, to continue close coordination in advance of the expected meeting between the United States and North Korea. So that's a statement from the White House calling this summit expected and then of course right now we know of at least two teams that are overseas preparing for this summit. One team is in Singapore led by the Deputy -- White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Hagen, the other team is in North Korea led by veteran American diplomat, the U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim. Now he's facing off against the North Korean Vice Foreign Minister whose explosive remarks last week threatening a nuclear to nuclear showdown and calling Vice President Pence a political dummy were partially responsible for President Trump canceling the summit. But since then, the President has done an about-face about the summit on Twitter and in remarks from the Oval Office on Saturday."

But of course, the North Koreans are really known for keeping their word and many Americans -- American officials are worried that they remain deeply skeptical that the North Koreans are going to continue to lie and that they would never officially entirely abandon all of their nuclear weapons.

Fischer, former State Department diplomat under President Obama who helped implement the Iran Nuclear Deal. Thanks to both of you for joining us. Y.J. I'll start with you.

I think the question is how President Trump is going to use this time and is he going to prepare for success because if he doesn't, then even if the summit gets rescheduled, you could easily get canceled again. If you look at what President Trump has done to date, Melissa, he's done three things. He set outsized expectations for the summit overstated what he had achieved and he has insisted on a maximalist position from the North Koreans. If you look at how Nixon approached Mao and how Reagan approached Gorbachev when they negotiated, that's not how they prepared for success."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, what's fundamentally - - well what's fundamentally different here is that Donald Trump is actually at the negotiating table. That didn't happen under Obama. It didn't happen with Secretary Clinton, it didn't happen with Secretary Kerry. So the very fact that they're actually having this dialogue bringing home hostages, they have made huge far more progress than anything else before. And I think Donald Trump in conjunction with Mike Pompeo as the Secretary of State are moving this in exactly the right direction. And whether or not it happens, actually, on the 12th or not but it's moving in the right direction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "I think that you know one of the biggest concerns that everyone has mentioned is how do you verify that he's actually telling the truth especially if they come to some agreement? I mean, Y.J., I would ask you as somebody who was involved in the Iran nuclear deal, you know, we heard about those anytime anywhere inspections and it doesn't seem like that actually happened are the things that you would do differently this time in order to make sure that we could actually inspect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "I think it's a great question. I think it's going to be the hardest part of the deal and I actually think that ultimately President Trump would be very happy if he could get a deal as good as the Iran Nuclear Deal because it is so unlikely that we are going to get the level of comprehensive verification with North Korea's program. I mean, North Korea is so much further along, it's really quite complicated. And I would also just add to this discussion, I think it's really also important to talk about what is President Trump going to put on the table. I mean, I would even ask Congressman Chaffetz how he feels about reports that President Trump was willing to pull U.S. troops out of South Korea. That's was even before North Korea made a single concession. I mean, those troops are protecting the peace in South Korea and serving as a deterrent should China, and I think we need to ask what is the U.S. willing to put on the table."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think before we pivot to that, I mean, let's tackle the idea of going in and authenticating what is actually going on because she said the President would be lucky to get as good a deal as we got with Iran and we know that that was a terrible deal because we never got the chance to go in and look at anything. So Jason, do you think he would actually agree to a deal like the Iran deal? I mean, he threw that one in the wastebasket."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "No. No -- yes exactly. Donald Trump tore that agreement up because there was no verification. You could not get there and you had to have weeks in advance. They could easily move the material, as the chairman of the Oversight Committee, I wanted to go to Iran, they said no you can't go. So what kind of verification is that? Donald Trump is leading. This is different than what you are used to dealing with which is leading from behind. Donald Trump is leading from the front and its peace through strength. It is a page out of Ronald Reagan's put a book and it's making sure that we have the strongest possible position economically and militarily. That's what's brought Kim Jong Un to the table as well as the Chinese. And our partnership with South Korea and Japan is going to make the best difference."

However, you can see off the little horizon our dark bands of rain on the backside of this subtropical storm are expected to reign it throughout the Panhandle for the rest of this evening. Now Alberto, the subtropical storm actually made landfall about 10 miles north of here, about 60 or 90 minutes ago. So it's now pushing northward, pushing inland. The threat of rains and flash flooding remains for the entire south, 48 inches of rain can come isolated spots getting 12 inches of rain. As for the surf, it remains dangerous rip currents. Everybody of -- along the Gulf Coast told not to go into the water. You can stand on the beach but don't go in the water because it simply is life-threatening. Some people did venture out after being locked up for three days because of the relentless rains that are now heading north into the inland of the United States. They came out tried to have a little bit of fun here but tens of millions of dollars were lost in tourism revenue blown away because people canceled plans, didn't make their trips down to the beaches in Florida. Many events actually got canceled. A Memorial Day parade in Sarasota today. And also a beach party in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday which is nothing but nonstop rain.

Very reminiscent of those comments her mother made about Americans being deplorable and irredeemable. But look, President Trump, he embodies what it means to be an American. He's a self-made billionaire. He conquered the political scene and how he's providing access to the American dream for millions of Americans. You look across, unemployment being down, wages being up, tax cuts. He's empowering Americans. He is what it means to be American and those comments were insulting and they were absurd."

But the reality is we hear negative things and quite frankly, bullying from the president of the United States just about every single day, usually in the form of Twitter. So, I think when we talk about degrading American values, we're all proud to be Americans, but when you talk about the president degrading American values, it's not an American value to criticize John McCain for his historic military service. It's not an American value to rip apart thousands of families as we are seeing happening right now. It's not an American value to undermine the U.S. justice system.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Well, no doubt, it absolutely does come out hypocritical. Because what was degrading to Americans was Bill Clinton's actions in the Oval Office. What was degrading to Americans was Benghazi. What's degrading to Americans was BleachBit-ing subpoena emails or the quid pro quo corruption at the Clinton Foundation. That was degrading to Americans. It is not degrading to enforce borders, raise economic prospects for millions of Americans and dominate on the foreign policy realm, which is exactly what President Trump is doing. So, Chelsea should take an inward look if she wants to talk about degrading."

I mean, you know, that's how you get people chattering and to take a shot at the president is very smart because it kind of gets her name in the headlines. You know, I wonder beyond promoting a book, do you feel like she's a good spokesperson to go out there, there's always talks about her having a political life going forward. I mean, did she strikes out as a good spokesperson?"

I mean, this president has a terrible record when it comes to the way he treats women and I think that that's not something that should be overlooked. And we shouldn't become numb to the things that this president says and just write it off as Trump being Trump."

You know, the ones that are true or what people have said. You know, who knows about the ones that are not true. But it's the idea that someone is criticizing him from a pedestal when they themselves and their family have this thing in their background, you know. I mean, it's just this like, this is kind of, you know, again, as a woman, it makes me feel like it just makes me cringe and it feels hypocritical."

      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Sure. It's the height of hypocrisy. And if you look at President Trump, President Trump has empowered women. Sarah Sanders, Kellyanne Conway. Look at Gina Haspel, the first female CIA director. And going back to his real estate company where he had the first person in commercial real estate to put women at the highest levels to become executives. That is President Trump's record with women. And Chelsea Clinton, if you're going to go out make this argument, Bill Clinton is going to come up in the verifiable facts of what happened in the Oval Office with Monica Lewinsky a very dark period in our history."

I mean, I think for a lot of people out there that's the difference, somebody who at the time being paid to be our president was there with an intern, whatever. That's a discussion for another time. We'll let that one go. Thank you, guys. All right. Coming up, an Iraq war veteran's battle against the opioid epidemic. Find out his incredible story and what he's doing to help his fellow vets fight, next."

      "utterance": "The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has become all too common, hitting some of our nation's finest especially hard. The number of veterans addicted to opioids has risen more than 50 percent between 2010 and 2015. It's a problem that my next guest knows all too well. Kevin Rumley was serving with the marines in Iraq when he was hit by an IED and severely injured. The road to healing was long, requiring 32 surgeries. Kevin soon found himself struggling with opioid addiction, but it is a battle that Kevin is now winning. He is in long-term recovery and has made it his life's work to help his fellow veterans combat opioid abuse. Here now is Kevin Rumley, marine combat veteran, Purple Heart recipient and coordinator of Veterans Treatment Court. Thank you so much for your service. It has been far and wide. Talk to me a little bit about -- you were in there for two years, you had 32 surgeries. You made it through all of that, but then you're stuck with an addiction. How did you overcome that?"

      "utterance": "Well, thank you for having me and happy Memorial Day to you. I, like many veterans, was discharged from the hospital and I had a lost sense of purpose. I didn't really know what my next steps were, but I did have opioids and I found opioids really helped me address the physical wounds, but also the psychological wounds of war. But I was fortunate enough to have a support system and family members that really encouraged me to get the support that I needed and go to the Asheville V.A. and from there I was put on Suboxone which is a medication- assisted treatment. I really credit Suboxone with saving my life."

      "speaker": "RUMLEY",

So, it's the Veterans Treatment Court and in lieu of sending our veterans to prison, they complete in our court and it's 18 months plus where we focus on treatment and rehabilitation and really getting to the source of the suffering that led to the negative outcomes for our veterans. And the exciting part too is not only are they held accountable for their actions and they receive the proper treatment, but we are finding this kind of renewed sense of hope and purpose at the end of their journey so they have a stable job, stable house and a year after graduation from the Veterans Treatment Court they are eligible to have their charges dismissed."

      "speaker": "FRANCIS",

You know, you say that you spent about half of your time doing therapy with people who have been through what you've been through and have face that struggle and want to talk you about how you've made it through to the other side. If you spend the other half of your time trying to make sure that this program continues for those down the road. I mean, how widespread, how many people do you think that this could help?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUMLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, we know that problem-solving courts are incredibly effective. Just sending an individual to prison, there's a 50 percent chance that they are going to return. They are going to recidivate. But when we look at the results of specialty courts like the Veterans Treatment Court in drug court, nationally we only have a 3 percent recidivism rate."

      "speaker": "RUMLEY",
      "utterance": "That's right. I really just encourage everyone on this special Memorial Day to just go up to a veteran and simply ask how they are doing. You know, all the training and interventions that I've gotten through the years of education, it's fascinating because the most effective way that we can support a veteran is simply to be there as empathic and caring, loving, compassionate friend."
