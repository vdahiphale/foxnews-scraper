You probably won't be surprised but we have confirmation tonight. First though, when the Senate decided to delay Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote for a week in order to enable an FBI investigation, everyone who was not Jeff Flake understood the point of it. The investigation itself was irrelevant. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For Democrats, the only purpose was to buy time so that new people, some of them anonymously, could make allegations against Kavanaugh. That's exactly what happened, of course, and we've been the first to scoff at some of these claims because some have been frivolous, unfounded, some have been absurd. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But tonight, we must tell you a new and troubling story has emerged that could alter the trajectory not simply of the Kavanaugh nomination but of the history of this country. It is a story of a young man, outwardly respectable but so morally distorted within, so addled by chronic dependency on draught beer, the witnesses say he committed a particularly heinous form of assault in a public place. This man, this monster in human form, once tossed an ice cube at someone in a bar. Yes, an ice cube, the perfect weapon, in solid form, deadly. And then, within hours, it melts and evaporates into the air, all physical evidence turns to vapor. There are no fingerprints. It's diabolical. The perfect crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And frankly, from a constitutional standpoint it is disqualifying. Now, we'll concede that we missed the significance of this story at first. But the other networks were on it long before we were. Watch their coverage.",

Article III of the Constitution in words well known to every first-year law student are unequivocal on this subject. \"Whoever shall throw ice in a tavern is disqualified from service in the federal judiciary.\" Game over. And yet, ladies and gentlemen, there is more tonight. A former Yale student called Tad Low who apparently overlapped with Brett Kavanaugh in school has contacted the FBI with a brand new outrage. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Low says that at one time at a frat party, some fraternity brothers hired a prostitute to put on some kind of show that Low found offensive.

Need we say more? Totally and utterly disqualifying. Still confused? Watch CNN. They'll explain. There've been a lot of stories like this lately. You may have noticed. Julie Swetnick, for example, claims that 37 years ago, for some reason, she went to 10 gang-rape parties in a row in suburban Maryland, and that Brett Kavanaugh may have been at some of them.

Now, that's a very serious charge except as sweatness - Swetnick just explained in a televised interview, she didn't really mean it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Dr. Ford was sincere and she was empathetic. But that did not translate into being credible. Credibility is established by evidence, cross- examination, testimony, and the messy process of cross-examination.

Also, a new investigation reveals who exactly is funding many of the protesters you've seen scream at Republicans in public. You probably won't be surprised but we have confirmation tonight. First though, when the Senate decided to delay Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote for a week in order to enable an FBI investigation, everyone who was not Jeff Flake understood the point of it. The investigation itself was irrelevant. For Democrats, the only purpose was to buy time so that new people, some of them anonymously, could make allegations against Kavanaugh. That's exactly what happened, of course, and we've been the first to scoff at some of these claims because some have been frivolous, unfounded, some have been absurd. But tonight, we must tell you a new and troubling story has emerged that could alter the trajectory not simply of the Kavanaugh nomination but of the history of this country. It is a story of a young man, outwardly respectable but so morally distorted within, so addled by chronic dependency on draught beer, the witnesses say he committed a particularly heinous form of assault in a public place. This man, this monster in human form, once tossed an ice cube at someone in a bar. Yes, an ice cube, the perfect weapon, in solid form, deadly. And then, within hours, it melts and evaporates into the air, all physical evidence turns to vapor. There are no fingerprints. It's diabolical. The perfect crime. And frankly, from a constitutional standpoint it is disqualifying. Now, we'll concede that we missed the significance of this story at first. But the other networks were on it long before we were. Watch their coverage."

Article III of the Constitution in words well known to every first-year law student are unequivocal on this subject. \"Whoever shall throw ice in a tavern is disqualified from service in the federal judiciary.\" Game over. And yet, ladies and gentlemen, there is more tonight. A former Yale student called Tad Low who apparently overlapped with Brett Kavanaugh in school has contacted the FBI with a brand new outrage. Low says that at one time at a frat party, some fraternity brothers hired a prostitute to put on some kind of show that Low found offensive. Now, what does this have to do with Brett Kavanaugh, you might wonder? Well as Low concedes, nothing directly. \"I can't say for certain that Judge Kavanaugh was present in the frat house.\" And yet, and this is the critical part of this story, Brett Kavanaugh may have been in the State of Connecticut when this happened, the very same state at the very same time that people in a fraternity house were doing things that Ted Low didn't like. Need we say more? Totally and utterly disqualifying. Still confused? Watch CNN. They'll explain. There've been a lot of stories like this lately. You may have noticed. Julie Swetnick, for example, claims that 37 years ago, for some reason, she went to 10 gang-rape parties in a row in suburban Maryland, and that Brett Kavanaugh may have been at some of them. What did Brett Kavanaugh do at these parties? Well Swetnick signed a sworn statement suggesting that Kavanaugh and friends added drugs and alcohol to the punch that facilitated the rapes that took place at these parties. Now, that's a very serious charge except as sweatness - Swetnick just explained in a televised interview, she didn't really mean it."

There is now though quite a bit of evidence that Julie Swetnick just did. Democrats don't care. They're not interested in finding out because \"Hey, whatever works. Power is the point.\" And yet, they should care. Sexual assault is a horrifying crime no matter who commits it. All decent people understand that. False claims trivialize the offense. And there have been a number of widely publicized false claims over the past 15 years, and they undermine the many assault victims who are telling the truth. They make the search for justice seem political which it never should be. And worst of all, they are making the rest of us nearly as cynical as professional Democrats already are. That's a high cost. Mollie Hemingway is the Senior Editor at The Federalist, and she joins us tonight. So, IceCubegate. Is this one of those moments that looking back on it 15 years from now, we're going to cringe in embarrassment that adults with college degrees could have taken something like this seriously?"

And yet, Republicans are playing by a set of rules devised in the 18th Century and they're very literal. Well there's a story, we must take it seriously.

I mean a lot of these allegations never should have been promulgated by the media to begin with. People are saying, \"Oh, well we put this person on air so we can all see that she is ridiculous.\" Well that's true. You can see that some of these allegations are ridiculous when - when you show light on them. But there should be a basic standard. I mean this is a human being who is being torn apart through this process. And then, also, even if they're acknowledging that some of the stories are ridiculous, at the same time they're putting forth stories of - that are ridiculous on their own.

Case in point, Senate challenger Beto O'Rourke who's running against Ted Cruz in Texas is now apologizing, groveling in a craven way for what misdeed? Well it turns out, he wrote a musical review at the age of 19 for the Columbia student newspaper. He was known as Robert then. He was fresh out of boarding school. In that piece, he says this that the Will Rogers Follies had actresses who were chosen \"For their phenomenally large breasts and tight buttocks.\" So, he's obviously evil. Would ignore this whole thing as dumb and irrelevant but that would be a mistake. We says - it says somewhere in the Constitution we just learned, by the way, I think, on MSNBC, that dumb college essays categorically disqualify you from serving in the U.S. Senate. At the very minimum, we ought to have an FBI investigation to see if O'Rourke, I don't know, ever admitted to not liking Toni Morrison novels, maybe two FBI investigations because we need to know. Well the ACLU has been around a long time. And it built its reputation defending free speech and especially due process, especially for the politically unpopular. It saved lives at the beginning of its existence. That was the whole point of the ACLU. Those traditional principles are being washed away though in the tide of derangement that has now seized the Left and the ACLU has decided to join that tide. They are now running an ad declaring Kavanaugh guilty without the need for a trial or in fact any evidence. Watch."

If you're progressive, it's proof of your zealousness for right and righteous indignation. But it - it's illustrative, Tucker, that the values of the campus are no longer esoteric or irrelevant. They've been transmogrified right into the Congress--"

      "utterance": "--right into the - the heart of American governance. We saw at Yale or Berkeley, students rushed professor Christakis at Yale but now we're seeing the same thing with Jeff Flake. Lindsey Graham said he felt it was dangerous to walk to the Senate. And we're starting to see Cory Booker - Booker, I couldn't believe it, he said \"I believe your truth,\" to Dr. Ford. And I thought, wait a minute, there is one truth that we find through cross-examination, witnesses testimonies. They're not just equal narratives but that's exactly what the university preaches in post-modern English department that there's a variety of truths and you can pick which one you want and they become valid depending on access to power, race, class, or gender. We still have and we have the same idea of prolonged adolescence where we have these 18, 19, and 20 year olds that we invent things like micro- aggressions, trigger warnings, safe space so they won't be hurt. These are people whose great-grandfathers were dying in places like Guadalcanal and Okinawa at 18. And yet, now in the Congress, we're not supposed to be too aggressive in cross examination or we don't want to pursue certain lines of examination because we - we've confused the entire idea of being sincere with being credible. Dr. Ford was sincere and she was empathetic. But that did not translate into being credible. Credibility is established by evidence, cross- examination, testimony, and the messy process of cross-examination. And it's not - it's not established by accusing, considering the accused guilty or relying on hearsay or not knowing any of the key details that might adjudicate who is telling the truth or not. So, the campus is in the Congress and that's a scary idea."

Destroy him and his kids and his reputation. And then, after calling him a rich, drunk, lying, sexual predator, they criticized him for defending himself. Now, having said that, I'm a - I'm a lot more sanguine than some folks around here. I know the Democrats think they're winning. But, you know, sometimes falling feels like you're flying for a little while. I predict that Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed. They think he's a smoked turkey. You watch. I think he'll be confirmed.

For example, Citigroup and Bank of America don't believe in the Second Amendment. And they've decided they won't do business with any - with any businesses that - that sell automatic weapons, semi-automatic weapons or handguns. Now, my cup - their copy of the Bill of Rights goes from one to three. My copy includes the Second Amendment. And when they almost went broke in 2008 and the American taxpayer had to give Citigroup $475 billion and Bank of America $336 billion, I don't recall Citigroup or Bank of America saying \"Well now wait, which of you believe in the Second Amendment?

To our surprise, the company announced that all its employees, whether full-time or part-time or seasonal, will now receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, that's double the federal minimum wage. In a statement, Bezos said, \"We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and then decided we wanted to lead.\" Well Amazon still constitutes one of the most dangerous concentrations of power in the world. We're still concerned about that. But they did the right thing here for whatever reason. At the very least, they still care about public relations, so that's a way. What do you do about the craziness enveloping your world where you can vote but you could also understand why it's happening, Ship of Fools, my book out today explains the whole story. Pick it up.
