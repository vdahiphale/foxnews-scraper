      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson, host",
      "utterance": "You're looking at live pictures of Capitol Hill. Steps from where we're sitting right now, the House is currently setting up the rules for the impeachment vote. They're apparently going to hold tomorrow. The House is temporarily in recess and is going to be reconvening in about a half an hour we're monitoring the situation there. Good evening welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" It is here after months of false starts and threats and endless posturing by some of the saddest, most ineffectual people in America, impeachment apparently is imminent. Barring some last-minute plot twist. And that could happen but otherwise, less than 24 hours from now, Donald Trump will join Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton as the third American president ever impeached by the House of Representatives. We're thinking at this point the final vote tomorrow afternoon. So Democrats been promising to do this since before the president was even elected president and yet still it feels kind of weird, surprising, surreal even that it's finally going to happen. Why? Because impeachment and there's really no disagreement about this is a terrible idea for the country at this point. At this point there's no question that Democrats can actually remove the president and in trying, they will only hurt themselves. The polls are clear and yet and here's the fascinating point they're doing it anyway. Watch Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin explain why they're doing it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Rep. Jamie Raskin",
      "utterance": "The president's continuing course of conduct constitutes a clear and present danger to democracy in America. We cannot allow this misconduct to pass. It would be a sellout of our constitution, our foreign policy, our national security and our democracy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "See if you can follow the logic chain maybe you can spot the missing link. Here's what he's arguing. Leaving a president in office until voters can decide to remove him from office if they want is, quote, a danger to democracy. It's a, quote, sellout of our constitution. OK. So, in case you've forgotten, what is the crime that undergirds this impeachment proceeding? What is the president accused of doing? Well in case you've forgotten, it's that Donald Trump may have delayed military aid to the government of Ukraine. Now, keep in mind, that the only purpose of aid to the government of Ukraine is to antagonize Russia. Keep in mind also that Russia is a country with more nuclear weapons than any other country on the globe but according to Jamie Raskin, not giving weapons to Ukraine is a clear and present danger to America. It's a sellout he says of our national security to pause in our relentless attacks on Russia, even for a moment. That's a remarkable assertion. Hard to believe he could defend that in a rational conversation, but it doesn't even stand out under the current standards of political rhetoric. There's a lot of talk like that all of a sudden. The entire impeachment saga, in fact, has become detached from reality. Here's the most basic facts about it. Democrats do not have the votes to remove President Trump from office. They never will have the votes to remove the president. The point of impeachment is to remove a president. They cannot do that. This process is doomed before it even begins and by the way, they don't have the votes because voters don't support it. The irony is that our democracy is working just fine. Voters supported, in fact, less than they did after a full month of watching public hearings on impeachment. Democrats have not gain support they have lost it. In late October, when this began, about half the country backed impeachment. Forty four percent said they were opposed to impeachment in the most recent polling. Those numbers have inverted. In other words, the more people learned about impeachment, the less they wanted impeachment. That's not one person's opinion that is the sum total of the polling. The numbers could not be clearer on this question and yet, even in the face of all those data, elite Democrats still will not admit it. They're literally in denial. Watch Democratic Party cheerleader Jeffrey Toobin attack his own company's polling when it doesn't match what he believes must be true."

      "speaker": "Jeffrey Toobin",
      "utterance": "The 90 to 77 percent. I you know, it's just I don't believe it well like it makes no sense that that number would change like that. I mean, you know, life mean in life has shown us that polls are sometimes wrong and, David, that poll is wrong just because I said so ok."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "Why don't you believe? Because I don't because I look out my window and I see the horizon that means it's flat. You can tell me the earth is round, but I just don't believe it. Enough with your dumb numbers in your scientific theories. I just don't believe it, says the legal analyst. Okay. What you're watching, obviously, is one man degrade himself. But it's bigger than that it's the definition of ideological extremism and that's the inability to change course. No matter what the evidence tells you. So, that's the point at which this is no longer politics, of course we left that a long time ago. What you're looking at is religion and of course, being the Democratic Party and their religion it's always the exact opposite of what they claim it is. So, as President Trump noted in a recent letter to Nancy Pelosi and we're quoting, “you are the ones interfering in America's elections. You are the ones subverting American democracy. You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish, personal, political and partisan gain.” The public, whether they like Trump or not, agrees with that. The polling shows it, but the Democrats can't acknowledge that they're stuck. So, in 2016, they went all in on denouncing Trump remember this before the election? And every one of his supporters, you as beyond the pale, racist, worthy of being hated, not reasoned with or talked to, but hated and dismissed and physically assaulted in some cases but they lost anyway. When they did lose, they refused to learn. They refused to even think for a moment about why they may have lost and instead move seamlessly from racism into a conspiracy about Russia so bizarre they could never even fully explain its outlines. What are you saying you would ask? Russia they would say, OK. That collapsed you watched it happen on live television. But what hasn't changed is the rage storm they created with years of propaganda. They whipped their voters into such a frenzy that the voters can't be pulled back now they want blood. And so, Democrats have no choice but to march forward, despite the fact that it will inevitably destroy them, and they know it will. It's poignant almost. Congresswoman Debbie Lesko represents the state of Arizona. She's been a sharp critic of all this impeachment since it began, and she joins us now. Congressman, thanks so much."

I believe it's rigged they have no proof, no evidence even from their own witnesses of bribery, treason or high crimes and misdemeanors, which is required in the Constitution. I serve on the Judiciary Committee and the Rules Committee. So, boy, this is a total nightmare and hopefully I don't continue it in my dreams. I'm so used to talking about it."

No Republican voted for it in Judiciary Committee tonight. I don't think one Republican will vote for it in the Rules Committee of which I serve, and this has been a very partisan process. Not one single Republican is going to vote for it, but there will be some Democrats that vote with Republicans against it. It's just a matter of how many. I don't think we know for sure yet but boy, this is a shame. And I tell you, can I just explain to you how it is unbelievable blows my mind that in Rules Committee tonight, we're on a recess because my Democratic colleagues haven't figured out how much time they want to give on debate, what the rules are yet, as if they didn't know this was coming for weeks, months, years. But we're in recess until they figure it out and we've heard that they might only give four hours of debate on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Zero responsibility we're monitoring their responses, mostly because they amuse us, we will have all the highlights tomorrow night. But first, tonight, Ken Starr was, of course, special counsel during the Whitewater investigation. That was in the Clinton administration. He knows more about this process than maybe any living person and he joins us tonight. Mr. Starr, thanks so much for coming on. So, you've been watching this as closely as anyone.

Yogi Berra would say, “deja vu.” But really, the same things are being said in each of these committees. But here, I think, is a critical fact. I've not heard a single member of the House of Representatives say, “I need more evidence. I need to bring in -- we need to bring in more witnesses.” So, there's now a disharmony between the House of Representatives, some of whom were declaring today, “I'm voting for --“ or with respect to Mr. Golden of Maine, “I'm not going to vote in favor of the second article.” They're making up their minds based upon the record. So, consider, then, Chuck Schumer, Senator Schumer saying, “We need more, or we should have four more witnesses at a minimum.” So, there's a real disconnect between the two sides of Capitol Hill."

So, actually the opposite is true, as is so often the case. The left has nothing but contempt for the men who founded this country, and that's why they're forever denouncing them as racist. So, why are Democrats suddenly telling you the opposite of that? Well, because that's what the left does. They don't simply lie, they invert the truth. Whatever they claim you did is exactly what they, themselves, are doing. We can think of a few examples, but here's one.

I mean, call him old-fashioned but Joe just doesn't believe in that. It's now how he was raised. Breaking up that sacred unit, two parents, husband and wife, raising their kids together. Anyone who would do that and Joe, again, doesn't want to be judgmental here but sometimes it's hard not to be. That's how passionate he feels about it. Anyone who would break up and separate a family, says Joe Scarborough, is beneath contempt, the lowest of the low, disgusting as Joe's third wife put it so aptly. Family separation is simply calculated and cruel. It's just not something decent people do. Just so you know. Victor Davis Hanson is a classics professor. He's a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Author of the book, \"The Case for Trump\" among many other volumes worth reading. He joins us tonight. Professor, as you see the Democratic Party reach backward to the founders to justify what they're doing right now, what as someone who knows a lot about the founding period in this country's history, what's your response to that?"

So, we've heard nothing from the people that you just aired, nothing from them but the -- as you said, the framers were dead old white men. They were racist, sexist, they were intolerant. They were -- some of them were slave owners and that their documents, the founder -- founding documents and the framing of the Constitution was flawed at the outset and that's why they want to change the 2nd Amendment or amend it until it's unrecognizable. They want to put hate speech codes into the 1st Amendment to water it down. As you said, they want to get rid of the electoral college. They're mad that there's two senators and a 40 million California and only two in Wyoming. Two in Wyoming and two in California. That's not fair. So, we shouldn't take these reverent references to the founders seriously. If you read the federalist papers, 65 and 66 are what Madison said. What we're seeing now is exactly what they were afraid of. The majority party that was in opposition of the House turning impeachment into something like a parliamentary vote of no -- they didn't want that."

Let's have the Supreme Court justice be the arbiter and it would be rare and we've never removed a president because of what the founders foresaw and in the past, the immediate past, we always had bipartisan support. We had public -- some public support. We had a special council. We had a fair adjudication of witnesses. This is like not like the Nixon inquiry or the Clinton. This is like Andrew Johnson impeachment where it was a stain on the record of the United States. It was exactly the opposite as this is of what the framers intended. I had a couple other things just in finishing, Tucker. What would -- what's going to happen in January when four senators who are candidates for the presidency are going to put themselves and be the adjudicators of whether Donald Trump, their likely opponent for president, they're going to be judging and running against him at the same time and the Constitution also said that when a president leaves office he's not exempt from the crimes that he was found guilty of if convicted in the Senate. So, there's really something wrong with Donald Trump. When he gets back to Mar-A-Lago is a local district attorney going to say ah, you're not exempt. We're going to put you on trial for obstructing Congress or you abused your power that's a crime. It's not going to happen. And so, this whole thing is a joke and it's a cruel joke. It's a tragic joke because it's dividing the country and it's -- we're more like it's 1859 or 1860 than 2019. And it didn't have to happen."

According to Jim Comey it was not a big deal at all compared to a lot of other malfeasance currently going on at the FBI, none of which he would describe in any detail. But the FISA court appears to disagree. Today in a rebuke even the New York Times called \"extraordinary,\" the FISA court accused the FBI of repeatedly misleading it, the court, in the Carter Page case. The court gave the FBI until January 10th to propose changes to its procedures to prevent future abuses. Francey Hakes is a former federal prosecutor, knows a lot about this process.

I mean honestly, the constituency for that is like zero but he's one of the richest people in the world so he's trying to buy his way into contention for the Democratic nomination. Senator Elizabeth Warren is against that, of course, because she wants it and she says that before Bloomberg becomes the nominee has to answer for a history of sexist remarks. So, we normally dismiss this because sexist remarks what does that mean? But in this case, we have some specific examples that are worth knowing about. While building his business empire Bloomberg is accused of running a workplace where crude and demeaning remarks were commonplace. What do we mean by crude and demeaning? Here's one example. One employee said that after she got pregnant with her baby, Michael Bloomberg repeatedly told her to, quote, kill it meaning the baby kill it he said. Yeah, that actually does qualify as offensive. The full extent of what Bloomberg said and did with and two women is being hidden, though, because so many of his former employees took cash payments in return for signing nondisclosure agreements.

And so, this is actually like the best-known thing and in some ways about him in New York. So, it's now, he denies much of this, some of the more outrageous comments he says he doesn't remember making. But, you know, what's interesting is, is that, of course, he's running as a Democrat and he's appealing, trying to appeal to the Democratic base. Other Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, as you've noted, now are complaining, saying he's he must answer for this. But let let's be honest here Elizabeth Warren had to a fire staffer because of some alleged misconduct just a few months ago from her campaign.

These are this is just perspective when we when we think about who's making complaints like the Democrats and impeachment, it's like this is strange.

When Scott Brown raised the issue that Elizabeth Warren made two hundred thousand dollars representing Travelers Insurance in a case which ended up depriving asbestos workers of hundreds of millions of dollars and that became a big campaign issue. And I analyzed it and I documented quite precisely and quite well, I think how her strategy and the representation she gave directly led to those is asbestos workers not getting their money. But that's not all there is. When she was called out for that by the Brown campaign, she gave the Boston Globe a list of 10 cases she had worked on. It was a completely incomplete list. And this is a history that she has and she'd left off that list and I discovered at the time her representing representation of Dow Chemical to help deprive breast implant litigants of money and she said, well, I was representing Dow Chemical, the parent company of the manufacturer, because I was trying to help the women get money and that was, of course, ludicrous. And that's been demonstrated, and other newspapers recently have proven that. She also represented an aircraft manufacturer against a family who lost a loved one. She said she represented a large energy company, one of the biggest coal producer coal users in the southeast in trying to save a rural electric cooperative. In fact, it's well documented that she was trying her client was trying to liquidate the rural cooperative. So, at every step of the way, she not only had a representation contrary to her political narrative, she tried to hide it she tried to spin it as something else and she never would disclose how much money she made doing it. I estimated it because I found 22 of her cases, which now is up to over 50 cases, and I estimated it had to be millions of dollars and she has now admitted that when the Buttigieg campaign raised the issue, she disclosed that she made almost two million dollars from this and so the question has to be she is somebody who is throwing stones and lives in a glass house."

The store is in Nancy Pelosi's district and John Dennis, the GOP candidate running for her Congressional seat wrote, quoting here, “Clean up on aisle three. Thank you, Nancy Pelosi. I publicly warned in 2018 that if we let people violate our streets, the homeless problem would get worse. The answer? Arrest then offer a choice: jail or rehab.” And a local journalist directed this tweet at the city's mayor, quoting, @LondonBreed, \"Here's a pic of a man on drugs taking a poo in aisle 10 of a Safeway Marina Sunday morning in San Francisco. Why is this okay?” In a recent interview, the mayor admitted public defecation is a major problem. What she failed to mention is the city's political leaders are unwilling to stop it. In fact, the new far left San Francisco DA Chesa Boudin has said he won't prosecute these so-called quality of life crimes. So, public defecation kind of goes along with shooting up heroin publicly and burglarizing cars, shops, and homes, crimes that rarely have consequences. In San Francisco, people call the city's hotline 65 times a day to report piles of human feces. In 2011, there were just over 5,500 reports of human feces on public streets. Last year it was more than 28,000. And those are just the incidents that got reported. Tucker?"

Sixty-five million dollars was spent last year trying to clean up the streets. But the homeless have nowhere to go. And what about shelters? The governor of California has been asked repeatedly, “What about building temporary shelters?” And they're not being built. So, as a result, you have the sewage, you have the feces, and you end up with all of these health issues. This is a public health emergency. It's a disgrace in San Francisco."

It's not just the homeless population, right? People trek through those neighborhoods. They get the poop on their shoes, and then they bring it to other neighborhoods. And then the diseases spread to other neighborhoods. So, to actually solve this problem, again, we have to offer bathroom facilities in temporary shelters, get cots, get food. This is what we did in New York City at Belleview Hospital, by the way. This is what has to happen in California. This is what HUD Secretary Ben Carson wants. This is what I want.
