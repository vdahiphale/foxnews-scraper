They had a long time out here trying to figure out what to do, because this is pretty extraordinary to have that sort of a charge made against the speaker of the House. Just within the past couple of minutes, the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, has come to the floor. And he has in fact ruled her words to be out of order. He cited a precedent from 1984, May 15, 1984, when Newt Gingrich, then a backbencher, challenged them Speaker Tip O'Neill, saying his words were out of order, and Tip O'Neill was penalized. And so what's going on right now on the House floor is, the House is voting to strike her words from the record. Usually, when someone's words are stricken from the record, Neil, they are prevented from speaking on the House floor for the rest of the day. So the fact that we have had this on the House floor involving the speaker of the House, this has been so supercharged, this resolution condemning the president for racism, according to the text of the resolution. This is a big deal. And it should be no surprise that they got into this major kerfuffle on the House floor today.",

Doug Collins, Republican from Georgia, he made the charge, saying, OK, we should take down her words. Taking down words is the equivalent of pulling someone over for speeding. Then they have to go back and say, were your words within the realm of parliamentary conduct or not? Steny Hoyer said they were not. And so Doug Collins then asked for a vote to strike her words from the record. And so it's up to the Democrats now. And right now, Pelosi's words will be allowed to stay if they vote with her.

So there's serious, serious crippling of what's taking place in North Korea. The president is going to keep those sanctions on. That's what brought them to the negotiating table back in Singapore initially. And I think these negotiations will take place here. However, Neil, there has been a major change in the administration. They wanted North Korea to give up all of their weapons, nuclear and ballistic missiles, and then we would provide some sanction relief. I think where we are now, the administration knows that there has to be a step-by-step process here. It's unrealistic for the North Koreans to put all of that on the table at once.

As he was in the Cabinet Room today meeting with his Cabinet, the president seem to be focused on policy. He allowed the cameras to stay there for more than an hour while Ben Carson and Alex Azar and Jared Kushner all spoke about big policy agenda items. And then the president almost reluctantly weighing in on the four congresswomen, called the so-called Squad, and the fallout from his tweet on Sunday.

The president came to Nancy Pelosi his defense, and then for some reason thought that he would throw a hand grenade in the whole works on Sunday and turn the attention back on him.

The person has to stand there for 30 or 40 minutes while he talks on a wide range of issues, and basically stomps all over the political message that he's going to head out to those critical states to try to convey. So he basically gotten his own way. And you can even look at the midterms, where he had very similar economic news to where we are right now, and decided to make the last 45 days about immigration.

President Trump's very pro-Hispanic. And the Hispanics that are here legally in this country, many of them support Trump. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a much higher percentage than he even did the first time he ran. And I think the Hispanic community is really going to support President Trump this time.

Now, China slamming the president for linking their slowdown to the trade war. We have got Charlie Gasparino with us and market watcher Gary Kaltbaum. Gary, one of the things that the president was essential saying -- I know it's been echoed a number of times -- they need a deal more than we need to deal. This weak economic news out of China seems to confirm that they need something."

I feel like this is almost Brexit at this point in time, that we keep hearing we're weeks away, then it's months away, then now that -- he's talking tariffs again. And, again, the good news is the market I don't think is listening anymore, because we were supposed to get European car tariffs. That was pulled. We were supposed to get Mexican tariffs. That was pulled. So I think we're OK. And I think the market is more or less looking at the easy money right now. And you can see what the markets doing, which is very, very strong. And now even the industrials and economically sensitive areas are starting to kick into gear."

      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, listen, the markets trade off of -- I mean, listen, at bottom, the markets trade on corporate earnings, right? If corporate earnings are strong, stocks will go up. The bet right now in the market is that corporate earnings are strong, largely because of the tax cuts and deregulation, and lower interest rates, or at least stable -- stabilizing rates at this very low level. He's not going to -- Jerome Powell is not going to raise rates, and that is net positive for corporate earnings. What we don't know is what has already been done with trade or whether tariffs on China will in the future slow down the economy for the 2020 election. And here's the thing, I think, that -- just to throw this out there. Chairman Xi, whatever his title is, the Chinese -- Donald Trump's Chinese counterpart doesn't have to run for reelection. He's a dictator for life, or as long as they know -- until they kill him or whatever, right, or poison his tea. Donald Trump has to run in 2020. If we do have an economic slowdown because of trade, that will be an issue. And add trade is the one fly in the ointment of this economy. And there's just no doubt about that. That doesn't mean it's going to happen. It's just I can't tell you and a lot of economists can't tell you whether the stimulus from the tax cuts and deregulation and low interest rates will overwhelm the trade stuff. The market right now is betting it will. But who knows?"

How do you advise clients in the middle of a run-up like this, and what some are calling a melt-up like this, maybe courtesy of the Federal Reserve and lower interest rates?"

Neil, you can time the bottom in the market at the end of December, early January to the day they sent out somebody from the Fed to float the fact that they were going from raising rates to patience. And you can time to the day the last bottom we had about a month ago going from patience to lowering rates. So leave no doubt that's what the markets been looking at. And, really, I believe the markets been hanging on for 10 years with easy money. And it's not just here. Neil, there's $13 trillion of negative yielding debt around the globe. Around the globe, they're easing like crazy. China just put a trillion dollars into the system. Europe, with negative rates, just announced they're going to go even lower negative rates. And I think markets just love it, until they don't. Right now, I'm a big believer in price and markets acting fine."

New York utility Con Ed warning that more blackouts could be coming, as temperatures start soaring, by Saturday in the Big Apple, maybe as high as 100 degrees, for a city that might not be able to handle the big energy bite that comes with it. Former White House and Pentagon official Douglas MacKinnon says last week's mini-blackout might have just been a sign of things to come. Very good to have you, Doug. I was surprised of this, because, memory serves me right, the more recent blackout occurred in normal temperatures, in the 80s or whatever. They seem to be signaling -- that is Con Ed -- that you're really putting a strain on these systems when you get up to 95, 100 degrees. So they almost seem to be saying, prepare yourself.

He really is an infrastructure guy. And oh, by the way, he's a New York City guy. And I think if he's smart -- and he is -- he can use this, the last blackout last weekend, as an example of what's wrong with the national infrastructure. I mean, our grid, our national grid, Neil, is really a joke. It's decrepit. It's old. Parts of it are over 50 years old. And I think, again, what happened in New York is an example. And so, for President Trump, hold New York City accountable, hold Con Ed accountable, hold Mayor de Blasio accountable, and say, lookit, we have to fix this, but, more importantly, this is an example of what's going to happen across the country if we don't get ahead of this."

And that is something that sticks in their craw, that that emboldens ICE and all these other agencies that will be dealing with these migrants there. And that's something they couldn't tolerate. Nancy Pelosi said that wasn't her cup of tea, the package itself, but it did get immediate help to these kids. Was that your position?"

If you look at, behind the scenes, what happened, when the House Appropriation members -- and I'm a part of that committee -- when we were talking to the Senate, when we were working on the Harvey disaster bill, we actually were working with them. For example, I was able to get that $30 million reimbursement for the nonprofits and the churches that are doing so much at the border. They're putting money out of their pocket. So we were working with them. We got a lot of the language there. So when the bill came out, I looked at it, and that bill had a lot of things that we had looked at. When they say that there's no protocols or no rules and we gave the president a blank check, that is not correct, because there are protocols that Homeland has. There are protocols that ICE has. There's protocols that the Health and Human Services have. There's language that my -- that I have added there to make sure that we have transparency and protection for the migrant -- the migrant kids. And, in fact, in the -- own appropriation bill, the Senate bill that came over, there's even additional language there for protection. So there was no blank checks -- blank check written to anybody. And that's why I supported that particular bill."

      "utterance": "This is a rather extraordinary scene on the House floor, where the words of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were challenged by Republicans to be out of order, saying that they -- she broke the rules of decorum in referring to the president of the United States. They had a long time out here trying to figure out what to do, because this is pretty extraordinary to have that sort of a charge made against the speaker of the House. Just within the past couple of minutes, the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, has come to the floor. And he has in fact ruled her words to be out of order. He cited a precedent from 1984, May 15, 1984, when Newt Gingrich, then a backbencher, challenged them Speaker Tip O'Neill, saying his words were out of order, and Tip O'Neill was penalized. And so what's going on right now on the House floor is, the House is voting to strike her words from the record. Usually, when someone's words are stricken from the record, Neil, they are prevented from speaking on the House floor for the rest of the day. So the fact that we have had this on the House floor involving the speaker of the House, this has been so supercharged, this resolution condemning the president for racism, according to the text of the resolution. This is a big deal. And it should be no surprise that they got into this major kerfuffle on the House floor today."

So, in other words, if they don't vote for that, then her words are allowed to stand. And that's the issue. Doug Collins, Republican from Georgia, he made the charge, saying, OK, we should take down her words. Taking down words is the equivalent of pulling someone over for speeding. Then they have to go back and say, were your words within the realm of parliamentary conduct or not? Steny Hoyer said they were not. And so Doug Collins then asked for a vote to strike her words from the record. And so it's up to the Democrats now. And right now, Pelosi's words will be allowed to stay if they vote with her. And that's what's going down on the floor right now, Neil."

I mean, we have canceled six-plus major exercises since President Trump said he wanted to take major exercises off the table. And there are smaller ones taking place to maintain some proficiency between the United States' troops and the South Korean troops. And that's what this exercise largely is."

      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "They have not specifically objected to the other smaller exercises that we have been conducting. So I think this is probably a little bit of a surprise here. I do think that negotiations will go forward, that the South Koreans have just come out with an economic report on North Korea, and how devastating the sanctions are impacting the country, going back and comparing it to the worst days of famine that the country has had. So there's serious, serious crippling of what's taking place in North Korea. The president is going to keep those sanctions on. That's what brought them to the negotiating table back in Singapore initially. And I think these negotiations will take place here. However, Neil, there has been a major change in the administration. They wanted North Korea to give up all of their weapons, nuclear and ballistic missiles, and then we would provide some sanction relief. I think where we are now, the administration knows that there has to be a step-by-step process here. It's unrealistic for the North Koreans to put all of that on the table at once. And, obviously, they haven't even come close to doing any of it. So I think the negotiations will get started at the working level, and hopefully some progress."

Basil, very good to have you. We forget that. I like how you put that in perspective, that that was a common element. BASIL HERO, AUTHOR, \"THE MISSION OF A LIFETIME\": It was, Neil. And thank you for having me. It's fascinating, when you look at the Apollo 11 taking off, to think that there were 5.6 million parts on the -- what they called the stack, OK, which included the command module, the service module, and, of course, the lunar module, which landed, and then everything, of course, and the Saturn V rocket."

And I think that's something that gets lost today, as does, frankly, the management miracle that took place in that seven-and-a-half-year period to get these guys on the moon. As Jeff Bezos told me -- and he has his Blue Origin aerospace company."
