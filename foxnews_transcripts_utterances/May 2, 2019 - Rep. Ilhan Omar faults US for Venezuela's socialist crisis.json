And now they're talking about late-term abortion. They're talking about, you know, babies being born alive and framing it in the context of women's rights somehow, not human rights, and the dignity of those children. So this abortion debate and the language that he used, whether he objects to the bill or not was not the issue, it was the language that he felt it was OK to present to the world. That's what's happening among Democrats right now. And they need to be really careful of that because the bulk of the country does not support extreme measures on abortion, and they don't support language like this.

And that's why when someone speaks about this, whether it's him or someone like Ralph Northam, in graphic, blunt, real detail, it's so shocking because no one ever really discusses it like this. I think we need to sometimes be brutally honest about the calculations that people make when they consider having a procedure like this. I think transparency in the abortion debate is probably a good thing as opposed to a bad thing. And he's probably right. I think some women, 19 years old, they have no support system. They're not rich. They don't come from a great background. They get pregnant on a one night stand and they think, you know, what kind of choice I'm going to make, and maybe some of these thoughts run through their minds? But, you know, right now its abortion -- legal in America, and women have the right to choose. But I think when you have this discussion you just want women to be -- and men, to be as knowledgeable as possible about what's going on either in their body or the consequences of what they're doing so they can make as an informed decision possible.",

There would be no more abortions and eventually no more voters. He also argued that parents of children with disabilities should be able to have an abortion \"Some parents can't handle a child with problems. It could be retarded. It might have no arms and no legs\". So the dignity of life question is definitely at issue here. If you wanted to make the point that Alabama should do more to support the entire life of the African-American community, that might have been a useful thing to say, because he going to flip this argument in a way that didn't draw the attention to what it looks like extremely outrageous, insensitive, amoral ideas about what life is. But he's actually saying is that - he's drawing a picture for us of what it is like for the constituents he represents. There's not a hospital. There - all kids end up in jail.

It's based on a belief that kid - a kid born in a tough environment is doomed, which is an outright lie - hardly. What are the greatest stories that we cherish in America? Adults who overcame horrifying backgrounds to achieve greatness, right? That abortion argument denies that. I have a good friend who was given up for adoption and he always thanks the mother he never met for not aborting him. And the thing is, what he said - I actually almost admire the fact that he voiced that tiny little thought in the back of people's - pro-choicers heads, white people's heads, I might add, thinking, you know what, this'll lower the crime rate.

They just floated this legal theory that was totally untested and the Department of Justice had never used before. So he basically ended the coup. Secondly, they're not used to having such a seasoned pro in the department under Donald Trump. They had Sessions, didn't really have the firepower to compete. They had Rosenstein who wasn't really there. He kind of abdicated his role. So you have someone come in, clean up shop, and then really unflappable and deftly explain what happened with the Mueller report. And the Democrats are driving -- have been driven crazy because they can't compete rhetorically with him. And then thirdly, they're panicking because they know that Barr is investigating the investigators. They're looking at -- they are looking at the FISA abuse. They're looking at the human intelligence assets that they ran, the unmasking and the criminal leaks. And they never thought this would boomerang on them and it has. And they're really nervous."

So you're not going to be able to talk about your student loan debt free plan or your climate change plan or whatever else you have up your sleeves because the headlines will all be about impeachment.

And secondly, here's a guy who said, oh, I didn't know anything about Mueller having any objections. Two weeks after, Mueller sent him a letter saying I objected, this is not the full story that you put out and it leads to a lack of public's trust. And then you guys come out and say, oh, yeah, this just the Democrats having a tantrum. Let me just say this to you, I didn't hear this when Congress was having oversight hearings on Benghazi for the 15th time. Oh, no. Then Congress was fulfilling its constitutional role which is to act as an equal partner under the constitution to the executive and to employ its resources, subpoenas, and the like, to get answers for the American people. It's the House of the people. But now, Donald Trump is fighting every subpoena. Obviously, we don't have a date for Robert Mueller to testify. We don't know if Don McGahn can testify. Hmm, is something being hidden? And when Kamala Harris says to this attorney general, oh, Mr. Attorney General, what is going on? Were you informed by Robert Mueller of object -- oh, well, I don't know. What do you mean? How about this, do you have a record of conversations with Robert Mueller? Well, yeah. I was taking notes.

You don't like Barr, fine. Don't like Trump, fine. The report is out. There's still no conspiracy with the Russians. There's still no crime.

When something good happens in the world what they do is they say, oh, why can America be like that country? And then when something bad happens in the world, they say, oh, that's America's fault that that's happening. But they can never see the point that socialism is failing on its own. Remember what the communists did after the Soviet Union collapse? They say, oh, well, communism has never been perfectly implemented. Or they did the same thing with Obamacare. Oh, Obamacare failed because Donald Trump undermined it. At this point, I just want -- I want her to do this. Stop siding with the Russians.

It's ingrained in the hard left of the oppressor versus oppressed ideology. She always believes that places like America are guilty of imperialism, of being the oppressor. And here's a situation where you actually have people that are being depressed, but all she sees is the Yankee imperialism that is ingrained, not from any religion, and also not really from any politics, but from our own academia.

He stood by them. Well, I'm sort of struck here. Rogers is catholic. He is pro-life. And what he's saying is the state, you know, regularly close -- denies Medicare expansion, closes rural hospitals, and he's just worried that, in fact, that's what goes on."

There's a number of people who are going to have a problems with the bill. That's separate from what he actually said, though. What he said is really vulgar. And I think the abortion debate is representative of what's going on in the Democratic Party. There used to be a time that Democrats were talking about abortions as safe, legal, and rare. And now they're talking about late-term abortion. They're talking about, you know, babies being born alive and framing it in the context of women's rights somehow, not human rights, and the dignity of those children. So this abortion debate and the language that he used, whether he objects to the bill or not was not the issue, it was the language that he felt it was OK to present to the world. That's what's happening among Democrats right now. And they need to be really careful of that because the bulk of the country does not support extreme measures on abortion, and they don't support language like this. So if you want to frame your resistance to a bill that you deem as radical in terms of leaning right, that's fine, but be careful how you word it. You're talking about a human life.

And that's why when someone speaks about this, whether it's him or someone like Ralph Northam, in graphic, blunt, real detail, it's so shocking because no one ever really discusses it like this. I think we need to sometimes be brutally honest about the calculations that people make when they consider having a procedure like this. I think transparency in the abortion debate is probably a good thing as opposed to a bad thing. And he's probably right. I think some women, 19 years old, they have no support system. They're not rich. They don't come from a great background. They get pregnant on a one night stand and they think, you know, what kind of choice I'm going to make, and maybe some of these thoughts run through their minds? But, you know, right now its abortion -- legal in America, and women have the right to choose. But I think when you have this discussion you just want women to be -- and men, to be as knowledgeable as possible about what's going on either in their body or the consequences of what they're doing so they can make as an informed decision possible."

I do think that there's a couple of things that he suggested. He said I may bring a bill to force all men to have vasectomies and that would end this whole debate. There would be no more abortions and eventually no more voters. He also argued that parents of children with disabilities should be able to have an abortion \"Some parents can't handle a child with problems. It could be retarded. It might have no arms and no legs\". So the dignity of life question is definitely at issue here. If you wanted to make the point that Alabama should do more to support the entire life of the African-American community, that might have been a useful thing to say, because he going to flip this argument in a way that didn't draw the attention to what it looks like extremely outrageous, insensitive, amoral ideas about what life is. But he's actually saying is that - he's drawing a picture for us of what it is like for the constituents he represents. There's not a hospital. There - all kids end up in jail. They can't get jobs afterwards. I think all of these problems and they've been perpetuated for generations."

It's based on a belief that kid - a kid born in a tough environment is doomed, which is an outright lie - hardly. What are the greatest stories that we cherish in America? Adults who overcame horrifying backgrounds to achieve greatness, right? That abortion argument denies that. I have a good friend who was given up for adoption and he always thanks the mother he never met for not aborting him. And the thing is, what he said - I actually almost admire the fact that he voiced that tiny little thought in the back of people's - pro-choicers heads, white people's heads, I might add, thinking, you know what, this'll lower the crime rate. And by the way there's no real research that shows that. But they believe that, like you know what this is probably why crimes going down, that's how people think.

Now this painting only took him an 1 and 43 minutes to compete. He's been painting for only two years and he's created about 60 celeb portraits. Now with this particular painting, he just hoping to meet J. Lo when she does a concert in his hometown of San Jose, California and give her the painting, so I'm hoping that he gets the opportunity. This kid is amazing. I cannot draw a stick figure. I am in complete awe of his work and kudos to him for doing that amazing thing."
