In part, it's because the whole media bears the brunt of stories that are reported by just one entity or by one journalist. Part of it is frustrations that the American people have at seeing their views lacking in a lot of different contexts when it comes to media. And the president plays that to his advantage, pointing out that the media is populated by a lot of people who have elite opinions and removed from the American people.

Plus, a showdown between the president and The New York Times's publisher over his charge that the paper virtually committed treason. We'll look at the war of words. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" In the uproar after Iran shot down an American drone, President Trump seemingly tried to deescalate the situation saying, \"I think probably Iran made a mistake. I imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake.\" But late Thursday night, The New York Times reported the president had authorized retaliatory airstrikes against Iran and called them off as the military was gearing up for the attacks. The president confirmed it on Twitter saying they were cocked and loaded when he gave the stand down order 10 minutes before launch, and in an interview that aired today on \"Meet the Press.\""

In this context, I found the reaction here to be really over the top. Considering the decision process that the president went through, I think, seems very responsible in saying, \"I don't want to get into a situation where we start killing Iranians over a drone that was downed that was unmanned.\" This is an act of aggression on the part of Iran and there are other ways to deal with that other than going out and killing people."

And while I'm not letting President Trump off the hook, his end result was reasonable. His decision was reasonable. The chaos and confusion that got there is the problem. And I think what you saw in television was, you know, when we move towards military action, you have a significant amount of resources and people moving into place. We are moving aircraft carries. We are moving destroyers. We are moving thousands of people. The media was feeding off of that.

Instead, they're trying to rip apart foreign policy. For example, yesterday on MSNBC, Chris Hayes, the bottom of the screen read \"foreign policy lacking in vision.\" So that's pretty much alluding to your point that it is constantly arguing why the president has a problem with foreign policy, why he's -- he has to balance two sides: one, to not intervene, but two, to be strong and to show that he's not weak and not caving to Iran.

That change hasn't happened. It hasn't happened for a lot of reasons. So you see the same voices back at the same tables making similar arguments again about the need to use American power in ways that can ultimately lead us down the road toward casualties, toward significant conflict. That's something that I think needs to change broadly in the media. We need a wider and more representative debate on foreign policy that has voices that agree with the president and with so many other Americans about these subjects."

Also that was a classified situation. The more parallel situation might be Syria where on a Friday, the president had moved to a red line and the world was moving towards assuming the United States would do something.

In part, it's because the whole media bears the brunt of stories that are reported by just one entity or by one journalist. Part of it is frustrations that the American people have at seeing their views lacking in a lot of different contexts when it comes to media. And the president plays that to his advantage, pointing out that the media is populated by a lot of people who have elite opinions and removed from the American people.

He described how eight years ago, his son, then 17, brutally attacked his mother with a baseball bat, leaving her bloodied and unconscious. Shanahan said he regrets defending his son and wrongly claiming that that attack was in self-defense. It is really sad.

This is something he was very clear on the campaign. And when you look at this President, he has been very consistent with following through whether it's pulling out of the Iran agreement, moving the embassy to Jerusalem or tax cuts, regulations, all of those things he said he is going to do.

Let me talk to you about the campaign and the polls, in particular, because the President claimed the media were reporting on fake internal White House polls that showed him losing to Joe Biden in a lot of key states. The campaign later said those poles were real, but they were all outdated. So, they weren't phony as the President claimed. But the public polls obviously showing Biden leading nationally by about 10 points than other Democrats by lesser mounts.

I get it, MSNBC has an audience, but the problem that NBC has is they continue to decouple themselves. They were NBC, we're not MSNBC. You see people like Hallie sitting one seat one day, and then go on MSNBC the next day to continue to further the left-wing ideological agenda of MSNBC. And they cannot discern the difference anymore. So, whether it's her or anyone else there, they cannot say that they're different."

I think what's really telling to me, though, if you look at two of the hosts, George Stephanopoulos and Chuck Todd, right. So you have Fox being banned by the DNC. And here, you have a President. And this was a subtle note that I don't know many picked up on was the hearing sitting with two former Democratic staffers, he is willing to go where so many others have not."

You have more time in the field to learn and whatnot. But the way the media has been painting Biden is being from a different time because of all of his experience. And they certainly went after his comments. There was even a piece in the New York Times saying is this going to affect his standing with black voters, because black voters overwhelmingly have supported Biden, about half of them said they support Biden. And I don't know the answer to that, but I know that the media is certainly taking that angle."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

If you remember back the last time he ran for president, he made some remarks about Barack Obama in the context of race and how articulate that he was. And that became a problem for him then. So, this is really reminiscent of past comments that he has made. And I think that that is going to continue to be a problem for him in this race."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "This speaks to -- but this speaks to the larger problem that Joe Biden has as a candidate to what Kat was saying, is that it speaks to what his opponents, Howard, which is that he's a blast from the past, that the Democratic Party needs fresh new leadership, and he's not the right person to go up against Donald Trump. And that is what his opponents are saying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And, Kat, certainly, the media narrative against Biden is, you know, his too willing to work with the Republicans, he's too old, he's out of touch with the party, too prone to gaps. So, he gave them some ammunition. But is there an element of I told you so among some of these pundits, who particularly that Biden would basically implode when he declared, and meanwhile, he still got a double-digit lead?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I think it's a mix, because as you mentioned, he still does have a double-digit lead. But we don't see him out there actually quite as much as the other candidates. So there's not as much opportunity for him to say things that the press can pounce on. And it seems like when he does go out there, what he is going to talk about is brag about his relationship with segregationists. I understand that the point he was trying to make was about getting things done. But if you're going to use one of your appearances to talk about that, it is seems quite stupid. And obviously, the press is going to jump on that. So, the good thing about being a frontrunner is obviously you're the frontrunner. But the bad thing about it is you're going to get the most media coverage, which includes scrutiny."

And, Francesca, the Washington Post found letters in which includes the young senator Joe Biden was clearly courting James Eastland in working with him on school busing, where he had a different position. He was against it as a Delaware senator. So, again, as with the changing his position on the abortion and Hyde Amendment, is the media subtext here that Joe Biden unlike Cory Booker, unlike Kamala Harris, isn't liberal enough for his party, do you see it as sort of an underlying theme?"

Former Governor Jeb Bush follows him. People are interested in this because he puts a week ago today a video on their -- presumably, he's in Nevada. We don't actually know."

      "utterance": "OK. Well, the world certainly needed to know that. Now, OJ was breaking football records when I -- for the Buffalo Bills, when I went to college in Buffalo. I feel, you know, it's just such a tragedy what happened. And yet, there is a parody account that says that OJ sent a series of knife emojis -- do you believe this? With the warning, I will find your butt and cut you. Unconfirmed. But it seems like he just can't stay out of trouble or maybe he wants to be in trouble?"

      "utterance": "you know, we'll see. You know, it's interesting. Ron Goldman's sister, right, Kim, who posted that she thinks that this could be because she launched a Podcast, she's unhappy with it. But the issue is that OJ has such a larger fine. If you look at all the players, Goldman sisters, Mark Furman, these other folks out there on Twitter, they have 25- or 30000. OJ already has almost on the way towards a million. It's only been one week."

      "utterance": "Maybe, it's a stroke of genius. And I say that carefully only because here is an attempt to revise history. But he also says he's going to talk about Fantasy Football. And that's a lucrative market. I still follow Fantasy Football. In one of his five tweets that he has done basically since he launched this a week ago is about what quarterback you should have going into next year. He likes by the way Patrick Mahomes."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. People are tweeting he was a stroke of genius. This is a guy who just everyone thinks is responsible for two deaths. So, how is it a stroke of genius, because it changes the subject, because a lot of people don't remember the trial in 1984?"

      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "Because one of the legacies of President Trump will be his ability to harness Twitter to reach millions of his core base followers, and go against any narrative, whether it's facts or rumors. He's speaking right to them. In this case, OJ is creating an audience all into himself."
