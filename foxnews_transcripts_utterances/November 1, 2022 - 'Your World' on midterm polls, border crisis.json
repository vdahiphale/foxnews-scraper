We have got you covered with Alexandria Hoff in Nevada, Alicia Acuna in Arizona and Rich Edson in Pennsylvania. We begin in Nevada, where polls are showing that the Senate race between Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt is as close as you can get. I think they call it a dead heat. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. Let's first go to Alexandria Hoff on what she is seeing right now in Nevada -- Alexandria.",

And, this evening, former President Barack Obama will be holding a rally at this high school behind me in North Las Vegas hoping to drum up some support, some enthusiasm among Democratic voters, namely for Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, who has served since 2017. And she replaced the late Senator Harry Reid, and she is now locked in what you called, Neil, a dead heat, that's what it is, with Republican challenger, Adam Laxalt. The latest New York Times/Siena College poll has the two candidates completely tied at this point. This morning, Laxalt, who is the state's former attorney general, kicked off his bus tour.

David Drucker back with us, The Washington Examiner senior political correspondent. I'm amazed that a lot of these races, David, have tightened, again, I know, and you have reminded me, depending on the poll, but it's always the momentum. And the view was that, given the economy and recent numbers, and maybe we will see another sign of that after we get word the Fed has just hiked interest rates yet again -- that's expected to happen tomorrow -- that that sentiment, the concern over higher prices and now higher interest rates, will be building as the week ensues.

And voters feel worse about them than maybe they are, depending on how you want to look at it. That doesn't mean that voters are wrong, by the way. It just means that, even if you look at growth in the second quarter, even if you look at robust employment, voters broadly do not feel great about the economy. And whenever you're the incumbent party in the White House, whenever your party is running everything in Congress, or at least you have the votes to run the floor in the House and the Senate, voters are going to hold you accountable. And so I think what we're likely to see is voters go to the polls, whether through early voting or in person next Tuesday, and vote Republicans into office to control the House of Representatives. And Republicans now have a very good chance of overtaking and controlling the Senate as well. And then, of course, it's the problem you want. But they're going to have to then deal with a lot of these problems, along with President Biden, beginning in January.",

Now, of course, it could be so good that the Federal Reserve could look at that, as you know, and say, oh, we got to keep tightening rates. But there is this sort of dichotomy going on, the economy itself, which a lot of people are frustrated with, the high prices going to the grocery store, high prices going to the gas station, high prices, and yet a backdrop of pretty powerful jobs, 10.7 million out there that are going begging, that are out there, but no one no one's taking them up on it.

It's more about how voters feel about the economy. Neil, let's look at some recent history. In 2012, right before the presidential election, there was a really weak jobs report that came out. President Obama was reelected nonetheless. In 2018, the economy was strong all the way around, and yet Republicans lost 40 seats in the House, because voters, especially independent voters, women, suburban voters, were exhausted with President Trump's style of leadership. And so here we are in 2022. As we have been talking, there is the possibility to point to some solid economic indicators, even as we're dealing with so much friction and stress about the economy in terms of inflation, and I really don't think it's going to matter all that much if the next jobs report looks really good.

And maybe after the election, this tells us a little bit. Maybe it doesn't. But there's a district up here in New York. It's New York 25. It's Rochester. All right? This should not even be on the board, Neil, OK? La'Ron Singletary is a former police chief. And apparently he's running a pretty good race, because Democrats over the past week have thrown a lot of money into this race. They set an all-time record for homicides in Rochester, New York. So you know what the issue is there. It's crime, right? Come down here to -- let's go to Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh. This is an urban area, Allegheny County, right along here. Summer Lee is a progressive. Mike Doyle is a Republican. He wants the seat. Democrats, again, putting money into this district. Why is that? Is Doyle doing better than people thought? Can Republicans win in places like Pittsburgh, PA? The city now, I'm talking about, not the suburbs. Can Republicans win in Rochester, New York? If they can, Neil, then you come out a little wider and ask yourself what's happening all in here across the entire country come election night? And then we go to California, and all these races are starting to pop up. Want to take you down to California 26. Julia Brownley is the Democrat. This is just north of L.A. here, OK? Over the last week, Democrats thrown a lot of money in this race, thinking -- and this race has moved now more toward the center, and perhaps she could be in trouble. And that was something that, even a week ago, Neil, I would argue it wasn't on the radar. And this kind of stuff is popping up every day now.

Of course, Gerry has a show on the network. He's already demanded it. It's a waste of time. But, Gerry, always good to see you. Bill was alluding to these polls that are showing this moderate to conservative shift that's make getting a race out of races that shouldn't be races. And I'm just wondering what you make of that. GERRY BAKER, HOST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL AT LARGE\": Yes. Neil, thanks very much again for having me on. And it was interesting to see Bill's map there opening up some parts of the country that are becoming competitive that perhaps weren't expected to be competitive. Look, I think something -- I mean, it does look as though, in the final days of the campaign, we are seeing some quite significant movement towards Republicans. You're seeing it in some of the polling, The Wall Street Journal poll today is a very marked example of that, a swing to Republicans, ahead now in the generic ballot, big swings in some of the categories of voters, suburban women swinging enormously towards Republicans, I think concern about crime and inflation. So I think you are seeing this. The interesting thing, though, Neil, it still has to be said, is that even as more and more of those House races become competitive, the Senate picture still looks a little complex and still it doesn't look good as though it's in the bag for Republicans. In fact, there's still a chance Democrats could hold on, as you look at those key races in Pennsylvania, in Arizona and Nevada, in Georgia, in particular. It's still not clear yet that, despite the Democrat -- the Republicans having a solid lead on the issues across the country and making advances in some of those national polls, those Senate races still seem to be toss-ups.",

Still saying, no, inflation isn't a problem. The economy's great. Remember, strong as hell, President Biden said just a couple of weeks ago. Crime, they are basically denying that crime, which is surging in so many cities, that they're denying it's a problem at all. Kathy Hochul, in her debate last week with Lee Zeldin, I think, really what might be one of the pivotal moments of that -- the pivotal moment of that campaign, said -- she was repeatedly pressed by Lee Zeldin to say whether or not she favored putting criminals in jail. And, at one point, she said, I don't understand why this is so important to you. And it just seemed to me to capture and to lot of people just how much in denial Democrats are, or at least that trying to get us to deny what we see with our own eyes. I live in New York City, Neil.

He faces a number of state charges, including assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, burglary and so on. And, of course, the state charges are in addition to several federal charges that were announced yesterday.

And so I think what we're likely to see is voters go to the polls, whether through early voting or in person next Tuesday, and vote Republicans into office to control the House of Representatives. And Republicans now have a very good chance of overtaking and controlling the Senate as well. And then, of course, it's the problem you want. But they're going to have to then deal with a lot of these problems, along with President Biden, beginning in January."

Now, of course, it could be so good that the Federal Reserve could look at that, as you know, and say, oh, we got to keep tightening rates. But there is this sort of dichotomy going on, the economy itself, which a lot of people are frustrated with, the high prices going to the grocery store, high prices going to the gas station, high prices, and yet a backdrop of pretty powerful jobs, 10.7 million out there that are going begging, that are out there, but no one no one's taking them up on it.

It's more about how voters feel about the economy. Neil, let's look at some recent history. In 2012, right before the presidential election, there was a really weak jobs report that came out. President Obama was reelected nonetheless. In 2018, the economy was strong all the way around, and yet Republicans lost 40 seats in the House, because voters, especially independent voters, women, suburban voters, were exhausted with President Trump's style of leadership. And so here we are in 2022. As we have been talking, there is the possibility to point to some solid economic indicators, even as we're dealing with so much friction and stress about the economy in terms of inflation, and I really don't think it's going to matter all that much if the next jobs report looks really good.

Of course, this election is about a referendum on his leadership. But at the end of the day, the Democratic Party has to start fielding some better candidates. And I think that's what -- one of the problems they're having right now, is that the candidates are not resonating with voters. And their message is more about scaring people, as opposed to present-day actions or results or what's actually happening in the country.

He didn't have these Democratic socialists running around the halls of Congress. You didn't have that twist towards socialism and the liberal approach to governing. So I think it would be much more difficult for President Biden to do it. And then, of course, he doesn't have Bill Clinton's skill set. And leadership in politics has a lot to do with the candidate themselves. And this president is very unpopular. He won because he wasn't Donald Trump, and -- at that moment in time And I think that that was the challenge in terms of him being able to lead post-election, and we're seeing that now. So I think, when he wakes up, when the Republicans gain control of the Senate, which they are highly likely to do, and have control of the Congress -- of the House, I think he's going to have to figure out what could he get done now, if anything."

You have got to have those repercussions. And this is what Congressman Tony Gonzales and I are doing. People don't understand. They think that members of Congress don't talk to each other, don't work together, but we're both appropriators. And we're working together to find solutions, the technology. We're adding more moneys for new Border Patrol agents, new CBP, because you have got to be smart on how you address this issue. For example, most of the drugs for example, meth, 94 percent of the meth will come through ports of entry; 91 percent of the fentanyl comes through ports of entry. And we can go on. So we got to make sure that we not only talk and support the men and women in green, but also the men and women in blue. And, finally, if you looked at about 50 percent of the 11 to 12 million undocumented aliens that we have, about 50 percent of them are visa overstays.

According to the federal affidavit, DePape told authorities, when police showed up to the house, Pelosi ran and opened the door and grabbed the hammer that he was holding. Now, police say, when they arrived at the House, they witnessed DePape gain full control of that hammer and swing it into Pelosi's head. And according to police, DePape said that he was going to hold the House speaker hostage and talk to her. And if she were to tell the truth, he would let her go, and, if she lied, he was going to break her kneecaps. He also told police that he viewed Pelosi as the -- quote -- \"leader of the pack of lies told by the Democratic Party.\" He told police that, by breaking her kneecaps, she would have to be willed into Congress, which would -- quote -- \"show the other members of Congress there were consequences to actions.\""

But the attempted kidnapping is the charge that certainly, I think, is going to keep him in jail for some time to come. I will say he's lucky to be alive, because when he raised that hammer, those law enforcement officers could have blasted to smithereens."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL DALY, FORMER FBI INVESTIGATOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil. I mean, it's certainly could have been a very different story if they had not interceded so quickly in that, I mean, and certainly the miracle of that kind of call and immediate response. We did hear the transcript of the call that Mr. Pelosi made to police. There's some people read into the fact that he said, oh, I have a friend here, et cetera. Somebody under duress, under duress is -- and maybe with someone nearby, wants to kind of tone things down. And,, that's why he -- when he made that call, which was the call that precipitated police doing kind of a wellness check, because they sensed that something was awry, that's when they interceded and got there very quickly. I mean, it was something out of a movie, where they rolled in and here the two were struggling with a hammer."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, obviously, DePape had other intentions, Ted, if we're to take him at face value, that he wanted to kneecap Nancy Pelosi, drag her to Capitol Hill. I mean, it gets pretty morbid, pretty crazy. But that's what we're dealing with. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, we're dealing with a possibly very disturbed person. For someone to break into someone's home in the middle of the night, and then to specifically say, \"Where's Nancy?\" I think that is what is helping the authorities with the attempted kidnapping charge, Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, looking at the charges right now, Bill, of course, this occurs with a backdrop where we have very easy, almost way too easy, bail policies in cities across the country. In San Francisco, a prosecutor was thrown out of office for deemed being too easy. Is this a reminder that, if you have tighter standards, tighter charges, or even a tighter policing of those charges -- and I know it's different in this case, by all means, an attack on a speaker's family member -- that that works, that they get put behind bars and stay behind bars?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DALY",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, you see, a number of these people are recidivists. So they're out there. And between the time that they're arrested, and there's no bail, and they're waiting for some type of court hearing or the next session to go back to court, they're committing an act. And I think this goes to show you that people who have this type of -- these behaviors are bound or perhaps possible -- possibly recidivists, where they're going to commit these acts when they're out again. And we have seen that time and time again, whether it's here in New York or whether it's in major cities in Chicago or out in California. And so I think that does send a message. When people are incarcerated and held, depending upon the charges, with bail or perhaps sometimes without bail in jail, it may reduce the opportunity to commit further harm to citizens of that locale."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. By the way, Ted Williams, we're told this is all over now. The arraignment is done. You mentioned earlier, Ted, that, depending on the degree of the charges actually filed here, that kidnapping one alone could land him in prison for the better part maybe the rest of his life, although he's 42 years old, I believe, but at least a 50-year sentence on that alone."

He pleaded not guilty to these charges and he's being held without bail. That's probably not a big shocker. We will keep you posted on that, give you an update. Meanwhile, as we're a week away from the big midterm election, what are the battleground states? Some have just become battlegrounds. We're on top of it. Our Bill Hemmer all over it -- after this."

Already, millions of Americans have already voted in this midterm election year that's getting the attention a presidential election year does. Our Bill Hemmer is keeping track particularly of this battle for the United States Senate. And it gets crazier and crazier every day, doesn't it, Bill?"

      "utterance": "Sure does. Hey, Neil. I see. I just want to give you a little spin here, OK, and give me a sense of who's on offense and who's on defense, where are Republicans spending money, where are Democrats spending money, and ask yourself whether or not it makes sense. And maybe after the election, this tells us a little bit. Maybe it doesn't. But there's a district up here in New York. It's New York 25. It's Rochester. All right? This should not even be on the board, Neil, OK? La'Ron Singletary is a former police chief. And apparently he's running a pretty good race, because Democrats over the past week have thrown a lot of money into this race. They set an all-time record for homicides in Rochester, New York. So you know what the issue is there. It's crime, right? Come down here to -- let's go to Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh. This is an urban area, Allegheny County, right along here. Summer Lee is a progressive. Mike Doyle is a Republican. He wants the seat. Democrats, again, putting money into this district. Why is that? Is Doyle doing better than people thought? Can Republicans win in places like Pittsburgh, PA? The city now, I'm talking about, not the suburbs. Can Republicans win in Rochester, New York? If they can, Neil, then you come out a little wider and ask yourself what's happening all in here across the entire country come election night? And then we go to California, and all these races are starting to pop up. Want to take you down to California 26. Julia Brownley is the Democrat. This is just north of L.A. here, OK? Over the last week, Democrats thrown a lot of money in this race, thinking -- and this race has moved now more toward the center, and perhaps she could be in trouble. And that was something that, even a week ago, Neil, I would argue it wasn't on the radar. And this kind of stuff is popping up every day now. And maybe it means something and maybe not in the end, but follow the money and see who's playing offense and see who's playing defense along the way."

      "utterance": "Just wild. Bill Hemmer, thank you very, very much, my friend. Let's go to Gerry Baker, what he makes this, \"The Wall Street At Large\" with Gerry Baker, a very popular show on FOX Business, which, if you don't get, you should demand. Of course, Gerry has a show on the network. He's already demanded it. It's a waste of time. But, Gerry, always good to see you. Bill was alluding to these polls that are showing this moderate to conservative shift that's make getting a race out of races that shouldn't be races. And I'm just wondering what you make of that. GERRY BAKER, HOST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL AT LARGE\": Yes. Neil, thanks very much again for having me on. And it was interesting to see Bill's map there opening up some parts of the country that are becoming competitive that perhaps weren't expected to be competitive. Look, I think something -- I mean, it does look as though, in the final days of the campaign, we are seeing some quite significant movement towards Republicans. You're seeing it in some of the polling, The Wall Street Journal poll today is a very marked example of that, a swing to Republicans, ahead now in the generic ballot, big swings in some of the categories of voters, suburban women swinging enormously towards Republicans, I think concern about crime and inflation. So I think you are seeing this. The interesting thing, though, Neil, it still has to be said, is that even as more and more of those House races become competitive, the Senate picture still looks a little complex and still it doesn't look good as though it's in the bag for Republicans. In fact, there's still a chance Democrats could hold on, as you look at those key races in Pennsylvania, in Arizona and Nevada, in Georgia, in particular. It's still not clear yet that, despite the Democrat -- the Republicans having a solid lead on the issues across the country and making advances in some of those national polls, those Senate races still seem to be toss-ups."

      "utterance": "You know what's wild too, Gerry? And you have written about this, but the crime issue, in other words, where there does seem to be some tone-deafness out of some prominent Democrats. Kathy Hochul in New York comes to mind, the governor, who is trying to get elected in her own right, but faces an unusual challenge in this bluest of blue states from Lee Zeldin, where it could be pretty competitive. He could even win, the first Republican in 20 years. Where is she botching it?"

      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "Well, you -- I think you hit it on the head there. And thank you again. I have written about it my column today in The Wall Street Journal about denialism on the Democratic side. This, I think, is the big problem that Democrats have, that, whether it's inflation, they have spent a year, more than a year denying that inflation is a problem. Still doing it. Still saying, no, inflation isn't a problem. The economy's great. Remember, strong as hell, President Biden said just a couple of weeks ago. Crime, they are basically denying that crime, which is surging in so many cities, that they're denying it's a problem at all. Kathy Hochul, in her debate last week with Lee Zeldin, I think, really what might be one of the pivotal moments of that -- the pivotal moment of that campaign, said -- she was repeatedly pressed by Lee Zeldin to say whether or not she favored putting criminals in jail. And, at one point, she said, I don't understand why this is so important to you. And it just seemed to me to capture and to lot of people just how much in denial Democrats are, or at least that trying to get us to deny what we see with our own eyes. I live in New York City, Neil. We know how bad the crime problem was become here. It's up. Thank God it's not where it was 30 years ago. It's true. But it is much, much worse than it was three, four, five years ago. And people know that. They're not stupid."

So I think that, whether it's on crime, whether it's on inflation, whether it's on immigration -- they told us for a long time there was no crisis at the border, the border is secure. People see some -- people see the reality. And when the politicians tell them something different, I think they think those politicians are not fit for office."

All right, we have been following as well this attack on Paul Pelosi a week ago. He is still in the hospital and his alleged assailant has just been arraigned. He's going to have to sit and stew in jail right now. We don't know for how long. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. Let's get the latest from Claudia Cowan in San Francisco. Claudia, what have we learned?"

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. No cameras allowed, but it was a packed courtroom for this arraignment for David DePape that just wrapped up a few moments ago here behind me at the Hall of Justice. He was wearing an orange jail jumpsuit. He was not shackled. But one of his arms appeared to be in a sling. He was in the hospital as well. He apparently just got out of the hospital this morning. The details of his injuries are unclear, but he sat quietly in the courtroom as the judge, Diane Northway, retired visiting judge, accepted his plea of not guilty. He faces a number of state charges, including assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, burglary and so on. And, of course, the state charges are in addition to several federal charges that were announced yesterday. And if convicted on all of these charges, Neil, of course, he could spend decades in prison, possibly more, because the assault with a deadly weapon charge carries a possible life prison sentence. So everyone is back in court now on Friday for more legal proceedings, including some arguments about whether he should be allowed to be free on bond. So we are all back here on Friday. But, for now, the arraignment is over. And we will see what happens next, Neil."

That is expected tomorrow. It's all the language and the details we hear from Jerome Powell, the chairman, as to how many more of these are coming. And we're told more are."
