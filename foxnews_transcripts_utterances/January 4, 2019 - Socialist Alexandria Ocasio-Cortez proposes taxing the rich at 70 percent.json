In a Twitter and soundbite culture it was refreshing. It reminded me of Oprah's interviews of the past where you got that long conversation with somebody. I think there may be too much heated conversation here, and if that is the case, I actually believe the Oscars have an opportunity to go in a fresh direction. If it doesn't end up being Kevin Hart, and again, Ellen is making a big push here, I say connect with middle America, connect with the average person. We've long said that Hollywood is out of touch, and I would make the case that you actually have some people that could work. How about Chris Pratt? A box office star and somebody that talks openly about his faith. Maybe Reese Witherspoon, who although a very successful actress, still feels like the girl next door and someone we could be friends with.

The Democrats are in control of the House for one full day and they're already making their embarrassing priorities known. I'll explain in moments and President Trump says he could get the border wall build without Congress and warning this shut down could last years. One of the border agents who spoke alongside the President yesterday joins us plus newly minted Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez making a splash on Capitol Hill comparing herself to Abraham Lincoln and saying that wealthy people should be taxed at a much, much higher rate, we'll get into it all with Corey Lewandowski. And we'll compare the First Speaker Pelosi to the latest iteration, our panel will react. Also will he or won't he? Comedian Kevin Hart may get his academy award hosting gig back and Ellen DeGeneres is taking heat for giving him a pass on an old LGBT joker or two. But first the Internet is exploding with people griping about Netflix's new interactive film, 'Black Mirror Bandersnatch.' It'd been hyped as a choose your own adventure experience where your choices can lead to unexpected and incredible story lines. I won't describe what happens to the lead character Stephan but suffices to say no matter what options you choose as you watch the film, you basically get the same endings. The more novel choices I made, the more frustrated I became with the pre- ordained finales that continue to pop up and it got me thinking, this is what the American voter has been going through for decades. Every couple of years we go to the polls thinking we're going to control the new narrative, we're going to change things, now we're going to get the ending we want. In 2016 Donald Trump ran on a couple of key issues reviving the economy, riding trade imbalances and -"

But due to establishment Republicans and Democrats, the people didn't get the ending the expected. So they went to the polls again in the midterms Republicans held the Senate, the Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House mostly to be a check on Trump. Now voters didn't suddenly reject their desires for a thriving economy and a border wall, they just wanted some checks and balances in place. Now we find ourselves in the midst of a government shutdown."

The voter keeps hitting the fund government and border wall choice but nothing happens. They hit it over and over again but they're trapped in the same old narrative no matter what they do. Ryan and McConnell didn't deliver but they somehow found billions for more defense spending while blowing right through those spending caps. Now Pelosi and McConnell are stiffing the voters as well. The American people want both parties to work together because they imagine that adults can work across the aisle to soberly and responsibly keep the government open and protect their national security. They like the idea of parties collaborating to create the best outcome for the American people. But hard as they press that button, no matter how many times they try to choose a different outcome, the same old story comes back at them like Bandersnatch. The people got a heavy sell this week."

Armed with subpoena power, Democrats are planning to investigate the personal and professional life of this President and every official in his orbit with the goal of driving him from office. As for the voters, well, they're stuck in a 'Bandersnatch' like a loop having to suffer through storylines they never bargained for with no way out. Should this continue, they might be tempted to do what so many Netflix viewers taking part in that interactive movie did during the holidays and just turned it all off. But that's just what the politicians want you to do. Look away so they can dictate how you live and what you'll spend your money on. With so much at stake for American citizens, withdrawal is not an option. You'll have to stay engaged, our future hangs in the balance and by the way, the term 'Bandersnatch,' I found out this week comes from Lewis Carroll's \"Through The Looking Glass\" in one of his subsequent poems. It is described as a creature with a long neck and snapping jaws but I'm sure it's only fiction one. Who would ever choose a storyline with something like that in it? Joining me now this Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union along with Dee Dawkins- Haigler. She's a Democratic strategist, thank you both for being here.

We know that if he did this emergency declaration, that the DOD owns probably about 5 percent of the land along that border and if any money is appropriated to the southern border that's not specifically for the construction of a wall, it would be illegal to use those funds for a wall. So of course, we're going to see another legal challenge and I don't think frankly the President wants to go there, he hasn't been very successful in the past with legal challenges and I think he's right. I think the best route is to get back to negotiating. Now that he's got a Democratic Congress, he's got to deal with that and I think really that's what the people of United States want to see. They want to see our government back to work and they want to see you know, compromise. They want to see a conversation of ideas.

We got to get them back working together. We need compromise, we need sound immigration policy, we need to fix this. Look, what what's happening in the United States is not good when it comes to immigration policy but you know the Mexicans aren't happy about the guns, the U.S. guns that are traveling into Mexico.

Kevin Hart was confirmed as the Oscars hosted back on December 4th, but within 24 hours anti-gay tweets and jokes from eight or nine years ago resurfaced, ginning up bigtime backlash. Two days later, on December 6th, Hart posted on Instagram video accusing critics of being negative, and another saying the Academy had asked him to apologize but that he'd refused. Later that night the comedian changed his mind, tweeting that he'd be stepping down because, quote, \"I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.\" But his interview today with Ellen DeGeneres, who came out publicly in 1997, may lead to another about-face after Ellen revealed she personally called the Academy to ask if they would take him back. Watch."

Whatever we can do we would be thrilled. And he can host. You have grown, you have apologized, you are apologizing again right now, you've done it. Don't let those people win, host the Oscars."

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "After Hart said he would evaluate the possibility, Ellen tweeted, quote, \"I believe in forgiveness. I believe in second chances, and I believe in Kevin Hart.\" But then DeGeneres got called out on Twitter with one person saying, quote, \"Kevin's attacks were geared towards black and men. That being said, you have no authority to forgive him on behalf of a section of the community you don't belong to.\" And this, quote, \"Forgiveness happens when someone sincerely apologizes, makes amends, and shifts spiritually. Still waiting on steps number two and three.\" And lastly this one, quote, \"No, Ellen, just no. There need to be consequences for such vitriolic homophobia. Love you, but you are way off base on this.\" So far, no word from the Academy on if they are considering a reinstatement, but the show will go on as planned on February 24th. Raymond?"

      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Trace. Joining me now to react is actor Antonio Sabato Jr. and Megan Alexander, a correspondent at \"Inside Edition.\" Megan, I want to start with you. What is Ellen DeGeneres about here? What's the game? When I read this, I thought maybe the Academy Awards are conspiring with her to rehabilitate Kevin Hart because they are out of options, they don't have a host."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEGAN ALEXANDER, REPORTER, INSIDE EDITION",
      "utterance": "Raymond, regardless, words like \"second chances,\" \"forgiveness,\" words we don't often hear in our culture sounds an awful lot like the gospel to grace to me. So no matter what, I think it's very cool that Ellen decided to give Kevin this platform, a full hour. I encourage everyone to watch this interview. In a Twitter and soundbite culture it was refreshing. It reminded me of Oprah's interviews of the past where you got that long conversation with somebody. I think there may be too much heated conversation here, and if that is the case, I actually believe the Oscars have an opportunity to go in a fresh direction. If it doesn't end up being Kevin Hart, and again, Ellen is making a big push here, I say connect with middle America, connect with the average person. We've long said that Hollywood is out of touch, and I would make the case that you actually have some people that could work. How about Chris Pratt? A box office star and somebody that talks openly about his faith. Maybe Reese Witherspoon, who although a very successful actress, still feels like the girl next door and someone we could be friends with. Raymond, they have a viewership problem regardless, and I think this is an opportunity for them to really take a look at who could bring back those middle America viewers."

At some point we want to ask for forgiveness and move on. This year I want to focus on positives, I want to focus on bringing Hollywood together, and this is a good chance to do so. We have to do a lot of work, but we'll see what happens."

So you can't now talk about LGBT people, we can't talk about Italians, we can't talk this or that. Pretty soon they will only be able to discuss cats and DMV lines. We've got to broaden their offering. Go ahead."

They can do whatever they want, they can say whatever they want about our president or the Republican Party, but any time we don't agree with the Democrats in Hollywood, all hell breaks loose. And we've just got to change that. we've got to bring people together. I always ask people like George Clooney, people like that, just come to come out and help us, come together. Let's help the people of this country. Let's bring Hollywood together. Let's bring it like the old days like you said. And we have got a lot of work to do, and we can start right now."

She saying during her awards show, quote, \"I'm not interested in talking about Trump at all. What I'm interested in is pointing to actual real change. I want to focus on that cause. People can pooh-pooh Hollywood all they want, but we also make culture.\" Is this a sign that Hollywood is finally realizing the divisive politics is not working for them, Megan?"

And I would encourage Sandra to take a cue from Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley who hosted the CMA Awards in November. They had not one political joke, not one controversial subject on that stage, viewers loved it. So give us the art. And yes, celebrate movies like \"Black Panther\" that are breaking box office records with $1.3 billion, focus on the art and entertainment."

It's simply went viral because she's a public figure and she's dancing kind of terribly, and it's something just people laugh at. It's totally harmless. I don't think there's anything wrong here. What I see a problem with is they keep continually infantilizing her in the media. They're pretending that she is some 13-year-old girl who is constantly under attack by the bogeyman white GOP old men who are out to get her and want to ban dancing, and that's patently false. She is constantly under attack because of her poor ideas. She is pushing communism and socialism, ideas that were perpetuated by Lenin and Stalin before her. That's why she's become a target in the media, not because she's simply dancing."

Welcome to 2019 where everything is racist and everything is sexist and everybody needs to be offended at every turn. We have to stop this. And you brought this up in an earlier segment. We are killing comedy and we're killing humor, and that's a problem because that really is the glue in the fabric that keeps Americans together during such divisive times. Just a couple of decades ago we would all be making fun of each other. You would go and see Chris Rock at a stand up and he would make fun of me for being black and he would make fun of Cathy for being Cuban and we would all laugh together and walk out feeling better about ourselves. We can't do that anymore in this society. I think that's said. It's something that we are actually missing."
