Plus, we'll cover a very tense standoff at sea, where a Russian warship nearly ran into a U.S. Navy destroyer. We're going to play that full tape coming up tonight. Laura Ingraham had a long sit down with the president of the United States. We'll have a preview of that interview, and also talk to Laura about behind the scenes. First, we turn to a big development from the deranged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Today, oh, as we predicted, she did finally cave to Mitch McConnell. She agreed to send over her B.S. articles of impeachment to the Senate. No one on either side of the aisle is sure why the speaker was clinging to a dear life to the articles. We have no idea. But as of yesterday it wasn't totally clear that Nancy Pelosi herself even knew why. She was stalling, as usual, considering this is so urgent, urgent, urgent, urgent, urgent.

The only one fact witness, you all Republicans in the U.S. Senate, in this entire case, other is hearsay, others, of course, opinion witnesses -- Gordon Sondland. He gave exculpatory information about the president refuting the charges. Talked to the president? Yes. What did he say he wants? Nothing. No quid pro quo, game over. Do your job.

It's now up to the Republican controlled Senate, do your job. Your job is not to undo the mess that they are handing you. Your job is to dismiss it because there's nothing there. Not carry out Nancy Pelosi's bidding and the squad's bidding. That is not your constitutional role to hold little Adam Schiff's hand and correct all of his lies -- and they are lies -- and mistakes and his psychosis. You can't fix it anyway. It's not your duty to try and justify the Democrats fabricated charges, three years in running now, and the B.S. once and for all. Get back to working on issues that will impact the lives, the safety, the security, the prosperity of the American people.

Joining us now with more, author of the book, bestseller, \"Guilt by Accusation\", Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. Texas Congressman, also former prosecutor, Louie Gohmert, is with us. Good to see you both. Professor, I'll start with you tonight. OK, when the Supreme Court, when there was a conflict between the judicial and executive branch, I will defer to you, professor. And the executive branch seeks a remedy like in the case of executive privilege, and the court decides to take it up. I would think seeking remedy in the court is the constitutional thing to do. They didn't want to wait for the court's decision which I would anticipate sometime in, oh, maybe June. What do you think, Professor? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, \"GUILT BY ACCUSATION\" AUTHOR: Absolutely right. Checks and balances in separation of power requires the president or anybody in the executive branch is asked to disclose material that might be covered by executive privilege, the executive branch has an obligation to say no to the partisan House of Representatives committee and say, look, if you want to have a subpoena recognized, go to court. Get the court to validate it. That's what they did in the Nixon case. That's what they did in other cases.

On Tuesday, according to our intelligence, they downed a passenger plane with a Russian-made antiaircraft missile, killing 176 human souls on board, including dozens of Canadians, Ukrainians and Iranians. Well, now, new video has emerged showing the plane getting struck with what looks like, yep, some kind of missile before falling out of the sky. But the rogue regime in Iran, they are still denying that the plane was hit with the missile, claiming the U.S. is spreading lies about the crash. According to reports, Iranian bulldozers have already been seeing clearing the debris before investigators actually arrived and Tehran is currently refusing to turn over the plane's black boxes. Meanwhile in the Arabian Gulf, earlier today, a Russian warship came within feet of ramming a U.S. destroyer.

It swung dangerously behind the USS Farragut, coming as close as 60 yards, only turning away after five warning sirens signaled a collision. The USS Farragut had significant backup, though. It was on routine operations as part of the powerful Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier strike group. After around 10 to 15 minutes, the aggressive Russian ship pulled away.

He's held naval drills with other allies, the Iranians and the Chinese. He has even offered to mediate between Iran and the U.S. It does seem as if Putin doesn't want to be left out of the current tensions.

That will put us in jail. Where's the accountability? Where's the equal justice and application of our laws? And also just breaking tonight, FBI Director Wray submitted a declaration of the FISA court saying the FBI is going to implement all of the inspector general's recommendations to improve the accuracy of FISA applications. Meaning, nothing like the Steele dossier should ever be in a FISA application again. With all due respect, Director Wray, that's not enough. Sorry, the premeditated fraud on the FISA court to spy on a candidate and a transition team and a president, I'd like to see a little more outrage from you.

I just got off of the phone with Campbell's lawyer -- no, Huber never bothered to interview the whistle-blower. Look, the Clintons became enormously wealthy through quid pro quo arrangements that were funneled through their foundation. The worst of which was $145 million paid by uranium at the same time that Clinton CFIUS committee allowed the sale of those uranium assets to go through.

We begin tonight with yet more breaking news at home and abroad, including major new details from the president's action in Iran. Plus, we'll cover a very tense standoff at sea, where a Russian warship nearly ran into a U.S. Navy destroyer. We're going to play that full tape coming up tonight. Laura Ingraham had a long sit down with the president of the United States. We'll have a preview of that interview, and also talk to Laura about behind the scenes. First, we turn to a big development from the deranged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Today, oh, as we predicted, she did finally cave to Mitch McConnell. She agreed to send over her B.S. articles of impeachment to the Senate. No one on either side of the aisle is sure why the speaker was clinging to a dear life to the articles. We have no idea. But as of yesterday it wasn't totally clear that Nancy Pelosi herself even knew why. She was stalling, as usual, considering this is so urgent, urgent, urgent, urgent, urgent. Take a look."

Before this current month-long pause of urgency, the very dazed and confused Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, argued that impeachment was urgent, time sensitive, a crisis, must be fast without delay before Christmas, before our vacation. But now, after weeks and weeks of stalling over some fantasy that she's going to actually dictate, the Constitution to the U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell directing the Senate's trial, Pelosi has given in. And at some point next week -- well, the Senate will receive these B.S. articles of impeachment we kind of expect Tuesday. Trial begins on Wednesday, tentative schedule. This morning, during his interview with Laura Ingraham, here's what the president had to say about Nancy Pelosi and her impeachment charade. Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "What have they done for three years? Nothing! So, let's be clear, Pelosi is sending over this pile of garbage to the U.S. Senate. I gave my message to senator -- Senate Republicans last night. Their job, their constitutional obligations, they do the impeachment. OK, let the managers bring in all their evidence because there was no crimes, no high crimes, no misdemeanors, no bribery, no treason, totally made up charges, one fact witness. Now, let them put forward their case. You don't go in and say, oh, it's so bad, let us do it for you. No, your job is to have the trial, let them present the evidence that was so compelling to impeach the president. And then you're done hearing, there's only fact witness, then you can vote, call the roll and get rid of this. Of course, we'll be watching the compromise, the corrupt congenital liar Adam Schiff. The only one fact witness, you all Republicans in the U.S. Senate, in this entire case, other is hearsay, others, of course, opinion witnesses -- Gordon Sondland. He gave exculpatory information about the president refuting the charges. Talked to the president? Yes. What did he say he wants? Nothing. No quid pro quo, game over. Do your job. Don't start trying to redo their bad work in the U.S. Senate. Don't give any credence to what they have done and how they are hurting the country with politicizing, all of this now going on over three years. So-called whistle-blower, non-whistle-blower, fraud, coordinating. We now know Schiff's office did have contact from the get-go. Let's look into that. It's now up to the Republican controlled Senate, do your job. Your job is not to undo the mess that they are handing you. Your job is to dismiss it because there's nothing there. Not carry out Nancy Pelosi's bidding and the squad's bidding. That is not your constitutional role to hold little Adam Schiff's hand and correct all of his lies -- and they are lies -- and mistakes and his psychosis. You can't fix it anyway. It's not your duty to try and justify the Democrats fabricated charges, three years in running now, and the B.S. once and for all. Get back to working on issues that will impact the lives, the safety, the security, the prosperity of the American people. And don't forget, any additional witnesses from the administration, that will be executive privilege. And the president reaffirmed that again today as he should. Take a look."

The president's constitutional duty is to uphold the legitimacy of the executive branch, not just for himself -- but he's right -- this is about the executive branch, future presidents. And unlike the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Pelosi's articles were not passed on a bipartisan basis. Zero Republicans in a House voted for it and a few Democrats actually voted not to impeach. This has been and remains a political witch hunt. The only one guilty of a quid and a pro and a quo is Joe, and zero experience Hunter paid millions. You're not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor. It is a desperate last-minute attempt to smear, slander, besmirch the president to try and get the political advantage. They know they're not going to do it. They want to hurt the president politically. Earlier today, the president had this to say about the Democrats' never- ending antics. Take a look."

Can you one thing they have accomplished for the American people? This is supposed to be public service, we the people. Members of the U.S. Senate, especially you Republicans, you need to end this for the sake of our country and our Constitution and frankly, for the sake of the future presidents. In America, it's we, the people. You're supposed to be servants of we, the people. Do our work. Well, guess what? In 298 days, thank goodness, we, the people, we make the final decision. Joining us now with more, author of the book, bestseller, \"Guilt by Accusation\", Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. Texas Congressman, also former prosecutor, Louie Gohmert, is with us. Good to see you both. Professor, I'll start with you tonight. OK, when the Supreme Court, when there was a conflict between the judicial and executive branch, I will defer to you, professor. And the executive branch seeks a remedy like in the case of executive privilege, and the court decides to take it up. I would think seeking remedy in the court is the constitutional thing to do. They didn't want to wait for the court's decision which I would anticipate sometime in, oh, maybe June. What do you think, Professor? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, \"GUILT BY ACCUSATION\" AUTHOR: Absolutely right. Checks and balances in separation of power requires the president or anybody in the executive branch is asked to disclose material that might be covered by executive privilege, the executive branch has an obligation to say no to the partisan House of Representatives committee and say, look, if you want to have a subpoena recognized, go to court. Get the court to validate it. That's what they did in the Nixon case. That's what they did in other cases. But to hold a president impeachable on obstruction of Congress for simply exercising his constitutional authority as head of the executive branch, to impose and invoke checks and balances and judicial review would make Alexander Hamilton turned over in his grave."

So the Democrats in the House should have gone to court, they could have done it on an expedited basis and sort -- review and sort enforcement. They probably would have won some of them, probably would have lost the Bolton case because that is as the president said in the interview, paradigmatic example of executive privilege. Getting advice from your national security advisor about national security issues, the courts would generally uphold that claim of executive privilege. Maybe others they wouldn't. But you cannot expect the president as head of the executive branch simply to capitulate to a partisan majority in -- on a committee of Congress."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you Louie Gohmert, because I read the Constitution and I'll defer to you and Professor Alan Dershowitz, both lawyers. But my reading is that it is the sole power of the House of Representatives to impeach. That is their role. But that is their only role. The trial, it is the constitutional role of the U.S. Senate and it is the chief justice that will preside over the hearings. Now, they have impeached this president. They're going to have managers present their case to the Senate, OK? Now I know some Republican senators may be saying, well, maybe we should call other witnesses. But if it is the House's role to impeach, my question is, why would the Senate not do anything except listen to their case and not do the -- the takeover of the role of the constitutional job of the House? Can you help me with that?"

      "speaker": "REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-TX)",

So, yes, the House did not do its job on impeachment. There was no high crime. There was no misdemeanor. There was no treason, bribery. They dropped all of those things. So, they -- we know and you and I have talked about it, Sean, when the Democrats are accusing the president and Republicans have doing something, that's exactly what they are doing is projecting. The abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, that's exactly what they've been doing. And all of the garbage about clear and present danger, we've got to act now, we've got to violate our own rules and not allow the minority party to have witnesses. We have got to move forward and then sit on it for a month or so, that just shows the hypocrisy. And we haven't -- the majority has not done its job in the House. And you're right. The trial ought to go forward --"

      "utterance": "Yes, I do and Hamilton again in Federalist 65 said, you need a speedy trial. You need to have a trial right away. Impeachment and removal are part of the same process. And it undercuts the process when there's undue delay for partisan tactical reason."

U.S. Senate, don't go in there and do the Houses job. They have a role, let them present their case and you vote. You hold the trial. Tonight, we're also tracking to major situations out of the Middle East. Now breaking just moments ago, we are learning Soleimani was not the only high-ranking Iranian terrorist targeted over the weekend. Look at these new reports, the leader of Iran's so-called elite Quds forces in Yemen also the subject of a U.S. strike. Although the mission was allegedly not successful, it is clear that U.S. has been working to incapacitate the leadership of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Now, despite the mullah's promise to drive the U.S. from the region, the president is undeterred. Obama, and Biden, the era of appeasement and trying to bribe dictators, pretty please like us if we give you $150 billion please -- there's not going to be appeasement. Those days are done, no bribery and we no longer supply billions in cash to the world's number one state-sponsored terror that says death to America and wants to wipe Israel off the map. The president will never allow them to have a nuclear weapon. We can't risk that with that insane ideology of the mullahs running Iran. And unlike Obama and Biden, the United States is not going to cut and run just because Iran would like to try to intimidate us. There will be a price to pay if they want an escalation. Take a look."

He got criticized for sitting down -- saying, I will sit down with Kim Jong-un, and Putin and all these bad actors. I'm not going to bribe you, we'll talk. Let's see if we can talk. And we're not going to have boots on the ground. We're not going to have protracted conflicts. I'll beat you like we beat the caliphate in Syria. He won't allow the world's most hostile regime to cross the red line. That is to attack the sovereignty and kill Americans. Unfortunately, Iran is ruled by what is a reckless, evil, irresponsible, radical dictatorship, a theocracy. On Tuesday, according to our intelligence, they downed a passenger plane with a Russian-made antiaircraft missile, killing 176 human souls on board, including dozens of Canadians, Ukrainians and Iranians. Well, now, new video has emerged showing the plane getting struck with what looks like, yep, some kind of missile before falling out of the sky. But the rogue regime in Iran, they are still denying that the plane was hit with the missile, claiming the U.S. is spreading lies about the crash. According to reports, Iranian bulldozers have already been seeing clearing the debris before investigators actually arrived and Tehran is currently refusing to turn over the plane's black boxes. Meanwhile in the Arabian Gulf, earlier today, a Russian warship came within feet of ramming a U.S. destroyer. As I have said many times on this program, the government of Iran, the Russian regime are -- these are hostile regimes. Russia is ruled by a hostile actor. We know his name, Vladimir Putin. That must be detoured and countered whenever possible. Here now with more, our own Benjamin Hall. Benjamin, what's the latest?"

      "utterance": "Well, Sean, remember that Russia is always very keen to remind the world that it plays a role in the Middle East. And we have seen these kind of provocations before, particularly when they're not in the headlines. Well, today was a Russian spy ship that aggressively approached a U.S. destroyer in the North Arabian Sea. It swung dangerously behind the USS Farragut, coming as close as 60 yards, only turning away after five warning sirens signaled a collision. The USS Farragut had significant backup, though. It was on routine operations as part of the powerful Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier strike group. After around 10 to 15 minutes, the aggressive Russian ship pulled away. President Putin has been active in the Middle East all week, though it has gone under the radar. He's visited allies Assad in Syria, Erdogan in Turkey. He's held naval drills with other allies, the Iranians and the Chinese. He has even offered to mediate between Iran and the U.S. It does seem as if Putin doesn't want to be left out of the current tensions. He is trying to show that he has a role to play in the Middle East and don't forget, as you pointed out, that was a Russian missile which brought down that Ukrainian plane -- Sean."

You documented it since he came down the golden escalator how they have targeted, how they have targeted his family. Now, they are trying to impeach him after failing on Mueller. So, like he's now used to this, you know, minute-by-minute tussle. And on the Soleimani thing, especially, he's like, the guy was going to take out major U.S. installations. And he doesn't think it's his obligation to share every minute detail of that with the -- with the Hill. And he said -- which is key -- that, you know what, it might not trust the Hill, given a lot of the leaks that have occurred, given what he thinks is essentially unfair and fraudulent dealings on some of these other investigations. So, when you try to impeach a successful president on bogus grounds, it has a spillover effect on the trust issue on other issues."

The president took a lot, Laura, going in here. Two drones were shut down. We had literally Straits of Hormuz, they're pirating tankers to impact the free flow of oil at market prices and a hit on Saudi Arabia unprovoked. But the red line was killing Americans. Now he's given the Iranians an out. So it seems like he really -- he doesn't want conflict of war but he's ready to act and is not willing to bribe. That's the Trump doctrine."

He didn't want to do that. And I think he wanted to send a message, you do this and you're going to pay a big price, don't push it. And I think the Iranians know that despite all their bluster. But I don't know, I mean, you spent so much time with the president, Sean, I think there are very few individuals -- and he did say this about himself -- could withstand the daily onslaught that he's had to withstand and take and produce the results that you just ticked off on trade and judges and everything else.

Joining us now, former White House press secretary, FOX News contributor, Sarah Sanders, Michael Best Law president, former GOP chairman, Reince Priebus. Reince, you've got to get back in the game. I told this to Mark Meadows. I think we need you back in the game. I'm appointing you something, I don't know what. But, look, you watch what they are doing to the president. Now we're going to have the Schiff show, sham show impeachment show, that will end very quickly, expeditiously next week, Sarah. And -- but this has been every single day. We have our montage. We run it all the time, impeachment two days after he's elected. Impeachment through 2017, '18 and '19. Now, they impeached him over nothing because they didn't get what they wanted from Mueller. But the American people speak out in 298 days. How does this play out?"

We know it's been a huge waste of time, a huge waste of taxpayer dollars and frankly, it hasn't played well for Democrats. We saw them push every single day, telling us how urgent it was to get impeachment done. And now, all of a sudden, we have all the time in the world to sit back and wait while Nancy Pelosi gets controlled more and more by the far left wing of her party and refuses to send the papers to the Senate. It's been a sham from day one. It's going to be wiped away in the Senate. And I think it's gong to be a great day to watch the president get fully vindicated in the Senate and then get to stand in front of Nancy Pelosi and all of her crazy colleagues as he delivers a beautiful and amazing State of the Union and talks about all the successes of his last three years as president.

The America's freedom, you know, $94 trillion and 10-year New Green Deal, the $52 trillion Medicare-for-All deal, we can afford any of this. But and I always want to play like you are behind a touchdown, no timeouts, you're down by six, and you need the touchdown and the extra point, in two minutes, doing the two minute drill.

I remember days on the plane and I'm sure Sarah does too, where the president opened up \"The New York Times\" and not just find one bad story on the page, but every day, some days, every single story on the front page was bad. Everyone said he can't win. He's -- you're going to be wasting your time. You're wasting your money at the RNC. And obviously, on election night, President Trump wins the presidency and shocks the world. So, back to the Hunter Biden issue though. You know, I think the Republicans might want to consider getting very bold about this, exert executive privilege over John Bolton, exert executive privilege over Mick Mulvaney, call in Hunter Biden and find out what the truth is, because the center of the Democrats' case is that, you know, was it reasonable for the president to ask about -- about Biden?

And when that didn't happen, of course, donations fell off the cliff. Look at this, new Clinton emails just obtained by our friends at Judicial Watch provide even more examples of her using her unsecured, nongovernment email to transmit yet again classified information. That will put us in jail. Where's the accountability? Where's the equal justice and application of our laws? And also just breaking tonight, FBI Director Wray submitted a declaration of the FISA court saying the FBI is going to implement all of the inspector general's recommendations to improve the accuracy of FISA applications. Meaning, nothing like the Steele dossier should ever be in a FISA application again. With all due respect, Director Wray, that's not enough. Sorry, the premeditated fraud on the FISA court to spy on a candidate and a transition team and a president, I'd like to see a little more outrage from you. This is the world's premiere, number one law enforcement agency, 99 percent of FBI guys are the best in the world. Really? That's all you -- that's your reaction? Not enough for me. Author of the bestseller \"Witch Hunt\", we are joined by FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and FOX News contributor Sara Carter, and Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton.

We were in court three weeks ago. They had six lawyers for the Justice Department and State Department. They are still coordinating with the Clinton lawyers to oppose Judicial Watch's efforts to get answers. And the FBI at the same time the Justice Department is leaking and they don't want to do anything on Hillary Clinton, the FBI is still finding, as you point out, more Clinton emails. On top of that, we have new Page-Strzok emails.

Did Huber ever interview anyone? Did he interview, for example, William Campbell, the whistle-blower that connected Hillary Clinton to the Russians and the takeover of American uranium assets. I just got off of the phone with Campbell's lawyer -- no, Huber never bothered to interview the whistle-blower. Look, the Clintons became enormously wealthy through quid pro quo arrangements that were funneled through their foundation. The worst of which was $145 million paid by uranium at the same time that Clinton CFIUS committee allowed the sale of those uranium assets to go through. She all but hung a \"for sale\" sign on the office door and became wealthy by influence access peddling and other actions of corruption."

This was basically FBI, senior FBI officials just trampling all over the constitution and people's civil liberties. This is about the FBI falsifying documentation to spy on an American. So, this is -- this is outrageous that this is all he has to say. I mean, it has to be more than that. And I certainly hope -- John Huber, Sean, his entire investigation was a sham. It was feckless, he didn't interview anyone, just as Gregg stated and as Tom discovered, there is a two-tiered justice system and something has to be done. These people tried to unseat a duly elected president. They were sending disinformation out on people. They were destroying people's lives. And people like Lieutenant General Michael Flynn are now facing a sentencing date while all of these people who are known liars are walking around free, getting book deals and making a lot of money.
