At least three dozen Memphis police officers were hurt, though all of the injuries are minor. City officials then began posting on social media, the Memphis mayor saying, quote, \"Let me be clear. The aggression shown towards our officers and deputies tonight was unwarranted.\" The police chief added, quote, \"We will not allow destruction of property, we will not allow acts of vandalism to occur.\" But county commissioner Tammy Sawyer who is running for mayor said, quote, \"Don't judge Frayser without asking a community how it feels to mourn their youth over and over again.\" And those who knew Brandon Webber doubted the marshals claim that he was a wanted felon.

As you can tell between my tenure and Sarah's, that's not always the most traditional way. And he's going to want to make sure that the chemistry is there between whoever he chooses.

But whether or not she takes a little time in the private sector, I would imagine that public service continues to be something that she will be a part of. She is enjoyed being a part of watching her father go up as lieutenant governor and then governor. She served in the White House.

That when you look at national head-to-head, they can be very misleading at this stage of the game. Nonetheless, there were a lot of polls out there that show that the president is in a competitive race. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Now let's talk about Quinnipiac. They had Clinton winning Florida by two. She lost Florida to President Trump. They had Clinton winning North Carolina by two, she lost to President Trump by four. They had Clinton winning by six in Pennsylvania, President Trump won Pennsylvania. I don't put stock in Quinnipiac. Where I put stock is in campaign manager Brad Parscale, a data guru. You just heard President Trump in that clip say call Brad. There is one person who knew President Trump was going to win. It was Brad Parscale because of his data operation, and our internal polling at the campaign shows again, they define, Democrat, President Trump wins in all 17 swing states.

There have been plenty of other public polls in Michigan, the Detroit News, had Biden up by 11. In North Carolina, a local poll had Biden up there. And even the Fox poll had Biden beating Trump by 11. So, let's take Quinnipiac out of this discussion.

Jim, when you look at, you know, all of these different polls that were just mentioned, is there any -- is there any message that you think that the campaign should pay attention to in them?

And if you remember what was going on, you had memos that were leaked last time by the campaign manager of Hillary Clinton, was working with the media to rig polls. And that's the same nonsense that's going on right now. The truth of the matter is many of these polls that are under sampling Republicans and that's why you are getting the numbers that you are getting. For instance, that Texas poll? It was only plus four Republican. In your typical Texas election, and I was polling there last time for the attorney general, and he won by double digits. Republicans outnumbered Democrats by over 12 points down there. And that's not was what the Quinnipiac poll was reflecting there. And we saw, again, Kayleigh gave you some great examples. Right before election day in Florida last time they had both Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis losing seven points down in Florida. We all know what happened on election day."

I mean, it does, it raises an interesting question because one of the things that has been talked about and I know that, you know, perhaps some of you, Richard might disagree with this point, do people who are Trump voters necessarily answer polls. And I wonder in the environment that we live in where people are so concerned about privacy on social media and all of that, do people respond to these questions? I mean, how difficult is it to get a very good sample? Kayleigh? And then I want to get Richard's response to that."

I spoke with an internal pollster of ours who said he went out in the aftermath of the election, to many of these states and found the polls were off by about 10 to 12 percent of Trump voters who just wouldn't speak to a pollster. I just got to say I find it laughable for Richard to act as if he knows what our internal polls say, to have reporters say the president is being mistrustful when they haven't seen the polls. I spent an hour and a half going through the polls. So is Brad. So as others. But it's laughable for people to concoct to negative news cycle based on a polling they haven't seen, that very few, small handful, I can name them have actually --"

He was on the House intelligence committee. They wanted a cloud over this presidency, and they got one.

I am, Martha, a 100 percent confident and hopeful that this president and any other president would call the intelligence community and law enforcement if a foreign adversary would try to impact our election. I am confident that President Trump said that as much to make the Swalwell's and the Castro's of the world upset. As for any other reason, but the flip side of that is when you do pick up the phone and call, you have to have confidence in who is on the other end of the line. Let's assume he called in June of 2016. Who would he have gotten? Jim Comey. Someone who spent the last two years saying impeachment is too good for the president? John Brennan, is that who he is supposed to call? A guy that thinks he was treasonous and blown from the dust pin of history. Well, lead the case agent, Peter Strzok. So, the FBI also has an obligation to be so apolitical and so objective that nobody has any qualms calling them. I feel that way about the FBI. But look, Brennan is still talking about the president, Comey still talking about the president. So, I'm not sure which one of them people expected him to call in 2016."

The embattled lawyer being sued by a paraplegic former client who says Avenatti secured a $4 million settlement on his behalf and then pocketed the cash. According to him, the former client Geoffrey Johnson has now hired a new attorney to recoup the money, plus, he says, punitive damages."

      "utterance": "We have a situation where Mr. Avenatti has acted so despicably, it's beyond words. And I am here to do my very best to help Mr. Johnson recover that money from Mr. Avenatti and for anybody else who acted in concert to deprive Mr. Johnson of his funds."

      "utterance": "Avenatti says in a statement \"It is unfortunate that he is being used by his Republican Trump supporter lawyer and others as part of a pile on publicity stunt to smear me. In separate cases, Avenatti faces charges of wire fraud, bank fraud, extortion, and claims that he misappropriated $300,000 of funds from Stormy Daniels. Also breaking tonight, the city of Memphis is on edge after a night of violent clashes. The chaos erupted after a 20-year-old black man was fatally shot by authorities during a confrontation yesterday. Now the Memphis Police Department confirming a short time ago, a total of 36 officers suffered injuries due to bricks, and rocks that were thrown at them. Some were even spit on. And tonight, the authorities are urging the people of that city to stay calm. Trace Gallagher is in our West Coast newsroom with the story tonight. Trace?"

      "utterance": "Martha, at the time of the shooting, U.S. marshals were trying to arrest 20-year-old Brandon Webber on multiple felony warrants including aggravated assault and armed robbery. The marshals were in the north Memphis neighborhood of Frayser and say Webber, who is black, got into his car, refused to stop and rammed his vehicle into the marshal's vehicle multiple times. Officers then claim Webber got out of his car with a weapon and that's when they open fired, killing him. News of Webber's death spread quickly as did a neighborhood protest where residents turned their anger toward Memphis police throwing rocks and other debris at officers, tearing down a brick wall, and also vandalizing both squad cars and the fire department. At least three dozen Memphis police officers were hurt, though all of the injuries are minor. City officials then began posting on social media, the Memphis mayor saying, quote, \"Let me be clear. The aggression shown towards our officers and deputies tonight was unwarranted.\" The police chief added, quote, \"We will not allow destruction of property, we will not allow acts of vandalism to occur.\" But county commissioner Tammy Sawyer who is running for mayor said, quote, \"Don't judge Frayser without asking a community how it feels to mourn their youth over and over again.\" And those who knew Brandon Webber doubted the marshals claim that he was a wanted felon. Watch."

The stolen car is the same vehicle Webber used to ram the marshals. A local pastor says that Frayser, Tennessee being portrayed in the national media is not a representation of the true Frayser.
