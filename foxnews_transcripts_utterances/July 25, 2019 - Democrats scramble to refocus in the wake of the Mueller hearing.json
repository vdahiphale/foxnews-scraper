      "sentences": "Thanks so much, Sean. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. 24 hours after Mueller's meltdown, what are the big takeaways from this mess and will anyone be held accountable as the President referenced? Joe Digenova, John Yoo and Former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker will weigh in. Plus Frank Evans will reveal what the Democrat's reactions to yesterday's hearing tells us about their chances in 2020. And later Ilhan Omar seems to have something against white men. A newly on earth video gives us a disturbing insight into her warped mind-set. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And finally, do you like to bathe in toilet water, really?

That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” The fallout from that calamitous Mueller testimony continue to reverberate today and the questions keep mounting. How is a man who's obviously so detached from key aspects of the case ever allowed to run the investigation? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why didn't they end the investigation when they realized there was no collusion or conspiracy to throw the election? How could Mueller not have known anything about Fusion GPS? And why wasn't the FISA court fully informed about the origins of the dossier? How did Trump hating partisans manage to become key players on Mueller's team? Why do elites always seem to get away with the abuse of power when conservatives like Trump are dragged through the mud for something he didn't even do? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, as to the last question, the elites in both parties, let's face it, have a lot to answer for. And it's up to us to hold them accountable. This kind of thing doesn't happen ever again to any President or frankly any American citizen. So that no one is subjected to defamation or saddled with massive legal bills, or has his or her entire life's work. And in this case, his entire presidency, put in jeopardy. The fact is the so-called elites have been failing us for decades. And Trump, remember, called them all out in 2016. I think they ever forgave him. Elites have been wrong about major history authoring issues. Under Former Federal Chair Alan Greenspan, they even called him the maestro. He presided over the housing bubble and along with Bill Clinton he thought it was just peachy to allow China into the World Trade Organization. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But each of us have been told by our Attorneys that if we go out here and defend the President and talk about how this whole thing is a complete travesty, that these House Democrats are halls in front of hearings and cost us each 20000- $20,000, $30,000 more per hearing. I'm just not afraid of it any more. I'm so angry about this. I think everyone should know that Robert Mueller is a new admiral Stockdale and these hearings will be in the lead of his obituary just like Stockdale's. Even though Stockdale was a hero, all we remember him for is for making an embarrassing performance at that debate.",

      "utterance": "Thanks so much, Sean. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. 24 hours after Mueller's meltdown, what are the big takeaways from this mess and will anyone be held accountable as the President referenced? Joe Digenova, John Yoo and Former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker will weigh in. Plus Frank Evans will reveal what the Democrat's reactions to yesterday's hearing tells us about their chances in 2020. And later Ilhan Omar seems to have something against white men. A newly on earth video gives us a disturbing insight into her warped mind-set. And finally, do you like to bathe in toilet water, really? If not you may think twice before you take a dip at certain popular beaches across American Dr. Drew is here with all the literally sickening details. But first, time for accountability. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” The fallout from that calamitous Mueller testimony continue to reverberate today and the questions keep mounting. How is a man who's obviously so detached from key aspects of the case ever allowed to run the investigation? Why didn't they end the investigation when they realized there was no collusion or conspiracy to throw the election? How could Mueller not have known anything about Fusion GPS? And why wasn't the FISA court fully informed about the origins of the dossier? How did Trump hating partisans manage to become key players on Mueller's team? Why do elites always seem to get away with the abuse of power when conservatives like Trump are dragged through the mud for something he didn't even do? Well, as to the last question, the elites in both parties, let's face it, have a lot to answer for. And it's up to us to hold them accountable. This kind of thing doesn't happen ever again to any President or frankly any American citizen. So that no one is subjected to defamation or saddled with massive legal bills, or has his or her entire life's work. And in this case, his entire presidency, put in jeopardy. The fact is the so-called elites have been failing us for decades. And Trump, remember, called them all out in 2016. I think they ever forgave him. Elites have been wrong about major history authoring issues. Under Former Federal Chair Alan Greenspan, they even called him the maestro. He presided over the housing bubble and along with Bill Clinton he thought it was just peachy to allow China into the World Trade Organization."

In this situation, with the stakes so high, this was of paramount importance. By the way, each lawyer on Mueller's team had an affirmative legal obligation under the ethics rules to consider their own Anti-Trump bias. And decline the offer to work on the Russian collusion investigation given their past connections to the Democrats. My friends, Republicans must hold them accountable and get real answers as to why this team was allowed to operate outside the code of professional responsibility that all of us Attorneys are subject to. Heaven forbid, this travesty could happen again. And that's THE ANGLE. So what's next for these elites? Tonight, we offer a path forward for holding them accountable. Joining us now U.S. Attorney Joe Digenova and Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo. Joe, what's the best course of action here? Should Lindsey Graham hold hearings on Capitol Hill as Chair of the Judiciary Committee and bring the real authors of this report before the Committee? Weissmann and Rhee and find out why this recusal was not done and whether any conflict check was done in this case?"

      "speaker": "JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. It won't do any good to file complaints with bars because bars are not going to do anything about these people. Lindsey Graham has a wonderful opportunity before the final report from Horowitz comes out and John Durham has finished his work as an interim accountability staff, he should hold a hearing, he should have Weissmann, he should have Rhee he should even invite Mueller to testify about why he didn't engage with these people, clear conflicts of interest. They should never have been on this case, should have absolutely been precluded from becoming involved in these cases and nothing was involved about it. The reason is Weissmann went about this from the very beginning, before he was ever appointed. He told Mueller I want to be on this, I want to be the one you used. Mueller gave him the job. Mueller didn't even care whether or not he had conflicts. Mueller has been absolutely absinthe, a wall--"

Obtaining advice and approval on ethics related matters an employee should contact his or her designated ethics officials for advice or approval when the employee is assigned in a matter in which his or her official actions may affect the employee's own financial interest or the interest of any person or entity whose interests are imputed to the employee. There is another provision about if any question arises as to your impartiality, which is the operative one in this case then you must go for approval to the ethics official. We have no record of their having been given any approval from the ethics officials at DOJ."

    {
      "speaker": "JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Right. As a Former Justice Department Attorney, as Joe was, you are supposed to take it on yourself to ask yourself, can I be impartial? It's not even whether I can be impartial, it's also would anyone knowing about my work, my past clients or my personal friends or political contacts, would anyone on the outside question the impartiality of the Justice Department if I participated? You are supposed to report that. A good Attorney will do that themselves. They do not need to be prodded or attacked or questioned by someone on the outside. And as you say it doesn't look like anybody brought that to anyone's attention. You would think that if you are representing the Clinton Foundation or your personal friends were working for the Clinton campaign and you are working on an investigation where the origins of the very facts of the investigation seem to have been fed into the Justice Department by the Clinton campaign, that's a perfect example of when you should be reusing yourself."

      "speaker": "DIGENOVA",

He did have conflict of interest and in fact he got waivers for them. After he was appointed! So he knew that you had to deal with conflicts and he never required Weissmann or Rhee or anybody else to deal with their conflicts. This is a major, major ethical flaw in everything that he gets. By the way, the investigation was taken from day one by all of these biased people. It's a joke."

As I think you go to Attorney General Barr. These people worked at the Justice Department, they abused the procedures, they did not report these ethical problems, so the Attorney General of the Justice Department could perhaps launch an investigation and see if there were any laws broken."

And my next guest, hey boy, took a lot of criticism for his temporary role in overseeing the Mueller investigation including chargers that he mishandled it."

And I think all you have to do is look at part two of the report to see exactly how that lack of impartiality manifests.

I realized that our country is probably found its end if this is what we're talking about is the Department of Justice. And now Laura, I'm just mad. I'm really angry because they clearly chose Robert Mueller because of his outstanding reputation, but still knowing that he really didn't have it all together anymore. They knew if they installed him as Special Counsel the Hillary loving lawyers there could ripped each of us apart limb from limb while Robert Mueller was trying to program the cloth on the my microwave in the break room. This thing is really got me really angry. All of us should be up in arms but you know, I've talked to survivor after survivor who was just dying to come out and say something about this right now. But each of us have been told by our Attorneys that if we go out here and defend the President and talk about how this whole thing is a complete travesty, that these House Democrats are halls in front of hearings and cost us each 20000- $20,000, $30,000 more per hearing. I'm just not afraid of it any more. I'm so angry about this.

My question to you is when did liberals become so OK with a restriction approach to language, to dress, to free speech, whether it's speech codes on college campuses, I dealt with that back in the days of Dartmouth, or what we are seeing with some of the more violent in Antifa?

There is an organization called Heal the Bay that keeps very close tabs on our water safety along the southern beaches in southern California from Orange County to Ventura. And since the rains this last winter, they've been giving us C's to F's. And F means completely overrun with fecal bacteria, unsafe amounts of fecal bacteria. What comes with that, other things like syringes and Hepatitis A and other infectious diseases. Now, I spoke to a representative at Heal the Bay. His explanation was all the runoffs from the fires. There were the fires that cost about two dozen homes to get disconnected from the sewage treatment plant. Laura, there are 60,000 people defecating directly into our gutters every day, urinating, defecating, bleeding. There sewage is going directly into the ocean. We've had a massive die off of mammals in the spring. And for goodness sakes, if a city the size of Pasadena suddenly became disconnected from our sewage treatment plant, where do you think the environmentalists would be on that?

But this was a consistent contamination of our water, and why shouldn't it be, 60,000 maybe as many as 80,000 people are contributing directly into the L.A. River and the Santa Ana River basin.

A terrible problem with raw sewage from Mexico, floats up to the San Diego beaches. And that's been a persistent problem for a long, long time. And I guess we just not doing anything about that either. Dr. Drew, you and I, you mentioned the homeless crisis in California, you focused on it and as have we. And this YouTube star named Fleccas Talks, he hit skid row just to show how horrifying this situation has become."

And when it comes to the problem these people face, a third or so are mentally ill, another third have substance abuse problems or are addicted to something, and the other third are kind of off just living off the grid and kind of grifting. Dr. Drew, the pictures. This is America. We have sanctuary policies in California that cost the state a lot. Your thoughts really quick?"

The sanctuary city, people are beginning to wake up to the fact that we are providing unlimited health care and jobs -- and by the way, these 800,000 undocumented immigrants we welcome into our sanctuary cities all found a place to live. So the city focuses on the idea that what you are seeing in this video is a housing problem. No, this is a mental health problem. This is a law problem. The cops cannot enforce the laws. We cannot bring these people to the health care they need, and they're drying in the street at inhuman numbers. And the question is, how many must die? That's what we asked the ACLU and the other attorneys that keep suing the city to prevent them from doing anything. Now, what you are seeing here, what you are seeing there is considered those people's quote, \"belongings,\" and law enforcement cannot touch them. They cannot touch anything. It is proliferating to the point that literally traffic is getting blocked by debris and feces and garbage. Again, as I've told you before, rats have overtaken the city. It's not consistent with civilization. How many people must die before we change direction is the question I keep asking everybody that's involved in this."
