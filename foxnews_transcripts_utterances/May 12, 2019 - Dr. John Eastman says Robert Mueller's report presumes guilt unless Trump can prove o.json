What the King of England was doing to the colonist was issuing general warrants that meant that the King's tariff officers could go not where they suspected a crime, but where they had an individual that they wanted to investigate to see if any crime had been committed. And one of the reasons we have a Fourth Amendment is to prevent the notion of general warrant that we target an individual we don't like and then turn his world upside down until we can try and find some evidence of a crime. What we see happening here with the investigation, with the subpoenas, let's go through the financial records for 10 years, if that doesn't produce anything, let's go back 20 years. If that produce anything, let's go back. We know this guy must have done some crime otherwise he couldn't have gotten elected, so let's just scour the Earth until we find it.

The Emoluments Clause basically says, \"Look, you're a President or a senior official in the administration in the government, you're not allowed to have foreign titles or foreign appointment,\" okay, great, and \"You're not allowed to receive emoluments,\" payments and so forth from foreign governments. And so they say, well, here we have a President, and he own a lot of things, a lot of real estates. But this hotel in Washington D.C., in particular, a beautiful hotel, I recommend it to anybody who would like to go here -- the Trump Hotel.

And in fact, the normal Justice Department practice is to not let anything beyond their go out because the Justice Department speaks against individuals by way of its indicting documents not by leaks to the press, not by innuendo and reports that don't lead to indictments because people's reputations are at stake as well."

The only job is to decide if there's enough evidence to bring about an indictment with a likelihood of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. We presume innocence unless we can presume otherwise.

It's Arthur Andersen petitioner versus United States. At the District Court level, Arthur Andersen lost, at the Circuit Court level, the Fifth Circuit, they lost. What did they lose? They recused of obstruction, of destroying documents, spying among others. Andrew Weissmann, the deputy to Mr. Mueller and he led this effort. Arthur Andersen went broke, 80,000 people lost their jobs and the Supreme Court reversed the law of courts in a nine to zero opinion. What is this? Six or seven or eight pages long?

The Special Prosecutor, the Department of Justice itself, the Attorney General have no powers under our Constitution that aren't derived from the President. The notion that the President can't determine the course of an investigation is the most basic violation of separation of state. We have a unitary executive. The entire Executive Branch is headed by one guy and the only constitutional check on that is through an impeachment power, not through statutes and not through regulations internal to the Department of Justice because the President has the authority to change those whenever he wants.

And on a high profile investigation like that, even if there's not actual conflicts, you want Caesar's wife to be pure. You want them not even to be the appearance of conflict of interest, and what we've seen is the media, the e-mail exchanges between people on Mueller's team who were bent on getting this particular President, no matter what, that just stinks of an appearance of conflict of interest, if not an actual conflict of interest. And what we're looking for here is -- it was an investigation, if there was going to be one at all and I don't there should've been, we will get to that in a minute, that is above reproach so that the country can come back around on what's become a real political divide and quite frankly, threatening our ability to govern ourselves."

The same people who are attacking this President saying he is violating the Constitution, although, for the life of me, I can't figure out how, that he wants to be a dictator. For the life me, I can't figure out how. I mean, he is not FDR after all. I look at this and then I say to myself, but look at how they elements of it. Let's take the Electoral College, there would be no country but for the compromise on the Electoral College. There would be no United States Senate if we just had a popular vote like a Parliament or something of that sort. And the Bill of Rights, there probably would be no Bill of Rights because the Bill of Rights protects the individual rights, but if we can vote, I mean, they don't have the Bill of Rights in the U.K. or most of these parliamentary systems.

And they like that because it is kind of an elite progressive move in the courts to redefine the Constitution that then becomes the Constitution in their view. And the reason that was important for this progressive movement, this anti-American progressive movement was the Constitution's constraints on government serve to limit the good that they thought they could do with government. And therefore, you had to get rid of the constraints which means you had to get rid of the Constitution structure, the notion of enumerated powers that the Federal government can only exercise those powers that are delegated to it. All of these structural constraints stood in the way of the best and the brightest experts doing the right thing and the political science was going to solve all problems, create utopias for us if we would just get these constraints on government out of the way.

So the actual language of the Constitution is discarded in order to advance a progressive agenda, a progressive idea on a particular issue, and that's what we've had courts doing for way too long. President Trump did something very bold in his campaign. He announced the kind of people that he would be picking for Supreme Court vacancies or the lower courts. And I think that issue, more than any other is what won him the election because people quite frankly are tired of their lives and basic policy decisions being handled and made by unelected judges. I mean, it goes back to Lincoln. You know, in his very first Inaugural Address, he was confronted with Dred Scott, you remember, he said, \"You can't do anything about the slavery question.

Second, what they're doing amounts to something that our own Declaration of Independence had accused the King of doing which is issuing general warrants. When you suspect that a crime has occurred, we go to the judge and we ask for a warrant to inspect certain things that we think will help us prove the crime. What the King of England was doing to the colonist was issuing general warrants that meant that the King's tariff officers could go not where they suspected a crime, but where they had an individual that they wanted to investigate to see if any crime had been committed. And one of the reasons we have a Fourth Amendment is to prevent the notion of general warrant that we target an individual we don't like and then turn his world upside down until we can try and find some evidence of a crime. What we see happening here with the investigation, with the subpoenas, let's go through the financial records for 10 years, if that doesn't produce anything, let's go back 20 years. If that produce anything, let's go back. We know this guy must have done some crime otherwise he couldn't have gotten elected, so let's just scour the Earth until we find it.

      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "No, it's blatantly unconstitutional -- it's totally unconstitutional. The Supreme Court decided this issue a long time ago, back in the early 1800s on a Member of Congress when a state tried to impose an additional restriction on its members and they said their Constitution sets out the requirements for Federal office and the states can't add to those requirements. Well, saying somebody has to disclose their tax return is adding a requirement to running for Federal office in the states have no power to do that."

      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Professor Eastman, I want to tackle what unfortunately is one of the most boring issues in America, but the left keep bringing it up -- the Emoluments Clause. I have to tell, you and I have been around the Constitution for many, many decades and I've never heard it really brought up in the way it's being brought up today as they scour the Constitution looking for things to destroy. The Emoluments Clause basically says, \"Look, you're a President or a senior official in the administration in the government, you're not allowed to have foreign titles or foreign appointment,\" okay, great, and \"You're not allowed to receive emoluments,\" payments and so forth from foreign governments. And so they say, well, here we have a President, and he own a lot of things, a lot of real estates. But this hotel in Washington D.C., in particular, a beautiful hotel, I recommend it to anybody who would like to go here -- the Trump Hotel. When these foreign heads of state and other diplomats stay at that hotel and pay for the hotel rooms and pay for their meals, that is an unconstitutional benefit to the President of the United States, is that right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "There is so far a single court that has said that's right and it's laughable. I mean, look, if that were the case, then President Obama accepting the Noble Peace Prize would have been an unconstitutional emolument. Any President that owns stock in any foreign corporation that had ties to a foreign government when that stock prices goes up because of some action of the foreign government, that would be an unconstitutional emolument, that's never the way we've looked at it through 200 years of our history."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "And yet, we have a judge, I believe he is in Maryland, and maybe it is D.C. who has ruled that Maryland and Washington, D.C. has standing to bring the suit. And I am thinking, \"How the hell do they have standing?\" Because they get tax proceeds from the hotel. So in other words, they get a benefit from the hotel so they could sue under the Emoluments Clause that they shouldn't get a benefit from the hotel?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Is this not the problem when you have a judiciary that has become in many respects, despite what the Chief Justice said so thoroughly activist and partisan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I want to segue back to the travel ban cases because something very similar happened here. The judges that blocked President Trump's Executive Order on the travel ban, which was not a ban, it was a temporary suspension didn't even cite the statute that clearly gave him the authority to do what he had done and that had been used by every President from Jimmy Carter forward and it was only this President that somehow run afoul of it. These judges have become part of a resistance movement to undo the results of the 2016 election and it really is a travesty. I think that's a greater threat to our constitutional system and the rule of law than any of these particular incidents, the embracing of the judiciary of this resistance movement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Didn't we also have a judge who said that when Obama put in place certain environmental regulations through Executive Order that this President can't reverse them through Executive Order? Haven't they also said -- some of these judges -- that DACA was put in place basically that was written out of the White House, a piece of legislation that was adopted through Executive Order that this President can't reverse that? So a President can't reverse the executive decisions of the President who preceded him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "Decisions that were themselves unconstitutional. My favorite is the DACA and DAPA case, the immigration deferred action. President Obama, after 22 different times saying he had no legal authority to do it went ahead and did it anyway, or rather his Secretary of Homeland Security did it with a memo, not even an Executive Order. It was held to be unconstitutional because it didn't go through regular requirements for adding a new regulation. The same Janet Napolitano who did that illegal act then sued Trump for reversing it without going through the notice and comment process that she hadn't gone through. I mean, it was laughable and yet you get a judge that says, Napolitano's suit wins, Trump has to stop the revocation of this illegal action. It is really unbelievable."

They rejected some like maladministration was considered to a lower bar. Treason, bribery, high crimes, misdemeanors, I keep hearing it said, \"Well, it's a political act. It's a political act.\" It's whatever the House of Representatives said. Is that the way it's supposed to work?"
    },

High crimes and misdemeanors were not the ordinary crime, high crimes and misdemeanors was a term of art of fundamental abuse of the office that would undermine the legitimacy of government itself. Those were the kind of things that we're talking about. They did not want a King who was above the law, who could do whatever he wanted."

His immediate predecessor, you know, blew through the lines on executive power and constitutional authority on numerous occasions and they could have said, we are going to take what Obama did as precedent and we're going to do the same thing in the other direction, but they haven't done that."
