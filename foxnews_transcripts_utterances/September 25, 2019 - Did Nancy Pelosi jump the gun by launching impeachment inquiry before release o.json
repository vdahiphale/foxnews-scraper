You look at it, it's a phone call in front of witnesses where one guy is asking another guy about something that happened in the past that you can look into, which I think is in his job description to ask about corruption.

No, you arrived at this conclusion three years ago. You've been pounding it into the ground ever since. The media cites a growing clamor, right? A growing clamor for impeachment. They are the growing clamor for the last three years since Trump was election. They act like they're a model of restraint that this was the last straw.

The media expects you, the viewer, to have a heart attack every freaking week. Every time they come up with a new bombshell, they want you to rife in terror. But our viewers, and the people at home, and the voters, know better than this. There's a disconnect between the way America is and the way the media portrays it, right? Americans are starting jobs. There's low unemployment. They've got swollen IRA's. They're spending their money. But the Dems, they can't profit off that. The media can't profit off that. So they have to paint an apocalypse. The viewers should be outraged that they're putting through an unhealthy emotional rollercoaster every single day. But I know that they get it. They've always been way ahead of us on this stuff. They see it for what it is. It's not left versus right. It's not conservative versus liberal. It's the media versus you.

Both the president and President Zelensky, earlier today, saying that there was no pressure put on the call. But, clearly, the president did have a couple of asks, one, in which he characterized as being a favor. He asked Zelensky to look into this whole idea of crowd strike and alleged interference in the 2016 election on behalf of Hillary Clinton by elements in the Ukraine. And then the other one, separate to that, which wasn't characterized as a favor to look into Joe Biden. The president also suggesting that if Democrats want a transcript of the first conversation that he had with Zelensky after he won the presidency they are welcomed to that as well. And the president also talked about transparency in terms of this whistleblower complaint. I'm told that the complaint is on Capitol Hill, and the question is whether or not the president will actually seek to have that declassified and made public.

He beat back spy gate, the Russia hoax, he exposed Hillary, all of her corruption, and now he's beginning to expose the Biden family corruption in Ukraine, and in China, and they want to impeach him for exposing Biden's corruption. This is what's going on. The left says they don't believe what Biden did, abusing his power, abusing taxpayer money, and his son enriching himself is a crime. They think it's a crime for Trump to say, hey, can you look into that? Because Donald Trump is the chief executive of the executive branch of this country, and he is in charge of executing the laws. So, if some American citizen is committing potential crimes in the United States, or overseas, he has the right to say, hey, guys, can you look into it? But the Democrats are saying no, no, no, no, no. Joe Biden and his family, they're above the law. Joe Biden can't be looked into by this current administration, and he can't be look into by the Ukraine administration. So, Joe Biden, basically, gets a free pass. He can run around and commit all sorts of crimes because he's just above the law. And to say that this administration can't enlist an ally to look into potential corruption of a political opponent? Hmm, isn't that exactly what the last administration did? The last administration enlisted multiple allies, including Ukraine, to look into Trump and all of his people on no basis, with no evidence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yet, this time the evidence is right in front of us. We have Joe Biden on tape and we have his son's receipts. So, at this point, the Democrats are accusing Trump of crimes they committed and this is in order to get out in front of the Durham investigation, and the Bill Barr investigation. It's an admission they can't beat Trump at the ballot box.

Another example of the media and the Dems fashioning the worst of things out of the best of times, all to avenge an emotional loss. You want some examples. Well, as America leads the way in climate with cleaner energy, the Left tells their kids, we have a decade to live. As race relations improved from the mass demonstrations of five years ago. The media sees racism in every nook. As men and women reach equality in all facets, the media questions whether gender is just a fantasy. And as women and minorities gain more employment than ever, the guy running the show is called a bigoted sexist. A guy called Trump, a guy who wakes up every morning in that candy store called America wondering what we can get out of the world and not the reverse. For him, it's not about money, influence or sex, God knows he's had enough of that for five lifetimes. It's about the job and you're his boss. So, he's a guy who is stingy with both blood and treasure, which is why he's trying to replace real wars with trade wars. He's sending in accountants, instead of tanks. And yet even as America is governed by an orange Gandhi, the median Dems see him as Hitler. You see the trend, as the world gets better, which the metrics show. The media panics. How can they report good times, if Trump's involved in all of them? So, every day is doomsday since 2016 which is why now they're outside that candy store waiting for that sweet impeachment. Desperate for the taste of revenge, the sweetest bonbon of all. Hold your plot. Dana, while Donald Trump was talking apparently like the other networks were cutting in and out to fact check him.

That means 2020, those districts are definitely ripe for Republicans to win back. So, they had been saying, no, Nancy Pelosi were not for impeachment. Don't listen to AOC et cetera. Then because of the reporting about this issue before seeing the transcript, before seeing the whistleblower report, those seven got together and wrote this op ed and said, actually now we all believe that we should move forward with an impeachment inquiry and that is when Nancy Pelosi was like, well, what am I going to do now. Because she in some ways as the Speaker of the House instead of saying we're going to stave this off, she had to be for what's going to happen in her caucus. I don't know if it's showing up in the polls, but in that 37 percent, those are people that are really active in calling their members of Congress I heard a few of them today say, you wouldn't believe my phone's ringing off the hook, saying we have to hold President Trump accountable. But I would bet that there is just about the same maybe 40 percent of people on the right who are saying, don't you dare do this. And then that margin that's left. They don't want to talk about this. There is not an appetite to do this and this will take several months. This is not something like the Trudeau scandal that happened on Friday and it was done by Monday and nobody ever talked about it again. This is something because now they're all bought in and anything that happens, they're going to try to shoehorn evidence into this so that they can make their case over and over again and this would probably go through the holidays unless somebody puts a stop to it.",

He said he worked morning till night as he fights back against the Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry, while all these other things were going on.

It shows Trump asked about looking into Joe Biden and his son's business dealings, but there was no direct mention of military aid.

No wonder the transcript suddenly isn't enough. Oh, my God, we need something else, because they screwed up. Almost went in the wrong direction with that verb. Anyway, I love how the Dems said that we didn't arrive at this conclusion lightly. No, you arrived at this conclusion three years ago. You've been pounding it into the ground ever since. The media cites a growing clamor, right? A growing clamor for impeachment. They are the growing clamor for the last three years since Trump was election. They act like they're a model of restraint that this was the last straw. No, every day for the past three years has been the last straw. So what I say is the country right now is a victim of impeachment harassment. The media expects you, the viewer, to have a heart attack every freaking week. Every time they come up with a new bombshell, they want you to rife in terror. But our viewers, and the people at home, and the voters, know better than this. There's a disconnect between the way America is and the way the media portrays it, right? Americans are starting jobs. There's low unemployment. They've got swollen IRA's. They're spending their money. But the Dems, they can't profit off that. The media can't profit off that. So they have to paint an apocalypse. The viewers should be outraged that they're putting through an unhealthy emotional rollercoaster every single day. But I know that they get it. They've always been way ahead of us on this stuff.

The president saying that he had all these accomplishments this week at the United Nations, and yet they went unreported because everybody was focused on this idea of impeachment, which we should point out is not an insignificant things. The fact that this is only the fourth time that a president in the history of the United States has faced impeachment proceedings, definitely carries with it a measure of significance. The president talking about his phone conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky, the two of them also had a bilateral meeting. The president saying that he can't believe that the Democrats are going down the road of impeachment over what was discussed in that phone call. Both the president and President Zelensky, earlier today, saying that there was no pressure put on the call. But, clearly, the president did have a couple of asks, one, in which he characterized as being a favor. He asked Zelensky to look into this whole idea of crowd strike and alleged interference in the 2016 election on behalf of Hillary Clinton by elements in the Ukraine. And then the other one, separate to that, which wasn't characterized as a favor to look into Joe Biden. The president also suggesting that if Democrats want a transcript of the first conversation that he had with Zelensky after he won the presidency they are welcomed to that as well. And the president also talked about transparency in terms of this whistleblower complaint. I'm told that the complaint is on Capitol Hill, and the question is whether or not the president will actually seek to have that declassified and made public. That may be part of that call that he made with Leader McCarthy about transparency. So, we'll see, Dana. Still a lot to come in this."

I think this bottomline the Democrats are trying to impeach Trump for crimes that they themselves committed. These are nasty, ruthless, destructive, hypocritical people. And it's going to take a lot of energy to fight back their deceit and their lies. But you know what, Dana? I'm up to the challenge. And I will do this for the American people because they are being lied to. This is what the bottomline is, Donald Trump has taken a sledge hammer to the ruling class, and the ruling class is fighting back hard as hell, and they're never gonna stop. He beat back spy gate, the Russia hoax, he exposed Hillary, all of her corruption, and now he's beginning to expose the Biden family corruption in Ukraine, and in China, and they want to impeach him for exposing Biden's corruption. This is what's going on. The left says they don't believe what Biden did, abusing his power, abusing taxpayer money, and his son enriching himself is a crime. They think it's a crime for Trump to say, hey, can you look into that? Because Donald Trump is the chief executive of the executive branch of this country, and he is in charge of executing the laws. So, if some American citizen is committing potential crimes in the United States, or overseas, he has the right to say, hey, guys, can you look into it? But the Democrats are saying no, no, no, no, no. Joe Biden and his family, they're above the law. Joe Biden can't be looked into by this current administration, and he can't be look into by the Ukraine administration. So, Joe Biden, basically, gets a free pass. He can run around and commit all sorts of crimes because he's just above the law. And to say that this administration can't enlist an ally to look into potential corruption of a political opponent? Hmm, isn't that exactly what the last administration did? The last administration enlisted multiple allies, including Ukraine, to look into Trump and all of his people on no basis, with no evidence. Yet, this time the evidence is right in front of us. We have Joe Biden on tape and we have his son's receipts. So, at this point, the Democrats are accusing Trump of crimes they committed and this is in order to get out in front of the Durham investigation, and the Bill Barr investigation. It's an admission they can't beat Trump at the ballot box. And this is Nancy Pelosi trying to ride this crazy impeachment train the best they can. But you know what's going to happen? Sadly, coincidentally or not, Joe Biden might take the fall for all of this."

A sensitive compartmented information facility, and so you have members of the House and Senate intelligence committees going in to get a look at this document, the whistleblower complaint, and get, you know, break it down a bit for themselves. But when they've been coming out they have said absolutely, positively nothing, which is pretty common when you have the intelligence committee members going into a sensitive facility, they don't want to be caught talking on camera when they're on the way out. Bottomline, it's been pretty stunning how quickly things have moved here. Yesterday morning you had the Speaker saying that something had changed, that it was a time for a formal impeachment inquiry. So the president then said fine, you want the transcript of this phone call with the Ukraine president? I will release it. Then Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said I want more than that, I want the whistleblower complaint. So 10 o'clock this morning, eastern time, you had the president hand over the full transcript of that conversation.

People accusing the president of giving a favor and asking for a favor of Joe Biden being investigated. He actually uses the term favor when he's asking about -- Ukraine interference in the 2016 election. And let's not forget that it was the DNC who went and met with Ukrainian officials in Washington, D.C. to ask for dirt on President Trump on behalf of Hillary Clinton. That's the first thing. The second thing is the president this week has been able to set up a huge contrast when it comes to what Democrats are focused on and what he is doing. He's been meeting with a number of leaders. You had Secretary Pompeo stand up and say we've convinced a number of allies that the Iran deal is no longer the way forward with Iran. So while he's doing this on the world stage and having serious conversations about the security of the country, the Democrats are focused on impeachment based on a transcript that they didn't even see until today and continuing on with the narrative, while the president is actually focused on serious issues that affect the country. And voters are going to be the ones who decide if that's going to happen."

But it's pretty much consistent across the board that 60 percent or more of people say they are not for impeachment, that they don't have the appetite for it because they would like to see other things get done. And I do wonder, Greg, about the Democrats, how do you make a message to the people that it was worth it to put you in power to deal with healthcare, and get deals, and get things done with the president if, in fact, you don't have anything to show for it."

So what you're seeing is you're seeing the Democrats continually saying that there's going to be an impeachment. There's going to be impeachment. Why is that? Because they cannot lose their psychological investment in this battle. Yet, meanwhile, they're totally ignorant to the rest of the country that do not want impeachment, which -- and the country that is booming. People are starting businesses. You know, like I said, they're spending their IRA's. People are actually getting along unlike five years ago. Relatives are getting let out of jail thanks to Trump. People are having -- it's great - - it's easy to get along when you have jobs. And this is what the Democrats want you to ignore, and what the media wants you to ignore."

    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think on the Biden angle, too, the question -- why is Joe Biden even in this conversation? The New York Times published that story about him bragging about getting the prosecutor fired in May of 2019. Trump talked to the president of Ukraine in July. Short couple of months later, that's why he says, there's stuff going on in Ukraine about the prosecutor that's possibly why he brought it up in the conversation. But the question of Biden is, was he selling influence through his son to get access to the White House and Washington? It's the same reason why Hillary Clinton had a lot of trouble with the Clinton Foundation, and why the Clinton Foundation completely dried up as soon as she wasn't elected president. She got a lot of checks that came through when she was the secretary of state. The same questions that apply to her selling of influence in that situation, also apply to Joe Biden and the vice presidency, which is why you're seeing outlets like the RNC calling for him to release the transcripts."

Or when he flies them over on Air Force 2 to Beijing, and he brings home 1.5 billion with a B, from the Chinese state national bank and no one asks any questions? All the president is doing is say, hey, maybe there's some corruption out there that we need to look into if we're going to give you guys an additional $400 million to defend yourselves against the Russians, which by the way, Obama and Biden didn't give any money.

The glass fogged hoping against hope staring into a field of dreams, believing if they build an impeachment, a crime will surely come. So, let's step back and see this for what it is. Another example of the media and the Dems fashioning the worst of things out of the best of times, all to avenge an emotional loss. You want some examples. Well, as America leads the way in climate with cleaner energy, the Left tells their kids, we have a decade to live. As race relations improved from the mass demonstrations of five years ago. The media sees racism in every nook. As men and women reach equality in all facets, the media questions whether gender is just a fantasy. And as women and minorities gain more employment than ever, the guy running the show is called a bigoted sexist. A guy called Trump, a guy who wakes up every morning in that candy store called America wondering what we can get out of the world and not the reverse. For him, it's not about money, influence or sex, God knows he's had enough of that for five lifetimes. It's about the job and you're his boss. So, he's a guy who is stingy with both blood and treasure, which is why he's trying to replace real wars with trade wars. He's sending in accountants, instead of tanks. And yet even as America is governed by an orange Gandhi, the median Dems see him as Hitler. You see the trend, as the world gets better, which the metrics show. The media panics. How can they report good times, if Trump's involved in all of them? So, every day is doomsday since 2016 which is why now they're outside that candy store waiting for that sweet impeachment. Desperate for the taste of revenge, the sweetest bonbon of all. Hold your plot. Dana, while Donald Trump was talking apparently like the other networks were cutting in and out to fact check him.

This phone call now that we haven't been able to name any kind of high crime and misdemeanor that any of them can cite properly with any kind of evidence. And the question is, Is the media ever going to learn anything. I mean are the activists or are they reporters. Because a lot of the stuff, in the Mueller Report was supposed to show everything that happened. Robert Mueller was supposed to breathe life into the report. None of that happened. And here we are now with the transcript which doesn't show the quid pro quo, which was reported yesterday multiple times, it doesn't mention Joe Biden nearly as many times as reported and yet there is no correction from quite frankly anybody about the fact that they got this wrong.

And they had been very resistant about impeachment for a long time saying that look, we - and also Trump won their districts in 2016. That means 2020, those districts are definitely ripe for Republicans to win back. So, they had been saying, no, Nancy Pelosi were not for impeachment. Don't listen to AOC et cetera. Then because of the reporting about this issue before seeing the transcript, before seeing the whistleblower report, those seven got together and wrote this op ed and said, actually now we all believe that we should move forward with an impeachment inquiry and that is when Nancy Pelosi was like, well, what am I going to do now. Because she in some ways as the Speaker of the House instead of saying we're going to stave this off, she had to be for what's going to happen in her caucus. I don't know if it's showing up in the polls, but in that 37 percent, those are people that are really active in calling their members of Congress I heard a few of them today say, you wouldn't believe my phone's ringing off the hook, saying we have to hold President Trump accountable. But I would bet that there is just about the same maybe 40 percent of people on the right who are saying, don't you dare do this. And then that margin that's left. They don't want to talk about this. There is not an appetite to do this and this will take several months. This is not something like the Trudeau scandal that happened on Friday and it was done by Monday and nobody ever talked about it again. This is something because now they're all bought in and anything that happens, they're going to try to shoehorn evidence into this so that they can make their case over and over again and this would probably go through the holidays unless somebody puts a stop to it."

So, Nancy Pelosi yesterday saying she wants all these committees to come up with more information, more fact finding and bring her a conclusion on impeachment. So, after the Russia investigation ended, they essentially just redid the Russia investigation by calling up the same people who had been subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. Well, who are they going to call up now, if they're going for a different direction on this investigation, because if they're going to hold hearings, they're going to have to have witnesses, the whistleblower said that they want to come up?

I was against that because I think the confidentiality makes a lot of sense, but the President made a decision, he releases it and it's out there and it is what it is. So, you have these seven members release this op ed on Monday and they get that to Nancy Pelosi. In the afternoon, she finds out from the White House that they are going to release the transcript and then she scheduled the 4 o'clock meeting and then she did the 5 o'clock statement. I'm just saying from the timing perspective, could Nancy Pelosi the most powerful woman in government not have said, thanks guys. The seven of you, I hear you. They say they're going to release the transcript. Let's see what it says. And then you wouldn't already be on the road to impeachment."

They have so many different lawsuits that are up against them from Democratic politicians, elected leaders, across the country. It's irrational to think that they shouldn't be able to fight back.
