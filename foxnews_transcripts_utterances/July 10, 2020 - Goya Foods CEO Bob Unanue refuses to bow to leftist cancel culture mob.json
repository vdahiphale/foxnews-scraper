It's a true Hispanic American success story and one of the most charitable companies in the country, but because its CEO stood side-by-side with President Trump yesterday some vicious and powerful voices on the Left, they're calling for a boycott naturally. Goya's CEO Robert Unanue is here on why he won't back down. But first, the madness of voting against yourself. That's the focus of tonight's angle.  Some Americans may be thinking that voting for Joe Biden in November will be a vote against Trump, but maybe it's time to look at things a different way, namely if you vote for Biden what exactly will you be voting for. How will America change? First thing, you have to realize is that anything Biden says about being tough on China, about pushing Made in America stuff is a total lie. Biden has spent nearly half a century in politics including eight years as Vice President to show us that he was an economic populist suddenly.

And young and old alike must respectfully refuse to submit to this new normal that keeps us out of work, out of churches and out of schools. We have to teach the Democratic Party once and for all that attacking us and aligning with the radical socialist fringe is going to cost them dearly. And we can absolutely do this. We've beaten the Left many times before and we can do so again. In November, a vote for Trump is a vote to preserve the thing that makes America the best country on earth, our freedom. And that's the angle.  The president's re-election prospects, well, they rest in large part on how well he can do with women voters, especially suburban women voters, this November. A Washington Post ABC News poll from May showed that Biden's lead among that group was even stronger than Hillary Clinton's four years ago. 56 percent of that voting block favors Joe Biden compared to just 42 percent for Clinton. Now, this is where Trump is in trouble. But it's not all gloom and doom. Have the Democrats needlessly boxed themselves in on two key issues that are important to women? Now, Democratic politicians, lefties, school administrators and teachers are the main impediment to schools opening in the fall, especially teachers' unions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Parents know that the science says that the kids should be back in school. But Democrats seem to be ignoring that. Now, the other area is the burgeoning effort to defund, dismantle or just further weaken the police. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, surprisingly, empowering lawless mobs to roam the streets isn't exactly appealing to we women voters, especially women raising families. So, I think Trump has a real opportunity to peel off some of this crucial support away from Biden and, of course, to the Trump campaign. He needs to focus on three things. Reopening our schools. You saw a little bit of that this week. Reclaiming our safety, going after those people who are lawless in the streets. And rebuilding our economy. And he's well on his way to doing that. Joining me now, Sarah Carter, Fox News Contributor, host of the Sara Carter Show Podcast. Also, with me, Tom Bevan, co-Founder and President, Real Clear Politics. And Lara Logan, host of Lara Logan Has No Agenda on Fox Nation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tom, let me start with you. This is a kind of seems like a conundrum for Republicans. Certain election cycles. But are suburban women among the persuadable at this point in the election or is it all baked in already? They're immovable.  TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER OF REAL CLEAR POLITICS: I don't think that they're immovable. They have strong opinions about Trump and more with his style than with his actual policies. As you point out, there is support. There was a poll that just came out this week, Maris poll of New York. And get this, 62 percent of folks in the suburbs of New York and 60 percent of those upstate disagree with the defund the police movement. 55 percent of people in New York City approve of that. So, you have this real disconnect between folks in New York City and folks in the suburbs and upstate on the issue of defunding the police and that's New York, which is a very blue state. What do you take that to the swing states and in the Midwest? I think there is a real opportunity for Trump, if he can do it stylistically in a way that would appeal to suburban women to push his law and order message and make that a positive for him.  INGRAHAM: Sara is part of the point here for Trump to say something like, well, you might not at times like my tone or maybe even my tweets, but no one will fight harder for your safety at home, in the streets and your economic security and your ability of your kids to go to school. It's almost like he has to do a little bit of that. It seems in order to, you know, convince these women that they're not voting against him, really, if they vote for Biden, they're voting for more chaos.  SARA CARTER, THE SARA CARTER SHOW PODCAST: That's absolutely true, Laura. I think that's such a great point. And that's something that I brought up in the past before is reaching out to female voters, is saying, look, I know there's things about me, like you said, that you don't like. But I am here. I'm a president of Law and Order. I'm going to get your kids back to school. These are the facts. The Democrats are playing you and they really are. They're putting our kids in the middle of this political football. Laura. And it's so unfair. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Our children have been through enough. They need some semblance of normalcy so that they can move forward. And so, do the families. And the two most important things for female voters and for mothers and for women in the United States of America is their children's education and the security of their families. And if the president can move and just walk across that line and say, look, I'm here for you, I'm going to make this happen. I know you don't think I'm the most perfect guy. But if you vote for Biden, you are going to lose this because the Democrats have been giving way too much up to the radical leftists. And we can see that from Seattle to New York.  INGRAHAM: And Lara, I think I get the sense from the moms in my mom group who aren't political. These aren't political people that they sometimes the tweet they don't like from Trump, but they're really turned off by some of these Democrat leaders who are excusing the mobs like Nancy Pelosi is what she said about the Christopher Columbus statues being torn down. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And when you see all the talk online about, for example, The New York Times had an editorial where one of their opinion writers, Charles Blow, I mean, under a headline that said how white women use themselves as instruments of terror against black men. There's an entire editorial about that. I mean, he wrote here, there are too many next, charred bodies and drowned souls for these white women not to know precisely what they're doing. They're using their white femininity as an instrument of terror against black men. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, there's a real sense and a real feeling amongst some women in this country that the values, the things that they hold dear, the things they hold on to, the things they've known all their lives, that these are being torn down.

I really do for Trump. He ought to comeback for suburban women and some of the pollsters, Tom. Break it down, suburban white women. I know. That's how sometimes they break down these polls.  But I think safety, security, prosperity, reopening schools, reestablishing order, the home. The idea of home is very powerful, especially for women. And to me, those themes, they need to be hit and hit harder and more effectively by the Republicans if they're going to make up some of the ground they've lost, Tom.  BEVAN: I think that's right. And I think, you know, if Trump style isn't exactly right, this is where someone like Ivanka could really be a real asset to the campaign going out and making that argument.",

The political back story, I always have a hard time trying to figure out, but he is clearly wrong on what he said. Hydroxychloroquine is super safe. I particularly have a lot of experience with it. I've several thousand patient visits to discuss specifically the toxicity of this drug over my last 30 years. It's a super safe drug. It's safer than Tylenol, aspirin, Motrin. It's been around, a billion prescription.

And in those studies he's citing, they gave massively high dosages and what I would considering to be inappropriate dosages. So I think, if I can add just one little thing, Laura, it's that this QT interval that everybody is so scared of -- the heart recharges every time it beats, and it recharges. And the only thing I can tell you is I've been working with this drug for 30 years, OK, and I've never had a patient taken off of it from a heart issue.

He was convicted last year of obstructing a Congressional investigation into Russian interference of the 2016 presidential election. The president has long maintained that Stone was the victim of a witch hunt, suggesting he was not trying to intervene on his behalf. Stone had openly lobbied for a commutation or pardon. Prosecutors wanted Stone to serve at least seven years behind bars, but Attorney General William Barr overruled the decision, prompting all four career prosecutors working on the case to quit.

Goya's CEO Robert Unanue is here on why he won't back down. But first, the madness of voting against yourself. That's the focus of tonight's angle.  Some Americans may be thinking that voting for Joe Biden in November will be a vote against Trump, but maybe it's time to look at things a different way, namely if you vote for Biden what exactly will you be voting for. How will America change? First thing, you have to realize is that anything Biden says about being tough on China, about pushing Made in America stuff is a total lie. Biden has spent nearly half a century in politics including eight years as Vice President to show us that he was an economic populist suddenly. I don't think so. Well, this latter-day attempt to rebrand himself as some sort of liberal Pat Buchanan on trade manufacturing is a complete and utter farce. Instead of America first Biden's policies have always put American workers last.

We're going to talk to a man who is being subject to the cancel culture in just a few moments. And I think it's all bad now just wait until a Biden administration.

Heck, Biden already threatened to rescind the Obamacare exemption for groups like Little Sisters of the Poor after that Supreme Court decision the other day. And, homeschoolers, forget it. You're going to fake face such strict controls; you'll just go back to public school. College and high school sports teams, they're going to be in trouble. And media companies will face pressure by the FCC and other regulatory bodies. And if you take the Biden administration to court because you want to challenge any of this stuff, well, you're going to find that it has at least five justices in Washington to act as its rubber stamp. Meanwhile, laws that are on the books that they don't like will become meaningless. No more enforcement of the immigration or drug laws, bienvenidas to los. Of course, crime will rise as cops are taken off the streets and replaced with Left-wing social workers and therapists.

That's why that's the way it works in countries like Mexico and in Guatemala. And that's where we're headed under Biden. For a long time, many of you have been very happy that you don't have to live in Left-wing cities like Baltimore, New York, or San Francisco. But in just a few months, you may find out exactly what it's like. Finally, let's not forget that a vote for Biden is a vote to erase our history, our national memory, and our traditions, which brings us to the riots. Most people on the right, they're frustrated about the ongoing destruction. But for now, it's mostly contained in areas where the rioters feel safe. The mayors of Chicago and St. Louis are never going to arrest and prosecute these thugs. Yet that's only true so long as Republicans hold the White House. If the Left gets control of the DOJ, the rioters are going to feel safe from prosecution almost anywhere. In fact, they'll know that anyone who interferes with them will risk federal investigation. Biden won't have to order people to do much of anything like what like blow up the Mount Rushmore. No, he's not going to do that.

Well, these days when there's so much hatred toward our country and the media, I know it's really tempting to tune it all out and say, I'm not looking at it. Hide our heads under the covers and wait for the storm to pass. But this isn't a storm and it's not going to pass. It's a vicious and well-funded movement to take away your power and your money and give them to people who want to crush you. But patriotic Americans are starting to resist this unconstitutional series of edicts and actions of their mayors and their governors. And young and old alike must respectfully refuse to submit to this new normal that keeps us out of work, out of churches and out of schools. We have to teach the Democratic Party once and for all that attacking us and aligning with the radical socialist fringe is going to cost them dearly. And we can absolutely do this. We've beaten the Left many times before and we can do so again. In November, a vote for Trump is a vote to preserve the thing that makes America the best country on earth, our freedom. And that's the angle.  The president's re-election prospects, well, they rest in large part on how well he can do with women voters, especially suburban women voters, this November. A Washington Post ABC News poll from May showed that Biden's lead among that group was even stronger than Hillary Clinton's four years ago. 56 percent of that voting block favors Joe Biden compared to just 42 percent for Clinton. Now, this is where Trump is in trouble. But it's not all gloom and doom. Have the Democrats needlessly boxed themselves in on two key issues that are important to women? Now, Democratic politicians, lefties, school administrators and teachers are the main impediment to schools opening in the fall, especially teachers' unions. Parents know that the science says that the kids should be back in school. But Democrats seem to be ignoring that. Now, the other area is the burgeoning effort to defund, dismantle or just further weaken the police. Now, surprisingly, empowering lawless mobs to roam the streets isn't exactly appealing to we women voters, especially women raising families. So, I think Trump has a real opportunity to peel off some of this crucial support away from Biden and, of course, to the Trump campaign. He needs to focus on three things. Reopening our schools. You saw a little bit of that this week. Reclaiming our safety, going after those people who are lawless in the streets. And rebuilding our economy. And he's well on his way to doing that. Joining me now, Sarah Carter, Fox News Contributor, host of the Sara Carter Show Podcast. Also, with me, Tom Bevan, co-Founder and President, Real Clear Politics. And Lara Logan, host of Lara Logan Has No Agenda on Fox Nation. Tom, let me start with you. This is a kind of seems like a conundrum for Republicans. Certain election cycles. But are suburban women among the persuadable at this point in the election or is it all baked in already? They're immovable.  TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER OF REAL CLEAR POLITICS: I don't think that they're immovable. They have strong opinions about Trump and more with his style than with his actual policies. As you point out, there is support. There was a poll that just came out this week, Maris poll of New York. And get this, 62 percent of folks in the suburbs of New York and 60 percent of those upstate disagree with the defund the police movement. 55 percent of people in New York City approve of that. So, you have this real disconnect between folks in New York City and folks in the suburbs and upstate on the issue of defunding the police and that's New York, which is a very blue state. What do you take that to the swing states and in the Midwest? I think there is a real opportunity for Trump, if he can do it stylistically in a way that would appeal to suburban women to push his law and order message and make that a positive for him.  INGRAHAM: Sara is part of the point here for Trump to say something like, well, you might not at times like my tone or maybe even my tweets, but no one will fight harder for your safety at home, in the streets and your economic security and your ability of your kids to go to school. It's almost like he has to do a little bit of that. It seems in order to, you know, convince these women that they're not voting against him, really, if they vote for Biden, they're voting for more chaos.  SARA CARTER, THE SARA CARTER SHOW PODCAST: That's absolutely true, Laura. I think that's such a great point. And that's something that I brought up in the past before is reaching out to female voters, is saying, look, I know there's things about me, like you said, that you don't like. But I am here. I'm a president of Law and Order. I'm going to get your kids back to school. These are the facts. The Democrats are playing you and they really are. They're putting our kids in the middle of this political football. Laura. And it's so unfair."

And the two most important things for female voters and for mothers and for women in the United States of America is their children's education and the security of their families. And if the president can move and just walk across that line and say, look, I'm here for you, I'm going to make this happen. I know you don't think I'm the most perfect guy.

Every channel you watch, every newspaper you pick up. You're pretty much getting only one perspective on this constantly day and night. And so many of the women that I speak to are extremely frustrated. And because they feel that they're being completely ignored, there's a lot of talk about the silent majority. And what they're doing is screaming from the rooftops. We're not silent. We're just completely and utterly disregarded. We're just being overlooked. There's nobody out there that's standing up for these values and standing up for what it is that we care about and what we believe in. And when you see all the talk online about, for example, The New York Times had an editorial where one of their opinion writers, Charles Blow, I mean, under a headline that said how white women use themselves as instruments of terror against black men. There's an entire editorial about that. I mean, he wrote here, there are too many next, charred bodies and drowned souls for these white women not to know precisely what they're doing. They're using their white femininity as an instrument of terror against black men. So, there's a real sense and a real feeling amongst some women in this country that the values, the things that they hold dear, the things they hold on to, the things they've known all their lives, that these are being torn down.

And that's exactly what she did right there. She just was not willing to say. Joe Biden in his press conference tried to split the baby and basically say some monuments are bad and some are good, and we need to protect them. But he really hasn't been very forceful in this.

If you believe in the principle of, you know, the right to practice your religion, whether you're a Muslim or whether you're Jewish or whether you're Christian, that you don't have those rights at the moment. In California, you are not allowed to sing in church, that if you believe in freedom of speech, you're not allowed to speak out and say what you think these days. You're a racist and a bigot if you vote for Trump. You're a racist and a bigot if you say anything that goes against the grain, if you talk out, if you question the pandemic, if you question climate science, you're a denier. You're endangering people's safety. There's a real sense among many people in this country that freedom of speech, freedom of religion, these things are at risk right now as they in a way that has never been experienced in previous lifetimes. Now, those issues are going to be there, regardless of whether Trump is president or not. You're still going to be voting on those issues in the next election, no matter who wins this one.

And it's a drug that's safe and has been used for decades and decades. And although the FDA still issues a warning about using the drug, two prominent doctors that are now pushing for it to be offered in small over- the-counter doses. Now here to tell us more is Dr. Simone Gold. She's a board-certified emergency physician working on the frontlines during the pandemic.

You know, I've been tracking the progress of this pandemic and the reaction to the pandemic for months, long before maybe January, February. And initially, I was very excited about hydroxychloroquine, and it was very distressing that the media pounced all over this as though it wasn't a good option after the President endorsed it. So, we've known for decades as physicians that hydroxychloroquine is safe. And the evidence is pouring in that it's also effective as well. In early and in prophylactic treatment for COVID-19, you know, the President didn't pick hydroxychloroquine out of thin air. There was a lot of evidence to suggest that it would be helpful. And now that this evidence is coming in like a tsunami, it's going to be unstoppable. But because there has been so much politicization of the drug, I just suggest that we make it over-the- counter simply like we do in the rest of the world.  INGRAHAM: Oh, I can hear them.

The new Mount Sinai study that found it associated with reduced mortality, as well as the Henry Ford study, that this these comments about the drug seem almost akin to malpractice. How does Fauci, and why does Fauci seem to want to deny its efficacy? Dr. Urso.  DR. RICHARD URSO, OPHTHALMOLOGIST: Laura, thank you. The political back story, I always have a hard time trying to figure out, but he is clearly wrong on what he said. Hydroxychloroquine is super safe. I particularly have a lot of experience with it. I've several thousand patient visits to discuss specifically the toxicity of this drug over my last 30 years. It's a super safe drug. It's safer than Tylenol, aspirin, Motrin. It's been around, a billion prescription. In the largest analysis ever there is probably 50 patient deaths all time that have been attributed to the drug. So for him to make claims like that -- the only thing I can say is he's right in some respects, if you give toxic doses, if you give 34 milligrams per kilograms instead of giving like 6.5, yes, you probably will have adverse events. And in those studies he's citing, they gave massively high dosages and what I would considering to be inappropriate dosages. So I think, if I can add just one little thing, Laura, it's that this QT interval that everybody is so scared of -- the heart recharges every time it beats, and it recharges. And the only thing I can tell you is I've been working with this drug for 30 years, OK, and I've never had a patient taken off of it from a heart issue. And I've went out of my way to talk to cardiologists about this over the last four months. Not a single one has taken a patient off for this reason."

This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication. No one is saying it is a cure, by the way, but it reduces the viral load in all of the patients that Dr. Smith has treated, most all of the patients he has treated at an early level. The Turks have had incredible success, obviously, in India, and other countries. But doctors being targeted now and being threatened, Dr. Gold, what about that?"

Absolutely, they're brought up by the state medical board. And I'll come close to saying, more than you -- it is a cure. If somebody says I can give you the best chemotherapy agent or give you the option of not getting cancer in the first place, I will take not getting the cancer. So you have to understand that the COVID disease is really two different problems. If you get the virus and you treat it early, it's one problem. But if you get it late and treat it late, it's a whole different disease. So hydroxychloroquine given early, prophylactically treated, prophylactically before you get sick or for early treatment when you early are sick, it's very effective."

He was convicted last year of obstructing a Congressional investigation into Russian interference of the 2016 presidential election. The president has long maintained that Stone was the victim of a witch hunt, suggesting he was not trying to intervene on his behalf. Stone had openly lobbied for a commutation or pardon. Prosecutors wanted Stone to serve at least seven years behind bars, but Attorney General William Barr overruled the decision, prompting all four career prosecutors working on the case to quit.

Not only is AOC attempting to destroy a Hispanic success story, she is spitting in the face of someone who has likely helped her and her constituents get fed.

That's very powerful. And that can't be taken down, I don't believe, in a moment. But the fact of the matter is, our country is very divided. I'm 66 years old, and I have been through a few decades, let's say. And in my lifetime, I've never seen the country more, unfortunately, divided. I like the saying there are those who are born to love and build and others to hate and destroy. And unfortunately, there is a movement of hatred and destruction. Who wants to see houses of worship burn, businesses people have put their whole lives savings and to build the business, and to only have people come along and destroy it. They have no right to do that. And we have to stand for prosperity. We are the most prosperous country in the world. Pre-COVID, we were the lowest Hispanic and black unemployment in history.

Hispanic businesses are growing at three times the rates of any other business. And so the future is in our hands, and we have the opportunity to either do well or to destroy. And let's do well."

      "utterance": "Socialism or capitalism, freedom or subjugation, it's a pretty obvious choice. But Bob, I just really want to thank you for standing up for what you believe in and your incredible success as a CEO and as a charitable officer of that CEO and everything that you have organized for people in need. It should be held up as an example to the rest of the country. And I want to thank you personally, and I know all our viewers do as well. Thank you so much."

      "utterance": "\"The Ingraham Angle\" gets results. Just look at this week. Tuesday, we brought you details of the outrageous choices parents in Fairfax County, Virginia, were being given about how their kids were going to attend school in the fall. Well, the next day, the county said that it was looking at reducing these restrictions so kids could maybe get a little more in-person instruction. The whole thing is an outrage, but we had an effect. We also asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about whether the Chinese app Tiktok would be banned in the U.S. over security concerns. Since that interview, one of the Tiktok's largest influencers has left of the app. What should we be watching out for next week? Let us know your thoughts. That's all the time we have tonight.
