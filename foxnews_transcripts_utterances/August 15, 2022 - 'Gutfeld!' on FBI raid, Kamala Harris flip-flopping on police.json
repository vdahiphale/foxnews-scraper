      "sentences": "I'm pretty sure that guy sat next to me on a Greyhound bus and 1989. He was talking about how his voices were telling him to go to -- I don't know, to go eat insects. So now it's a moral obligation to eat insects. But like eating a centipede, they're just playing the long game, right? I didn't write that. If you laughed, I would have take ownership of it. But we just fired that person. First, they're going to tell you that eating insects isn't at all weird. Then you're going to tell you it's normal to eat insects. And then finally, you're racist if you don't eat insects. So Yahoo! Yahoo! Remember that? Yahoo! actually wrote a fact check piece claiming eating insects isn't harmful. I'm going to quote this. \"Social media posts say that chitin contained an insect exoskeleton cannot be processed by the human body.\" This is misleading. While some parts of insects may not be digested entirely by humans, it doesn't mean that eating them is harmful. I don't know. I think those experts are full of chit. So maybe not every bug makes you sick. But if I've got worms in my stomach, take me to the hospital. And don't suggest that they need company. Now others will say bugs are part of a balanced diet in other countries, as well as being integral to the culture which explains why people leave it there to come here. If insects are integral to your culture, you need to find a new culture. If I was working in immigration and a refugee came to my desk and I ask why are you here and they said my family eats insects. I wave them all through. Bugs are carriers of disease and parasites. The texture is disgusting. No one smiles when they eat insects. And when Robert Downey Jr. says it will reduce emissions. Yes, but by what? One study found that if every American became vegetarian emissions would drop by only five percent. That's not worth it. Fact is most people eat meat because it's healthy. And as Michael Shellenberger, author of the book Apocalypse never points out the amount of pollution from farming is trivial compared to jet setting around the world promoting bug cuisine. So, yes. So what if it's popular in other countries? You know what else is popular in other countries? Be headings. Which is also good for the climate because it cuts down on exhaling, which it turns cuts down CO2 levels. Should we adopt that practice too? Being headless makes it more difficult to drive helping the environment as well. That's the point though. It's not -- it's not about your health or your taste buds, it's about climate. The BBC asks, could grasshoppers really replace beef? Well, here's the long answer. (BLEEP) no. The writer -- standing over swearing. The writer said he was intrigued to see how we could lower his carbon footprint if he ate bugs as his main source of protein. Well, you do that champ. And also be sure and write another piece when you stop making insects your main source of protein. That'll be two days later when you're writing it from a hospital bed. So why all this media lockstep? Once again, it's driven by people who exempt themselves from their own advice. You think these elites will eat bugs themselves? Do you think Greta Thunberg's mom packed her centipede sandwich in her Hello Kitty lunchbox this morning? Do you think you're going to see cream of carpenter ant as a dinner special at the U.N. cafeteria? Now when they asked you ordered bugs at the World Economic Forum, all you hear is crickets. Oh, you wouldn't use that job. I'll take it. You see the faces of people who eat insects? It's revulsion. And revulsion is an instinct. The humans who didn't find eating insects, revolting died. That's why we prefer our food insect free because we're the ones left. Sure, you could say but it's low fat. But so his dog (BLEEP) And I'm not smearing that across a bagel. I told Kilmeade it was Nutella. But what really -- what really sucks -- what really sucks and the whole point of this is that they ignore the main reason that humans eat bugs. It's because they're poor, and they don't have access to better food. So instead, these fools try to make poverty seem like fun. I mean, do you think an African child would eat a plate of mealworms if they could have a bowl of pesto instead of pests? Like President Biden bugs are no one's first choice. Terrible. They leave that part out of every story, the lack of prosperity that forces them to eat insects, like the President's B.M.'s. It's not voluntary. I left that in there and I'm still wondering why. Then they call something people eat out of desperation, a delicacy. By this logic the Donner party was a 12-course lesson in exotic cuisine. Don't knock it. But it's all about Manufacturing Consent. Getting us to adopt a practice that advocates won't take part in, like giving up their personal jet or putting giant windmills in their backyards. The World Economic Forum may push this stuff but they're not eating spiders. Which by the way, are now our competition for the insects. They're better at it. Look, we've all eaten insects before too but usually by accident.",

But this isn't about you. It's not about the rich really. They are giving up their foie gras for fried worm. It's not about targeting the middle class either. The closest they'll come to eating a bug is the bee in Applebee's. The only people left really are the poor. So is that where we're headed? Feeding bugs and mass to the poor instead of helping them out of poverty? I'm jealous of the days when elites said let them eat cake. Now it's let him eat cicadas.",

      "utterance": "I'm pretty sure that guy sat next to me on a Greyhound bus and 1989. He was talking about how his voices were telling him to go to -- I don't know, to go eat insects. So now it's a moral obligation to eat insects. But like eating a centipede, they're just playing the long game, right? I didn't write that. If you laughed, I would have take ownership of it. But we just fired that person. First, they're going to tell you that eating insects isn't at all weird. Then you're going to tell you it's normal to eat insects. And then finally, you're racist if you don't eat insects. So Yahoo! Yahoo! Remember that? Yahoo! actually wrote a fact check piece claiming eating insects isn't harmful. I'm going to quote this. \"Social media posts say that chitin contained an insect exoskeleton cannot be processed by the human body.\" This is misleading. While some parts of insects may not be digested entirely by humans, it doesn't mean that eating them is harmful. I don't know. I think those experts are full of chit. So maybe not every bug makes you sick. But if I've got worms in my stomach, take me to the hospital. And don't suggest that they need company. Now others will say bugs are part of a balanced diet in other countries, as well as being integral to the culture which explains why people leave it there to come here. If insects are integral to your culture, you need to find a new culture. If I was working in immigration and a refugee came to my desk and I ask why are you here and they said my family eats insects. I wave them all through. Bugs are carriers of disease and parasites. The texture is disgusting. No one smiles when they eat insects. And when Robert Downey Jr. says it will reduce emissions. Yes, but by what? One study found that if every American became vegetarian emissions would drop by only five percent. That's not worth it. Fact is most people eat meat because it's healthy. And as Michael Shellenberger, author of the book Apocalypse never points out the amount of pollution from farming is trivial compared to jet setting around the world promoting bug cuisine. So, yes. So what if it's popular in other countries? You know what else is popular in other countries? Be headings. Which is also good for the climate because it cuts down on exhaling, which it turns cuts down CO2 levels. Should we adopt that practice too? Being headless makes it more difficult to drive helping the environment as well. That's the point though. It's not -- it's not about your health or your taste buds, it's about climate. The BBC asks, could grasshoppers really replace beef? Well, here's the long answer. (BLEEP) no. The writer -- standing over swearing. The writer said he was intrigued to see how we could lower his carbon footprint if he ate bugs as his main source of protein. Well, you do that champ. And also be sure and write another piece when you stop making insects your main source of protein. That'll be two days later when you're writing it from a hospital bed. So why all this media lockstep? Once again, it's driven by people who exempt themselves from their own advice. You think these elites will eat bugs themselves? Do you think Greta Thunberg's mom packed her centipede sandwich in her Hello Kitty lunchbox this morning? Do you think you're going to see cream of carpenter ant as a dinner special at the U.N. cafeteria? Now when they asked you ordered bugs at the World Economic Forum, all you hear is crickets. Oh, you wouldn't use that job. I'll take it. You see the faces of people who eat insects? It's revulsion. And revulsion is an instinct. The humans who didn't find eating insects, revolting died. That's why we prefer our food insect free because we're the ones left. Sure, you could say but it's low fat. But so his dog (BLEEP) And I'm not smearing that across a bagel. I told Kilmeade it was Nutella. But what really -- what really sucks -- what really sucks and the whole point of this is that they ignore the main reason that humans eat bugs. It's because they're poor, and they don't have access to better food. So instead, these fools try to make poverty seem like fun. I mean, do you think an African child would eat a plate of mealworms if they could have a bowl of pesto instead of pests? Like President Biden bugs are no one's first choice. Terrible. They leave that part out of every story, the lack of prosperity that forces them to eat insects, like the President's B.M.'s. It's not voluntary. I left that in there and I'm still wondering why. Then they call something people eat out of desperation, a delicacy. By this logic the Donner party was a 12-course lesson in exotic cuisine. Don't knock it. But it's all about Manufacturing Consent. Getting us to adopt a practice that advocates won't take part in, like giving up their personal jet or putting giant windmills in their backyards. The World Economic Forum may push this stuff but they're not eating spiders. Which by the way, are now our competition for the insects. They're better at it. Look, we've all eaten insects before too but usually by accident."

But this isn't about you. It's not about the rich really. They are giving up their foie gras for fried worm. It's not about targeting the middle class either. The closest they'll come to eating a bug is the bee in Applebee's. The only people left really are the poor. So is that where we're headed? Feeding bugs and mass to the poor instead of helping them out of poverty? I'm jealous of the days when elites said let them eat cake. Now it's let him eat cicadas."

And in an interview with Fox News Digital or FND, he says the country is not going to stand for another scam, \"People are so angry at what is taking place, whatever we can do to help because the temperature has to be brought down in the country. If it isn't, terrible things are going to happen.\" Now following the raid last Monday, the FBI sent a bulletin to law enforcement agencies warning of increased threats. Something -- maybe they should have sent June of 2020, riots and stuff. But anyway, V.P. President Harris AKA Biden's number two. She's second in command. She is second in command.

Psychologists Greg Maddows blames dating apps and higher relationship standards adding women are increasingly selective. They prefer men who are emotionally available, good communicators, and share similar values. I bet he's single, because he, he just described the friendzone. You never get out of there. As for dating apps, 62 percent of all users are men. So, women see that there's more out there, giving them more options. All I can say is, thank God I got out of the dating game before women realize their self-worth. They also found that women are choosy, except that they only choose the same people over and over.

Now, these kids don't act like a man and they, the women are finding out, and they can't get any dates, and they don't even want them.

And I only know that because I was the six, in this instance, you know what I mean? Which, you know, but they've algorithm dating to the point. That's where online dating doesn't work, is you're literally just looking at boxes and an algorithm. It's so niche now.

We have higher standards. Therefore, we have, you know, a smaller pool of men because obviously the average intelligence of, of a woman nowadays is much higher than the average men.

But how fitting that is seen and career also had a happy ending. I, for one, can't wait to see what he takes a whack at next. He continued, \"Love all my former colleagues. Watch for my next book about the Oklahoma City bombing coming in 2023 from Simon and Schuster.\" Well, thanks for the advance notice, like your coworkers, we hate surprises.
