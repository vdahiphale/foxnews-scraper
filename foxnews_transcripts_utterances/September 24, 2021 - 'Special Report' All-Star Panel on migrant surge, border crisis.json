He was swinging it, but it can be misconstrued when you're looking at the picture.\" Meantime, Border Patrol agents talking to our people on the ground there in Del Rio, Texas, said would you go to work and do your best knowing that if you do your boss is going to make you pay? I'm dumbfounded and don't know what to say. They said they were stunned and disappointed by the president's remarks today. Let's bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina, and Morgan Ortagus, former State Department spokesperson.

We have to withhold judgment until we know everything. And context, I think, is important here. I think there is frustration on the part of the administration, continued frustration by not being able to -- not being able to articulate and execute on an immigration policy that wins broad support. And I think until they find that we will continue to have episodes like this. But let's get the facts before we mete out too much judgment here. I will say, as an African American, it did hurt me to see those images, but context answers a lot of things as well."

They are in these sort of encampments that are just as bad as anything that the Democrats criticized the Trump administration for. Finally, I'd just say what we're seeing here in this administration is that there is no accountability when 13 American service members are killed in Afghanistan, no accountability when seven children are killed at the top, no accountability at the top.

This is now \"The Wall Street Journal\" writes it. \"Budget tricks disguise the true cost of Biden's vast entitlement plans. Democrats are grasping for ways to finance their cradle-to-grave welfare state, with the left demanding what they claim is $3.5 trillion over 10 years. The truth is that even that gargantuan number hides the real cost of their plans. The bills moving through committees are full of delayed starts, phony phaseouts, and cost shifting to states designed to fit $3.5 trillion into a 10-year budget window that can pass with a mere 51 Senate votes. Even if the bill shrinks to $2 trillion or less, the real costs will be far greater. Behold one of the greatest fiscal cons in history.\" \"Wall Street Journal.\" We're back with the panel. Harold, you have been on Capitol Hill. You know how this works, the sausage making is ugly. But for the president to say it's all paid for, what about that?"

He at least is offering revenue raises to do that, and people are being critical of him because he wants to raise taxes. But I give him credit for that. One thing we ought to acknowledge, also, is they should pass a debt ceiling increase not because they want to go forward spending money. They have already spent that money. And for anyone to say, to go home and brag about government spending but then not want to spend the money and put the country and the economy in jeopardy, I think is the height of irresponsibility."
