      "sentences": "I am your host, Brad Pitt. So let's talk about Rolling Stone, also known as crap. The one's great. Now pile of wet garbage published a story claiming that an Oklahoma hospital was so overwhelmed by patients overdosing on horse dewormer medications that actual gunshot victims were stuck outside in ambulances waiting for beds. Meanwhile, horses full of worms had to wait outside because they weren't wearing masks. Now with the story that sounds this on the nose. You'd assume any competent journalists would reach out to the hospitals before they write about it. After all these modern facilities have phones and fax machines and carrier pigeons and a brand new thing that we like to call e-mail. Having two or more sources verifying information before you presented as fact. Oh, but where's the fun in that? But no, this is Rolling Stone whose readership still hasn't used their AOL free trial C.D.s. It's the weekend at Bernie's version of journalism, a dead product propped up by virtue signaling and competence who believe instead of think. Their writing is so painful, they should change their name to Kidney Stone. And Stephen King has nothing on these terms when it comes to fiction, especially when they try to own the rubes. The story was originally from Oklahoma's KFOR-TV quoting some doctor, but then the North Eastern hospital system denied that any patients were treated for O.D.s and that this doctor actually hadn't worked at one of the hospitals in question for months. I haven't seen denial this strong since the time Elton John married a woman. There were absolutely no overdoses related to Ivermectin nor were any patients turned away due to an overload of such cases. OK. But apart from those little details, the story checked out just fine. At first Rolling Stone kept pushing the story then it ran it update, no retraction. And then when it just got too big to bury they ran a humiliating correction. But not before a pile of liberal mainstream media figures embrace their crap spreading it all over the web. Rachel Maddow tweeted about it. Joy Reid, who apparently still has a job promoted the story on her show.",

      "sentences": "Great job there, Joy. But maybe it's time MSNBC got treated for worms. After all, how many times have their hosts look like a horse's ass? Drew hold and compile the list of suckers who bought this story from Business Insider to The Guardian. Mindless dupes like Justin Baragona of The Daily Beast and Roland Martin who doesn't know his elbow from his ascot. There was an MSNBC producer and so on. These idiots are wrong more often than Biden trying to button up his shirt. So what's the lesson here? Well, the fake story took off without anyone within that media bubble applying the brakes. Instead, they placed both their feet on the gas pedal. Why is that? Well, first of all, the media is not our best and brightest people. Present company excluded of course. How you find better and smarter folks in the front row of a midnight cockfight in Guam. Especially those whose only content is clickbait designed to make their leftist consumers feel superior. And that's what this story did. It gave their patients a dose of dumb redneck therapy. Something to chat about well sunshine, the barista screws up your latte. And this isn't the first for Rolling Stone. They were responsible for one of the most damaging hoaxes ever. A piece called a rape on campus, which described the gang rape at the University of V.A. A crime that never happened. They gleefully ran with it. Even though the reporting at bigger holes in it than Hunter Biden's septum. They later retracted the story, you know, after the lives of the accused were ruined forever. UVA 's reputation was severely tarnished and American colleges went to do a full blown panic due to make believe campus rape epidemic. You think they learned but to learn you have to suffer unpleasant consequences. Meanwhile, Rolling Stone just got a new editor in chief from -- of all places The Daily Beast. That's like hiring your babysitter from death row. It's a bummer. I grew up idolizing Rolling Stone. When the class or Cheap Trick made the cover it validated by life because those were my bands. So I tolerated their editor's commie leftism because I love the music. Now it's a mess. Rolling Stone is to journalism as barfing into an air conditioner is to air conditioner repair. But maybe they always sucked in I didn't know it. After all, Rolling Stone pan Led Zeppelin's first two albums. Jimi Hendrix's first album, they pan Black Sabbath's first album. Nirvana's Nevermind, Neil Young's Harvest, the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street. Need I go on? Why isn't this magazine locked up and Gitmo where it belongs? But perhaps he should stop doing music altogether and stick to politically owning the rubes. Here's some cover ideas. Transgender raccoon families, babies, or rabies. Why you should never trust white people? Except for us because we like Tracy Chapman. 800-pound man dies at hot dog eating contest, COVID did. Top 500 songs of all time, number one, My Humps by Black Eyed Peas. Actor Tom Hanks has temporarily passed away. Why are they called African-American Sabbath? Finally, Dewey defeats Truman. Still magic. So just embrace it, Rolling Stone because your past role as a respected music magazine is over. You may be a Rolling Stone but your grave has been gathering moss for years.

Racism will likely be just as entrenched in a browner America as it is now. It will still be white supremacy with a tan.\" Which is great news for Mexicans who want to join the Klan. A bad idea. So, if a country is not diverse, it's racist. And if it is diverse, it's also racist. Translation. We don't want to give up the power false accusations of racism has that makes people conform. According to CNN author John Blake, whiteness is as elastic as Brian Stelter's waistband. And expands to accommodate new members if they have \"The right look.\" To the left it makes more sense to have a black white supremacist than their ideas possibly being bad. But somehow I'm guessing no actual white supremacist were cited in this piece. So what's the solution? According to people like Blake, it's reparations. This isn't about abolishing depression. It's a never-ending one-way monetary transaction, one which like white supremacy will apparently never end. But if whiteness includes black, Asian and Hispanic people, what does that term even mean? If whiteness includes people of all races, maybe it's time for a different word, like American or human. But then the race baiters will lose their cushy jobs in media and academia. And we know what color they're really into. Meanwhile, America is getting browner and blacker, but white supremacy gets worse. So does that mean Rachel Dolezal is a grand dragon? All right, Zuby.

A Florida doctor says she will stop seeing unvaccinated patients in person beginning on September 15th. That specific. Linda Marraccini, hopefully, a plastic surgeon, said that although she would make exceptions in some situations, she doesn't want to expose the people in her office. I've said that. Especially, immunocompromised promised patients to COVID. Especially since the virus thrives on 3-year-old magazines. No? That was it the way I said it. It could be honest. Meanwhile, as student at Rutgers University, New Jersey -- they have universities in New Jersey now, claims that he has been banned from classes because he's not vaccinated, even though all of his classes were virtual ones. That be intent he'd been taking from home. This is consistent behavior from the nanny state that won't let you pump your own gas. It's true. Logan Holler said he had to miss several classes in school started September 1st, and that it could be weeks before the school makes a decision on exempting him from the mandate. No word of the school will let him resume remote classes if he promises to wear a mask. Comes up there in the head. But this reminds me of my own school days when they wouldn't let me on campus without my shots. But, of course, those were for rabies. All right, Zuby, do you think that the contagious nature of this makes it a good excuse? It's less of a moral shaming when the doctor saying like, oh, I don't want him to infect my other patients?",

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I am your host, Brad Pitt. So let's talk about Rolling Stone, also known as crap. The one's great. Now pile of wet garbage published a story claiming that an Oklahoma hospital was so overwhelmed by patients overdosing on horse dewormer medications that actual gunshot victims were stuck outside in ambulances waiting for beds. Meanwhile, horses full of worms had to wait outside because they weren't wearing masks. Now with the story that sounds this on the nose. You'd assume any competent journalists would reach out to the hospitals before they write about it. After all these modern facilities have phones and fax machines and carrier pigeons and a brand new thing that we like to call e-mail. Having two or more sources verifying information before you presented as fact. Oh, but where's the fun in that? But no, this is Rolling Stone whose readership still hasn't used their AOL free trial C.D.s. It's the weekend at Bernie's version of journalism, a dead product propped up by virtue signaling and competence who believe instead of think. Their writing is so painful, they should change their name to Kidney Stone. And Stephen King has nothing on these terms when it comes to fiction, especially when they try to own the rubes. The story was originally from Oklahoma's KFOR-TV quoting some doctor, but then the North Eastern hospital system denied that any patients were treated for O.D.s and that this doctor actually hadn't worked at one of the hospitals in question for months. I haven't seen denial this strong since the time Elton John married a woman. There were absolutely no overdoses related to Ivermectin nor were any patients turned away due to an overload of such cases. OK. But apart from those little details, the story checked out just fine. At first Rolling Stone kept pushing the story then it ran it update, no retraction. And then when it just got too big to bury they ran a humiliating correction. But not before a pile of liberal mainstream media figures embrace their crap spreading it all over the web. Rachel Maddow tweeted about it. Joy Reid, who apparently still has a job promoted the story on her show."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Great job there, Joy. But maybe it's time MSNBC got treated for worms. After all, how many times have their hosts look like a horse's ass? Drew hold and compile the list of suckers who bought this story from Business Insider to The Guardian. Mindless dupes like Justin Baragona of The Daily Beast and Roland Martin who doesn't know his elbow from his ascot. There was an MSNBC producer and so on. These idiots are wrong more often than Biden trying to button up his shirt. So what's the lesson here? Well, the fake story took off without anyone within that media bubble applying the brakes. Instead, they placed both their feet on the gas pedal. Why is that? Well, first of all, the media is not our best and brightest people. Present company excluded of course. How you find better and smarter folks in the front row of a midnight cockfight in Guam. Especially those whose only content is clickbait designed to make their leftist consumers feel superior. And that's what this story did. It gave their patients a dose of dumb redneck therapy. Something to chat about well sunshine, the barista screws up your latte. And this isn't the first for Rolling Stone. They were responsible for one of the most damaging hoaxes ever. A piece called a rape on campus, which described the gang rape at the University of V.A. A crime that never happened. They gleefully ran with it. Even though the reporting at bigger holes in it than Hunter Biden's septum. They later retracted the story, you know, after the lives of the accused were ruined forever. UVA 's reputation was severely tarnished and American colleges went to do a full blown panic due to make believe campus rape epidemic. You think they learned but to learn you have to suffer unpleasant consequences. Meanwhile, Rolling Stone just got a new editor in chief from -- of all places The Daily Beast. That's like hiring your babysitter from death row. It's a bummer. I grew up idolizing Rolling Stone. When the class or Cheap Trick made the cover it validated by life because those were my bands. So I tolerated their editor's commie leftism because I love the music. Now it's a mess. Rolling Stone is to journalism as barfing into an air conditioner is to air conditioner repair. But maybe they always sucked in I didn't know it. After all, Rolling Stone pan Led Zeppelin's first two albums. Jimi Hendrix's first album, they pan Black Sabbath's first album. Nirvana's Nevermind, Neil Young's Harvest, the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street. Need I go on? Why isn't this magazine locked up and Gitmo where it belongs? But perhaps he should stop doing music altogether and stick to politically owning the rubes. Here's some cover ideas. Transgender raccoon families, babies, or rabies. Why you should never trust white people? Except for us because we like Tracy Chapman. 800-pound man dies at hot dog eating contest, COVID did. Top 500 songs of all time, number one, My Humps by Black Eyed Peas. Actor Tom Hanks has temporarily passed away. Why are they called African-American Sabbath? Finally, Dewey defeats Truman. Still magic. So just embrace it, Rolling Stone because your past role as a respected music magazine is over. You may be a Rolling Stone but your grave has been gathering moss for years. Let's welcome tonight's guests."

That's the sneakiest part of white supremacy. The fewer white people it has, the stronger it gets. \"The assumption that more racial diversity equals more racial equality as a dangerous myth. Racism will likely be just as entrenched in a browner America as it is now. It will still be white supremacy with a tan.\" Which is great news for Mexicans who want to join the Klan. A bad idea. So, if a country is not diverse, it's racist. And if it is diverse, it's also racist. Translation. We don't want to give up the power false accusations of racism has that makes people conform. According to CNN author John Blake, whiteness is as elastic as Brian Stelter's waistband. And expands to accommodate new members if they have \"The right look.\" To the left it makes more sense to have a black white supremacist than their ideas possibly being bad. But somehow I'm guessing no actual white supremacist were cited in this piece. So what's the solution? According to people like Blake, it's reparations. This isn't about abolishing depression. It's a never-ending one-way monetary transaction, one which like white supremacy will apparently never end. But if whiteness includes black, Asian and Hispanic people, what does that term even mean? If whiteness includes people of all races, maybe it's time for a different word, like American or human. But then the race baiters will lose their cushy jobs in media and academia. And we know what color they're really into. Meanwhile, America is getting browner and blacker, but white supremacy gets worse. So does that mean Rachel Dolezal is a grand dragon? All right, Zuby. Is there any hope for society at all or is it racism forever? Is it racism all the way down?"

A Florida doctor says she will stop seeing unvaccinated patients in person beginning on September 15th. That specific. Linda Marraccini, hopefully, a plastic surgeon, said that although she would make exceptions in some situations, she doesn't want to expose the people in her office. I've said that. Especially, immunocompromised promised patients to COVID. Especially since the virus thrives on 3-year-old magazines. No? That was it the way I said it. It could be honest. Meanwhile, as student at Rutgers University, New Jersey -- they have universities in New Jersey now, claims that he has been banned from classes because he's not vaccinated, even though all of his classes were virtual ones. That be intent he'd been taking from home. This is consistent behavior from the nanny state that won't let you pump your own gas. It's true. Logan Holler said he had to miss several classes in school started September 1st, and that it could be weeks before the school makes a decision on exempting him from the mandate. No word of the school will let him resume remote classes if he promises to wear a mask. Comes up there in the head. But this reminds me of my own school days when they wouldn't let me on campus without my shots. But, of course, those were for rabies. All right, Zuby, do you think that the contagious nature of this makes it a good excuse? It's less of a moral shaming when the doctor saying like, oh, I don't want him to infect my other patients?"

Some people take some, they don't take all of them. But it's just nonsense.
