Staying involved here when it's been such a mess. I think that we need to get out. However, I think it's hilarious to see Nancy Pelosi releasing a statement saying that we need to get out, a lot of other Democrats saying we need to get out, we've lost so much. You guys nominated Hillary Clinton, who was, by far, was the most hawkish person. She plays an instrument very well, first chair at any concert hall, called the wardroom constantly throughout her entire time in any office. So, you know, to say that -- to criticize him on -- to be specific enough is one thing, but to see Democrats criticizing him on not getting out is absolutely absurd because they had a chance to offer their answer to foreign policy issues and they offered a warmonger.",

The president will be meeting with U.S. border officials where you can bet the border wall topic will come up. The presidents stop in Yuma is the opening act before a big campaign style rally with supporters at 10 p.m. Eastern in Phoenix tonight, where major protests are also expected to take place.

It's to close after Charlottesville. That was such a difficult situation not only for the people in Charlottesville but for all Americans. So campaign style rally so shortly thereafter, I did not think was appropriate. I thought at the time and I still do that delay -- we don't want to cancel the president overall, but a delay of the presidential visit was an appropriate request and would be the appropriate action by the White House. I'm under no illusion that the president will take my advice."

And on the inside I'm very curious to see if the context is going to be tax reform, infrastructure, here's my Afghanistan policy. What do you think as opposed to, lock her up.

You know, that we're all unified in this. And together we can live in peace and in harmony and we will be a force for good there by.

I think in this moment, it was a rough, rough week for the White House last week for a few things, Charlottesville and the exit of Steve Bannon. I think this will be an opportunity -- I credited the president multiple times of his ability to control the narrative. He gets that narrative going exactly the way he wants it to. I think the timing on that part makes a lot of sense. Look, Brian, I think many people have been doing that rallying cry. It makes all the sense of the world to me to go to tax reform, to go to infrastructure, I am hoping for the sake of our country he will listen."

You're right, every vote does matter. At some point, the legislative points on the board are going to have to come to pass for President Trump. Otherwise, I say, he runs the risk of kind of becoming a really, really good height man around some issues that resonates to the American people into their core.

If you go to that infrastructure, you go to that tax reform, you're right, he positions himself quite smartly to pressure those kind of purplish red state Democrats to say, if you don't buy in to this type of opportunity for your constituents, what does that make you?

He said, hey, wait a second, I came into office saying I'm pulling out of Afghanistan, but the more I thought about it, the more I looked at it, it didn't make any sense. I change my mind. He showed humility. And I wouldn't mind if he came out today and said, so, repeal and replace went really well. Let's see if we can do better with tax insurance. Get a laugh from people. And I think we will. And start understanding, start showing a little bit of vulnerability. He's great at punching you in the mouth, but what about backing up and showing some vulnerability."

He treats people he needs nothing from great, whether it's the makeup artist of the key grip. I watched him with The Apprentice crew.

And we're going to engage with those who are providing safe haven and asked them to change what they're doing and help us help them, because in my view, the best -- the greatest benefactor other than the Afghan people themselves to achieving stability and peace in Afghanistan are the people of Pakistan."

After we left Afghanistan, after they helped us throughout the Taliban the first time, a couple of decades ago. It's been very difficult for them. But clearly, they've harbored malefactors including Osama Bin Laden. So I think it's very appropriate to offer the prospect as we're talking about before of both carrot and stick. We have to have a determined military advantage in Afghanistan. We're not directing our firepower toward Pakistan, but we're definitely expecting them to stand with us and to in line. And if they do, there're economic advantages for them. That's smart."

That could be decades off. So any president has to make the determination at what point do we leave and is Afghanistan the right place? Or do we stay for decades and decades and decades? And we'll say, you know, we still have troops station on the South Korea-North Korea border, right? We have troops station all over Europe. So the idea that we'll still have troops in 40 years isn't a crazy thought. But for a president who wants to make sure that he's fulfilling campaign promises and also sort of terrifying the American people, I think he dialed it back a little bit without talking about."

Staying involved here when it's been such a mess. I think that we need to get out. However, I think it's hilarious to see Nancy Pelosi releasing a statement saying that we need to get out, a lot of other Democrats saying we need to get out, we've lost so much. You guys nominated Hillary Clinton, who was, by far, was the most hawkish person. She plays an instrument very well, first chair at any concert hall, called the wardroom constantly throughout her entire time in any office. So, you know, to say that -- to criticize him on -- to be specific enough is one thing, but to see Democrats criticizing him on not getting out is absolutely absurd because they had a chance to offer their answer to foreign policy issues and they offered a warmonger."

The problem is not the Afghanistan private army, the Taliban private army. The problem is the 20 different terror organizations there. You can't rationalize it if you're the president of the United States, leaving a place where 20 separate organizations have as their doctrine wipe out the west and the United States. So that's what they're going to be doing. The most important thing he said was I'm getting India involved and rules of engagement will change. Go win.

Under White House rules, any petition getting more than 100,000 signatures requires an official response. But how far can the Trump administration go? OK. Well, so a lot of people, they've only just seen videos of them. As part of my man-on-the-street type of work that I've been doing for a few years, I've gone to these protests. I've talked to some of these people, and they will straight up tell me to my face -- they told me at a rally in D.C. recently, \"Oh, I don't like this rally, because there has been\" -- or in New York -- \"I don't like this rally, because there's been no destruction of property, and we like to destroy property.\" In D.C., they were laying in the streets. And I remember, there were these older black women who were desperately trying to get through in their car, and the meter was going up; and they were refusing to get up. They were hurling obscenities. They were saying horrible things about the police. They were saying similar things about -- these are not -- the ones that I've encountered are not these kind, social justice-y type of people. These are -- these are anarchists, exactly. Anarchists.

They are -- they're probably not even organized enough in their minds to be anarchists. They just want to go out and cause trouble. And their flag actually does resemble the Nazi flag, the flag that some of them adopted, with the black, and the red and the white field. It's frightening. It's fascist. It is not American.

In other countries, you would literally get arrested, probably killed for doing something like that. So I think it's great that we do have that freedom."

But now they're going to take their $20 billion and buy Jeep and make it somewhere else. That's 14,000 jobs. That -- a Jeep has to be born in America. It still supplies the military.
