      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is a special edition of \"The Ingraham Angle\" tonight. Nancy's impeachment furor and the subsequent flameout all occurred the same week a FISA court judge demanded info about FBI lawyer that was linked to Carter Page's warrant. Congressman Andy Biggs and former Whitewater independent counsel Robert Ray are here tonight to respond. Also, tonight, the failure of the 2020 Democrats to push back successfully against the president's roaring economy will be the story of next year's election and we're ready for it here at the Ingraham Angle. And tonight, Frank Luntz has details, he's going to explain it all. And the publication Christianity Today, which most of you have never heard of or heard of it tangentially -- well, it comes out for impeaching the president in an obvious attempt to goose its flagging sales and subscriptions. Ralph Reed is here exclusively tonight to deliver a fiery response. Also, it wouldn't be Friday night without Raymond Arroyo. A Christmas themed folly examines a leftist freak out of merry proportions and which holiday song is number one? It just hit number one. And we also -- this cannot be true. Am I reading this? We speak exclusively to Santa. Wait a second. Oh, a mall Santa who was replaced for get this -- wearing a Trump 2020 hat in a private photo. But first, it's time to put House Democrats on trial for perpetrating a massive fraud on the American people. I started this conversation last night and tonight we're going to continue it. House Democrats not only wasted taxpayer dollars on an incredibly lengthy, tedious, boring, costly, bogus inquiry, but now Nancy Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment for political gain and to prevent the president's trial and likely acquittal in the Senate, that's her goal. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a liberal member of the Judiciary Committee, seems to have no idea that Mitch McConnell has all the leverage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Richard Blumenthal",
      "utterance": "This decision is indeed Nancy Pelosi's to make, and her position is fully understandable that she wants some assurance that there will be a full, fair, honest trial with witnesses and documents. There's a court of appeals here. It's the electorate, the court of public opinion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Wait a second. He was basically the chief lawyer in my home state of Connecticut for a year after year after year. State's attorney there. He doesn't know that the Constitution says that the Senate has the sole power of impeachment. Really? Nancy gets to call all the shots in the Senate. Does that apply the other way? Does Mitch get to call all the shots in the House? Because this whole thing would've come down a lot different. Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz has actually read the Constitution and he said, I can imagine nothing more unconstitutional than a House impeachment without sending it to the Senate. It would be as if a prosecutor decided he had insufficient evidence to get a conviction. So we went after an ordinary citizen and said, look, I'm just going to indict him, but I have no intention of bringing him to trial. Obviously, no judge would tolerate that. I said something similar last night, if you remember, on The [Ingraham] Angle, it's an abuse of the entire process. Senator Jeanne Shaheen seemed to side with the professor. Interesting. Over her own Democrat colleague."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanne Shaheen",
      "utterance": "I think we're all -- and the public is anxious to see how the process is going to unfold. They want to see a process that they believe is fair. And I think that this kind of maneuvering just further raises questions in the public about what's happening in Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "She's New Hampshire. Well, joining me now, Robert Ray, former Whitewater independent counsel, and Congressman Andy Biggs, House Judiciary Committee member. Robert, I want to start with you. There's been a lot of debate over what withholding the articles means legally, constitutionally. But does it expose this entire process as something of a fraud?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Robert Ray",
      "utterance": "It does, because it just reaffirms the fact that this is an entirely partisan effort by House Democrats. And it's absolutely clear from the Constitution that it requires instead a bipartisan effort in order for there to be any chance at removal of a president from office. And I think finally, it's ultimately -- just to be practical about this for one second -- it's about counting votes. The votes are not there. Not only are there not sufficient votes to constitute a two thirds majority as required by the Constitution to remove the president from office, the Democrats will not even be able to get a simple majority in the Senate. So what are we wasting our time for? This is over. Once the House acted, they're out of it. Then the process go entirely to the United States Senate. And Nancy Pelosi cannot dictate to the Senate what kind of procedure that she would like. Yeah, when they say this was historic, Congressman Biggs -- this was a historic impeachment, I said it last night. I'm going to repeat it tonight for anyone who --missed it. It's historic because it was kind of -- it was an impeachment in name only because she didn't have the courage or the case or both to actually take it to where it's supposed to go. You have your managers named, you might be one of them, and the articles go that night. And I know Robert would agree with me that night they go to the Senate. Do you think she comes back from her Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa holiday break and folds and blames the Senate? Or does she say hold out for some type of concessions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Rep. Andy Biggs",
      "utterance": "You know, it's almost impossible to predict. I don't think the framers of this Constitution ever contemplated somebody who would abuse their powers so blatantly as to say, you know, we will impeach, but we're not going to transmit it so that that person gets a shot at a trial or a presentation even in this United States Senate. So, it's impossible to predict what she's going to do. It's quite frankly -- she's having a hissy fit here. She's decided that she doesn't like the way it's going. She's grabbing her ball and she's trying to go home. But she just can't do it after you've had the impeachment vote. It's absolutely outrageous. And I think people in her conference are going to start putting pressure on her to go forward, although some seem to be absolutely okay was never transmitting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, it's funny how they, Robert, throw around terms like obstruction of Congress. Okay, you could make a case that she's obstructing Congress --"

      "utterance": "I think you're right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "This is kind of obstructing Congress, an abuse of process. Abuse of power, abuse of process, obstructing Congress. Nancy, you're guilty of what you're accusing the president of doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Robert Ray",
      "utterance": "I mean, that's exactly right. The shoe is now on the other foot. You know, my view -- I think ultimately is that I do think she will fold. She will not get witnesses. And I think Senator McConnell likely is to set a date when this trial is to begin and they either show up with their articles or not. You know, that's the bottom line. I think that's what's going to happen in January."
    },

      "speaker": "Robert Ray",
      "utterance": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Congressman Biggs, former Senator Jeff Flake -- whom I don't miss at all -- he's home from your home state of Arizona, had this to say about you and your colleagues, \"The willingness of House Republicans to bend to the president's will has been an appalling spectacle. It will have long term ramifications for the country and the party to say nothing of individual reputations. This is a guy who had, what, an 18 percent approval rating in your home state. Your response?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Andy Biggs",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, I just can understand Jeff. And the reality is he's really irrelevant on the political scene anymore in Arizona and nationally. And, you know, as an individual, he's a good guy, but he is messed up politically. I'll just say it that way. And the fact of the matter is, he didn't read the transcripts that I read. He didn't see the closed-door hearings that I was prevented from seeing. He doesn't know firsthand what went on there. All he knows is he has disapprobation for this president, doesn't like him at all, hates him. And thus, he's going to come down on that conclusion every time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "And Robert, for the second time this week, a FISA court judge is demanding the FBI answer for its malfeasance. Judge Rosemary Collyer, who's retiring early from this particular post, is asking for previous surveillance requests authored by the FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith. He's the anti-Trump FBI guy who altered evidence in order to spy on Carter page. Now, Clinesmith has reportedly resigned. But Robert, this happened today. So how significant could this be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Robert Ray",
      "utterance": "Laura, it's serious stuff. And I think the court is acting because it knows that if it doesn't start to show that it's prepared to take matters into its own hands and rein in the FBI, the Congress may well eliminate the court and there may be bipartisan support for that. So, the court does have this power. It has the power of contempt. It also has the power to make a determination to refer the conduct of that lawyer, both to the bar and also for criminal contempt proceedings back to the Department of Justice. And I expect that that's what you're likely to see happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to say, Congressman Biggs, I thought I could call -- like kind of telegraph every move here. But I didn't think that as outrageous as Maxine Waters has been in her commentary, I didn't quite think that after the impeachment vote, I thought, should I go home for the holidays and put it to rest. But she took it up a notch today. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Maxine Waters",
      "utterance": "I was right that something was wrong with him, that he did not deserve to be president, but I came to those conclusions early and started the discussion. I wanted to sound the alarm. If he's exonerated by the Senate when they do the trial, he's going to get even worse. And I tell you and I will predict he's going to bring Putin into the White House for a meeting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "That's what he's going to do. Congressmen Biggs. They're going to be spooning in the Oval Office. This is how lunatic it's all become."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Andy Biggs",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, Maxine Waters, don't forget, she's been calling for impeachment. We had almost 100 of them had voted for impeachment before we ever had the Zelensky phone call."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Impeach 45. Impeach 45."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Andy Biggs",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And she's also the one who advocated people to harass physically, verbally, people who supported President Trump, people in his cabinet. I offered a motion to censure for that. The reality is that she's unhinged on this and that's really unfortunate. But that's that's where we are. And she's not alone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, if you think this is unjust, what happened to President Trump, you're a Russian asset, basically."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Andy Biggs",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "That's their argument. Robert, we raised an issue last night. I'm just so itching to get your opinion on this. In Andrew Jackson's case, when they took back the House and the Senate, his censure was ultimately expunged by the Senate. Could you see something happening here akin to that? Is it even possible under our Constitution that if the Republicans took back the House, they could expunge the impeachment of Nancy Pelosi and the gang? Next year, I mean, 2021. Is that possible under our constitution?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Robert Ray",
      "utterance": "And just to be clear, we're talking about Andrew Jackson not to be confused with Andrew Johnson, who is the --"
    },

      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Oh, did I say Johnson? Excuse me. Jackson. Thank you, professor."
    },

      "speaker": "Robert Ray",
      "utterance": "No, no, you didn't, but for the viewers, I think it gets to be confusing. Anyway."

    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Robert Ray",
      "utterance": "Yes. Andrew Jackson was actually censored, and I would assume that it probably would take the action of both bodies. But yes, if the House turned Republican, the there could be a resolution to expunge the impeachment, it would go over to the Senate like any other resolution. And if it passed with a simple majority, yes, I believe that would be the power of the legislative branch to remove and expunge any taint that arises as the result of this entirely partisan House effort to impeach President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "OK. That's interesting. You can see people making that case -- candidates, House members in some of these swing districts, they're going to continue this impeachment odyssey and 2021, if you reelect them, if you if you allow them to retain the majority in the House, we can't let that happen. That's fascinating. I want to talk for a moment about what we think they're starting to do to John Durham, Congressman Biggs. He's a well-respected, of course, U.S. attorney, and now he's handling the investigation into FISA and beyond. And I want to read this to you. This is from The New York Times yesterday. \"Durham is scrutinizing ex-CIA directors' role in Russian interference findings.\" And listen to this, \"Durham's pursuit of Brennan's records is certain to add to accusations that Mr. Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies.\" Congressman Biggs, so, Jeff Lord pointed out in a column today, they're starting to do to Durham what they've tried to do unsuccessfully to Bill Barr."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Andy Biggs",
      "utterance": "Yeah. No, that is the Democrat way. And it's you know, if you can't beat them on the facts, they can't beat anybody on the facts. They're going to attack you personally. And the fact of the matter is, Durham has basically an independent hand here. He's not having meetings with President Trump. He's not having regular meetings that some coordination is going on. This is where the facts lead. The facts lead to Mr. Brennan, who is now changing his tune. He's starting to say, \"Well, yeah, I kind of lied on this other stuff, and I didn't really handle this very well.\" But look for them to really try to lay the lumber to Mr. Durham as he gets closer and closer. Yeah, it's going to be brutal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It's this it's like you hear smash and grab. This is smear and run. This is what the Democrats have been doing. Gentlemen, both of you have been phenomenal in explaining something that's very complicated to the American people for this last three months and really that whole year. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas to both of you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Robert Ray",
      "utterance": "Merry Christmas, Laura."

      "speaker": "Andy Biggs",
      "utterance": "Merry Christmas, Laura. Be well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "All right. You take care. And now is a good time, I think, just to stop for a moment and to reflect on what President Trump was able to accomplish for the American people this week, even though he was facing this bogus impeachment. Think about this, among the results he's chalked up for you, okay, the House passed the USMCA, the big trade deal, despite Pelosi basically just squatting on it for over a year. Remember when renegotiating NAFTA was just a pipe dream? Obama promised to do it. He never did it. Well, Trump actually did it with Bob Lighthizer, an incredible team. The president also signed legislation to permanently fund historically black colleges and universities, something even Barack Obama couldn't get done. And then there's today's big news. Federal and local law enforcement arresting nearly 100 top brutal MS-13 gang members in Long Island, the place where two years ago Trump promised to eradicate that vile criminal cartel. Now, officials are saying that these arrests -- or sweeping arrests have rendered MS-13 inoperable in that part of New York, Suffolk County. Well, those are real results. I haven't even talked about where the stock market is, record numbers, the best economy in the last 20 years, and it's just over five days now. Trump can run on this in 2020. What on God's green earth do the Democrats have to offer? Now try as they might, the 2020 Dems do not have an answer for this booming economy. Now, this was painfully obvious during last night's Democrat debate."

    {
      "speaker": "Judy Woodruff",
      "utterance": "What is your argument to the voter watching this debate tonight who may not like everything President Trump does, but they really like this economy, and they don't know why they should make a change?"

      "utterance": "Now, they claim that the economy isn't working for everyone. [laughs] What economy are they looking at? The folks are being left behind? But I think Americans see what's really going on here. According to a new CNN poll -- it killed them to say this -- 76 percent see the economy as somewhat or very good, the highest rating in 20 years. I saw that at the airport today. It was awesome. Joining me now, pollster Frank Luntz. Frank, great to see you. Now, running against an incumbent, that's never easy, but how difficult is it for Democrats who deny what voters clearly recognize as a hot economy? I think it's the best in my lifetime. And I, you know, I worked in the Reagan administration. I don't think it's -- I don't think we're going to have a better economy -- I can't imagine a better economy than we have right now ever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Frank Luntz",
      "utterance": "Well, it's the best economy for African Americans. It's the best economy for Latino Americans. It's the best economy for 18 to 29 year olds. All the groups that tend to vote on the Democratic side of the fence are actually benefiting from this economy more than anyone else. But it's interesting, I did a down session last night, townhall for the L.A. Times -- and the viewers want to see if they can download the L.A. Times app. You can watch the entire focus group -- and Democrats think that it's not so good because of wages, because of costs, that it is more expensive, or seemingly more expensive, to live today, and that's the strategy that they're going to use against Donald Trump. \"It's not enough to have a good job. It's not enough to have a career,' they're going to say. That with the Democrats, \"We're going to raise your wages. You're going to have more take home pay.\" But what they forget to acknowledge is that taxes are going to go up. And so, people are actually going to have less money in their pockets --"

If that's what the Democrats do, they have this magic potion where they're going to raise wages and then all the costs are going to go down, and there's going to be lollipops on the trees and chocolate -- you know, raining chocolate, then why didn't Obama do it in eight years?"

The American people don't know some of this. The impeachment trial has actually gotten in the way of Donald Trump's communication. And the challenge for the Trump campaign is to shift it back to the quality of life, the standard of living, to the jobs, because that's what the public cares about. And if Trump can get that message out, then he gets reelected. If he doesn't get that message out, then he has a challenge."

His job approval, according to a recent poll by my organization, Faith and Freedom Coalition, among U.S. evangelicals stands at 83 percent. That's an historic high and 99 percent of conservative evangelicals, according to the Public Religion Research Institute, oppose impeachment and I don't know this editor. He's got one foot out the door. He's leaving on January 3rd, so this is sort of a, you know, kind of a parting shot by him. I don't know what impeachment hearings he's been watching.

In fact, really, there was nobody really around other than me and the camera girl.

I would've felt more comfortable when that statement came out that said I was replaced if that had been straightened out, you know, right quick that that, you know, that the matter is being taken care of as, you know, and we apologize for any, you know, if it's been offensive."

      "utterance": "I know you're devastated to hear this but I'm going to be off for Christmas and New Year's but come on, be sure to still tune in every night in my stead. We have Raymond Arroyo and Jason Chaffetz. They're going to guest host for a few nights each. They're going to have an amazing series of shows. You're going to love it. And on Christmas Eve we actually present the best of Laura and Raymond on the road. I think this is actually disturbing that we're actually doing this on Christmas Eve, but we are. They're great highlights from our 2019 travels. You'll love it. I promise. Then on New Year's Day the best of my angles, ooh, they're devastating, provides a unique look at how 2019 progressed through the lens of yours truly, the monologues. I just want to thank all of you, all the Ingraham Angle fans out there from the bottom of my heart. It's been an incredible year, one for the record books really in politics, the culture, and clearly Fox News and this show. We have an incredible team. Everyone has to contribute, and they do. That's why we get on the air every night. It couldn't have been more exciting. Thank you. Everyone have an incredible Christmas. Hug your family. Have a wonderful time. Happy Hanukkah. A wonderful, happy, blessed, and healthy new year. Be sure to soak up as much of that family time as you can, and I'll see you in 2020. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
