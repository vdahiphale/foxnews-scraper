And it's a quote from David Kang who is the director Korean study at the institute at University of Southern California, trying saying that five times fast. But basically what he's trying to say in his synopsis is that this time isn't any different than the past. And basically with the U.S. media we keep missing the second part of North Korea's sentence. The first part, if the United States attacks us first then these things will happen. And what he's arguing is the Trump administration also saying the same thing, that if we were attacked then we'll fight back. And right now, both sides are sort of practicing, you know, posturing, deterrence and wanting the other side to believe that we will take decisive action if need be."

And without a credible threat, without your adversary believing you will act, you don't get any progress in diplomacy. If you really want peace you better be prepared to conduct war. No one ever believed that Obama would do that with Iran, and therefore they moved along and they're progressing to a nuclear bomb, which is a preview by the way. North Korea is a preview of what it will look like when Iran gets a bomb. It is perpetual blackmail not to draw a real line here. Otherwise, you want to talk about a couple of nukes that can reach our shores today, an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead. Try dozens or a hundred pointed at the east coast, you will live under that scrutiny in 2037 if we don't act in 2017. So this administration understands those stakes. They're talking tough because it's about time they do."

And he is a New York Times bestselling author, a human rights activist, and a jazz recording artist, and he specializes in music and politics, Mark Steyn is here. All right, Mark, North Korea has been saying this kind of stuff over and over and over again, all the time, but they know Trump doesn't have to the say anything. They know if they came after us his regime is over. Play time is over, party is over."

It was all in the Canadian papers about how the North Korea's had plans to nuke Montreal because it would show that they were serious, but unlike nuking Cleveland would prompt an American response. And I don't know that in the crazy way they think in Pyongyang, they're not thinking, well, if we threaten Guam which is a U.S. territory it will show that we're serious without provoking the same kind of threat -- responses if we nuke Los Angeles. We're dealing in a world where the most isolated regime on earth is a nuclear power. And that should never have been allowed to happen. So when you see things, as Lisa was saying, the Washington Post headline, are we on the brink of nuclear war with North Korea?"

Because everybody knows dictators surround themselves with yes men. So therefore, you have somebody who really may not be aware that he would actually lose in a nuclear conflict. He might think there's a way to win. That's a very scary part. So yes, I like the way that the president has stepped up, and confronted the bully on the playground, Kat. That's what this really is. This is bully on the playground mentality, and the president is responding appropriately."

So, you know, I think if we see this sort of rhetoric right now, if we think this is bad now, I mean, it's only going to heighten that much more so here in the coming weeks in those two circumstances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Very true, it's only heightened over the last 20 years. Mark, you know the last time there was a credible threat of actions against North Korea militarily was 1994 under Bill Clinton. Since then we've tried sanctions, resolutions, talks, diplomacy, all the international -- the preferences of the international elite, and the intelligence, and the counsel of foreign relation. You're a student of history, has that ever worked and can that work?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "No, because broadly speaking the western world likes talking. And talking is the point. So they say, well, we need it get to a point where we're back in active talks with Iran. And for people like Iran and North Korea, the point of talking is to provide a cover for you to get on with your nuclear program, while at the same time sending your house trained be spoked diplomat to sit around the table with Europeans and North Americans pretending to be -- you talk about history, that was the same way it was. I dislike Nazi comparisons, but when you look at a German diplomats in the early 1930's, they were respectable civilized men and they flew around all the chancellery of the world, and people said they seem like reasonable people, so why don't we just carry on talking and doing this and chitchatting, and the world will come to rights. And it doesn't work like that."

People say, OK, we have to do something, we have to go in there, we have to get all this stuff, most experts agree we couldn't find everything, and that would guarantee that they would retaliate. So I think that's where the idea comes from of let's not do that."

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "To risk a war. I mean, there are some words worth fighting. Get to a peace -- adjust peace where you're not living under the specter of blackmail the entire time. So, if you do play it forward 20 years, now might look like a pretty darn good time to do something about it. Just like 1994, looks like a great time to have taken a preemptive measure in North Korea when they didn't have nuclear capabilities."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "And I think the difficulty we're facing right now is, one, there are no really good options here, because we know war on the Korean Peninsula could lead to catastrophic losses, as said -- stated by the secretary of defense. And we don't really have a ton of leverage over North Korea as well. So I think that's why we've seen, you know, this increased rhetoric from President Trump because I think he recognizes the fact that we don't have the economic tools like China does with -- you know, controlling 90 percent of the trade with North Korea. We don't have a lot of tools at our disposal. So I think President Trump what he sees is that we have to convince North Korea that we're willing to act if you mess with us. And so, I think that's what we're seeing with sort of this heightened increased rhetoric from the president, also, quite frankly, the secretary of defense in the past couple of days as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "It's true. Doctor, on the campaign train there was a lot of talk from this president about China and bad trade deals. And if we want to talk about leverage, China is the one that probably has the most. It's now the time to put the screws to them and say, it's put up or shut up. We know you don't share our interests, but we can find a convergence if we really push."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOUDON",
      "utterance": "I think we have to be strong with China, because, again, that part of the world really only understands strength. We've seen it over and over again. You know, if you don't come back as strong, then they're just going to push back even harder, because it is, again, back to that bully on the playground mentality. But here's the thing about China, and this what makes it so complicated and tricky. We even don't really know when they're being completely honest with us, if they're being completely honest with us or not. So it's not like, normally, we can use what is really an ally, this is not that, even if they say something to us, we absolutely no way to know if it's true. So this is -- this is really an international crisis like we've really never seen. We can make comparisons, but there really aren't any for so many reasons."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "No, he doesn't see it that way. And it's very real for them. They're dealing with basically 1950's duck and cover exercises now. They're being told, you know, don't look up if there's a big flash in the sky, that's only going to make things worse for you. And this is a very specific thing. This guy who actually hasn't demonstrated he's capable of hitting a barn door says he's going to put four missiles, north, south, east, west of the island like some spectacular choreographed Disney thing. And we are supposed -- and just to Pete's point about a credible military threat, the point isn't whether he acts on that, the point is we can't live in a world where people can get that specific about threats. The threat itself is a provocation, whether or not he acts on it."

So I don't necessarily think there's a correlation with the rhetoric. I think we're going to see those increased provocations regardless, which is what we've been seeing. I think President Trump is just trying to make it exceptionally clear to North Korea do not mess with the United States of America. I don't think he can get much clearer, but I think that is a point the Trump administration is trying to ultimately make here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Yeah. President Trump has great instincts, when he said fire and fury and then -- the North Korea balked at it, he said maybe that wasn't tough enough. And so, they speak the language of toughness, and he's surrounded by advisors who are the definition of understanding what adversaries need to hear. I think this is far more -- he's pushing toward brinksmanship. It's only when you get to a point where someone believes he'll do something. You get a moment of diplomacy or a moment where you can walk them back. It requires a steel spine to do that. And how many steel spines are there in Washington, D.C.? Not a whole lot. Thankfully there's one in the oval office."

I think the one thing that I found -- just a little glimmer of hope today, was that there's so many retired military living in Guam, you know, and many of these people have no fear at all because they understand our military capability. And those who understand it best, who live in Guam, who worked in military forever, if they're not afraid then it tells me that we really are prepared in ways that the average American may not be so aware of."

The former Obama national security advisor publishing an op-ed in the New York Times, writing war is not necessary to achieve prevention. Despite what some in the Trump administration seem to have concluded, history shows that we can if we must tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Well, measured rhetoric for 24 years is what's got us to this point. It's because we've been listening to people like -- Susan Rice and the Susan Rice's of this world have said trust in us for 24 years, and as a result a one man psycho state that has a GDP of $12 billion, which is approximately half of what Mark Zuckerberg has personally made this year so far, seriously, has become a nuclear power. And Susan Rice, everything she says sounds measured and reasonable, but it is in fact idiotic. It is precisely the fact that the five great powers had nuclear weapons, and did have huge arsenals that meant they had no pressure on them to use them. The smaller number of missiles you have the more likelihood there is, because it's a simple use them or lose them situation. So there's more chance of -- Pakistan, for example, using its nuclear arsenal than it is of France. And the idea that North Korea having nuclear weapons is comparable to the Soviet Union having nuclear weapons is just completely absurd. Who's next? Yemen, Somalia? A couple of tribes on the northwest frontier province of the Afghan-Pakistan border..."

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "No, we can't. I mean, this statement brought to us by the same woman who brought us the Libya debacle. It brought us the Iran deal, which means we've been living in the specter of that and the prospect of wiping Israel off the map. It's almost like they're telling us to live in this new normal where America is not exceptional, where the world is level. It's the same thing they said domestically. Your jobs aren't coming back, 1 percent growth is the new normal, and President Trump rejects that. He says if we are a hyper power, then let's use it. Careful, measured, planned rhetoric is not what you said Mark, nowhere. We shouldn't do anything to tolerate this. I think that's the spirit of what President Trump represents."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "And Kat, I know you don't like President Trump's rhetoric. North Korea has fired 18 missiles during 12 tests since February alone, watching their first ICBM on July 4th. So if you don't like the rhetoric, but what are we supposed to do then to counter that? Because we have had, as Mark has pointed out, we have had a policy of turning a blind eye to this and allowing this to happen. And obviously, they're increasing in the technology, so what are we supposed to do?"

What are we supposed to do is kind of the question everyone is asking. There really aren't any good answers. This comment was really interesting to me, though, because what they've been saying all along, Obama administration and, of course, Bill Clinton, oh, well, they won't, but they won't. And now it somehow shifted to, yeah, but if they did it would be alright. I want to know what happened in the middle there. That's a really, really big difference."

President Trump's escalating feud with Mitch McConnell sparking Republican colleagues, some of them, to rally around the senate majority leader, among others, Texas senator John Corny is tweeting out his support, writing, quote, passing POTUS' legislative agenda requires a team effort. No one is more qualified than Mitch McConnell to lead the senate in that effort. And moderate senator, Orin Hatch, tweets, Senator McConnell has been the best leader we've had in my time in the senate, and he's been there awhile, through very tough challenges. I support him fully. So is this push back from senate Republicans something President Trump should worry about? Lisa, I'm going to go with you first. They often time say that amateur's talk strategy, pros talk logistics. You look at the senate come in September. They've got 12 days until they got to raise the debt limit, the same amount of time to get a spending deal to avert a shutdown. President Trump previously tweeted maybe we need a good shut down for our country in September. Not saying that will happen. But what is this back and forth do to the prospect of the agenda President Trump truly wants, he tweets about every day, Obamacare repeal and replace, tax reform and infrastructure."

      "utterance": "Well, I do wonder what conversation are happening behind closed doors, and if some of this is a little bit posturing. I mean, it is problematic. Look, Republicans could get both healthcare and tax reform done on a party line basis through the reconciliation process, which is what, you know, they alluded and said that they wanted to do. Clearly, they couldn't get it done on healthcare. And my biggest concern, if you look at something like tax reform which I feel would be the best thing for Republicans in terms of seeking reelection in both 2018, as well for the president seeking reelection in 2020. Particularly, in what it could do in sort of boosting the economy, which is going to be a big driver for President Trump if it's going well. But you already look at disagreements we've seen previously like the border adjustment tax for instance. And you have groups like Americans for Prosperity putting up a six figure ad buy, Paul Ryan supporting it. Granted I think that has now subsided, but we're going to see the same ideological differences that we saw in healthcare rear its head in the tax reform debate as well."

This health care bill, what the best they could do, what the liberal bill, it wasn't even a conservative bill. It was a bailout plan. And then there's a couple people that are still actually believing in free market solutions in the GOP and then there's a couple people that are actually Democrats. They're essentially Democrats. I don't think that they're going to be able to come together on anything. I don't see it happening, no matter how much time they have.

They've concluded they have no interest in seeing Trump's populism succeed. And I think a lot of the House and Senate leadership thought that what Trump wanted to do was get elected. And that once he'd been elected, they could turn him into a Jed Bush or a John Kasich and he'd just be a normal Republican president and that's never going to work. They can stand or fall on how they implement on whether or not they're able to implement the Trump agenda.

And so, I think that when you put that overlay on anything we're looking at right now, any of these potential conflicts back and forth of blame game and everything, the honest person in this becomes rather apparent.

CNN acting as a hatchet man for the PC police. The network has fired Jeff Lord as most visible pro-Trump analyst after an online spot between Lord and the president of a far less group Media Matters. Lord was slamming Media Matters effort to silence conservative commentators comparing them to fascist behavior. Lord sent out a tweet mocking their Media Matters' president writing quote \"Seig Heil\", an infamous Nazi salute. Following an effort from the less online CNN hunt (ph) him with an hours. Lord however is defending his tweet telling Entertainment Weekly, \"Caving to bullies, caving to people who use fascist and Nazi-style tactics to remove people from air is an acceptable. I mocked this guy. Mocking Nazis is OK. That's a good thing, not a bad thing.\" Mark, what do you make of this?"

Media Matters tries to get people fired. They've -- they said something about me last night. They've said something about almost everyone. They have people who are paid to listen to you for the purposes of destroying your career. And so, he says, \"Seig Heil\" to them as a way of mocking their Naziness. It doesn't mean he's secretly sitting in his basement dressed as a noble group in Fiera (ph) from 1943 playing Nazi. It's actually -- and he's right. It's a joke. It's the same thing as if Pete says to me, hey, Steyn go and get me a cup of coffee. And I go, yes, both are mine Fiera (ph). And they decided to fire me over that. And actually, when we get to the point where you're being fired for stuff like this then we are simply too stupid. We're saying now bad words, mean words, you used them in a joke, you're dead.

Obviously, he was mocking -- he wasn't actually saying, I love Hitler, I'm a Nazi. I don't think anybody actually thinks that. But if CNN wanted to fire them, they have every right to do so. Generally, not a good idea, kid, if you're watching at home, don't tweet Nazi stuff even if it's a joke. That's probably a good move for your career.

And I think it's -- actually what's more offensive is with the example Pete gave where people are seriously arguing that make America great again is the new Heil Hitler, America first is fascist. If you have no ideas, you're the most tampered generation in history, you have no idea what it's like to lose your childhood, of your cities bombs, to have them occupied, to have your family member. The idea that a guy on the other side that you don't happen to like is this German dictator from 1933 to 1945, is far more offensive than anything Jeffrey Lord said."

And now you -- now that I'm gone, you're all depressed and edgy and you're trying to figure out how to score some more Scaramooch."

He's following a meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.N Ambassador Nikki Haley. And as soon as we have that, we will bring that to you. But now, it's time for our last segment today. It is time for, \"Wait, What?\" And I will kick things off. I found an article in campus perform today. The new school here in New York City has published an extensive guide on microaggressions. I think we have a screen on that. We've heard a lot about this, but this goes even further to warn students with such behavior is damaging obviously. Its monuments, artworks, any caricatures that are predominately white or cisgender men and women, for instance, could be deemed an environmental microaggression. Finally, professors who fail to ask students for their preferred pronouns or assigned too many readings by white cisgender men are likewise considered guilty of microaggression for students. I'm reminded of one thing in our higher education, a quote by Abraham Lincoln. \"The philosophy of the school room in one generation becomes a philosophy of government in the next.\" They're like people vote for Bernie Sanders since they are taught socialism and cisgenderness."
