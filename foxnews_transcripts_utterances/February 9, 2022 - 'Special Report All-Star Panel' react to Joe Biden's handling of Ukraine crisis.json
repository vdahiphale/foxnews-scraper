Let's bring in our panel, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, former Education Secretary Bill Bennett, and Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Mara, the one key thing that was not specifically agreed to was the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and that's a pipeline that will eventually provide energy, oil, to Germany from Russia.",

But the notion you could just give this money and then this corporation and just takes it and, what, repurposes it for what it wants? That's the kind of crazy. The second issue is what you just mentioned with Jim Jordan, and that is the apparent double standard here, which is that we have these giant tech giants, and they seem to have one standard for one political persuasion and one for the other. I'm not quite sure whether that rises to the level of an FTC investigation or some of these attorney general investigations, but it certainly is something that people need to analyze, especially when some of these guys have the power not just to throw one person off but to de- platform entire apps and services like we saw with Parler during that episode a year ago.",
