Kellyanne did respond, but not to defend her husband, but the president saying that about her husband. It's a pattern. It seems to be a weird one, but a remarkably consistent one, where the president blasts, but those affected don't really blast back. Today, Fox on top of how all this nastiness is going down -- not well -- and when it comes to Republicans on the receiving end of it just letting it go. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I want you to think about that for a second. The president calls George Conway a whack job and a stone-cold loser, and his wife, well, just lets it go. Calls the late John McCain even worse things, yet his old Senate pals largely let it ride. Now, I'm not talking about Georgia's Johnny Isakson, who ripped into the president today, but more like friends like Lindsey Graham, who tweet glowingly of their departed colleague, but curiously avoid offending the president who bashed that old colleague. The same with former Speaker Paul Ryan, who the president ripped for not doing enough to go after Democrats, even after Ryan helped deliver the administration's crowning achievement, that big tax cut that was rejected by all Democrats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then, of course, there's Mitch McConnell, blasted for not doing more to end the filibuster in the Senate, even though McConnell almost single-handedly secured two Supreme Court nominations for the president in the Senate. Maybe these guys figure it is really not worth the fight. Maybe they calculate, you rip him back, he will just rip you to shreds, rarely in person, more coldly, more consistently via tweet. It is how former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson found out he lost his job and how his successor, Mike Pompeo, joked he will find out if he loses his. Just ask Jeff Sessions, a punching bag while in office, until he ultimately lost his office. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So a lot of these guys just swallow their pride and keep taking the hits, hoping that the machine gun friendly fire out of the White House will find yet another target, usually a colleague, usually a friend, but usually the same response, no response. Better to duck and wave and stand up and maybe raise a finger back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } None of this should mask the president's clear victories here, maybe just the Pyrrhic nature of those victories. That's what happens when you take all the credit and you spread all the blame. After a while, even your friends wonder whether you're up to the fight, or whether there are those willing to be in the fight with you, just not now, maybe not even soon. Maybe, in this age at Trump, it is better to take the blows than risk a blowup, no matter how much it hurts you or demeans you or makes average folks wonder whether there is any backbone to you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It is why spouses stay silent when their significant others are bashed and why former speakers leave without a fuss, even when their accomplishments are all but trashed. They figure it is not worth it. And maybe that is the most telling response of all, a silence that isn't only damaging, but all the more so because it is so deafening. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's go to John Roberts at the White House with the fallout from all of this today -- John. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Good afternoon to you, Neil. Don't forget, Reince Priebus was the first one to learn that he was fired by tweet. That was a long time ago now. But this thing that's going on with the president, Kellyanne Conway and her husband, George Conway, really has an unusual pathology to the whole thing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Over the weekend and on Monday, George Conway kept tweeting about the fact that he believed that the president had some sort of mental disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, suggested that the president was not mentally stable enough to hold the office of the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president fought back. Kellyanne Conway stayed silent until today, when she did a brief phone interview with Politico, in which she said of the president -- quote -- \"But do you think he shouldn't respond when somebody, a non-medical professional, accuses him of him having a mental disorder? You think he should just take that sitting down?\" Kellyanne Conway siding with the president over her husband, going on to say: \"The president is obviously defending me. He could privately say to me, honey, you're a distraction. We love you. You will always be part of the family, but go be with your kids. They need you. Go make a million dollars an hour and go do that, honey. It is the opposite.\" So the president and Kellyanne Conway both defending each other.

It's a Lima, Ohio, tank plant where they build M1-A1 Abrams tank. And the president, who renewed his feud with John McCain over the weekend over that dodgy dossier that John McCain said a long time ago he got and thought he would turn it over to the FBI, the president going after McCain on that and his Obamacare vote this afternoon. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Listen to this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

A couple of the Democratic presidential candidates have said that, to pack the court, you should have 15 justices, and you get those justices by having Democrats pick five, Republicans pick five, and then those 10 justices pick five more. The problem with that is obviously Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution makes very clear that the president has the power and authority to nominate and with the advice and consent of the Senate to appoint Supreme Court justices. So, I mean, I don't know what Democrats and Republicans these candidates are talking about, but they certainly can't have justices appoint their colleagues. So that would require an amendment that I just don't think has a snowball's chance anywhere of being ratified. And then, as far as the number itself, the number of justices, that would have to be passed by a statute. The Constitution does not say that there needs to be nine justices, and there haven't always been nine justices. So, theoretically, that -- that's something, that could happen. And that's maybe an argument worth taking seriously. But when FDR did that, it didn't go over -- or when he tried to do that, it didn't go over very well. And -- but it did have an effect. And it kind of intimidated the Supreme Court -- or so that kind of the conventional wisdom goes -- into being more amenable to what he was trying to do with the New Deal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So he didn't get more justices, but he did get a lot of what he wanted done, done.

I would say, over the last year or so -- at least since January -- he's been 95 percent there. I think you could say, based on my sources that are close to him, he's now 99.9 percent there. And they just hesitate to say he's definitely going in there because you never know. When you wake up on the wrong side of the bed, you might say, hey, I have had enough. I'm not going to be able to win. But they're saying he's all but -- he's all but in. And one of the indications you get he's but in is -- again, the reporting that we have been doing is with the Wall Street crowd that follows him. He has about four or five people on Wall Street, very rich guys, billionaires, who are ready to raise money for him. One guy his name Jim Chanos, a major money manager. Jim is what's known as a short seller. He bets stocks go down. He was the guy they uncovered the Enron fraud. He's a very significant player on Wall Street. Another guy, his name is Tom Nides. He's the number two guy at Morgan Stanley. He's the head of the government relations, again, very prominent on Wall Street. Bob Wolf, who's a contributor to our shows, is in that mix. And there's others that I'm probably not mentioning. And he's been speaking with these people. They tell me he's going to have the money to run. Now, whether Wall Street money works now in a Democratic Party is really part of the calculus, I think, as well. I mean, can he get away with getting so much money from Wall Street, when he's running up against the likes of Elizabeth Warren, all these class warfare types, who absolutely hate the Wall Street crowd, even if a lot of the Wall Street crowd are left-of-center moderates? And so if Joe Biden does do it -- and it looks like he is going to do it -- it's going to be a different campaign. He's going to stick out like a sore thumb. He's going to get -- it's going to be a bunch of raving liberals and a couple of socialists and Uncle Joe, kind of the center-left guy that is not afraid to be friends with Republicans and Wall Street guys, sticking out. And he's hoping that sticking out like that is going to get him sticking out of the crowd, maybe get 20 percent of the vote, while the lefties split up the rest.

And if NATO wants to stay relevant, they're going to have to look at, what does NATO exist for? If it's going to be the bulwark against Russian expansion, then they need to get on board and find ways to realize that Russia is not their friend. They need to head them off at the pass.

      "utterance": "The president talking about Kellyanne Conway's husband there. Now, here's the interesting thing about that, though. Kellyanne did respond, but not to defend her husband, but the president saying that about her husband. It's a pattern. It seems to be a weird one, but a remarkably consistent one, where the president blasts, but those affected don't really blast back. Today, Fox on top of how all this nastiness is going down -- not well -- and when it comes to Republicans on the receiving end of it just letting it go. Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto. And I want you to think about that for a second. The president calls George Conway a whack job and a stone-cold loser, and his wife, well, just lets it go. Calls the late John McCain even worse things, yet his old Senate pals largely let it ride. Now, I'm not talking about Georgia's Johnny Isakson, who ripped into the president today, but more like friends like Lindsey Graham, who tweet glowingly of their departed colleague, but curiously avoid offending the president who bashed that old colleague. The same with former Speaker Paul Ryan, who the president ripped for not doing enough to go after Democrats, even after Ryan helped deliver the administration's crowning achievement, that big tax cut that was rejected by all Democrats. Then, of course, there's Mitch McConnell, blasted for not doing more to end the filibuster in the Senate, even though McConnell almost single-handedly secured two Supreme Court nominations for the president in the Senate. Maybe these guys figure it is really not worth the fight. Maybe they calculate, you rip him back, he will just rip you to shreds, rarely in person, more coldly, more consistently via tweet. It is how former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson found out he lost his job and how his successor, Mike Pompeo, joked he will find out if he loses his. Just ask Jeff Sessions, a punching bag while in office, until he ultimately lost his office. So a lot of these guys just swallow their pride and keep taking the hits, hoping that the machine gun friendly fire out of the White House will find yet another target, usually a colleague, usually a friend, but usually the same response, no response. Better to duck and wave and stand up and maybe raise a finger back. None of this should mask the president's clear victories here, maybe just the Pyrrhic nature of those victories. That's what happens when you take all the credit and you spread all the blame. After a while, even your friends wonder whether you're up to the fight, or whether there are those willing to be in the fight with you, just not now, maybe not even soon. Maybe, in this age at Trump, it is better to take the blows than risk a blowup, no matter how much it hurts you or demeans you or makes average folks wonder whether there is any backbone to you. It is why spouses stay silent when their significant others are bashed and why former speakers leave without a fuss, even when their accomplishments are all but trashed. They figure it is not worth it. And maybe that is the most telling response of all, a silence that isn't only damaging, but all the more so because it is so deafening. Let's go to John Roberts at the White House with the fallout from all of this today -- John."

      "utterance": "Good afternoon to you, Neil. Don't forget, Reince Priebus was the first one to learn that he was fired by tweet. That was a long time ago now. But this thing that's going on with the president, Kellyanne Conway and her husband, George Conway, really has an unusual pathology to the whole thing. Over the weekend and on Monday, George Conway kept tweeting about the fact that he believed that the president had some sort of mental disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, suggested that the president was not mentally stable enough to hold the office of the president. The president fought back. Kellyanne Conway stayed silent until today, when she did a brief phone interview with Politico, in which she said of the president -- quote -- \"But do you think he shouldn't respond when somebody, a non-medical professional, accuses him of him having a mental disorder? You think he should just take that sitting down?\""

They need you. Go make a million dollars an hour and go do that, honey. It is the opposite.\" So the president and Kellyanne Conway both defending each other. And, meanwhile, Kellyanne Conway's husband, George, is kind of out there twisting in the wind by himself. There are some people who speculate that maybe the two Conways are setting themselves up for a Carville-Matalin sort of thing after Kellyanne Conway leaves the White House. But that is only rank speculation. The president also this afternoon -- and this just happened, Neil -- going after Senator John McCain again in a huge way at the only plant left in the United States that builds tanks. It's a Lima, Ohio, tank plant where they build M1-A1 Abrams tank. And the president, who renewed his feud with John McCain over the weekend over that dodgy dossier that John McCain said a long time ago he got and thought he would turn it over to the FBI, the president going after McCain on that and his Obamacare vote this afternoon.

Contrast that to what the president did, and actually tried to use that information, created an open line of communication with the Russians, who very clearly meddled in our elections. And that part can't go unchecked. In terms of what it's doing with our discourse, this falls way below the level of the office, whether we're talking about attacking John McCain. Again, sure, I guess you're free to criticize, but to what end? What is he at all hoping to get out of this? There's a very solid Republican base that actually likes John McCain. So he's not doing any -- he's not doing himself any favors by going after him. He's not doing himself any favors by name-calling Kellyanne Conway's husband on Twitter.

Again, this is my opinion, but I am wondering about the muted response he gets from Republicans, who maybe don't want to trigger a Twitter war or a back and forth, so they suck it up and they take it, realizing he is the leader of their party, the leader this country. I get that. I understand that. I can even kind of respect that. But there is a line that, now and then, they can cross, or at least test it, can't they?"

So to what you were saying, that's what he was talking about, switched to John McCain. He did come back to that message and continue to talk about the economy. As for the president's anger at John McCain, I remember being in the Rose Garden on the day when John McCain came back to -- back from Arizona. Remember, he had been in treatment."

Guys, I appreciate all of you taking your time and your perspective on this. But it occurs on the same day we're getting a number of Democrats responding in the weirdest of ways themselves, including the push to shake up the Supreme Court by just adding a lot of people to the Supreme Court. The son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia on that -- after this."

Well, it's a different theme this year among the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, all in an overhauling the Supreme Court, maybe by including just more justices on the bench and imposing term limits to what is now a lifetime appointment. The son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia on that, co-editor of Scalia Speaks, Chris Scalia. Chris, very good to have you."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What do you make of this here, this push right now, maybe if we had more justices, we could spread this out, there wouldn't be one dominant -- obviously, the intent -- a conservative edge on the bench. What would your dad think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALIA",
      "utterance": "Well, it's pretty clear that one element of what some of the candidates are suggesting is just unconstitutional. A couple of the Democratic presidential candidates have said that, to pack the court, you should have 15 justices, and you get those justices by having Democrats pick five, Republicans pick five, and then those 10 justices pick five more. The problem with that is obviously Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution makes very clear that the president has the power and authority to nominate and with the advice and consent of the Senate to appoint Supreme Court justices. So, I mean, I don't know what Democrats and Republicans these candidates are talking about, but they certainly can't have justices appoint their colleagues. So that would require an amendment that I just don't think has a snowball's chance anywhere of being ratified. And then, as far as the number itself, the number of justices, that would have to be passed by a statute. The Constitution does not say that there needs to be nine justices, and there haven't always been nine justices. So, theoretically, that -- that's something, that could happen. And that's maybe an argument worth taking seriously. But when FDR did that, it didn't go over -- or when he tried to do that, it didn't go over very well. And -- but it did have an effect. And it kind of intimidated the Supreme Court -- or so that kind of the conventional wisdom goes -- into being more amenable to what he was trying to do with the New Deal. So he didn't get more justices, but he did get a lot of what he wanted done, done. And it's possible that the Democrats, just by -- by raising this threat of packing the court, are trying to do something similar."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Others have expressed resentment, that is, among Supreme Court justices, even today attending any president's State of the Union address, for fear that they're going to be dragged into the political back and forth. How do you think he would feel in this environment right now?"

    {
      "speaker": "SCALIA",
      "utterance": "Well, again, I do think it was something he saw coming to a large degree. He saw how politicized things were getting even when he was on the court, and he spoke about that a lot. I don't know that he would be terribly surprised by some of these court-packing ideas. I think one of the problems we're seeing here is that it -- this goes back to the early 2000s, when Democrats filibustered a lot of President Bush's nominees. And Republicans responded in kind by filibustering a lot of Obama's nominees. And so the Democrats responded by ending the filibuster for lower court nominees. And then Republicans, when the Democrats filibustered Gorsuch, Republicans got rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees."

      "utterance": "All right, we had a weird kind of market today, actually two markets, because around 12:30 p.m. Eastern time, the Dow was diving, with the president saying that tariffs on China should stay in place for a while. That rattled them. Then, at 2:00 p.m., the Dow was rallying, as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, signaled maybe no more hikes at all. By day's end, we were still down about 141 points. So maybe the fear about trade went out. Let's go to Alan Knuckman, market watcher extraordinaire, former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank adviser Danielle DiMartino Booth. Danielle, first to you on your old Fed buddies and what they signaled, that there are no hikes coming, or at least that's the perception. Normally, that would be a relief to the markets. Not today. What happened?"

They said, not only no rate hikes in 2019, but a majority of the members said that there wouldn't be any rate hikes also next year. So -- and they changed the verbiage of the statement. They alluded to consumption being weak, as in the household, to business investment weakening. So this was more than just alluding to weakness overseas or the trade war weighing on businesses. This was a nod to the U.S. economy slowing. And I think that that's how the market eventually interpreted it by the end of the day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "That's very interesting, because, Alan, you could take that away to say, all right, well, if the Federal Reserve is inclined not to hike for awhile, they must be worried about something, right?"

    {
      "speaker": "ALAN KNUCKMAN, BULLS EYE OPTION",
      "utterance": "If you're a warrior. Now, for me, there's no surprises here. Nothing new. We have talked about this months ago, that the markets were telling us that there was not going to be any rate hikes in 2019. If you look up to 2020, maybe the worry is there's going to be a rate cut. If you look at the Eurodollar futures contracts, that's forecasting possibly a cut at the end of 2020. So let's wait and see. Maybe that's what tempered the enthusiasm after the announcement here today."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNUCKMAN",

We're on a path, an upward path for 10 years. Nothing has changed. We were so worried about rates, if you remember last year. And now if you look at a mortgage rates, the 10-year note, we have got yields below where they were at this time last year. So that's been taken off the table. I like the strength of the market. Let's look at the Nasdaq. Tech made new highs say, highest since October, up 25 percent off the lows. So it's still up, up and away day."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "utterance": "No, he's great. And he's so good at what he does, as are you, Danielle. So if I'm looking at mortgage rates, and a lot of people listen and wonder, all right, where am I going with mortgage rates, it sounds like they're not going to budge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIMARTINO BOOTH",
      "utterance": "Well, it looks like actually mortgage rates are going to come down even more, Neil, given where the bond market closed out the day. We're at -- the 10-year yield is at 2.53 percent. That goes below kind of the Armageddon 2.55 level of December. And as we saw out this morning from the Mortgage Bankers Association, purchases -- applications to purchase a home were flat year over year. And I think that that is indicative of the fact that, even with falling mortgage rates, you're not getting the traction. Jay Powell is not getting the traction that he would like to see out of residential housing. And, again, I think that that is signaling potentially -- with all due deference to Alan -- potentially a weakening in the economy."

      "utterance": "Yes, following it a lot, Neil. I mean, this is a process I think that Joe Biden has been going through for about two years, trying to figure out whether he wants to run. I would say, over the last year or so -- at least since January -- he's been 95 percent there. I think you could say, based on my sources that are close to him, he's now 99.9 percent there. And they just hesitate to say he's definitely going in there because you never know. When you wake up on the wrong side of the bed, you might say, hey, I have had enough. I'm not going to be able to win. But they're saying he's all but -- he's all but in. And one of the indications you get he's but in is -- again, the reporting that we have been doing is with the Wall Street crowd that follows him. He has about four or five people on Wall Street, very rich guys, billionaires, who are ready to raise money for him. One guy his name Jim Chanos, a major money manager. Jim is what's known as a short seller. He bets stocks go down. He was the guy they uncovered the Enron fraud. He's a very significant player on Wall Street. Another guy, his name is Tom Nides. He's the number two guy at Morgan Stanley. He's the head of the government relations, again, very prominent on Wall Street. Bob Wolf, who's a contributor to our shows, is in that mix. And there's others that I'm probably not mentioning. And he's been speaking with these people. They tell me he's going to have the money to run. Now, whether Wall Street money works now in a Democratic Party is really part of the calculus, I think, as well. I mean, can he get away with getting so much money from Wall Street, when he's running up against the likes of Elizabeth Warren, all these class warfare types, who absolutely hate the Wall Street crowd, even if a lot of the Wall Street crowd are left-of-center moderates? And so if Joe Biden does do it -- and it looks like he is going to do it -- it's going to be a different campaign. He's going to stick out like a sore thumb. He's going to get -- it's going to be a bunch of raving liberals and a couple of socialists and Uncle Joe, kind of the center-left guy that is not afraid to be friends with Republicans and Wall Street guys, sticking out. And he's hoping that sticking out like that is going to get him sticking out of the crowd, maybe get 20 percent of the vote, while the lefties split up the rest. I mean, that is his calculus, I am told -- back to you."

      "utterance": "But let me ask you about that money issue. Let's say he does raise a record amount, but it's not in the small denominations that Beto O'Rourke got or that Kamala Harris got. Would his colleagues then quickly say, oh, you're trapped to the big bankers and the big Wall Street guys? Beto can come back and say, well, I had the people with me. You know how that goes, that it's not just the money. It's where you're getting it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, listen, in the old days, it wasn't so bad being associated with Wall Street, right? Bill Clinton was associated with Wall Street. Hillary before the last election was associated with them. I mean, it was good to be associated with moderate, the centrist -- centrist, mildly liberal Wall Street guys that made money, but wanted to make the world a better place. It's just so -- the Democratic Party now is just so turned upside down that, even if you're a liberal -- moderate liberal guy that works on Wall Street or woman who wants to make the world a better place, doesn't mind paying a little more taxes, but you're not anti-capitalist, that's a black mark against you. And I think he's got to know that. I think, though, his calculus is this, Neil. He knows the party has changed. He knows it's going off the deep end on the left. But his calculus is this. Maybe he can get through the primaries, because he has enough of a vote, of a voting bloc. You see the polls."

      "utterance": "OK. Thank you, my friend, Charlie Gasparino. He's the best in the business and is joining us out of Washington. All right, in the meantime here, the president was saying today via a little drawing, a map he was showing, how ISIS is all but gone, in fact, that it will be finished by tonight. The former USS Cole Commander Kirk Lippold on whether he's right -- after this."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, the president again declaring victory over ISIS while speaking at that tank factory in Ohio. But where does ISIS really stand? Are they really on the run or gone, as the president seemed to intimate, maybe by tonight? The former USS Cole Commander Kirk Lippold with us. Commander, is he right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK LIPPOLD, FORMER COMMANDER, USS COLE",
      "utterance": "He's right in the fact that the physical territory that they actually control is one small little dot. But is ISIS really gone? No. You can't kill an ideology. And it's going to take time. What we have really done is under this president invest in the destruction of their capability to gain and control territory from which they can train and teach operatives how to go out there and conduct terror attacks. Will attacks continue? Probably. But will they continue to the extent and with the lethality we have seen before? No."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "One of the many things I have learned over the many years, having the honor of speaking with you and your service to this great country, is that terror groups can morph. They morph into something that we -- we always remember the Taliban that morphed into another group, Boko Haram, and they combined. And then all of a sudden you have ISIS, and on and on, and Al Qaeda, back and forth, back and forth. So they could become a new entity. But the president is saying, ISIS as we know it is on the run. Is he accurate saying that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIPPOLD",
      "utterance": "I would say he is. You have to remember, with terror groups, they tend to be proactive in what they do. They can look for ability to adapt. They can look for the ability to try new techniques and tactics against their opponents, and against countries they're going after, whereas other countries tend to be reactive in nature, which means that they're always having to play a little bit behind. And the key is going to be to be able to get ahead of that, to understand where they're going, what they're doing. That's driven by the intelligence world to hopefully get inside of that loop in how they actually conduct those operations to head them off and to hopefully kill those who are doing the planning."

      "utterance": "Commander, if I could switch gears a little bit to NATO and, more importantly, to Germany saying that it will not be able to make good on that 2 percent commitment to defense spending, for a variety of reasons. I'm sure that's going to kick off a lot of people at the White House. Already, our ambassador to Germany has said it's a very disappointing move. But what did you make of that and, furthermore, the indication, at least out of Angela Merkel, she has no intention to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIPPOLD",
      "utterance": "I think when you look at the NATO alliance, and especially with Germany, that is going to be more and more of a problematic relationship in the future. When you look at what Germany is doing in building relationships with Russia, when they're building the Nord Stream II pipeline that is going to get Europe more addicted to Russian natural gas, there are all kinds of complications. When you look at what Germany did even in the post-9/11 days, while they supported us, it wasn't with combat troops. So the bottom line is, Germany is going to continue to remain a problem. And if NATO wants to stay relevant, they're going to have to look at, what does NATO exist for? If it's going to be the bulwark against Russian expansion, then they need to get on board and find ways to realize that Russia is not their friend. They need to head them off at the pass. You don't want to feed the beast that is going to be coming after you, which is exactly what Germany is doing today. So I think Angela Merkel has got a lot on her hands, not just in aggravating the United States, but more with the alliance in toto, because all these other countries look to Germany to be a leader on the continent. And, right now, they're not."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIPPOLD",
      "utterance": "Disappointing, to say the least. The man is a war hero. He is an American who dedicated a life of service to the nation. No, it wasn't perfect. Yes, John McCain was a political animal, but made decisions that suited the politics of the moment best in some cases. But, at the end of the day, he chose a life of consequence and service to this nation. He has passed. He is dead. President Trump needs to let this go, let the man lie with honor and move on. It's time to be forward- looking, not backward-thinking, in how the president is tweeting him."

As the commander was speaking, we're just learning now that the U.S. Senate committee, the Commerce Committee, wants to meet with Boeing and other manufacturers to testify at a future hearing -- they're not indicating a date -- to get to the bottom of that 737 MAX imbroglio. We will have more after this."
