The term white privilege is probably overused. I prefer the term white preference. White preference goes back to the 1940s when the Clark Doll Study was done, where you had two psychologists that put a white baby doll in front of a black baby doll in front of black children, where those black children in a segregated society shows the white baby doll as the one who was well-behaved, as the one that was smart, as the one that was beautiful.

On any given night, more than a half a million people sleep outside in this country. It's enough people to fill Yankee Stadium 10 times over. There are more homeless people in America right now then active duty troops in the U.S. Army. In fact, if the homeless had their own state, it would have as many people as Wyoming does. Over the last two years, even as the economy has grown, the homeless population has grown with it, in fact outstripped its growth. Who are these people -- these hundreds of thousands of people and how did they get there? And why? And what are we doing about it? What is this anyway? Well, the West Coast is the epicenter of the problem and we sent our producer, Charles Cougar on an eight-day journey there to seven states -- cities rather -- in three states. What he found was what you'd expect, but it was still shocking. Heroin addicts living along freeways in Seattle, a college town desperately trying to clear it sidewalks so people could walk. RV dwellers living next to the richest people in the world. Tent cities in one of the poorest places in California where housing costs are zero. Across the West, we found places in America that are almost third world in their decay and disorganization and the chaos. Often, we found homelessness and rampant drug use in places you would never expect to see them. This is a complicated problem. There's no obvious solution, at least no obvious one solution. One explanation you hear is that it's a mental health problem. And people say the government contributed to the crisis when it started discharging patients from mental hospitals and shutting those hospitals in 1960s. And there's truth in that. Clearly, it's a factor. But it doesn't explain everything. Government estimates that just about 25 percent of our homeless population is severely mentally ill, and that seemed about right. We are struck by how many of the homeless we talked to were not mentally ill. Many were totally coherent. Some of them were witty, even. Another explanation is that sky-high housing prices in places like California forced families out of their homes, and that can be a factor, too. But it's not the overall answer to the question of what's going on because we found in homelessness in places where the real estate market had collapsed, in places where apartment rentals go for just a few hundred bucks a month, where working class people can afford to live. So really, it's a question of drug addiction, alcoholism, financial problems, healthcare costs, housing costs and family dissolution. They're all part of the cause of homelessness. In fact, in every story we listened to, at least some of those factors play the role. But it's still confusing exactly what's going on. So to find out, we begin in San Francisco, one of the richest places on earth. San Francisco has more billionaires per capita than any city in the world. The reason, well, nearby Silicon Valley, it has generating unprecedented wealth. There were several multibillion dollar IPOs this year alone. But beneath this wealth is extreme inequality. The city of San Francisco has thousands of homeless people living on the sidewalks. If you've been there recently, you know that that's true. The city has a flourishing drug scene. Some of neighborhoods have opened their heroin markets in broad daylight. Cops do nothing about them. So despite its booming economy, San Francisco has lost its grip on its homeless problem and it is struggling to provide basic services. Here's what we found when we went there.",

The epicenter of homelessness in San Francisco is the tenderloin neighborhood. It's just blocks from tourist attractions like Union Square and major thoroughfares like Market Street. In the tenderloin, we saw junkie shooting up in broad daylight and homeless people wielding makeshift knives. One threatened to stab our camera crew because we were filming there. In this video, a mother and daughter wait for a public bus standing just feet from a drug-addled man who is too intoxicated to put on his own coat. The city has about 470 intravenous drug users per square mile. One reason so many homeless congregate in the area is a place called Glide Memorial Church. Like the city around it, Glide is political and post Christian. Back in the 60s, it removed its crosses to be more welcoming. This man was out cold on a sidewalk just blocks from the church; next to him, a partially eaten birthday cake, syringes that the city passes out and water packets that help addicts cook heroin on the street. How does this city this rich get so dirty? One reason, San Francisco no longer enforces quality of life citations like sleeping on the sidewalk or public urination. The city used to use citations as leverage to get people off the streets. But in 2016, a liberal judge called Christopher Hite, flushed all 64,000 outstanding warrants for quality of life crimes -- everyone from 2011 to 2015.

One consequence of not enforcing those laws -- rampant drug abuse well beyond the tenderloin. We videotaped this man shooting up heroin right in front of City Hall in broad daylight. Here's a picture of two people shooting up at Mission Dolores Park -- a three bedroom row house right next to these junkies currently sells for $6 million.

Yet the entire Oberlin College community viewed this exclusively through a racial prism, through a racial lens, a white store owner arrest or has the police arrest three black students, and that really set the tone for the last two years. There were protests organized outside the bakery that were so aggressive and so many people, hundreds of people that there's been testimony at the trial that the police considered calling in the riot squad to quell the protest, and as was reported, there were also indications that college officials, if not participated in these, at least fostered them.

Over time, Confederate soldiers were buried there, other soldiers were exhumed going back to the Revolutionary War and buried there, and it was kind of the time of arrival for a generation of new soldiers, when their war -- became time to be buried there whether it was the Spanish American War, World War I or World War II. Then of course, you had the addition after World War I of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Those three unknowns at one time stood for all the unknown soldiers that were still left overseas.

How much will all of that cost this country? Who will pay for it? How many more doctors and nurses will we need to provide that healthcare? How many more hospitals and clinics will we have to build? Joe Biden said we'd have to build some. How many? Well, no one is saying. No one is saying anything precisely about it. They haven't thought about the details. That's odd.

And let's go beyond just these two candidates because I think it's unfair to create some microcosm to explain a macrocosm of race in this societal construct. The term white privilege is probably overused. I prefer the term white preference. White preference goes back to the 1940s when the Clark Doll Study was done, where you had two psychologists that put a white baby doll in front of a black baby doll in front of black children, where those black children in a segregated society shows the white baby doll as the one who was well-behaved, as the one that was smart, as the one that was beautiful.

Last Friday Milano tweeted this quote, \"Our reproductive rights are being erased. Until women have legal control over our own bodies, we just cannot risk pregnancy. Join me in not having sex until we get our bodily autonomy back. I'm calling for #SexStrike. Pass it on.\" Author and columnist Mark Steyn Stein joins us tonight.

It's actually fantastically worded. \"We just cannot risk pregnancy, join me by not having sex.\" So on the on the day that Doris Day dies, we are basically back to the sexual morality of Doris Day young at heart circa 1954 in which Hollywood actresses now promoting chasteness because the risks of pregnancy from having sex are too high.

How did this happen? And why have our cities given up on it? Next, we're debuting a week-long series on those exact questions. We sent a reporter out for eight days all over the West Coast. First up San Francisco. Stay tuned for the beginning of our series."

      "utterance": "Suddenly, in big American cities, the homeless seem to be everywhere and that's not your imagination. On any given night, more than a half a million people sleep outside in this country. It's enough people to fill Yankee Stadium 10 times over. There are more homeless people in America right now then active duty troops in the U.S. Army. In fact, if the homeless had their own state, it would have as many people as Wyoming does. Over the last two years, even as the economy has grown, the homeless population has grown with it, in fact outstripped its growth. Who are these people -- these hundreds of thousands of people and how did they get there? And why? And what are we doing about it? What is this anyway? Well, the West Coast is the epicenter of the problem and we sent our producer, Charles Cougar on an eight-day journey there to seven states -- cities rather -- in three states. What he found was what you'd expect, but it was still shocking. Heroin addicts living along freeways in Seattle, a college town desperately trying to clear it sidewalks so people could walk. RV dwellers living next to the richest people in the world. Tent cities in one of the poorest places in California where housing costs are zero. Across the West, we found places in America that are almost third world in their decay and disorganization and the chaos. Often, we found homelessness and rampant drug use in places you would never expect to see them. This is a complicated problem. There's no obvious solution, at least no obvious one solution. One explanation you hear is that it's a mental health problem. And people say the government contributed to the crisis when it started discharging patients from mental hospitals and shutting those hospitals in 1960s. And there's truth in that. Clearly, it's a factor. But it doesn't explain everything. Government estimates that just about 25 percent of our homeless population is severely mentally ill, and that seemed about right. We are struck by how many of the homeless we talked to were not mentally ill. Many were totally coherent. Some of them were witty, even. Another explanation is that sky-high housing prices in places like California forced families out of their homes, and that can be a factor, too. But it's not the overall answer to the question of what's going on because we found in homelessness in places where the real estate market had collapsed, in places where apartment rentals go for just a few hundred bucks a month, where working class people can afford to live. So really, it's a question of drug addiction, alcoholism, financial problems, healthcare costs, housing costs and family dissolution. They're all part of the cause of homelessness. In fact, in every story we listened to, at least some of those factors play the role. But it's still confusing exactly what's going on. So to find out, we begin in San Francisco, one of the richest places on earth. San Francisco has more billionaires per capita than any city in the world. The reason, well, nearby Silicon Valley, it has generating unprecedented wealth. There were several multibillion dollar IPOs this year alone. But beneath this wealth is extreme inequality. The city of San Francisco has thousands of homeless people living on the sidewalks. If you've been there recently, you know that that's true. The city has a flourishing drug scene. Some of neighborhoods have opened their heroin markets in broad daylight. Cops do nothing about them. So despite its booming economy, San Francisco has lost its grip on its homeless problem and it is struggling to provide basic services. Here's what we found when we went there."

In this video, a mother and daughter wait for a public bus standing just feet from a drug-addled man who is too intoxicated to put on his own coat. The city has about 470 intravenous drug users per square mile. One reason so many homeless congregate in the area is a place called Glide Memorial Church. Like the city around it, Glide is political and post Christian. Back in the 60s, it removed its crosses to be more welcoming. This man was out cold on a sidewalk just blocks from the church; next to him, a partially eaten birthday cake, syringes that the city passes out and water packets that help addicts cook heroin on the street. How does this city this rich get so dirty? One reason, San Francisco no longer enforces quality of life citations like sleeping on the sidewalk or public urination. The city used to use citations as leverage to get people off the streets. But in 2016, a liberal judge called Christopher Hite, flushed all 64,000 outstanding warrants for quality of life crimes -- everyone from 2011 to 2015. But it's not just quality of life crimes, San Francisco now finds it difficult to enforce any law."

Police Station in the tenderloin complained that it's impossible to get convictions against drug dealers, so they don't even try to enforce the law. One officer told \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" that the police now allow criminals to operate, even when cops know who they are and what they're up to. One consequence of not enforcing those laws -- rampant drug abuse well beyond the tenderloin. We videotaped this man shooting up heroin right in front of City Hall in broad daylight. Here's a picture of two people shooting up at Mission Dolores Park -- a three bedroom row house right next to these junkies currently sells for $6 million. City officials are well aware of the problems San Francisco residents have reported, feces and syringe complaints on nearly every block of the city. Former Mayor Mark Farrell told local media that even he had stepped on a huge needle once at the Civic Center Plaza right near downtown. But nothing is changing. Despite the reports and the money that San Francisco spends on cleaning it streets, we found syringes and human feces all over the city."

Students and staff at Oberlin College have attacked a bakery, called it racist for trying to stop a trio of shoplifters who had pled guilty to shoplifting assault. Now, that bakery is fighting to regain its reputation. Interesting story after the break."

And then a couple of weeks ago, he accidentally destroyed his career. How did he do that? By telling a joke. As the Carrier prepared for a visit from the Vice President Pence, Carter instructed his men to quote, \"clap like we're at a strip club.\" Not a bad line, kind of amusing, actually. But the feminists didn't like it. They said it was inappropriate. They never bothered to explain why it was inappropriate. They never do explain. They just destroyed his career. Carter has now resigned and is going into retirement. Keep in mind that the Navy's job -- the military's job -- is to protect this country. Does turning it into a PC hellhole make us safer? Do we create more effective military leaders when we crush anyone who offends the Women's Studies Department at Brown? Probably not. Our bully class doesn't care though. To them, the military is just another place to tyrannize. Hopefully, the war we will eventually lose over all of this isn't too important. We're hoping that. Well in Ohio, three Oberlin College students were arrested after shoplifting from a bakery. In response, the bakery was denounced as racist. Now the bakery is suing Oberlin for damaging their reputation. Interesting story. Trace Gallagher has the latest on this tonight -- Trace."

At issue is an incident from November 2016 where three black Oberlin Ohio college students went into Gibson's Bakery, tried to use a fake ID and stole some bottles of wine. Allen Gibson, the son of the bakery's owner confronted the students and police say by the time they arrived, Gibson was on the ground being punched. The students initially claimed they were racially profiled, but then admitted they did use fake IDs, did steal the wine, and that there was no racism. A follow up police investigation also found that accusations of racism were baseless. But lawyers for the bakery say that did not stop Oberlin College from quote \"declaring war on Gibson's\" including a boycott and several protests involving hundreds of students chanting \"No justice, no peace.\" Watch."

Gibson's alleges the College and Dean of Students interfered with the bakery's business relationships that go back 130 years.

The student body was very upset. The students -- the three black students get arrested for shoplifting. They were in fact shoplifting. Yet the entire Oberlin College community viewed this exclusively through a racial prism, through a racial lens, a white store owner arrest or has the police arrest three black students, and that really set the tone for the last two years. There were protests organized outside the bakery that were so aggressive and so many people, hundreds of people that there's been testimony at the trial that the police considered calling in the riot squad to quell the protest, and as was reported, there were also indications that college officials, if not participated in these, at least fostered them. And so what you had was the worst of identity politics, really the worst of our politics, which judges everything, not based on the facts of what happened, but through a racial lens."

And the funny thing is he went to Trump Tower today, as you mentioned to bring attention to some sweeping climate change regulations and legislative changes that New York City just made, which he hasn't signed into law yet by the way. But also to take aim at President Trump because President Trump owns eight buildings that don't meet these standards that this new legislation set, so President Trump can end up facing about $2.1 million in fines if he doesn't meet these standards by 2030. But what happened is there were protesters and so, it really turned it into an embarrassing circus for de Blasio when you had protesters riding up and down with signs saying \"worst Mayor ever,\" blasting music, heckling him, and when pressed, he couldn't name other landlords that had you know, these sort of high emissions outside of President Trump. So what he came to do was to draw attention to his environmental record and what ended up happening is he ended up embarrassing himself."

I personally, in my 16 months there probably conducted 400 or 500 funerals. A lot of those funerals are for the heroes of the last generations of World War II and Korean, my day; increasingly, Vietnam today. Unfortunately, we had to form active duty funerals on occasion as well, not as many now as we did in 2007 and 2008, of course, but despite that volume of funerals, the Old Guard approaches funerals with a no fail zero defect mindset. The standard is always perfection to give that one last, indelible image of honor for the family and for the loved ones and to show everyone else who sees them the kind of honor that we pay to those who give the ultimate sacrifice for our nation."

Arlington really is a place that kind of brings the entire country together. There are no Democrats or Republicans there. There are no liberals or conservatives. We bury people of all races, of all ages, from all the various wars that our nation has fought over the last 60 or 70 years. And really Arlington has played that role in our nation's history since it was birthed in the most divisive time in our nation's history. I mean, Arlington's birth in the Civil War 155 years ago today, as a matter of fact, Private William Christman was buried on May 13 1864 on the old Castis-Lee Plantation, and that was really the origins of Arlington National Cemetery. Over time, Confederate soldiers were buried there, other soldiers were exhumed going back to the Revolutionary War and buried there, and it was kind of the time of arrival for a generation of new soldiers, when their war -- became time to be buried there whether it was the Spanish American War, World War I or World War II. Then of course, you had the addition after World War I of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Those three unknowns at one time stood for all the unknown soldiers that were still left overseas. But today they've really become the kind of place of national mourning, the place that more than four million Americans go every single year to pay tribute to our fallen heroes."

You know, the Old Guard doesn't just perform in Arlington either. It also goes to Dover Air Force Base to perform the dignified transfer remains. I probably did that mission 25 or 30 times in my 16 months at the Old Guard, you know, carrying the flag-draped remains of my fellow comrades in arms who just died a few hours earlier overseas.

It's a reminder of the consequences of failure in policymaking that we do have that sacred duty to honor those who have fallen, but also to provide for those who come after them, who are going to be fighting tomorrow's wars, to make sure we care for them. And I describe all that in \"Sacred Duty,\" and that mindset that the he Old Guard has to achieve that standard of perfection, that ethos of excellence that really can apply in everyone's life no matter what they do, but for their military, especially for the soldiers who honor our fallen heroes at Arlington is absolutely essential."
