Our military leaders have allegedly told President Biden that he'll need to make a decision on whether to extend the deadline to withdraw forces from Afghanistan, because that's the correct order for an evacuation. First, you give up control of the airport, then try to fly everyone home. That's as smart as putting on a helmet after you were shot out of a cannon, which is what I think happened to Joe at some point in his life. But it shows you the intellectual constipation that paralyzes our so-called leaders. They extended wars indefinitely lost lives and billions and billions of dollars, but at least the paperwork is in order. Meanwhile, the Taliban says they've drawn a red line on deadlines. And you know, they mean it. It's not an Obama red line in Syria, which he enforced as well as the COVID rules at his birthday party. So glad I skip that. But the Taliban issuing orders to us, it's like pouring salt on the wound. It's like after being fired and security telling you, you know, no, you can't take your unicorn coffee mug with you that belongs to the company. But here, the Taliban got everything, including the coffee mug. Did you see all the weaponry, guys? This doesn't make them celebrate Christmas. Nothing will. It's practically impossible to get a long rifle in New York City to shoot rats. We just handed over thousands of rifles and shotguns and howitzers to a group of radical Muslim fighters. They're now in equal footing with a middle school in Chicago. We paid for all of that, and some of that would likely be used against us later. So as we watch this calamity continue to unfold, we should probably stop listening to our leaders and start listening to our troops more like this fellow here.",

What is irresponsible is abandoning Americans there, abandoning our allies on the global stage and on the ground there. Rep. Waltz point it out that no surrounding, no single surrounding country right now will let Americans have a presence, let alone conduct operations there. And the U.K. was blindsided, it was a NATO mission. So, if we think that we have any allies that will back us up, that's all faded as well. Rep. Banks pointed out that now the Taliban has more Blackhawks than 85 percent of the planet, right, in addition to $85 billion worth of equipment, and that means Al-Qaeda is about to have it, that means ISIS chaos is about to have it, along with the countless deaths that will be on walkaway Joe's watch. And remember, this is against the backdrop of the Taliban saying, if we stay there after August 31st to evacuate Americans and other allies, that's an extended occupation. That's how they view our presence there. So, if Biden thinks that there's peace in our future, he's more delusional than we thought.",

And he found that quote many of the President's allies fear he will lose the confidence of the moderate swing voters, perverts. The Afghanistan mess and COVID may have Biden sliding down more polls than a greased up stripper. Shout out to Hunter. Democrats with dampened election prospects are acting like that horse in The Godfather, they need ahead. And anonymous democratic politician admitted that someone Biden to can National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to change the narrative, because that's all they care about, the narrative, the politics, it's never really about people. So, why not fire someone instead of trying to solve the problems that your party created? That's just too much work.

But I'll say this, that the most problematic thing to me was actually his second sentence where he said, you know, people who aren't vaccinated probably don't want to see my movies anyway. That type of broad brush thinking the assumption that people's positions they hold on the vaccines or their questions they have about it, that it's automatically political, that it's a certain politics that he ascribes to it, that it can't be connected to anything else. That's the problem. That's why these Hollywood elite are so disgusting, because it's that smugness that comes out where they Oh, I know exactly why you're not vaccinated. You have no idea, man.",

Our military leaders have allegedly told President Biden that he'll need to make a decision on whether to extend the deadline to withdraw forces from Afghanistan, because that's the correct order for an evacuation. First, you give up control of the airport, then try to fly everyone home. That's as smart as putting on a helmet after you were shot out of a cannon, which is what I think happened to Joe at some point in his life. But it shows you the intellectual constipation that paralyzes our so-called leaders. They extended wars indefinitely lost lives and billions and billions of dollars, but at least the paperwork is in order. Meanwhile, the Taliban says they've drawn a red line on deadlines. And you know, they mean it. It's not an Obama red line in Syria, which he enforced as well as the COVID rules at his birthday party. So glad I skip that. But the Taliban issuing orders to us, it's like pouring salt on the wound. It's like after being fired and security telling you, you know, no, you can't take your unicorn coffee mug with you that belongs to the company. But here, the Taliban got everything, including the coffee mug. Did you see all the weaponry, guys? This doesn't make them celebrate Christmas. Nothing will. It's practically impossible to get a long rifle in New York City to shoot rats. We just handed over thousands of rifles and shotguns and howitzers to a group of radical Muslim fighters. They're now in equal footing with a middle school in Chicago. We paid for all of that, and some of that would likely be used against us later. So as we watch this calamity continue to unfold, we should probably stop listening to our leaders and start listening to our troops more like this fellow here."

To use an adage, we all enjoy the sausage, we just don't want to see how it's made. But now this catastrophic end shows us the sausage in reverse. And it sucks. I take some responsibility. I'm one of millions who got distracted by the life of nonstop attention-grabbing entertainment. As I lose myself in the bachelor and peloton there unfolded a mess based on decades of incompetent leadership and corruption. Meanwhile, our media fussed over pronouns and toxic masculinity.

And going back to Jen Psaki's comments to Peter Doocy about, you know, calling it irresponsible to call it stranded. What is irresponsible is abandoning Americans there, abandoning our allies on the global stage and on the ground there. Rep. Waltz point it out that no surrounding, no single surrounding country right now will let Americans have a presence, let alone conduct operations there. And the U.K. was blindsided, it was a NATO mission. So, if we think that we have any allies that will back us up, that's all faded as well. Rep. Banks pointed out that now the Taliban has more Blackhawks than 85 percent of the planet, right, in addition to $85 billion worth of equipment, and that means Al-Qaeda is about to have it, that means ISIS chaos is about to have it, along with the countless deaths that will be on walkaway Joe's watch. And remember, this is against the backdrop of the Taliban saying, if we stay there after August 31st to evacuate Americans and other allies, that's an extended occupation. That's how they view our presence there. So, if Biden thinks that there's peace in our future, he's more delusional than we thought."

Because they need those intellectuals and those educated and those scientists, those doctors to operate those machines. They see those tomahawks, they see those guided missiles, and they go, we don't know how to do this, but they do. So now, we're seeing a whole new group of hostages.

This is once again I meant to do that excuse that Peewee Herman would pull off when he fell off a bike. I guess, I shouldn't say pull off.
