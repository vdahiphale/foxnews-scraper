The only way the president can get tossed, to the way I think any president could get tossed, for the evidence to be so overwhelming, and the wrongdoing so clear, that it -- that the public is outraged by it. And it becomes politically unsafe to vote not to convict. That's a tall order that Democrats are facing. And so, the question to -- that you, you know, if you look at that brief that was filed, you know, constitutionally insufficient, crazy to try to make an impeachment article out of the efforts to claim privilege and so on.

One that senators on both sides of the aisle may be reluctant to see. I mean, you know, you get Hunter Biden in there, talking about who knows what. And you've drawn Joe Biden, therefore, further into the mix, and there's a circus aspect to this. Thus, I suggest senators on both parties may -- both sides may want to avoid. I think that's what Mitch McConnell would like to avoid. But the Senate will decide. I mean, if it only takes a few Republican senators, you can't can -- you can -- you take 67 to convict, but only 51 to call witnesses. So, there's a significant chance that witnesses may be called.

What are provides for and this is what we've been told over the past three or four days here is that there will be 12 hours a day, 24 total spread out over four days for the House impeachment managers to present their case, that's Wednesday, Thursday, and then Friday, Saturday for the president's defense team to offer their side of the story. And then, sometime, the middle of next week, they get two witnesses. Now, what that means, if you're going to start at 1:00 in the afternoon because they have to accommodate Chief Justice John Roberts, he is sitting before the Supreme Court, they can't start to 1:00 in the afternoon, you're going to go until the middle of the night. And just before we went on the air here, we got a statement from Chuck Schumer, the minority leader who will offer a counterproposal tomorrow. And he says the following, McConnell's resolution stipulates that the key facts be delivered in the wee hours of the night simply because he doesn't want the American people to hear them.

One of them essentially makes an abuse of power argument. \"By limiting impeachment to cases of treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors, the Framers restricted impeachment to specific offenses against already known and established law. House Democrats newly invented \"abuse of power\" theory collapses at the threshold because it fails to allege any violence of law whatsoever.\" The House responding to that, the managers, \"This is the argument of a monarch with no basis with the Constitution. When the Framers worked the impeachment clause, they aimed it squarely at abuse of office for personal gain, betrayal of the national interest through foreign entanglements, and corruption of elections. President Trump has engaged in the trifecta of constitutional misconduct, warranting removal. He is the Framers worst nightmare come to life.\" Just some of the of the back and forth. Let's bring in our panel, Chris Stirewalt is politics editor here at FOX News, Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" I'm keeping distance year. I have tea here. I promise I will talk this way. Mollie, this is the argument that's being made. Tomorrow is about the ground rules in the U.S. Senate. And that is going to be a battle. What we are seeing from McConnell is that there's going to be 24 hours to make these cases for the House impeachment managers and for the White House over two days.

I want to make a quick point. Adam Schiff, I think, was suggesting that Alan Dershowitz is not a constitutional scholar. He is a criminal defense attorney, but he is also a known constitutional law scholar, and that is probably why the president picked him. What is interesting about today is finally got a little bit more of a feeling for what the president's defense is going to be, and we'll hear this as the cases are made, both the prosecution and the response. And the president's team says there is no crime, first and foremost. This is the first time we've had impeachment with no actual crime being alleged. Even with the Johnson impeachment, he was accused of breaking a law. That law was probably unconstitutional, but he was at least accused of an actual crime, which is not the case we have here. They also say that the process was flawed. This was an argument that the Republicans in the House did a really good job of making. That was sort of one of their more successful things. And then they say, even if you take the best possible interpretation of their case, there are no facts to support it. We're kind of seeing that response that you just showed from the Democrats. They are really overstating what they have in terms of the quality of their evidence as suggested by the fact that they're trying to bring out more evidence.",

But to Alan Dershowitz, who I sat in on his class twice because I'm from Boston, I went to school there, and I used to be a big fan of his, quite frankly, but he's changed his tune greatly when it comes to specifically impeachment and the Constitution. In 1998 he said not only in his classroom but on national television, it certainly doesn't have to be a crime to be impeachable, abuse of power is not a crime. And also when he cited Hamilton and \"The Federalist\" papers, number 65, when you read that, it said, quote, inevitability of partnership as a reason to support the constitutional approach to try impeachment, which is completely opposite what Alan Dershowitz was saying and was putting forth. When you look at polls that show 70 percent as of late today of the American people feel that there should be witnesses, I'm not sure what the Republicans doing is going to help them in the long run, especially politically, because they are not fighting, it looks like, facts, especially when they're talking about Democrats who are trying to undo an election.

      "utterance": "You know, you heard in that piece, Robert Ray, one of the president's lawyers, essentially saying he's going to wait for the Senate to decide. More specifically, as you read this brief by the president's lawyers, they're really aimed at Republican senators."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "That's right, Bret, because Republicans constitute the majority of the Senate, and it takes 67 votes to convict a president and remove him from office, which means that Democrats alone can't come close to doing it. They need about 20 Republican senators to turn against the president and vote for his departure. So, the smart way, it seems to me for people to look at the defense, the briefing, the defense that the -- that the president's representatives will be making is whether it gives Republicans, who were disinclined to vote to remove the president, to begin with, some material they can work with to defend their vote. The only way the president can get tossed, to the way I think any president could get tossed, for the evidence to be so overwhelming, and the wrongdoing so clear, that it -- that the public is outraged by it. And it becomes politically unsafe to vote not to convict. That's a tall order that Democrats are facing. And so, the question to -- that you, you know, if you look at that brief that was filed, you know, constitutionally insufficient, crazy to try to make an impeachment article out of the efforts to claim privilege and so on. The question then is, is that -- is that -- does that give Republican senators what they need and will want?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is. But you know, I think it's really a Hail Mary pass to need witnesses. After all, I mean, the Democrats in the House are arguing on the one hand that the case that they admitted against the president is overwhelming. That the -- that the -- that they should convict on the basis of it, and the same time, they're reaching out for more evidence. If the evidence is sufficient, you don't need more evidence. And the question that I think is been raised by all this is whether the Senate contemplating the prospect? I mean, if the president says, look -- if the Senate says, look, you can have your witnesses, you prosecutors. But the president then, to be fair is going to have -- to get to have his witnesses. And he's going to want to call Hunter Biden, and who knows who else. At which point that the trial takes on a very different cast? One that senators on both sides of the aisle may be reluctant to see. I mean, you know, you get Hunter Biden in there, talking about who knows what. And you've drawn Joe Biden, therefore, further into the mix, and there's a circus aspect to this. Thus, I suggest senators on both parties may -- both sides may want to avoid. I think that's what Mitch McConnell would like to avoid. But the Senate will decide. I mean, if it only takes a few Republican senators, you can't can -- you can -- you take 67 to convict, but only 51 to call witnesses. So, there's a significant chance that witnesses may be called. Weather in the end that will make any difference. So, I think he's very much in doubt."

What are provides for and this is what we've been told over the past three or four days here is that there will be 12 hours a day, 24 total spread out over four days for the House impeachment managers to present their case, that's Wednesday, Thursday, and then Friday, Saturday for the president's defense team to offer their side of the story. And then, sometime, the middle of next week, they get two witnesses. Now, what that means, if you're going to start at 1:00 in the afternoon because they have to accommodate Chief Justice John Roberts, he is sitting before the Supreme Court, they can't start to 1:00 in the afternoon, you're going to go until the middle of the night. And just before we went on the air here, we got a statement from Chuck Schumer, the minority leader who will offer a counterproposal tomorrow. And he says the following, McConnell's resolution stipulates that the key facts be delivered in the wee hours of the night simply because he doesn't want the American people to hear them. And Bret, that's going to be a key point you're going to hear tomorrow, especially from the House impeachment managers.

One of them essentially makes an abuse of power argument. \"By limiting impeachment to cases of treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors, the Framers restricted impeachment to specific offenses against already known and established law. House Democrats newly invented \"abuse of power\" theory collapses at the threshold because it fails to allege any violence of law whatsoever.\" The House responding to that, the managers, \"This is the argument of a monarch with no basis with the Constitution. When the Framers worked the impeachment clause, they aimed it squarely at abuse of office for personal gain, betrayal of the national interest through foreign entanglements, and corruption of elections. President Trump has engaged in the trifecta of constitutional misconduct, warranting removal. He is the Framers worst nightmare come to life.\" Just some of the of the back and forth. Let's bring in our panel, Chris Stirewalt is politics editor here at FOX News, Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" I'm keeping distance year. I have tea here. I promise I will talk this way. Mollie, this is the argument that's being made. Tomorrow is about the ground rules in the U.S. Senate. And that is going to be a battle. What we are seeing from McConnell is that there's going to be 24 hours to make these cases for the House impeachment managers and for the White House over two days. That's 12 hours a day, 1:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": These are going to be very long days, and I think that's part of Senator McConnell's strategy to just get this done as quickly as possible by running it throughout the day. I want to make a quick point. Adam Schiff, I think, was suggesting that Alan Dershowitz is not a constitutional scholar. He is a criminal defense attorney, but he is also a known constitutional law scholar, and that is probably why the president picked him. What is interesting about today is finally got a little bit more of a feeling for what the president's defense is going to be, and we'll hear this as the cases are made, both the prosecution and the response. And the president's team says there is no crime, first and foremost. This is the first time we've had impeachment with no actual crime being alleged. Even with the Johnson impeachment, he was accused of breaking a law. That law was probably unconstitutional, but he was at least accused of an actual crime, which is not the case we have here. They also say that the process was flawed. This was an argument that the Republicans in the House did a really good job of making. That was sort of one of their more successful things. And then they say, even if you take the best possible interpretation of their case, there are no facts to support it. We're kind of seeing that response that you just showed from the Democrats. They are really overstating what they have in terms of the quality of their evidence as suggested by the fact that they're trying to bring out more evidence."

      "utterance": "I don't think he's going to be convicted and kicked out, but I do think it comes down to what will happen going forward, whether there will be witnesses or not. Some people are considering Alan Dershowitz a witness because he's not technically a part of the legal team. But to Alan Dershowitz, who I sat in on his class twice because I'm from Boston, I went to school there, and I used to be a big fan of his, quite frankly, but he's changed his tune greatly when it comes to specifically impeachment and the Constitution. In 1998 he said not only in his classroom but on national television, it certainly doesn't have to be a crime to be impeachable, abuse of power is not a crime. And also when he cited Hamilton and \"The Federalist\" papers, number 65, when you read that, it said, quote, inevitability of partnership as a reason to support the constitutional approach to try impeachment, which is completely opposite what Alan Dershowitz was saying and was putting forth. When you look at polls that show 70 percent as of late today of the American people feel that there should be witnesses, I'm not sure what the Republicans doing is going to help them in the long run, especially politically, because they are not fighting, it looks like, facts, especially when they're talking about Democrats who are trying to undo an election. And I think the American people, regardless of their ideology, regardless of their politics as voters, are smarter than that."

Democrats and Republicans have already gone to their corners, but you're fighting for people who already have quite a bit of fatigue over this, and it might not be improved by more discussion of the same."

But one thing on the vote on witnesses, you have a vote on witnesses, but then the White House could say executive privilege for somebody like John Bolton or Mick Mulvaney. That is a different vote. It would also be a Senate vote potentially. And it's a different argument that the Republicans who vote for witnesses may vote against changing executive privilege."

To Mollie's point, I won't entirely disagree, but when I look at what happened with Democrats in the House, even those where they were in very red districts where Trump is still very popular, and they were freshman and still are freshman Democrats, they still voted to impeach. So I think in the Senate they may go along more party lines both on the left and the right, regardless of people saying, look at Susan Collins. No. She talks, and then she votes with her party."

      "utterance": "Just pitiful. I have to say, the dereliction here by \"The New York Times,\" I think of myself still as a newspaperman, and I think that endorsements are important, but you actually have to endorse. They have special access to the candidates. They spend hour upon hour talking to the candidates. They convene their editorial board, they have these discussions. And at the end with all of their special privilege and all of their special access, they get to the end and they're afraid of offending one faction or the other of the Democratic Party, so it's very much a story of Amy Klobuchar this race. This could've been a huge boost to Amy Klobuchar's campaign, but \"The Times\" were chicken, and they watered down their endorsement, and it ends up being useless to everybody. This is a fail."

So I don't take this endorsement seriously because there are two, and I really do think this is about women, and I wish \"The New York Times\" were honest about it."

In this case, \"The New York Times\" really is the house organ of the left in a way that newspapers maybe in the past would have endorsed a Republican and a Democrat, what they're doing here is trying to endorse two sides of the actual party that they represent, and they picked two people and they made their case for it. What was curious to me was that for picking Warren, they kept trashing her throughout the endorsement, which was a very weird backhanded way to handle their problems with her."
