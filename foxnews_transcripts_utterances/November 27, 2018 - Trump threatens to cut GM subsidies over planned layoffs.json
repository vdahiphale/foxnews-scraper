They should've have hit rock bottom and come back on their own instead of being propped up for years and continuing to sell cars that people don't want to buy, which is part of their problem here. It is inappropriate for the federal government to go after any single company for not doing what they want specifically, but there is a huge case to be made generally about how certain subsidies have been given to electric car makers for cars that people aren't buying. So we can make the argument that we shouldn't have bailed out GM in the first place.

I think there are some people who think they are, but Jay Powell is trying to follow in the very careful footsteps of Janet Yellen and manage this so there is not inflation, which hasn't been a problem for a very long time because the Fed has gotten really good at that. But in terms of yanking subsidies from General Motors, if you want to yank subsidies from everybody, that's one thing. But to punish General Motors by taking away just their subsidies, that sounds like crony capitalism in reverse, just the thing that Republicans and conservatives are supposed to hate more than anything else."

      "utterance": "President Trump's tweet today gave me flashbacks of 2008 when he talks about the American people have given GM and other companies a lot. And that goes back to the argument that we should never have bailed out those companies in the first place. They should've have hit rock bottom and come back on their own instead of being propped up for years and continuing to sell cars that people don't want to buy, which is part of their problem here. It is inappropriate for the federal government to go after any single company for not doing what they want specifically, but there is a huge case to be made generally about how certain subsidies have been given to electric car makers for cars that people aren't buying. So we can make the argument that we shouldn't have bailed out GM in the first place. That is coming home to roost now in a way that conservatives and Republicans and other economic factors predicted back when this happened, and here we are moving forward with these jobs going away in the U.S. which is something that President Trump obviously doesn't like because he campaigned on keeping them here."

I agree entirely with Katie about this, though. The reason why GM is closing these specific plants is because people aren't buying the specific cars being sold in those plants. And they are following in the footsteps of Ford. A lot of these guys are getting out of the passenger car market and going into the light truck market. And I didn't think Barack Obama knew enough how to manage a huge economy from the White House, I don't know that Donald Trump's instinct are any better. I'm one of these Friedrich Hayek guys. I think the market is supposed to work this stuff out. These guys are making business decisions closest to the ground where they know how to make them. I'm all for getting rid of these electric subsidies --"

The plea deal is up in the air as far as they are saying he's totally undermined it by lying. Then there is this story, Katie, in \"The Guardian\" saying that Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, suggesting that he had some previous knowledge, prior knowledge before these emails came out. Manafort puts out a statement through his team, \"This story is totally false and deliberately libelous. I've never met with Julian Assange or anyone connected to him. I've never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks either directly or indirectly. I've never reached out to Assange or WikiLeaks on any matter. We are considering all legal options against \"The Guardian,\" who did the story, \"who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it is false.\" You can't get a more stringent denial than that."

And \"The Guardian\" walked back some of the more strict language in that story, putting in words like \"apparently\" and not exactly following through with it being a solid allegation that had some backing. The truth is we're not going to know until Robert Mueller comes out with his full report about what the exact connections were. But Paul Manafort has a right to defend himself against these accusations, especially since they are very serious and they have to do with his plea deal."
