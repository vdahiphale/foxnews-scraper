Tough guy.\" Stephens is a smart journalist, a Pulitzer Prize winner who in this case was too thin skinned for his own good. As we were going off the air last Sunday, President Trump tweeted from G7 in France that MEDIA BUZZ and Fox News, quote, \"are getting worse.\" I've been covering Donald Trump for 35 years. Sometimes he is loving my coverage. As president he has told me I am to fair, and sometimes he's ripped my reporting. That's fine. It's the big leagues. In this case he linked to his own tweet pushing back on unfavorable Fox poll that I had discuss discussed. Just to be clear, there can be problems with any poll. I was just saying Fox isn't tilting the surveys against him. Days later after a Fox interview with a DNC spokeswoman he tweeted this. \"The new Fox News is letting millions of great people down. We have to start looking for a new news outlet. Fox isn't working for us anymore.\" Well, as Brit Hume and others have pointed out, Fox doesn't work for the president. Now, he's certainly entitled to criticize Fox News' division, which is separate from the opinion folks, just as he takes shots at other media outlets. The President, as I frequently point out, is often unfairly maligned by much of the press. I will try every day along with my news colleagues here to keep covering him fairly.

I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" Fox News alert, at least seven people are dead and several others are injured after a shooting in West Texas on Saturday. Police say the man was being stopped by state troopers for not using his turn signal when he shot at them and fled. Spokesman for the Odessa police says at least one victim remains in life threatening condition. We will have updates throughout the day on this tragic situation. Our other top story today of course is Hurricane Dorian, currently strengthening. Senior meteorologist Janice Dean joins us now. Janice?"

They have upped the winds, gusts of 220 miles-per-hour. This is going to cause catastrophic, life-threatening damage for the northwestern Bahamas. This storm continues to strengthen and will probably be intact for at least the next 24 to 48 hours. And then beyond that, computer models look like they're trending westwards, so we're not out of the woods for Florida, and these are the advisories. I just want to make mention that we have a hurricane watch now for parts of Florida. That means the hurricane center thinks that we're going to see hurricane-force winds in the next couple of days. The latest track as we go to 11 a.m., very close call here for Florida, up towards Georgia and the Carolinas. You're not off the hook yet. You need to be paying close attention to your local forecasts and your local officials. There will probably be evacuations all up and down the southeast coast. Howie, back to you."

Tweet, \"Another totally fake story in the Amazon Washington Post lobbyist which states that if my aides broke the law to build the wall, which is going up rapidly, I would give them a pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage fake news.\" Axios reports that in at least two meetings Trump asked for research on whether nuclear bombs could be used to stop hurricanes. Tweet, \"Axios, whatever that is, sat back and said gee, let's see what can we make up today to embarrass the president. Then they said, why don't we say he wants to bomb a hurricane, that should do it.\" Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist, a Fox News contributor and co-author of \"Justice on Trial, the Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.\" Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent for the Washington Examiner. And Richard Fowler, a radio talk show host and also a Fox News contributor.

Nobody is willing to put their name on the record. You have no way of knowing, you know, where the story came from.

I feel like in the media there are so many reporters who interpret what he says without any, you know, recognizing of his sense of humor or how he's sarcastic or how he approaches things. It's like, wow he's a crazy man, look he's talking about nuking hurricanes. He may have been joking about that. He may have been joking about the pardons of saying, I'll pardon you. Go ahead and build the wall. And to Richard's point, saying the wall is not being built. Actually, the wall is being built because the places where they're replacing the wall are making impenetrable to pedestrian traffic and that was the problem.

Donald Trump unreliable to his hyperbole and exaggeration and China unreliable by being China.

The point that Mollie brings up is that the president has reliability questions that I think the American people now see. This goes far beyond media coverage.

This happens to be one of the only times where you start to see stories that are negative against Democrats of this nature because he's running against other Democrats that media might like as well.

This doesn't -- I don't put this in the category of a gaffe, Susan. And the worst part for me is Joe Biden doesn't seem to get it.

I think Biden runs the risk over time, you saw that Washington Post kind of warning shot story, we're watching you, Joe. We are going to be chronicling all your gaffes, et cetera.

The New York Times has bedbugs in its newsroom. And that weirdly led to a war of words between a professor and Bret Stephens, a conservative op-ed writer for the Times. Dave Karpf who teaches at George Washington University tweeted that the bedbugs are Bret Stephens. That prompted the columnist to write to Karpf saying, \"come to my house, meet my wife and kids, talk to us a few minutes and then call me a bedbug to my face.\" And he copied the professor's boss.

      "utterance": "Now Karpf wrote in Esquire that Stephens was trying to send a message that people like me are not supposed to write mean jokes about people like him online. It was an exercise in wielding power. Stephens a harsh critic has now quit Twitter. The president tweeted that \"the bedbugs were perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens, a conservative who does anything that his bosses tell at the paper tell him to. Tough guy.\" Stephens is a smart journalist, a Pulitzer Prize winner who in this case was too thin skinned for his own good. As we were going off the air last Sunday, President Trump tweeted from G7 in France that MEDIA BUZZ and Fox News, quote, \"are getting worse.\" I've been covering Donald Trump for 35 years. Sometimes he is loving my coverage. As president he has told me I am to fair, and sometimes he's ripped my reporting. That's fine. It's the big leagues. In this case he linked to his own tweet pushing back on unfavorable Fox poll that I had discuss discussed. Just to be clear, there can be problems with any poll. I was just saying Fox isn't tilting the surveys against him. Days later after a Fox interview with a DNC spokeswoman he tweeted this. \"The new Fox News is letting millions of great people down. We have to start looking for a new news outlet. Fox isn't working for us anymore.\" Well, as Brit Hume and others have pointed out, Fox doesn't work for the president. Now, he's certainly entitled to criticize Fox News' division, which is separate from the opinion folks, just as he takes shots at other media outlets. The President, as I frequently point out, is often unfairly maligned by much of the press. I will try every day along with my news colleagues here to keep covering him fairly. Coming up, Frank Luntz is here on how the entire press corps bet on a bad poll. And are the pundits right in saying America has Trump fatigue or are they just tired of him?"

And always, you say, as bad as it was, it could have been worse, but it was certainly bad, very, very sad situation. Also, I would like to introduce Admiral Brown of the U.S. Coast Guard, a highly respected man who spent two days at Camp David going over a lot of different things, having to do with the hurricane. The Admiral has informed me through all of the different sources that he has, but you can pretty much get it on television, Admiral. They -- this is now a Category 5. It seems to be one of the biggest hurricanes we've ever seen. And that's the problem, that's a problem. So I think a lot of -- we have a lot of great -- we have a lot of great people working right now. We don't know where it is going to hit, but we have an idea. Probably a little bit different than the original course. The original course was dead into Florida. Now, it seems to be going up towards South Carolina, towards North Carolina. Georgia is going to be hit. Alabama is going to get a piece of it, it looks like, but it could change its course again. And it could back more towards Florida.

As you know, some new tariffs get on we're taking in, tens and billions of dollars. We're giving some of the money to the farmers. I'm making the more farmers more than whole.

      "utterance": "There was a reason why I reported it. There was -- there's a public interest in this guy's background and who he dealt with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "There's not much of a public interest here by the way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURZ",
      "utterance": "It's all pretty gossipy stuff, which I'm not going to repeat on the air. Now, the Washington Post pointed me to a statement, who says Phil Rucker is one of the best and most scrupulous reporter in the news business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Right. And he is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He has never violated Washington Post standards or policies. But the New York Times was not at this dinner, so that you get around the off-the- record restriction because you were told this by somebody who was there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Well, if He's off-the-record, if he's taking that information off-the-record and giving it to somebody, that is a violation of those policies, the way I read it. Now, I don't know what was agreed to. Phil Rucker is a really good journalist. I think at some point, you got to hear how he handled it. I want to hear the conditions that he agreed to. It may not have been strictly off-the-record."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, he didn't respond to my e-mail this morning. But as I say, the Post is defending him. The sad part is Madeleine Westerhout is 28 years old. Obviously, they were having drinks and she said she shouldn't have said and now she's out of a job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "I'm sorry, it's bad stuff because we don't even -- this woman should not even be a national story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And I think if she hadn't lost her job, obviously, this might have gone unnoticed. Charlie, great to see you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Any time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURZ",
      "utterance": "Thanks for stopping by as always. And that is it for this edition of \"Media Buzz,\" a little cameo by the president. I'm Howard Kurtz. Hope you enjoy your Labor Day weekend. Hey, check out my Podcast, \"Media Buzz Meter.\" You can subscribe there at Apple iTunes, Google Play or FoxNewsPodcast.com. We hope that you look at our Facebook page.
