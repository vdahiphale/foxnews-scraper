      "sentences": "All right. And, Tucker, thank you. Welcome to HANNITY. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Day five, Americans trapped behind enemy lines pretty much -- well, they're being held at the whim of the Taliban, yes, a terrorist organization. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On Sunday, the entire country of Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, as Joe Biden gears up for yet another long weekend in Delaware. Wow. Only the Hamid Karzai International Airport remains under U.S. control. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At this hour tonight, thousands of Americans and thousands of our allies hopelessly stranded all over the country, as we said, behind enemy lines. At this hour, the Biden administration, they still don't know exactly how many. Joe is estimating about 15,000. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They don't know where they're located. They can't even tell us exactly how many have been evacuated and worst of all, they have zero plan to rescue any Americans. And according to \"The Wall Street Journal\", this is the return of America held hostage. Some 15,000 U.S. citizens and residents are behind Taliban lines, and there's no easy way to get them out. That's just a fact. They've allowed it to get that bad. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as we speak, there are other countries at least trying and they're extracting their citizens with their special forces. For example, the British are calling it Operation Pitting. But the United States as of now has no such program. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In a press conference, the Department of Defense told us that the U.S. military is under orders to protect the Karzai International Airport and that is it. According to the State Department in a memo with, quote, the United States government cannot ensure safe passage to the Hamid Karzai International Airport. But they're suggesting people might think about going there but we can't provide you safe passage there. So, we're securing an airport that people will take great risk to get to only someone as stupid as Joe Biden could come up with a plan like that. Of course, now, he's going on vacation again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to reports, the Biden administration, they're looking for what they call non-military ways to move Americans to the airport past the Taliban. Okay, I'd like to know what that might be. What are the plans? Look at your screen because this is what it looks like outside of the airport. It is chaos. It is carnage. Taliban fighters viciously beating whipping stabbing crowds, seemingly doing it at random. Shots ring out constantly. Men are abducted on the back of pickup trucks, even American journalists have come under attack.

He was reassuring the American people that the Afghan army -- one of the most capable, well- trained armies in the world and that they even had an air force, and that there's only 75,000 Taliban, and then the Taliban makes their march and every step of the way, Joe apparently didn't notice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He said there'd be no chaotic scenes at the U.S. embassy in Kabul with helicopters scenes similar to the fall of Saigon in '75.

He dismantled Trump's contingency in crisis response bureau, that was back in June, he dismantled that. That was set up by President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo to provide aviation, logistics, medical support to Americans if they get trapped abroad.

And the Biden administration is completely, totally detached and out to lunch. This is by every definition of dereliction of duty. If Joe Biden is not up for this job, now we've joked about it, we've kidded about it, we've shown you the video, and then we stop laughing about it because it's not funny, because seeing a Joe Biden weak, and frail, and a cognitive mess is not good for the United States.

I've never seen a situation like this. Colonel North, have you? You've been in Afghanistan. You're in the Vietnam War. You have numerous Purple Hearts, other honors of service. But you have news before we get to anything else. COL. OLIVER NORTH (RET), CO-AUTHOR \"WE DIDN'T FIGHT FOR SOCIALISM\":  Well, let's go ahead and commit some news here because everything you've said is absolutely correct. So the number one most important next step has got to be finding a way to solve the problem of exfiltrating males not just Afghan males but males through the Taliban's outer perimeter at the airport. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What we see now is footage of what's happening right at the airport. That's the inner perimeter. The outer perimeter is serious problems because they've got lists, they've got the names and phone numbers of every one of the folks who work with our country for the last 20 years. They've got the bank records. They've got it all, thanks to the embassy. So that's the number one issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Second issue, is it true that the Taliban are using captured U.S. drones like the Switchblade and others seized at the Bagram Air Base and other U.S. bases that are now being reverse engineered by Russian, Chinese and Pakistani intelligence officers? Because that's a major hazard going forward. Number three, it's been reported the Taliban has captured the payroll data in American embassy and the Kabul banks showing the names addresses and phone numbers for locals now being hunted down. Sean, I've been in touch over the course of the last several days with folks who are now got at least a thousand Afghan nationals who worked very closely with us, some of them were my interpreters when I was on the air with you from Afghanistan. We're trying to get them out before they're hunted down. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And now, they've got -- the enemy has the addresses and phone numbers and they're calling them up trying to entice them to come on over. They come over. They're dead. Number four, the armed resistance units forming in the Panjshir Valley are appealing for help. I'm wondering, is anyone in the U.S. government answering the phone.

Here's the bottom line: nobody seems to remember the lessons learned from the capture of our embassy in Saigon in April '75, or Tehran in '79. If Biden can't figure out how to deal with these problems, he ought to step down.

I mean, when you see something trained up in the way they carried themselves, that's -- a lot of that is the Army. And how fast that fell -- to fall in 11 days, that takes the will of the people as well. Close to 20 years, they probably got so sick of it that they just wanted something to change. Now, as far as the airport goes, I keep hearing everybody talking about contingencies and we have all of these contingencies line out, and we got - - we don't know -- it's like, man, there was already a contingency written up. And so, tell that guy at the White House, pay attention to the letters (ph) to the president, all right? You walk in, there's a big binder says \"contingencies for airports\". You open it up, there's one page in there, all right? There's a crest in there and it has gold letters of \"Rangers\", all right? That's what they do. That is their profession, and they do it so well that -- I mean, words can't even describe. They shut that down and secure in a matter of minutes, if you turn them loose. That's a true statement.

They are beginning to see the tragic consequences of a return to Taliban rule. For example, according to a new report, the Taliban is marking the doors of prominent Afghan women, even taking female news anchors off the air. And the terror group reportedly killed one woman for not wearing a burqa on the same day that the Taliban was vowing to honor women's rights. They've since backed off that as we predicted. And as \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports, many women are fading from public view, rightfully, fearfully for their lives as the Taliban crackdown begins. Now remember, under previous Taliban rule, girls were prevented. They couldn't go to school or work, prevented from appearing in public without being fully covered, having a male relative with them. Also restrictions on what health care they could receive, what types of transportation they could take, and severely limited on when and where they could work if they could, and were even subjected to forced marriages and abuse and rape. And those who broke the rules they face public flogging and even execution. Here with reaction FOX News contributor Sara Carter, along with nationally syndicated radio talk shows Dana Loesch. Sara, you've been there many times. You have friends there. You've been in non-stop contact for the last week with people on the ground there. What's the latest you're hearing?",

She has family members in the United States. She can have access into the country but she cannot get to a gate. The perimeter around Kabul airport is completely surrounded by Taliban. The Talibs pushed her. They pushed other women. They were threatening them. They were pushing them onto the ground. It was horrifying. I was there, Sean, as you said many times. I remember going to Kabul University, talking to young Afghan women, women that would go to school. They were wearing their jeans. They were wearing a hijab but no burqa. They were very educated, very free, standing up for their rights, women who were judges. Now all of their lives are being threatened. I can't begin to stress that the United States government must secure the perimeter around the airport so that people can get into the airport to get on the flight.

      "utterance": "All right. And, Tucker, thank you. Welcome to HANNITY. Day five, Americans trapped behind enemy lines pretty much -- well, they're being held at the whim of the Taliban, yes, a terrorist organization. On Sunday, the entire country of Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, as Joe Biden gears up for yet another long weekend in Delaware. Wow. Only the Hamid Karzai International Airport remains under U.S. control. At this hour tonight, thousands of Americans and thousands of our allies hopelessly stranded all over the country, as we said, behind enemy lines. At this hour, the Biden administration, they still don't know exactly how many. Joe is estimating about 15,000. They don't know where they're located. They can't even tell us exactly how many have been evacuated and worst of all, they have zero plan to rescue any Americans. And according to \"The Wall Street Journal\", this is the return of America held hostage. Some 15,000 U.S. citizens and residents are behind Taliban lines, and there's no easy way to get them out. That's just a fact. They've allowed it to get that bad. And as we speak, there are other countries at least trying and they're extracting their citizens with their special forces. For example, the British are calling it Operation Pitting. But the United States as of now has no such program. In a press conference, the Department of Defense told us that the U.S. military is under orders to protect the Karzai International Airport and that is it. According to the State Department in a memo with, quote, the United States government cannot ensure safe passage to the Hamid Karzai International Airport. But they're suggesting people might think about going there but we can't provide you safe passage there. So, we're securing an airport that people will take great risk to get to only someone as stupid as Joe Biden could come up with a plan like that. Of course, now, he's going on vacation again. According to reports, the Biden administration, they're looking for what they call non-military ways to move Americans to the airport past the Taliban. Okay, I'd like to know what that might be. What are the plans? Look at your screen because this is what it looks like outside of the airport. It is chaos. It is carnage. Taliban fighters viciously beating whipping stabbing crowds, seemingly doing it at random. Shots ring out constantly. Men are abducted on the back of pickup trucks, even American journalists have come under attack. Take a look."

Okay, when you saw that the Taliban took over 10 percent of the country, 20 percent of the country, 30 percent of the country, 40 percent of the country, why was there no urgency then? Does this like, look, safe to you Joe Biden as you make your way back to Delaware? Would you want one of your loved ones outside of that airport behind enemy lines getting pistol- whipped getting beaten getting shot or just in fear of all the above? Look at your screen. These are Afghan families literally passing their babies over a wall covered with razor wire, begging the British to take their children, because they know that their children will be murdered by the Taliban if they don't get inside of that airport. Think how desperate a mother or father would have to be to do such a thing, but they do it because that's all they think they can do to save their kids, because they know how the -- what the Taliban is all about and how they treat people. Now, there is no safe passage, not for the Afghan people. Not for Americans, not for the allies, not for the interpreters that we promised we'd protect. And now, we're witnessing what is one of the biggest hostage situations in the history of the U.S. and the biggest military debacle in the history of the U.S. And you have a president so checked out that he's spending most of his spare hours on vacation, with no plan except that -- well, the Taliban has said that they're going to allow safe passage to the airport, when we know that's not happening, considering they have multiple checkpoints, they have surrounded the entire perimeter of the airport and nobody is getting through unless they get Taliban permission. And even worse, so many innocent souls are already dead. But according to Biden is -- this is really much ado about nothing apparently, take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, you could have done it before they made their march to Kabul. You didn't have to give them Bagram Air Force Base either. You could have acted earlier. It didn't have to go chaotically. It could have gone very smoothly. Logistics could have been employed. We could have had a plan to extract, identify every American and get them out weeks before. But Biden said that a Taliban takeover -- well, it was not inevitable, Joe was just telling us that a couple of weeks ago. He was reassuring the American people that the Afghan army -- one of the most capable, well- trained armies in the world and that they even had an air force, and that there's only 75,000 Taliban, and then the Taliban makes their march and every step of the way, Joe apparently didn't notice. He said there'd be no chaotic scenes at the U.S. embassy in Kabul with helicopters scenes similar to the fall of Saigon in '75. Yeah, we have those scenes. And then he pulled American soldiers out -- in the middle of the night. He abandoned Bagram Air Base. He dismantled Trump's contingency in crisis response bureau, that was back in June, he dismantled that. That was set up by President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo to provide aviation, logistics, medical support to Americans if they get trapped abroad. Why would you have gotten rid of that program? And Joe stood by and did nothing as the Taliban made all of these rapid advances all over the country in the past two months they acted like it wasn't happening. In fact, an internal State Department cable in July actually warned of Kabul's imminent collapse. Joe did nothing. And now, we're experiencing what is the single worst foreign policy crisis and debacle ever. The lives of thousands of Americans are literally in the hands of evil terrorists. Our Afghan partners, they have been abandoned and left for dead and I can promise you those left behind will die gruesome deaths. Our allies rightly no longer trust us our enemies are only emboldened billions of dollars in U.S. weapons, they didn't have a plan to remove them or at least destroy them. You know, night vision goggles, planes, helicopters, up-armored vehicles, yeah, that you paid for, they're now in the hands of the Taliban. That makes them even stronger. And today, Joe Biden had no public events again, called the lid, I'm done at 3:30 in the afternoon. No press briefing. I guess Jen Psaki's back on vacation because we didn't hear from her, we haven't heard a word from Kamala Harris in more than a week and thousands of American lives are at risk at this hour. And the Biden administration is completely, totally detached and out to lunch. This is by every definition of dereliction of duty. If Joe Biden is not up for this job, now we've joked about it, we've kidded about it, we've shown you the video, and then we stop laughing about it because it's not funny, because seeing a Joe Biden weak, and frail, and a cognitive mess is not good for the United States. It's not good for our fellow citizens those trapped behind enemy lines tonight and it's not good for the world either. If he doesn't care about the lives of Americans abroad, if he's not up to this job, he needs to either step down or be removed. If he just wants to live out his remaining days on a beach in Delaware, I'm fine with that. Step down, let someone more capable take over, someone that may have a sense of urgency about how dire this situation is and the amount of potential power and leverage that he has now single-handedly given a terrorist organization and God forbid what I can think of in my mind which I will not express they could do to the Americans held behind enemy lines. We pray for those Americans, every one of them. We want them home safely. They're trapped in Afghanistan. We pray for our friends. We pray for our allies, who have been abandoned and pray also that as many lives as possible hopefully prayerfully every life will be saved before it's too late. If it does work out that way, it will be a miracle a modern day miracle but it won't be because of anything Joe Biden did. Here with more and he's got some breaking news, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. I've never seen a situation like this. Colonel North, have you? You've been in Afghanistan. You're in the Vietnam War. You have numerous Purple Hearts, other honors of service. But you have news before we get to anything else. COL. OLIVER NORTH (RET), CO-AUTHOR \"WE DIDN'T FIGHT FOR SOCIALISM\":  Well, let's go ahead and commit some news here because everything you've said is absolutely correct. So the number one most important next step has got to be finding a way to solve the problem of exfiltrating males not just Afghan males but males through the Taliban's outer perimeter at the airport. What we see now is footage of what's happening right at the airport. That's the inner perimeter. The outer perimeter is serious problems because they've got lists, they've got the names and phone numbers of every one of the folks who work with our country for the last 20 years. They've got the bank records. They've got it all, thanks to the embassy. So that's the number one issue. Second issue, is it true that the Taliban are using captured U.S. drones like the Switchblade and others seized at the Bagram Air Base and other U.S. bases that are now being reverse engineered by Russian, Chinese and Pakistani intelligence officers? Because that's a major hazard going forward. Number three, it's been reported the Taliban has captured the payroll data in American embassy and the Kabul banks showing the names addresses and phone numbers for locals now being hunted down. Sean, I've been in touch over the course of the last several days with folks who are now got at least a thousand Afghan nationals who worked very closely with us, some of them were my interpreters when I was on the air with you from Afghanistan. We're trying to get them out before they're hunted down. And now, they've got -- the enemy has the addresses and phone numbers and they're calling them up trying to entice them to come on over. They come over. They're dead. Number four, the armed resistance units forming in the Panjshir Valley are appealing for help. I'm wondering, is anyone in the U.S. government answering the phone. If not, why not? Call me, I've got their numbers. They've called me. Number five, there are or more Afghan air force fixed wing and helicopter aircraft now safely on the ground in neighboring countries. The senior Afghan officer has appealed directly for help, I have his phone number. Anyone going to answer his calls, if not, if you're in the government of the United States, give me a call. I'll give you his phone number. He's desperate to make sure that the that came out with him get somewhere be safely before they're bounced out of Uzbekistan or Tajikistan or God knows where else.

It goes to the top of the Pentagon, the top of the State Department, the top of the CIA. The incompetence is extraordinary, I hate to say that, because they served -- every minute of my time in uniform, I was proud of the people who I reported to. The fact is we no longer have people like that in our government."

Joining us now with reaction, former White House press secretary, FOX News contributor, Ari Fleischer, former acting director of national intelligence, Ric Grenell. Ric, you know, it's interesting because this -- we do have our Defense Department. They're fighting back saying, oh, we absolutely warned you. We have a State Department memo, and now, we have a U.S. diplomat memo, all warning that this was becoming imminent a month ago. The question is, it didn't take -- all you needed to do is really watch the news. You could see the advancing Taliban, and they were taking over large portions. My question is, was this an intelligence breakdown or that they didn't just seem to care or that they were ignorant to what could happen here?"

And let me just tell you that in early June, I have seen evidence of a warning, a very stark warning to Jake Sullivan in early June. Then there were multiple cables throughout June warning of what's happening as the Taliban rises. Now, on July 1st, we shut down Bagram Air Force Base. The troops were removed before American civilians or foreign service officers and embassy personnel were removed. How do you do that? So the frustration that the State Department was having, the foreign service officers, it finally boiled over after multiple warnings into this descent cable which is a very rare thing. Twenty-two of 23 economic and political officers in Embassy Kabul signed a descent cable on July 13th. After warnings throughout June and July, the troops were removed July 1st, they felt alone. Let me just finish by saying this, on January 20th of this year, Kabul was free, the American embassy, Afghanistan was free, the American embassy in Kabul was working fine. And then what happened after that? Twenty-five hundred American troops and 5,000 NATO troops were there keeping the peace and then chaos ensued."

He flew in, he gave a -minute speech that somebody else had obviously written, he took no questions he went back on vacation again. Then he does what I consider to be a disastrous interview with George Stephanopoulos and saying, oh, no, no, we did everything right. We -- you know, there's nothing that I think we could have improved on and the chaos was priced into the fact of any withdrawal and I inherited this and -- well, no one's being killed right now, and you know, no one warned him against withdrawing and now we have all the evidence to the contrary, and now, he's going on vacation again.

This is the subjugated position that Joe Biden has subject our nation and our military too. It's a shameful, shameful moment and he did it because he withdrew the troops prematurely. As for the communications of it -- you know, what Joe Biden needed to have done and remember that July news conference where he said, you know, we're heading into a three-day weekend I really don't want to take these questions. I don't want to talk about it. He should have gone and talked about it to the American people and laid out the risks. He could have made the case that after 20 years, it's right to withdraw the troops, but here are the risks in doing so. There could be chaos. There could be problems getting Americans out. We'll do everything we can to minimize it. But instead, he took the opposite the tack. He made the case how strong the Afghan military was, that they would be strong, he had confidence and faith and as he called it, 300,000 members of the Afghani military. He led America on to believe something that did not come true and the reason for it significantly it didn't come true is because of the decisions Joe Biden made just as Ric laid out, to withdraw the troops before he withdrew the civilians. He got that order exactly backwards and put us all in peril."

You know, with Americans in harm's way behind enemy lines -- to be honest, Congressman, I'm not interested in the politics of anything tonight. I'm interested in one thing only, and that's getting our fellow Americans home. With that said, I do think Congress needs to be brought in. I think we need to be briefed. Our intel apparently had been warning -- both intel in the House and the Senate, members of both sides of the aisle -- have been warning not to do this now, the danger was real.

The idea that our military's saying they don't have the capabilities to go out, yes, they do. We just need the will, and I think all Americans should stand for that. What this disaster has done is put a stain on our nation's status for years to come. I've heard from ambassadors of other nations that are our allies, they said they can't go back and tell them whether America will be there again. We're watching what China is doing with Taiwan, what Russia talks about within the Baltics.

Even earlier this year, we have been catching people on the terrorist watch list coming across our border. Five thousand prisoners have just left in Afghanistan. America is less safe today because of what this president has done. And the president to sit there and tell us that he has planned for every scenario, why wouldn't they stop planning? Who would plan this way? Why would they remove in a time of the height of the Taliban in the summer? If they wanted to draw down, why wouldn't they do it in winter and give the capability? To criticize the Afghan military that has been losing thousands of lives every month, we had stabilized this nation, without a casualty in the last 18 months with 25 (ph) of our very best.

Also tonight, the brave men and women in uniform who served in Afghanistan, they are speaking out and they are slamming Joe Biden for his lack of urgency, lack of transparency, lack of action amid what is now a full-blown Taliban takeover all across Afghanistan. Many Gold Star families, many families of the severely injured in Afghanistan, are rightly asking why? Why did they give -- why did they give their life, their limbs, for this? And one of those brave heroes is retired Navy SEAL -- you might have watched the movie, read the book -- \"Lone Survivor\" author, Marcus Luttrell. He says we need to do everything we can to get our fellow citizens out of Afghanistan. He joins us now with more. Marcus has been a longtime friend. I know you're watching, and I know your heart, and I think I know the answer to the question before I ask it. What do people like yourself that served there -- you lost your closest friends there -- what do you think about the situation? And what do you think needs to be done to resolve the situation and save our fellow Americans? MARCUS LUTTRELL, AUTHOR OF \"LONE SURVIVOR\":  Good to see you, brother, and thank you for having me on. It's been a while. (INAUDIBLE) since COVID got spread around here, but a lot has happened since then. My feelings on this are kind of equal to everybody else's. I mean, you just kind of watch it go down and we fought so hard in there for so long. Now, in hindsight, we're talking about 20 years now, all right? So, we got done fighting. About the time bin Laden came down (INAUDIBLE) and Rob O'Neill and the rest of the guys, we got (INAUDIBLE). Other than that, you look at the nation-building, and to pass that over, I hear -- I heard Colonel North fired up, and, all right, he made a great point. When you see the Taliban walking down the streets with all of our equipment and the way they walked -- I know what it is when I'm looking at it. I mean, when you see something trained up in the way they carried themselves, that's -- a lot of that is the Army. And how fast that fell -- to fall in 11 days, that takes the will of the people as well. Close to 20 years, they probably got so sick of it that they just wanted something to change. Now, as far as the airport goes, I keep hearing everybody talking about contingencies and we have all of these contingencies line out, and we got - - we don't know -- it's like, man, there was already a contingency written up. And so, tell that guy at the White House, pay attention to the letters (ph) to the president, all right? You walk in, there's a big binder says \"contingencies for airports\". You open it up, there's one page in there, all right? There's a crest in there and it has gold letters of \"Rangers\", all right? That's what they do. That is their profession, and they do it so well that -- I mean, words can't even describe. They shut that down and secure in a matter of minutes, if you turn them loose. That's a true statement. That's all they do. That is what they are designed for. And the fact they're not even over there is surprising to me."

The whole time I was over there, I was stuck down there, all I wanted to do was get back here to y'all (ph). And as long as I kept standing, I knew that flag was standing, and someone was willing to stand for that flag, I know y'all -- I mean, that's the hope. That's the hope. Now, if we've already bailed out of there and all bets are off and you don't have to ask permission from the Taliban, anybody says that they're coordination and talks with the Taliban in the airport, that just means they are talking to a gate door. They don't have any -- they don't care what we think. Right now, they are worried about security, what they just took over. They're going to be focusing on that. What we need to do is focus on getting our people back. That's what America is. Every time you stand for the flag, to be acknowledged as an American, every time you look at the flag, it's for this really -- this reason right here.

For example, according to a new report, the Taliban is marking the doors of prominent Afghan women, even taking female news anchors off the air. And the terror group reportedly killed one woman for not wearing a burqa on the same day that the Taliban was vowing to honor women's rights. They've since backed off that as we predicted. And as \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports, many women are fading from public view, rightfully, fearfully for their lives as the Taliban crackdown begins. Now remember, under previous Taliban rule, girls were prevented. They couldn't go to school or work, prevented from appearing in public without being fully covered, having a male relative with them. Also restrictions on what health care they could receive, what types of transportation they could take, and severely limited on when and where they could work if they could, and were even subjected to forced marriages and abuse and rape. And those who broke the rules they face public flogging and even execution. Here with reaction FOX News contributor Sara Carter, along with nationally syndicated radio talk shows Dana Loesch.

She has family members in the United States. She can have access into the country but she cannot get to a gate. The perimeter around Kabul airport is completely surrounded by Taliban. The Talibs pushed her. They pushed other women. They were threatening them. They were pushing them onto the ground. It was horrifying. I was there, Sean, as you said many times.

DANA LOESCH, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST OF \"THE DANA SHOW\":  Oh, Sean, and thanks for having me, it's good to see you again. They are silent on this because they're fakes, they're frauds, they are grifters. These are people have turned the idea of third and fourth wave feminism into a cottage industry to advance their own interest, instead of the securing the interest of women everywhere. It's really easy, Sean, for these women here to start third and fourth wave feminists, to talk a really good game about Me Too and to scream about your truth, et cetera, et cetera, but that ends apparently at America's borders. They don't have the bravery. Yes, the squad, they are not brave enough or courageous enough to actually advocate for these women in other countries.
