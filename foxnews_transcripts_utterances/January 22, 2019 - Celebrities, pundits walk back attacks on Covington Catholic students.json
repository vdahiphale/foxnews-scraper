This is my way to get my opinion out.  Everyone kind of feels like a TV star out there.  They get to say their piece.  They get retweeted.   They get it out there.  For all you know, somebody with a big microphone will pick that up.  And now, all of a sudden, they become famous. In this debate, though, I have to say I appreciate the Joy Behars of the world because they are bluntly honest.  She's willing to say what a lot of people in media won't say, which is that there's a mission to bring down President Trump at all costs and they're willing to do that whether the information is true or not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that if they see an opportunity to paint somebody with a Make America Great Again hat or at a pro-life rally, or whatever the circumstance allows, if they have the opportunity to paint them as bigoted or racist or whatever needs to be and tie them to Trump, they're going to do it.  So, I appreciate that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You need people like that because so many of people in media, like Greg said before, they're sticking to their argument but they're not telling you why.  They're not being honest about this.  This is a mission to take down the president.  They're just saying, oh, no, we're right, these kids really are racist and fishing, they're fishing for something in their past that might indicate that. You have to be grateful for the people on the left that are telling you exactly why they're doing it and what they're doing.  And you know, you have the facts then.  You know what you're rallying against. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He just stood there like this and that was the crime.  And this is a great lesson. Now, whenever you see a story in the media and everybody starts to pile on, step back, think about the Covington boys and just wait until the facts comes out.  Some people are learning their lessons and other people aren't. I think some left-wing person went to a high school basketball photo and the guys were going like this and they said that's a white power symbol. No, that means someone just hit a three-pointer.  Everybody knows that that watches basketball. So, we learned from Parkland.  Children are off limits.  I thought that's what was supposed to be the lesson.  And now, you have a situation where the hat was offensive, the smirk was offensive, and this is coming from the same people that were yelling and chasing people and their families out of restaurants.

Many people feel like, well, you know what, I don't work in television. This is my way to get my opinion out.  Everyone kind of feels like a TV star out there.  They get to say their piece.  They get retweeted.   They get it out there.  For all you know, somebody with a big microphone will pick that up.  And now, all of a sudden, they become famous. In this debate, though, I have to say I appreciate the Joy Behars of the world because they are bluntly honest.  She's willing to say what a lot of people in media won't say, which is that there's a mission to bring down President Trump at all costs and they're willing to do that whether the information is true or not. And that if they see an opportunity to paint somebody with a Make America Great Again hat or at a pro-life rally, or whatever the circumstance allows, if they have the opportunity to paint them as bigoted or racist or whatever needs to be and tie them to Trump, they're going to do it.  So, I appreciate that. You need people like that because so many of people in media, like Greg said before, they're sticking to their argument but they're not telling you why.  They're not being honest about this.  This is a mission to take down the president.  They're just saying, oh, no, we're right, these kids really are racist and fishing, they're fishing for something in their past that might indicate that.

I will say this, Nathan Phillips, the veteran, Native American elder, said the kid has never apologized to him.  He felt stared down and he felt threatened by the kid, and he thought that what the black Israelites were up to was offensive, but he thought the kids and the Israelites were about to clash and he was trying to be a peacemaker. So now you get people on either side, especially the right, and the fact that, hey, these -- a lot of the initial interpretation was wrong saying, oh, now the kids are to be protected.  They're angels.  I think that, boy, we as Americans we get fragmented, divided intentionally by these people for some reason and we play into it.  We're such dummies.  I don't believe it."

But the truth is I think that the moderates on the left are in the minority.  I actually think a lot of Democratic voters now agree with what these people are saying, what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is saying.  There was a recent poll, the Hill Harris poll, that said 59 percent of registered voters support a 70 percent marginal tax rate. I think that Democrat voters, particularly millennials, are going for what sounds good.  It sounds good to say stuff is going to be free, free education, Medicare for all, green new deal, less fossil fuels.  That all sounds good and no one is paying attention to the fact that none of these people, none of these candidates can explain how that stuff is going to get paid for, how it's not going to bankrupt industries in this country. And unfortunately, in the social media age, that sound bite works.  So I think that their shift to the left, actually, is probably a smart one.  And I think most of their voters will actually fall in line with them and be more supportive of a hard left candidate, even though I wish that wasn't the case and I want to say moderates still exist in the Democratic Party.

The thing is the Democratic Party has evolved so much just over the last 10 to 15 years.  They've just their position on immigration, criminal justice, social justice, drug policy, gay marriage.  If you look at the positions 10 to 15 years ago, those were held by Democrats.  Now, they don't hold those positions anymore. But here's their problem, they call Republicans that hold those positions evil.  So when you're asked the question, well, you held the same position 15 years ago, were you evil back then?  They say, oh, well, I wasn't evil, but Republicans that hold the same positions I held 15 years ago, they're evil.  So the whole offensive strategy doesn't work anymore."

Take a look right here in New York City.  Check out this video of the fountain in Bryant Park, frozen over this morning.  Yesterday, it dropped all the way into single digits here in midtown Manhattan. Now over to Missouri.  Take a look at this.  That's a tow boat on the upper Mississippi, struggling to move a barge through a thick sheet of ice near Clarksville, Missouri.  Thankfully, it's supposed to warm up over the next few days before another cold wave over the weekend."

But I love moms like this.  I mean, this is the kind of person I want to be.  I'm not that's kind of person.  I'm the type that freaks out and gets mad and has road rage.  But in another life I'm going to be that person."
