U.S. officials also tell me four tugboats contracted to pull the Norwegian-owned tanker, one of the two tankers damaged in an attack Thursday, have been prevented from doing so by Iranian gunboats that have surrounded the stricken tanker. At first, the Iranians put out a press release saying they rescued all 44 of the sailors on these two disabled tankers. U.S. officials now tell us one of the two tanker crews were in fact detained by the Iranians early Thursday morning after first being rescued by another merchant vessel.

U.S. Central Command released this photo showing what it says is an unexploded mine attached to the whole of one of the tankers attacked outside the Persian Gulf Thursday. This video also released by the U.S. military shows what it claims is proof of Iran's involvement in the attacks.

And we should form a coalition of support against what's taken place. The Iranians are clearly disrupting the major oil artery in the world here, much as they did once before in the late 1980s.

Step two, Neil, is U.S. begins to escort ships with coalition partners through the Persian Gulf. The Iranians will likely escalate. And they will put mines out there, as they did in the late 1980s. What Reagan did under those circumstances is this. In 1987, we took a Kuwaiti tanker, and we re-flagged under U.S. flag, hoping it would have more protection, ran it through the Persian Gulf. The Iranians attacked it. Reagan directed military action against two Iranian oil platforms that were destroyed in the Rostam field. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In 1988, U.S. escorts are bringing ships through the Persian Gulf. A U.S. frigate is hit by an Iranian mine. Reagan directed military action against the Revolutionary Guard. Navy staging bases destroyed many of their vessels and also destroyed two more oil platforms. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That crisis ended with that action. That I think is sort of the path that we're on. There's other options that the military may have based on what the Iranians are doing. But I think that's sort of the direction we're heading, Neil.",

So that's the denominator one. Will they escalate to try to take the pressure off of them that the United States has imposed on them by getting the international community to tell the United States, back off the Iranians, we got to get that oil flowing on that major artery in the Persian Gulf? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Trump administration is not going to do it. But the Iranians are going to still keep trying that, because they're in a desperate situation, Neil. But all that said, you can take measured, limited military action to enforce diplomacy without the provocation of going to war. And it's a false choice when people say, well, if you pull the trigger, no matter how limited and how measured, it is, it's a warlike act and, therefore, you are going to war with Iran. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's the same choice Obama gave us with 150,000 troops in Syria as one option, meant major war, or do nothing as the other option.

Iran first, and officials now saying Iranian gunboats have surrounded one of those stricken oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. And guess what? They're refusing to let it leave. Then there's Hong Kong, where we could be headed for a repeat of those violent demonstrations, another big one reportedly being planned for this weekend. And we are watching all of it, and why Wall Street so far doesn't seem to be concerned by any of it. Weird. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. Welcome to \"Your World.\" President Trump says the attacks on those oil tankers have Iran written all over it To Jennifer Griffin on how the Pentagon is dealing with it. Hey, Jennifer."

U.S. officials also tell me four tugboats contracted to pull the Norwegian-owned tanker, one of the two tankers damaged in an attack Thursday, have been prevented from doing so by Iranian gunboats that have surrounded the stricken tanker. At first, the Iranians put out a press release saying they rescued all 44 of the sailors on these two disabled tankers. U.S. officials now tell us one of the two tanker crews were in fact detained by the Iranians early Thursday morning after first being rescued by another merchant vessel. One of the crew members spoke earlier today on Iranian state TV."

Important to remember those 23 sailors detained by Iran have now been held for nearly two days against their will. U.S. Central Command released this photo showing what it says is an unexploded mine attached to the whole of one of the tankers attacked outside the Persian Gulf Thursday. This video also released by the U.S. military shows what it claims is proof of Iran's involvement in the attacks. Officials say this Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard boat later removed that unexploded mine from the hull. Iran denies it played any role in the attacks. U.S. officials say all 21 sailors from the Japanese-owned tanker were rescued by the American guided missile destroyer Bainbridge and have been treated and returned to their ship and are preparing to tow the stricken vessel back to port. Iranian vessels remain lurking nearby the damage hull. Officials say the unexploded mine removed from the tanker is the same type of mine, Neil, used to attack four oil tankers last month in the same area -- Neil."

Meanwhile, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders says that the Gulf of Oman attack shouldn't be used for a pretext to go to war with Iran. He might be getting a little ahead of himself right now. But let's get the read from General Jack Keane. General, if it's unequivocal proof, and they say it is, then what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACK KEANE, SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, we need to share the intelligence with our allies in the region, with the Europeans and also with the Japanese. And we should form a coalition of support against what's taken place. The Iranians are clearly disrupting the major oil artery in the world here, much as they did once before in the late 1980s. And it didn't end well for them under the Reagan administration because of the actions they took. But I think that's step one. Step two, Neil, is U.S. begins to escort ships with coalition partners through the Persian Gulf. The Iranians will likely escalate. And they will put mines out there, as they did in the late 1980s. What Reagan did under those circumstances is this. In 1987, we took a Kuwaiti tanker, and we re-flagged under U.S. flag, hoping it would have more protection, ran it through the Persian Gulf. The Iranians attacked it. Reagan directed military action against two Iranian oil platforms that were destroyed in the Rostam field. In 1988, U.S. escorts are bringing ships through the Persian Gulf. A U.S. frigate is hit by an Iranian mine. Reagan directed military action against the Revolutionary Guard. Navy staging bases destroyed many of their vessels and also destroyed two more oil platforms. That crisis ended with that action. That I think is sort of the path that we're on. There's other options that the military may have based on what the Iranians are doing. But I think that's sort of the direction we're heading, Neil."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know what I wonder about, General, a lot is that how easily this can go to extremes, and what Iran would be thinking to push it to extremes, especially now, where this time you have the -- pretty much the entire Arab League saying something's got to be done, and they're fingering one of their own to say with them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, here's a couple of denominators that we should really keep in mind. One, Iran doesn't want to go to a major war with the United States. So that's the denominator one. Will they escalate to try to take the pressure off of them that the United States has imposed on them by getting the international community to tell the United States, back off the Iranians, we got to get that oil flowing on that major artery in the Persian Gulf? The Trump administration is not going to do it. But the Iranians are going to still keep trying that, because they're in a desperate situation, Neil. But all that said, you can take measured, limited military action to enforce diplomacy without the provocation of going to war. And it's a false choice when people say, well, if you pull the trigger, no matter how limited and how measured, it is, it's a warlike act and, therefore, you are going to war with Iran. That's the same choice Obama gave us with 150,000 troops in Syria as one option, meant major war, or do nothing as the other option. Doing nothing here is not in the United States' national interests."

We have all been through a week of a lot of turmoil. And this isn't going away. This is something that, as you -- as I saw -- as I heard you mention, I mean, this is about what Beijing is doing and what what's going to the future of Hong Kong, I mean, what's going to happen to the autonomy of this place. Is this -- people aren't laying down for this. I have never seen anything like a million people in the streets. And that's what we saw this last weekend."

And since that time, what's brought people into the streets is the extradition agreement. And this is something that they want to pass, that the government wants to pass here. And what people are worried about is that, if they have any dissent, they're just going to go to China, they're going to be extradited there, and they won't have any voice. And what they're worried about is this lack of autonomy, again, another blow to what Hong Kong has as an autonomous place."

      "speaker": "MCDERMID",

Major figures, major figures close to Carrie Lam, who is the chief executive here, have said this is a bad idea. Let's just slow down a little bit . The Catholic Church and said, let's slow down. I mean, all of the labor unions have said this, the teachers union, I mean, the social workers union. A lot of people are saying, hey, let's slow down on this. But we don't know what's going to happen. And let's take it from the other perspective. What if Beijing, through Carrie Lam, what if, what if they do slow down? Then every time that people get into the streets, they just pull back on everything. So you're in a stalemate here. You're in a real standoff. And it's intense."

So how to make sense of all of this and the markets' surprising resilience through all of this? We have got market watcher Gary B. Smith, The Heritage Foundation's Lieutenant Colonel Dakota Wood. Gary, this doesn't make sense to me, but you have reminded oftentimes the market zigged when it looks like they should zag. They were doing a lot of digging. Why?"

I think the market is -- it took the oil crisis, we will call it, the attack on the tankers, in stride because it knows that we're in a different energy economy that we were even five, 10 years ago. As far as trade, the other big one, tariffs with China and Mexico, they seem to -- at least Mexico is off the table and China seems have stabilized. There's no new news, if you will."

      "utterance": "We should explain. That Morgan Stanley report tracks services, manufacturing, hiring. It's sort of like an all-inclusive index that now is at its lowest point since the financial crisis, but there are other reports that go just the opposite direction. Having said that, Colonel, I would like to get your thoughts on the collective read from many that they don't think this Iran thing is going to blow up into anything, obviously. They feel the same way, as Gary said, about China. They might be just looking at the half-full glass. Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LT. COL. DAKOTA WOOD (RET.), U.S. MARINE CORPS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, there isn't any positioning by any of the major actors for a full-blown conflict. So it kind of limits how bad things might get. I mean, as you had an earlier section there about potential strikes against Iran based on what they continue to do, we rippled Tomahawk cruise missiles into Syria when chemical munitions were used by Bashar al-Assad. So you can have very limited responses in these very tense situations without escalating into full-blown war, and nobody is talking about anything like that vis-a-vis China. So I think it's limited in scope. All the cards are on the table. Folks have made their positions known. And as our other guest has talked about, the market has accounted for that. So unless something really crazy happens, I think this is just the normal that we see on a day-to-day basis."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "If I could follow that up with you, Colonel, are you surprised that the Iranians, if this is true and they're behind these attacks, continue to do them, I mean, in the face of what seems like half our Naval fleet and flight -- fleet, I should say, is in the region? They know what they must be tempting here, and they know the opposition they're getting this go-round from the entire Arab League, not a fan of what they're up to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOOD",
      "utterance": "Right, yes. Folks, I mean, after two years, which is kind of crazy, they're still trying to understand President Trump. So, in previous administrations, a regime like Iran would behave very badly. The United States or other Western powers would make all kinds of blustery statements. But then usually you would cede something, and this administration isn't willing to cede things, right? So if Iran is going to threaten international shipping, a major source of energy for much of the world, not so much for the United States anymore, we're going to stand our ground and tell them that that behavior is not acceptable. And I think people are understanding that position of the United States. Why Iran continues down this path while they're the world sponsor of terrorism, fomenting war in Yemen, threatening to attack U.S. interests in Iraq, it's just a crazy regime. And so I think the administration is fully justified and it's on the proper path to hold this hard line."

You throw in what's happening with the dollar, what's happening with the euro, it's up and down, that, to me, is -- I am as surprised at those moves as anyone else.

That is the plan that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has ironed out.

We're going to show you some revealing polls in just a second. But what could be going on here? Again, to a crowd that likes this, this is something that is sticking with them. The Washington Examiner's Tiana Lowe. We have also got Democratic strategist David Burstein. David, I think last time you and I were chatting, you were mentioning this, that this was something you wanted to see out of candidates. You were seeing it at the time in Elizabeth Warren. And now she's getting the bang for the research buck in the polls. What do you make of that?"

      "speaker": "DAVID BURSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",

We have a huge college debt problem in this country. And it is a huge drain on the earnings of people of my generation. Mayor Pete, who you have got up there right now, he himself has a huge amount of student loan debt. And this would be a one-time -- one-time thing that would have a huge impact on the lifetime earnings and potential of people who are not having families, who are delaying homeownership, all the things that we actually need to have a long-term vital economy that have proven to be quite important. People are delaying and they're changing their behavior because they're saddled with this kind of debt. So I think this is actually a very smart plan. I know -- I'm sure people will be critical of it, as they are with all big new policy proposals. But I give her a lot of credit for having put together this very thoughtfully and really addressing a real problem where it hurts for people."

Now, you can quibble with what she's talking about here and who she's targeting, largely the rich, the upper 2 percent on the college thing, but I'm wondering how Republicans respond to that. Obviously, they could do the thing of big government and the dangers of that, and you're going to pay for this, even though she's going to come back and say, no, no, no, actually, I'm saddling the rich with this.

I mean, even if you look at her free public college plan, it's far less detailed than that proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders. You see she's proposing this, and it's going to cost, what, $640 billion? That's more than our entire annual defense budget. And is it a one-time payment? Sure. But does it also give the go-ahead to colleges to continue to explode their bureaucracies? In the last quarter-century, the amount of university bureaucrats in America has doubled. And is the quality of their degrees doubling? No, but we have -- we have created this pipeline. We have unfettered complete federal student loans, so universities know they can screw taxpayers, and they can screw students by jacking up prices. And this is just giving them a green light to do so."

This is -- I actually think -- to Tiana's point, I think this should be coupled with some kind of regulation, some ability to rein in the way that colleges have been doing this for some time.

These universities, they're technically nonprofits, and lots of them are technically private, but they're still being spoon-fed federal funding at every course, and us taxpayers, we are directly subsidizing these bureaucracies through student loans. If Liz Warren wants to start investigating these schools and what they are doing with our money, I am all for that. And I think that could be bipartisan."

That's probably not surprising, because there's so many Democrats running. But it got us thinking about whether Barack Obama is all together behind Joe Biden, or he's looking at others in the race. Campus Reform's editor in chief, Lawrence Jones, with us, Democratic strategist Nathan Rubin, and the host of \"Sincerely, Kat,\" among many things, on FOX Nation and here at FOX itself, Kat Timpf. That is what struck me, Nathan, that I know the president has to be Switzerland right now.

He said that Hillary was the most qualified candidate in modern-day history, the person to run for president ever. That was his pitch to America. And he felt personally insulted that if anybody, especially in the black community, would go out and not support Hillary. So does that sound like a guy that really wanted his vice president to run in that position? Look, most of what -- in most times, what happens is, the president wants the continuation of his legacy. He wants his vice president to continue that. Obama didn't do that. And I think we got to think long and hard. If the guy that served as vice president for all these years, right, if the president didn't want him to be the candidate, should America want him to be the president of the United States right now?"

Now, that was largely expected here, saying that it's an overreach on the part of Democrats who've been doing this simply for nothing more than political gain. It's a back and forth. It won't stop. We're going to be exploring this, by the way, a lot more, along with what's happening in Hong Kong and Iran with our live show tomorrow kicking off at 10:00 a.m. But, again, the Justice Department saying no tax returns, not now, ain't happening.
