      "sentences": "Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Tonight, so many big stories to share with you. I wish I had a second hour, do we have that? No, we don't. President Trump goes on offense against the Mueller team. The DOJ agrees to his demands to investigate whether the Obama administration spied on his campaign. Carter Page is here to describe what it was like to be targeted by an FBI informant. Meanwhile, Trump goes to war with John Brennan suggesting Obama's CIA chief began the entire Russia witch hunt because of politics. Plus, we have a stunning report on the immigration crisis. No one talks about this. Chain migration, it's a nightmare. The head of Customs and Border Protection is here to reveal the startling new numbers and absurd and obscene charges against the bureau as well. And Raymond arroyo will be here to break down the media's -- speaking of absurd, let's say ridiculous covering of the royal wedding. What are your tea and scones. But first, I spy with my little eye something crooked at the FBI. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" On Sunday, President Trump had had enough. He pointedly tweeted, \"I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI, DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump campaign for political purposes. And if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama administration.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, Trump has a good sense. This is nothing new in a way. On March 4th, 2017, more than a year ago, President Trump contended that his phones were tapped just prior to the election and of course, they get Trump media in the deep state all dismissed it. It was all a bunch of nonsense. Well, of course we now know that the Justice Department sought and secured permission to surveilled Trump Advisor Carter Page, whom you will hear from in just a moment. The problem was the 2016 Page FISA warrant was obtained in part using fraudulent information from that infamous Steele dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign. Now again reset your brain for a moment. Think about that. In the middle of a presidential election, when a man who was running for president is bowing to drain the swamp, there could have been a plot hatched at the senior levels of our government to entrap secondary figures in the Trump campaign to ultimately get to Donald Trump himself. Then those figures were targeted and surveilled, again, even possibly Trump himself. Well, of course, Democrats laughed, laughed all of this off as spurious. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEMBER, REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D—CALIFORNIA: This claim by the president suggestion by Giuliana that there is a political spy embedded in the Trump campaign is nonsense and you hear it in the same terms that Trump often speaks, which is people are saying or I'm hearing or we are being told, that's another way of saying this is patently untrue, but we would like to spread it anyway and it is single he destructive of our institutions, but then, that's the point. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "No. Congressman Schiff, the point is day by day we learn more information that seems to indicate that the government may have used its prosecutorial and investigative powers for a political end. To do what? Well, to stop Candidate Trump, and when that failed, to derail his presidency. This is the deep state in action. I think it's really unwise to dismiss out of hand the notion that the FBI could have found it within itself to spy on the Trump campaign. They never would have done that. While as \"The Federalist\" David (inaudible) reminds us, \"John Brennan spied on the legislative branch and lied about it to the American people. James Clapper spied on the American people through a domestic surveillance program and lied about it to Congress. And although the Obama administration never tweeted any nasty attacks on journalists, it did spy on and prosecute them. It's completely plausible that those in the upper echelon of law enforcement saw Trump as a threat, then used wobbly evidence as the pretext to investigate his campaign,\" close quote. A great piece, by the way. For more than a year now the president and the House Intel Committee led by Devin Nunes has sought the initial unredacted documents that sparked this collusion broke. Well, today, the FBI director and the deputy AG have agreed to give congressional members access to highly classified documents about the Russia probe. Now they want to see the information concerning the FBI informant who reportedly cozied up to at least three Trump associates. What do you call this guy, a spy, and informant or just a mole? Who cares? That's just semantics. According to reports, the FBI sent this informant out to make contact with Carter Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis. This informant reportedly had a sit down with Carter Page in early July of 2016. Well, that's interesting, because that undermines former FBI Director Jim Comey's contention that the FBI didn't begin its investigation until late July. Incidentally, between 2012 all the way up to 2018, now, according to public records, this same informant received more than a million dollars. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What kind of general foreign policy research and he conducted this all through the Department of Defense. That's another interesting point. That's all very fishy. Come on. Many questions remain about this and they are unanswered. Today following that White House meeting, the president said he has been able to get the Justice Department to authorize another inspector general probe into these spy allegations. Well, the problem with referring this investigation to the inspector general, as good of a guy as he is, he has no prosecutorial or official subpoena powers. So, even if he does find rank abuse by Obama officials or perhaps, who knows, even Obama himself, if he knew about it, the inspector general will only be able to refer that information to the Justice Department. What good does that end up doing? The president and all of us do have a right to know the names of any and all Americans who were surveilled as part of this anti-Trump hit squad over at the DOJ. And when we finally get to the bottom of all of this we should have the names of any officials current or former who were part of what I believe was an obscene abuse of power. They should be held accountable, all of them, to the fullest extent of the law. And of course, the $64,000 question is who else in the Obama administration other than Jim Comey, the people of other have already been identified, signed off on this, approved of this? How much did Attorney General Loretta Lynch know about cross fire hurricane? And while there is historical distance between the White House and the DOJ on ongoing cases, kind of independent, you think about it, it kind of is unfathomable that Jim Comey and company would conduct an operation like this one without at least informing the president of the United States, of course, then Barack Obama. As long as these questions hang out there, I really believe that Americans, more and more of them are going to think that our government tried and maybe is still trying to pull off a political coup against the antiestablishment figure, Donald Trump. And that's the \"Angle.\" Joining us now for reaction is the aforementioned Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor whom the FBI surveilled. As well as Michael Cavuto, a former Trump campaign aide who has been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team. Gentlemen, it's great to have you both on tonight. Thank you so much for joining us. Carter, let's start with you. You had a lot of contact with this informant, whatever we want to call them, informant, spy, mole. And I want to read one of the emails that he sent to you that was released by, I think it was \"Daily Caller\" got this initially. Dear Carter, I thought I'd write as the summer wears on to ask how you are and what your plans are at this point. It seems attention has shifted a bit from the collusion investigation to the contempt within the White House and how or if Mr. Scaramucci will be accommodated there. I must assume this gives you some relief. We are here in Virginia, et cetera, et cetera. Be in touch when you have the time. It would be great to catch up.\" We are not mentioning the informant's name, but Carter, when did you first meet this informant that we now know is an informant and just briefly tell us about that exchange. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Former CIA Chief John Brennan called that a, quote, \"disastrous path\" and accused Trump of self-serving action.

Joining us now from Denver to discuss that is Ryan McMaken, senior editor at this Mises Institute, and former aide to Chuck Schumer Chris Hahn is with us in New York. Great to see both of you. Let's start with you, Ryan. Where are we on this? Because it really is alarming. We have more dead students, we have a town in morning 30 miles outside of Houston.

And so after the Parkland disaster back in February we started to see some data that was coming out that started to come to our attention, and some of that came from James Alan Fox at Northeastern University who has some new research coming out showing where he counts up all of these gun incidents that took place over the past 25 years or so, and there wasn't evidence to suggest that this is a growing trend. If anything it shows that the numbers are declining. And at the same time there was new Justice Department data that came out in November of last year showing that school violence is declining as well. And then just to add additional context of that, this all seems quite possible when you consider the fact that the FBI annual data on homicide shows that homicides have basically been cut in half since the 1990s. Homicides are much lower now than they were 20 and 30 years ago.",

      "utterance": "Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Tonight, so many big stories to share with you. I wish I had a second hour, do we have that? No, we don't. President Trump goes on offense against the Mueller team. The DOJ agrees to his demands to investigate whether the Obama administration spied on his campaign. Carter Page is here to describe what it was like to be targeted by an FBI informant. Meanwhile, Trump goes to war with John Brennan suggesting Obama's CIA chief began the entire Russia witch hunt because of politics. Plus, we have a stunning report on the immigration crisis. No one talks about this. Chain migration, it's a nightmare. The head of Customs and Border Protection is here to reveal the startling new numbers and absurd and obscene charges against the bureau as well. And Raymond arroyo will be here to break down the media's -- speaking of absurd, let's say ridiculous covering of the royal wedding. What are your tea and scones. But first, I spy with my little eye something crooked at the FBI. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" On Sunday, President Trump had had enough. He pointedly tweeted, \"I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI, DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump campaign for political purposes. And if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama administration.\" Well, Trump has a good sense. This is nothing new in a way. On March 4th, 2017, more than a year ago, President Trump contended that his phones were tapped just prior to the election and of course, they get Trump media in the deep state all dismissed it. It was all a bunch of nonsense. Well, of course we now know that the Justice Department sought and secured permission to surveilled Trump Advisor Carter Page, whom you will hear from in just a moment. The problem was the 2016 Page FISA warrant was obtained in part using fraudulent information from that infamous Steele dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign. Now again reset your brain for a moment. Think about that. In the middle of a presidential election, when a man who was running for president is bowing to drain the swamp, there could have been a plot hatched at the senior levels of our government to entrap secondary figures in the Trump campaign to ultimately get to Donald Trump himself. Then those figures were targeted and surveilled, again, even possibly Trump himself. Well, of course, Democrats laughed, laughed all of this off as spurious. HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEMBER, REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D—CALIFORNIA: This claim by the president suggestion by Giuliana that there is a political spy embedded in the Trump campaign is nonsense and you hear it in the same terms that Trump often speaks, which is people are saying or I'm hearing or we are being told, that's another way of saying this is patently untrue, but we would like to spread it anyway and it is single he destructive of our institutions, but then, that's the point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "No. Congressman Schiff, the point is day by day we learn more information that seems to indicate that the government may have used its prosecutorial and investigative powers for a political end. To do what? Well, to stop Candidate Trump, and when that failed, to derail his presidency. This is the deep state in action. I think it's really unwise to dismiss out of hand the notion that the FBI could have found it within itself to spy on the Trump campaign. They never would have done that. While as \"The Federalist\" David (inaudible) reminds us, \"John Brennan spied on the legislative branch and lied about it to the American people. James Clapper spied on the American people through a domestic surveillance program and lied about it to Congress. And although the Obama administration never tweeted any nasty attacks on journalists, it did spy on and prosecute them. It's completely plausible that those in the upper echelon of law enforcement saw Trump as a threat, then used wobbly evidence as the pretext to investigate his campaign,\" close quote. A great piece, by the way. For more than a year now the president and the House Intel Committee led by Devin Nunes has sought the initial unredacted documents that sparked this collusion broke. Well, today, the FBI director and the deputy AG have agreed to give congressional members access to highly classified documents about the Russia probe. Now they want to see the information concerning the FBI informant who reportedly cozied up to at least three Trump associates. What do you call this guy, a spy, and informant or just a mole? Who cares? That's just semantics. According to reports, the FBI sent this informant out to make contact with Carter Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis. This informant reportedly had a sit down with Carter Page in early July of 2016. Well, that's interesting, because that undermines former FBI Director Jim Comey's contention that the FBI didn't begin its investigation until late July. Incidentally, between 2012 all the way up to 2018, now, according to public records, this same informant received more than a million dollars. What kind of general foreign policy research and he conducted this all through the Department of Defense. That's another interesting point. That's all very fishy. Come on. Many questions remain about this and they are unanswered. Today following that White House meeting, the president said he has been able to get the Justice Department to authorize another inspector general probe into these spy allegations. Well, the problem with referring this investigation to the inspector general, as good of a guy as he is, he has no prosecutorial or official subpoena powers. So, even if he does find rank abuse by Obama officials or perhaps, who knows, even Obama himself, if he knew about it, the inspector general will only be able to refer that information to the Justice Department. What good does that end up doing? The president and all of us do have a right to know the names of any and all Americans who were surveilled as part of this anti-Trump hit squad over at the DOJ. And when we finally get to the bottom of all of this we should have the names of any officials current or former who were part of what I believe was an obscene abuse of power. They should be held accountable, all of them, to the fullest extent of the law. And of course, the $64,000 question is who else in the Obama administration other than Jim Comey, the people of other have already been identified, signed off on this, approved of this? How much did Attorney General Loretta Lynch know about cross fire hurricane? And while there is historical distance between the White House and the DOJ on ongoing cases, kind of independent, you think about it, it kind of is unfathomable that Jim Comey and company would conduct an operation like this one without at least informing the president of the United States, of course, then Barack Obama. As long as these questions hang out there, I really believe that Americans, more and more of them are going to think that our government tried and maybe is still trying to pull off a political coup against the antiestablishment figure, Donald Trump. And that's the \"Angle.\" Joining us now for reaction is the aforementioned Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor whom the FBI surveilled. As well as Michael Cavuto, a former Trump campaign aide who has been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team. Gentlemen, it's great to have you both on tonight. Thank you so much for joining us. Carter, let's start with you. You had a lot of contact with this informant, whatever we want to call them, informant, spy, mole. And I want to read one of the emails that he sent to you that was released by, I think it was \"Daily Caller\" got this initially. Dear Carter, I thought I'd write as the summer wears on to ask how you are and what your plans are at this point. It seems attention has shifted a bit from the collusion investigation to the contempt within the White House and how or if Mr. Scaramucci will be accommodated there. I must assume this gives you some relief. We are here in Virginia, et cetera, et cetera. Be in touch when you have the time. It would be great to catch up.\" We are not mentioning the informant's name, but Carter, when did you first meet this informant that we now know is an informant and just briefly tell us about that exchange."

I think they were really treating him poorly and I think a lot of us owe carter an apology because we didn't wait to hear the truth at the end and now we are finding out that his country was really failing him for months and months and even years. I'm angry, I'm surprised that Carter is not. He's a greater man than I. This is really sick and twisted stuff.

I got a positive impression about this informant. A couple of people I mentioned him to in the campaign, I was pretty positive endorsement.

      "utterance": "President Trump swore in new CIA Director Gina Haspel today while also targeting one of her predecessors in a furious war of words on Twitter. It began yesterday when the president demanded that the Justice Department investigate whether the FBI and DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump campaign for political purposes during the Obama administration. Former CIA Chief John Brennan called that a, quote, \"disastrous path\" and accused Trump of self-serving action. While Trump replied by quoting Dan Bongino on \"Fox & Friends\" this morning who said Brennan is panicking because he has disgraced himself in the entire intel community. Dan Bongino accused Brennan of starting the entire Russia investigation which he called the political hit job, not an intelligence investigation. The big question now is the intel community under Obama spy on the Trump campaign for political purposes as I asked in Angle? Let's discuss that with former NSA intel official, William Binney here the studio with me and in Boston, former Delta Force Officer Jeff Beatty, CIA counterterrorist case officer and a hostage rescue advisor to the FBI. Great to have both of you on. William, let's start with you. I find this narrative to be so disturbing on so many levels. We go back to the spring of 2016 when on a few occasions Loretta Lynch could have approved a defensive briefing of the Trump campaign saying that we see your list of advisors, it includes this guy Carter Page. Just might want to know we've been watching him for some time and she said no. On two occasions they could have informed the Trump campaign of their concerns. They did not want to do that."

And I hate to say it, but we could speculate on this, those are the words of a word I used last week with you of a propagandist. When you are out there using innuendo and speculation you are just trying to cast a net out there and trying to roll back actually a failure that Brennan suffered. I mean, Brennan has suffered multiple failures at Putin's hands. As a director of the CIA there was the Crimea annexation on his watch. There was the Russian incursion into Eastern Ukraine on Brennan's watch. The whole 2016 Russian meddling in the election all happened on Brennan's watch. He failed four times and the fourth is he's feeling now because Putin is objective, Putin has been the winner. His objective really wasn't about making Trump the winner of the election, it was about weakening the United States. Whatever it would take to cause division, to make us less effective so that we would be not united in opposing the Russian international agenda and that's been successful in Brennan once again is paying into his hands."

We don't have to go into it, but would amnesty or dangling the prospect of amnesty at this point as we approach the summer months, would that make your job easier or more difficult?"

They went to 100 percent prosecution, so the secretary has directed us to refer all people who cross the border illegally for prosecution, and so we are starting to ramp up those capabilities as well. What we've learned over the years if you apply consequences to people doing illegal activity you'll get less of it."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Try any other network and you'll hear we are in a crisis experiencing more school shootings than ever before. There's only one thing wrong with that, fact. It's not a fact. The people at this Mises Institute recently took a dispassionate look at the number of school shooting incident in the 1990s compared to today. What they discovered may shock you. Joining us now from Denver to discuss that is Ryan McMaken, senior editor at this Mises Institute, and former aide to Chuck Schumer Chris Hahn is with us in New York. Great to see both of you. Let's start with you, Ryan. Where are we on this? Because it really is alarming. We have more dead students, we have a town in morning 30 miles outside of Houston. We have a lot of politicians who want to something with gun control or gun safety reform, whatever they are calling it. But what is the truth about the actual numbers here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RYAN MCMAKEN, MISES INSTITUTE",
      "utterance": "Of course you can never be in a position where you say, hey, there's not homicides, no big deal, problem solved. But when people start talking about how there's an epidemic, how there's a crisis, I'm tempted to go and look at the actual data to see if that's true if we are going to use that is the basis for policymaking. And so after the Parkland disaster back in February we started to see some data that was coming out that started to come to our attention, and some of that came from James Alan Fox at Northeastern University who has some new research coming out showing where he counts up all of these gun incidents that took place over the past 25 years or so, and there wasn't evidence to suggest that this is a growing trend. If anything it shows that the numbers are declining. And at the same time there was new Justice Department data that came out in November of last year showing that school violence is declining as well. And then just to add additional context of that, this all seems quite possible when you consider the fact that the FBI annual data on homicide shows that homicides have basically been cut in half since the 1990s. Homicides are much lower now than they were 20 and 30 years ago."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Let's go to Chris on this. Chris, any student lost in a horrific shooting is heartbreaking for families, for the entire community. But it is interesting to see how the media are playing this as a trend, it's something that's going to keep happening, et cetera, et cetera for. One thing happened on CNN today I want to play for you. We don't have time to play the full minute clip. It was on MSNBC, excuse me. It was a full minute long clip of a reporter trying to get these baseball players in Santa Fe high school to say something about gun control. This is just one part of it, let's watch."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Anyway, none of the baseball players would kind of take the bait on the question. I found it odd to do that. People want to be involved with gun control, they can be involved with gun control. But don't like put them -- the other kids are doing this. It's just a little odd. Chris, what about the numbers question by Ryan's study and this Northeastern study?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS HAHN, RADIO TALK SHOW",
      "utterance": "So I looked at it and the study stops in 2013, so we can't really compare what was happening in the last five years from what happened in 2013. Remember, there has been 288 shootings up until today in schools since 2009. That's 57 times more than all the other members of the biggest industrialized countries in the world combined, the G7 combined. So in the United States of America you are 57 times more likely than all of the other G7 nations in the world to be shot in a school. So what are we doing differently than those schools, than those other countries? And I think we have more lax gun control in this country and that's why we're having more shootings. And we have a culture of guns. I'm not saying there's a one-size-fits-all solution here, Laura, but I am saying we've got to take a real hard look at how people store their guns and who gets a gun."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Ryan, 2013. If that's right, that's a pretty devastating response. It's not up to 2018, 2017? What's going on with the study?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCMAKEN",
      "utterance": "There's two things we can note here. First of all, the statistic just quoted about there being more than 200 shootings over that time period, Fox actually addressed that in a February \"USA Today\" column where he noted that more than 50 percent of those shootings were incidents that were just a person who attempted suicide or completed suicide on a campus, or incidents involving a gun where no one was actually shot or injured. So what they've done is they've taken and vastly expanded their definition of what it is."

The strong resistance by the former O administration alone proves their guilt.\" We shall see. That's all the time we have tonight. Mike Emanuel is in for Shannon Bream tonight.
