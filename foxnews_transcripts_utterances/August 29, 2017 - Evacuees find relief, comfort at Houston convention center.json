And that's been a big part of this. You know, they were prepared. They had regular meetings. They've been discussing things twice a day in that building and briefing the local authorities that need to be briefed on what the action plan is. And the fact that the governor is here today is helpful, as well. And it just -- it indicates the seriousness of the situation. You know, they realize that they're in danger. That they've had a ridiculous amount of rainfall here in Louisiana, as well, and of course, they're used to it. This area floods regularly when there is heavy rain, continuous heavy rain, as does New Orleans. And New Orleans is expecting more rain as this storm moves to shore. You know, there are flash flood warnings across the state, as well as warnings for tornadic activity tonight into tomorrow because the remnants of Harvey are expected to come back ashore into Southwest Louisiana and towards the New Orleans area.

But when you see the citizenship and the courage and the compassion of the people on the grounds who don't see a race or a gender or a creed or a class. They are just looking out for each other.

And we're just now start to get into a phase two and hopefully it won't last too long. But with the levees kind of overflowing, this is when the feds come in and it becomes more politicized and bureaucratize.

That's still -- everyone is hoping they hold and that they do. But they may not, and so this becomes a logistics issue. You've got FEMA. You've got 12,000 Texas National Guard members, but they may ask for up to 30,000 because you're going to need the ability to evacuate even more as the floodplain expands. People who thought they weren't going to have to leave because they're on their second story bedroom, now they're --first story anymore. They've got to go. So this is -- if you're going to get weary as a public and say, man, more flooding in Houston? This is now the time you've got to be even more vigilant as the water sort of quietly creeps.

So they have to release the water, but when they release the water, this is what you get. And it's been rising all day, and I can't tell you when it's going to stop. I don't know."

And we still -- there's a couple, an elderly couple, and she's got about the hardest head I've seen on anyone. She would not be moved, as much as being nice, telling her you've got to go. No, no.

They have shirts, and bedding, and shoes, and umbrellas, everything that the people arrive here and did not have. Plenty of people here arrived dripping wet. Some people didn't have shoes. They didn't even have time to get the basics. They're met with a blanket, a smile, and a hug. And when they're here they are getting a hot meal. We have some adorable little girls down here we met.

      "speaker": "RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Pete, we're outside the Lake Charles Civic Center, which is being reopened, opened this hour as a shelter. This area has been getting rain for the last seven days. It's completely saturated. And every time another squall blows through or they get a heavy piece of rain, thunderstorms, it's flooding streets, flooding neighborhoods and flooding homes, and people are being rescued. We witnessed dozens of rescues last night. There were, in fact, nearly 500 people plucked from their homes and brought to shelters. One of the shelters that we visited earlier today at the Purple Heart Rec Center was surrounded by water. The floodwater was rising around the shelter itself. So some of those folks, all of those folks are being moved to this shelter. And, in fact, the governor of Louisiana is inside right now, touring this facility, Governor John Bel Edwards. And we're expecting him to come out any minute now, and we expect him to come over here and brief us on what's happening. One other thing I want to tell you guys before I toss it back is behind us here, in this parking lot, you can see a lot of the boats on flatbeds behind pickup trucks. Those are members of the Cajun Navy you've heard so much about. They're going to Texas; they're affecting rescues. And they're coming back here to Louisiana to get fuel. And we're told they're going to be given food, as well. They're bringing a truck in as another rain squall moves in. They're going to bring a big fuel truck in here to gas up those boats and the vehicles so that these guys can go back and forth between Louisiana and Texas. Let's just step up here for a second. Want to get out of the rain. I think the governor's headed this way. Guys, back to you."

And, you know, the hurricane took a turn in Houston that made it -- it happened very quickly. Do you feel like it's -- they're pretty prepared on the ground there ?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",

They prepositioned boat in high water vehicles and National Guard-activated members in this parish alone and stages them at different areas where they thought they would be needed. And in fact, they were needed. And they've been helping out with the rescues, with some of those big high- water vehicles that can carry as many as 16 people out of neighborhoods that are swamped. They also have boats that they pre-staged. And they have other resources. The fire department, the sheriff's department have been out there with their stuff, as well. And you see many of the local citizens have been coming out to do their part. The governor, he's coming this way. All right. So if you guys can stand with us or hang with us for a minute or two. Or if you want to come back to us, the governor's going to be here very shortly."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "We'll stay with you, Rick. I have a quick question for you. Undoubtedly, the comparisons with Hurricane Katrina and what's happening now with Harvey are there and present, especially today. Can you articulate some of the specific lessons learned, so to speak, from people that obviously witnessed Katrina 12 years ago and are now going through Harvey right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "Well, one of the lessons, one of the obvious lessons is -- is knowing where to put your stuff and being ready. Including being ready with food, with shelter, with water, with provisions and with people. As you see some of the police officers, members of the National Guard, they've been having regular briefings out here, weather briefings and safety briefings at the facility right across the street, the emergency operations center. And that's been a big part of this. You know, they were prepared. They had regular meetings. They've been discussing things twice a day in that building and briefing the local authorities that need to be briefed on what the action plan is. And the fact that the governor is here today is helpful, as well. And it just -- it indicates the seriousness of the situation. You know, they realize that they're in danger. That they've had a ridiculous amount of rainfall here in Louisiana, as well, and of course, they're used to it. This area floods regularly when there is heavy rain, continuous heavy rain, as does New Orleans. And New Orleans is expecting more rain as this storm moves to shore. You know, there are flash flood warnings across the state, as well as warnings for tornadic activity tonight into tomorrow because the remnants of Harvey are expected to come back ashore into Southwest Louisiana and towards the New Orleans area. So again, I apologize for this big build-up, but the governor was inside touring this facility that's about to become or has now become a shelter for displaced residents. And there were some 500 residents displaced in Calcasieu Parish and surrounding towns just overnight. And because they're expecting heavy weather to come through again tonight, maybe six to 10 inches or more over the next two days, they wanted to be sure they had plenty of room for the residents who may be in -- this place tonight, in addition to the hundreds who have been forced out of their homes. As the governor approaches, we'll ask him about that."

      "utterance": "Well, obviously we're getting prepared still, because even though we've been having rain bands associated with the storm in our state for a couple of days now, we're actually going to have landfall sometime overnight and before noon tomorrow. A slightly reenergized Tropical Storm Harvey that is still drawing a lot of moisture off the Gulf and, quite frankly, we can't afford to have a lot more rain in Louisiana on top of what we've already had."
    },

      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEL EDWARDS",
      "utterance": "We're going to get it. And as a result, we're having to open shelters. We actually have some search and rescues last night. About 500 individuals from three locations in and around Calcasieu Parish that had to be rescued. And a number of them are still in the shelter, because they don't have anywhere to go."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEL EDWARDS",
      "utterance": "Thankfully, most of them have found relatives or friends whose homes are dry. But we're going to have more of this, and so we're preparing. That's why we're here today, talking to local partners. We also have FEMA representatives with us, because this is like partnership. And making sure that we're staging assets at the right place and that communications are good so that we can protect life. That's the most important thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "These are lessons that have been learned over the years over multiple major storms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEL EDWARDS",
      "utterance": "Unfortunately, we have too much experience. But when we need to draw upon that expanse, it's a good thing. Because we have a lot of people who've been through this before. Leadership, whether it's the National Guard, whether state police or wildlife and fisheries, you name it. But also, the parish-level folks, the sheriffs, the police sheriffs, the directors of the Office of Emergency Preparedness. They're all doing an excellent job to serve the people, not just here in Calcasieu Parish but around the state of Louisiana."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "And we've seen those efforts. We were out last night watching them rescue dozens of people from a particular neighborhood. And I know these civilians are pitching in as well. We see the Cajun Navy behind me that the civilians are pitching in, as well, and we see the Cajun Navy behind me with all those boats. And I understand that you're going to be providing fuel and food, eventually, for these guys."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEL EDWARDS",
      "utterance": "Well, absolutely. And that's one of the things we're talking about. I did approve providing fuel for the Cajun Navy so that they can come back here, resupply, whether it's food or fuel, whatever they need so they can get back into Texas and get in the game of saving people. And by the way, the folks in Texas are very appreciative of their efforts, because they're doing a great job. And the fact that they're willing to go out of state to do that says a lot about the people of Louisiana. We've always been really, really good at taking care of our own, and now we're being good neighbors to Texas, as well. And by the way, they were great neighbors to us. Twelve years ago today, Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, and we could not have had a better neighbor than Texas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "To that end, I'm told that you're welcoming refugees, evacuees from Texas into Louisiana if they need shelter here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEL EDWARDS",
      "utterance": "We actually have some here right now. But those are individuals. We are offering in the Shreveport area up to 3,400 shelter spaces for people out of Texas that we're trying to coordinate with Texas now. They're deciding whether they need shelter space outside the state. They're going through their analysis. But if they decide that they do, we're willing -- we're not willing, we're anxious to help out and take them in the Shreveport area, and we're working through that right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "Obviously, Texas got it a lot worse than Louisiana this time. How would you describe the situation in your state, as compared to Texas and the Houston area?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEL EDWARDS",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, we've got about 48 more hours before we know how much devastation is brought to us by the storm. As of right now, we've been very blessed, in all honesty. We've only had water in structures -- that means homes and businesses -- primarily here in Calcasieu Parish, a few elsewhere. But we don't know what the storm is going to bring. And those rain bands, by the way, are all the way across Southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi and Alabama. So this truly is a statewide effort that we have. And the flooding can occur anywhere from here to New Orleans and then as the storm tracks northward, as well. So as of right now, we're counting our blessings, because we actually had it much worse last March and last August in 2016 with those floods. But we're anxious to get these next 48 hours behind us."

      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "I just want to reinforce that guy's -- I think the governor is going to be heading over to talk to some of these guys -- maybe not talk to some of these right now, talk to some of these guys with the Cajun Navy behind me. Real quick, I just want to point out -- right here. I just want to point out that this area is saturated, and they are expecting heavy rains. And we went to some of these neighborhoods last night where roads, forgive me, became rivers. Because there was -- in some cases, one, two, three feet of water on the roads up to the bumpers and up to the hoods, preventing driving -- making it very dangerous. That water has receded. We went to the neighborhoods where it was maybe six inches to a foot on some of these roads, and some of them were clear. But because the ground is so saturated, if they do get six inches, eight inches of rain overnight, they're going to have major issues again tonight. So all of these people who worked so hard throughout the night last night are doing, and expected to do the same thing again tonight."

    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Well, Rick Leventhal, great timing, great work. Thank you very much for bringing us that interview in real time on the show. You get the sense, seeing that governor that they have been here before. Feel like you've got the A-team there, responding."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. As tragic as it was, you heard the governor talk about the benefits, the reaping of that experience, and you see it there. In two words I heard it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "Our viewers may get that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I was there. I was a second-year student, 21 years old. And it's devastating. It's terrifying. It is traumatizing. But you see the lessons learned. And two words I loved hearing so much there, coordination and communication. Because that's what we didn't have 12 years ago. There was panic. It was pandemonium. There was absolutely no communication. And that's why we saw the devastation that we saw. This is certainly a very different scene."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right, but there has to be an element of just, are you serious? If you're one of those people who went through this, and then 12 years later today, you're going through it again. I can't imagine emotionally how you would deal with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "It is devastating, Kat, but it's also like a regional thing. My family is from South Louisiana, and Betsy to these hurricanes. And you're always kind of told these rumors of New Orleans flooding and going underneath water and sinking, really, so it's almost a mythical thing to it. But when you're seeing it in real time 12 years later, like the governor said, last year Baton Rouge was basically underwater. So the rebuilding over and over and over again takes a toll."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "It sure does. Well, we'll continue to cover Hurricane Harvey here. But straight ahead, North Korea defied the world in launching a missile right over Japan. How should the U.S. respond as tensions boil yet again? Stay tuned. We're going to talk about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "All options are on the table. That's President Trump's warning to North Korea today after its firing of a ballistic missile over Japan. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., echoed President Trump's response and condemned the defiant provocation from the rogue state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.",
      "utterance": "No country should have missiles flying over them like those 130 million people in Japan. It's unacceptable. They have violated every single U.N. Security Council resolution that we've had. And so I think something serious has to happen. I think enough is enough."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Well, what option does the U.S. have at this point to get North Korea in line? Matt, the issue is, if you do something serious, bad things happen to a lot of innocent people. What do you think should be done here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WELCH",
      "utterance": "I have no idea. That's the problem here. And I think successive U.S. administrations also have no idea. They just pretend, especially on the campaign trail, that they do, that saying tough things can do it. The Trump administration said that the era of strategic patience is over, but they haven't quite elucidated what the strategic impatience looks like. Aside from one interesting wrinkle -- and I think this is important -- President Trump has always emphasized, Japan, you need to do more. South Korea, you need to do more. China, you need to do more, as well. China hasn't really done much. But now this is flying over Japanese airspace. And so I think Japanese and South Koreans are going to be taking the issue more seriously than they have. But there isn't a single red button that you can push -- at least, I hope not -- that can just make this thing stop and go away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Madison, what are your thoughts on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GESIOTTO",
      "utterance": "You know, I think one thing that hasn't been talked enough about is the fact that North Korea made a huge mistake here, and I think they actually gave us a point of leverage when it comes to China. You know, Japan hasn't been -- they haven't had a military that's able to go on the offensive since World War II. They are a self-defense force. If they feel threatened enough, they may militarize, and this could be a threat to China, which we could use, potentially, to make them help with North Korea, which is something they haven't been doing, even though, you know, North Korea has continued to just go against the U.N. Security Council resolutions, repeatedly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "And Japan could pursue their own nuclear weapons, as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GESIOTTO",
      "utterance": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "You know what you've got to do. You've got to shoot one down. At some point, you have to -- you have to say, \"We're not going to accept this.\" Otherwise, you live in a world where North Korea has miniaturized nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver them to our homeland. You want to live under that perpetual blackmail, that's the choice you make. It only gets worse the longer you wait, and they're only going to give this technology to Iran. I mean, Iran and North Korea are like brother and sister right now, sharing this technology. We want to live under the permanent blackmail of a nuclear-capable Iran, as well. That's how consequential this decision is. You don't want to be flippant about it. No one wants war on the peninsula, but at some point, you have to do more than say that the era of strategic patience is over."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Eboni, your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, we keep saying there are no good options. Right? Civilians are at risk either way. Certainly, anything that feels proactive from us is that. But also, to Pete's point, what is the alternative: to continue to, what, hope and pray that North Korea or Iran, for that matter, don't move forward in the direction that they're clearly showing us they're intentionally trying to move forward towards. That feels very terrifying, as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I was really hoping we were going to be able to solve it all all during that block. I didn't meet my goal. All right. We've got to say goodbye to our specialists, Madison Gesiotto and Matt Welch. Thank you both for joining us. Up next, more on the incredible relief and rescue efforts in Texas. We're back in a moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Well, on account of everything today, no \"Wait, What?\" as things unfold in Texas and Louisiana. Instead, we want to shine a light on the incredible rescue and relief efforts throughout the region. And I will start things off. This photo caught my eye this morning. This is a grandmother in the doorway of her own home, being rescued by a volunteer on his Jet Ski. And it was posted on social media. He came even with lifejackets. Pretty cool. I mean, that's just people helping people."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I want to share a picture that I thought was pretty awesome. There's little kitties in cages. But I've also seen boogie boards. I've seen them putting cages on boogie boards. I don't know if we have a photo of that or not, to get them down. And this is a lot different than Hurricane Katrina, where they were saying no pets. You have to leave pets behind. And I can't imagine, you know, what a huge difference it would make, as a pet owner myself, to get to bring -- to bring my, you know, little kitty chains and have him -- have him be saved. And just to see so many people who don't have to do this. It's not their job. Going out to do these things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "It also, I think, shows you how orderly, really, it is and that they have the time and the ability to. If you don't -- if it's absolute panic, you're going for people and not pets. But in this case, it's very - - it's pretty orderly, and you're able to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "True. The communication is really -- really showing its value there. Heartbreaking note here, one of the 15 fatalities that has been reported so far. That is Houston Sergeant Steve Perez. He was on the force for 34 years, just a few days shy of his 61st birthday. He's survived by his adult daughter and son and his wife. And his wife told him not to venture out into those waters and those heavy rains. But as, again, a veteran on the force, he felt that his duty and his responsibility to serve his community going above and beyond, as we heard the governor talking about, of the first responders and those first lines of dissent. So hearts out to Sergeant Perez and his family, just showing the level of risk and sacrifice that you, Pete, know all too well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Well, the police chief there in Houston did a very nice job of sort of memorializing him in real time at the press conference, acknowledging that this is a guy that's been on the force for 34 years. Went out in his patrol car against the advice of his wife and said, \"I -- it's my job to save people.\" I mean, it gives me chills, just thinking about that. And there's men and women like that across that region, and average citizens putting their lives on the line. It's the spirit of America. That's what it looks like right there, Sergeant Steve Perez."

      "utterance": "No, but we were certainly going to continue to follow this, because I'll be on \"FOX & Friends\" in the morning. And as the lights turn on in Houston, you start to acknowledge and recognize that there may even be more devastation. So we hope that's not the case, but we're certainly following it. I know the prime-time schedule here on Fox will be."
