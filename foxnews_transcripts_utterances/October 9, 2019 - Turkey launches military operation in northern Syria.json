It was these Kurdish fighters.  So if Erdogan is allowed to wipe out the Kurdish fighters, who is going to keep the boot on the neck of ISIS. These are the people we are depending on. When you have proxies, you can't let somebody wipe out your proxy. And then, even if they survive it, Bret, why would they help us fight ISIS?  Their enemy is Assad. We asked them to fight ISIS. And so they did that in exchange for our support. Now that we abandoned them, why would they fight ISIS for us? And why would any ally step forward to help us as a proxy when we don't want to send our forces somewhere to fight bad guys who want to kill us here at home?",

General Votel who just retired as commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East said that this literally threatens to undo five years of work fighting ISIS and damage our credibility as an ally. It is a betrayal of the Kurds. President Trump said today that we defeated ISIS. Number one, we haven't defeated ISIS. They have more than 30,000 fighters and $400 million, so they're not defeated. But to the extent that we have beaten them back, it wasn't U.S. ground forces that did that. It was these Kurdish fighters.  So if Erdogan is allowed to wipe out the Kurdish fighters, who is going to keep the boot on the neck of ISIS. These are the people we are depending on. When you have proxies, you can't let somebody wipe out your proxy. And then, even if they survive it, Bret, why would they help us fight ISIS?  Their enemy is Assad. We asked them to fight ISIS. And so they did that in exchange for our support. Now that we abandoned them, why would they fight ISIS for us? And why would any ally step forward to help us as a proxy when we don't want to send our forces somewhere to fight bad guys who want to kill us here at home?"

We did have a military objective there, which was to defeat ISIS's military capability.  We actually did accomplish that. The idea that we should stay there in perpetuity is something that clearly the foreign policy consensus in this town very much likes, but it is at odds with what a lot of people think about how we should be fighting wars, what are ideas should be about when we go into conflicts, when we get out. And this is -- the Kurds did deserve a fair warning that we would be doing this. They didn't get that. But this alliance that we had with them does not mean that it could extend into perpetuity for all time and all place."

There is a lot of anger. They have described this as betrayal. They've described it as a stab in the back. As you say, for years they fought with U.S. backing against the Islamic State."

When that happens and there is a longer-term consequence, which could lead to more instability in the region and more time and money that the U.S. is going to have to spend to clean that up, then that seems to me to not be a particularly good idea."

There is no endless war because we are not fighting these wars.  We have proxies in these countries that are fighting these wars. In Iraq we have 5,000 troops, Afghanistan, 14,000 troops, Syria we have 1,000 troops. We have 98,000 troops in Germany, Japan and South Korea. What we are doing in these countries is we are arming and training proxies to fight the wars for us, and we are giving them intelligence, air support, and other things. As far as I know Al Qaeda and ISIS have not surrendered. So somebody has got to fight them. So it's either going to be our proxies or it's going to be us. And if we abandoned the proxies and we betray them in this way, nobody is going to step up to fight for us, not only in Syria but in Afghanistan or in Africa or anywhere else around the world. You cannot betray your allies, especially if you don't want to deploy hundreds of thousands troops around the world."
