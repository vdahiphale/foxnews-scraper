But it's obvious why the media embraced this latest Russian story, because what that woman did to Donald Jr. is exactly what the media does to the public every day since the election. They bait, then switch. They promise something juicy that when you hear them out, it is emptier than a protester's resume. And when their hysteria is met with public disgust, what does the media do? Rather than admit to their compulsive overselling, they blame those who question them. Suddenly, it is your fault for being skeptical. It is your fault when their mania trumps back, it is your fault for their addiction to re-litigating the past. They say when you are a hammer everything becomes a nail. When you are a bitter hack, everything becomes collusion -- except actual collusion. All right. This is to me a ground breaking, earth shattering revelation, Kimberly.

Did she have any connections to anyone who went? Who did she meet with before and after?

Trump is the ability to come into your hometown, have a rally come up blast you to your face, he will send a nasty tweet about you come up with some serious pressure on you. He may take money away from your reelection campaign. He may campaign for your primary opponent. He is going to remember who did not get in line for this Obamacare repeal and replace bill and if you don't get in line, it will be a long reelection campaign."

I think the point that he made with Pat Robertson was valid, that he said that Republican has been talking about this for seven years, way before it had anything to do with politics, what is the hesitation? The question I want to ask people like Lisa Murkowski and Rand Paul and some of these moderates and whatever you want to call them, libertarians conservatives, were holding this up is, will you not genuine when you are self ran on repealing and replacing Obamacare? Is this just something that you think you want to go to your constituents, if you are Rand Paul or Lisa Murkowski, and you are only going to have their specific needs and wants at hand, because other than about your personal safety, this is about America, as well, and absolute collapse of Obamacare, and of these people aren't willing to work together and ultimately work for the good of the Republican Party, it is going to be a very, very scary midterm election."

You got to simplify this. If somebody comes along and says, treat health care like car insurance, right we'll cover the big stuff, you take care of the small stuff, my insurance will cover the car accident, but I pay for the oil change, I pay for the tune-up, I pay for the gas, I pay for the waxing, and then, you introduce competition. If you look at a guy competing in a triathlon, and you compare him to the average guy at the gym, who is in better shape? The only difference is the competition. Competition forces you to be in better shape. So, you get all of these new products, the insurance products, it's a product, products have to compete. Simplify it. That is all it takes. I don't like is never going to be resolved until we agreed to simplify."
