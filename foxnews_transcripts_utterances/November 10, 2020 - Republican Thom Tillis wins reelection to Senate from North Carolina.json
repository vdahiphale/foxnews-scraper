And, all of a sudden, things are starting to fall into place for Republicans who didn't want to risk losing the United States Senate. It's not a done deal, but the fact that Thom Tillis did secure his seat in North Carolina makes it a closer-to-done deal, with everyone watching the Georgia run-off races that will determine the outlook for the United States Senate. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If the Republicans can hang on to both seats, there is no debate. They have got it. If they lose both seats, there's no debate. They do not have it. If they split, well, yes, they still have it. I know it's a couple of variables and issues that we have to consider here. But, well, it's been an interesting election year, hasn't it? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's go to Mark Meredith with the latest on what this means right now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Hey, Mark.",

      "sentences": "Neil, good afternoon. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, now North Carolina knows for sure who's going to be representing them in the Senate for the next six years. Thom Tillis, he declared himself the winner of this race Tuesday night at his watch party near Charlotte. But, since then, the Democrat in this race, Cal Cunningham, was holding out hope that some of these absentee and provisional ballots that were still needing to be counted may give him enough of an edge to keep him in this race. But ever since Tuesday night, we had seen Tillis leading Cunningham by about 97,000 votes or so, those numbers not changing all that much. So there was every day that went by less and less of a chance that Cunningham was going to be able to unseat Tillis in this race. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Neil, there was a tremendous amount of money, over $100 million, spent on this race, both parties putting a lot of time and energy into North Carolina. Tillis was only in his first term right now. He had won his first term back in 2014 by less than 50,000 votes. So they certainly saw him someone that was vulnerable. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But Cunningham faced a real scandal in the final weeks of his campaign, after he admitted to having an inappropriate relationship outside of his marriage. It's unclear how much that may have impacted the final result. But just speaking to voters -- I spoke to one woman in Charlotte -- she said, \"I could kill Cal Cunningham,\" because she felt that he was the one that jeopardized his own chances in this race. But Thom Tillis realizes that this is a state that is still considered a battleground that can flip either way, likely trying to find issues -- find a way to work with the Democratic governor here, as well as what's going to be happening in Washington, but Thom Tillis very thankful to be spending another six years here in D.C. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Republicans on the ground in North Carolina, they were frustrated that this race still had not been called. But they had been waiting and waiting for the state board of elections to release these new numbers from the individual counties on the ground here. They also tell us now, Neil -- this is -- I just got done speaking to the chairman of the GOP party here. He says their next stop, Georgia. They're going to be sending volunteers from on the ground here in North Carolina just a few miles down the road to another battleground state ahead of those two Senate contests early next year. But, Neil, a lot of Republicans very happy to see Thom Tillis will remain in North Carolina for their Senate seat. As for Cal Cunningham, it's unclear what he will do next -- Neil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It appears that the High Court is in favor of keeping the Affordable Care Act intact, this after Supreme Court -- Justice Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh both signaled that they believe that the ACA can stay intact, despite getting rid of that controversial individual mandate. It's all about severability. Now, this is the third legal challenge in the 10-year history of the law. President Obama signed it into law in March 2010. The question for the court, whether the key funding mechanism for the law, as I mentioned, the individual mandate, can be taken away and if the rest of the ACA can stay intact without that mandate. The mandate forces someone to buy health insurance. Some say that is a tax. The chief justice, who upheld the law in 2012, made it clear he believes the act could survive without that mandate. The Trump administration got rid of that penalty in 2017. But they couldn't get rid of the law entirely that year. Why? Arizona Senator John McCain famously gave the thumbs down on the Senate floor, a very dramatic moment, to get rid of that measure, and he actually helped save it after the administration wanted to get rid of it. A group of conservative states argue that law must fall if that individual mandate falls. As you mentioned, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, she actively participated today. It's just her second week sitting on the High Court. She had to do things through teleconference because of COVID-19. And, today, she questioned Texas' solicitor general about the mandate. Listen.",

Thom Tillis, he declared himself the winner of this race Tuesday night at his watch party near Charlotte. But, since then, the Democrat in this race, Cal Cunningham, was holding out hope that some of these absentee and provisional ballots that were still needing to be counted may give him enough of an edge to keep him in this race. But ever since Tuesday night, we had seen Tillis leading Cunningham by about 97,000 votes or so, those numbers not changing all that much. So there was every day that went by less and less of a chance that Cunningham was going to be able to unseat Tillis in this race. Neil, there was a tremendous amount of money, over $100 million, spent on this race, both parties putting a lot of time and energy into North Carolina. Tillis was only in his first term right now. He had won his first term back in 2014 by less than 50,000 votes. So they certainly saw him someone that was vulnerable. But Cunningham faced a real scandal in the final weeks of his campaign, after he admitted to having an inappropriate relationship outside of his marriage. It's unclear how much that may have impacted the final result. But just speaking to voters -- I spoke to one woman in Charlotte -- she said, \"I could kill Cal Cunningham,\" because she felt that he was the one that jeopardized his own chances in this race. But Thom Tillis realizes that this is a state that is still considered a battleground that can flip either way, likely trying to find issues -- find a way to work with the Democratic governor here, as well as what's going to be happening in Washington, but Thom Tillis very thankful to be spending another six years here in D.C. The Republicans on the ground in North Carolina, they were frustrated that this race still had not been called. But they had been waiting and waiting for the state board of elections to release these new numbers from the individual counties on the ground here. They also tell us now, Neil -- this is -- I just got done speaking to the chairman of the GOP party here. He says their next stop, Georgia. They're going to be sending volunteers from on the ground here in North Carolina just a few miles down the road to another battleground state ahead of those two Senate contests early next year. But, Neil, a lot of Republicans very happy to see Thom Tillis will remain in North Carolina for their Senate seat. As for Cal Cunningham, it's unclear what he will do next -- Neil."

And there is a risk at some point whether Republicans are going down a wrong road here. There's questions about credibility if they continue to fight that battle where there's no way that they can possibly win. That is a danger for Republicans. But, like I say, simultaneously, it does get out voters in Georgia, and they have to do that. That's why Vice President Mike Pence, who was here at the Capitol today, meeting with Senate Republicans over lunch, he's going to go down and campaign. And that's why Joe Biden is talking about this. In some respects, if Joe Biden, in fact, takes office on the 20th of January, people are going to go back and say, how did he help or hurt in those races in January?

If that looks likely, so be it. And that's why the buying continues, that, of course, and promising news on the vaccine front that carried over to today. Charles Payne is with us, Eliza Collins of The Wall Street Journal. Charles, to you first on this. The Street is counting on the Senate staying in Republican hands, right?

We know that. Two year-free college. Raising the national minimum wage. So there's a lot of things already on his agenda that it would be tough to go for. But the lowest-hanging fruit, the thing that most -- a lot of people at least that I associate with, including myself, believe really was most impactful were the Trump tax cuts. You would need 51 senators there. If that went the other way, then a whole lot of what we have seen prior to the pandemic could be unraveled."

But, by prejudging it, as many in the administration have, that it's fixed, it's fraudulent, it's rigged, that now the attorney general of the United States is going to be looking into it, does it hurt their case?

So it is pretty unlikely that these lawsuits would be able to change votes in enough states to flip the presidency. Of course, the president won in 2016 by margins very similar.

So, look at the reaction post-election this time around, with President Trump asking questions that many of his supporters, most of them think he should be asking. I think you were right about him galvanizing the base. The people that love President Trump love him because he's a fighter, he's an outsider. They feel he was never treated properly the first moment he set foot in D.C. and that everything was against him. So they want to see him fight. I think ultimately, if he does -- if it does look like he's lost this, if Bill Barr says there's no shenanigans, he will gracefully hand it over, look forward to the next chapter. In the meantime, you're right, though. Wall Street believes that the GOP will win the Senate. And the best proof of that, in the last five days, the number one performing sector, energy. Remember, that last debate, Joe Biden made it pretty clear he's not a fan of fossil fuels. Energy up 11 percent in the last five days, number two, financials. Those are another area. They wanted to tax Wall Street to death. The worst performing sector of all 11 S&P sectors are utilities, where they were supposed to be the biggest winner under a Biden administration because they would funnel trillions of dollars to these utility companies. Like, NextEra made a big -- a lot of money under Obama/Biden. So, Wall Street has already made it pretty clear where they think everything falls out."

But the bottom line is, the memo that he created that got leaked out basically says, we're going to let you, as independent U.S. attorneys, as senior officials within DOJ, look into election fraud, if you think you have it. You don't have to consult with the Public Integrity Section. And he's not prejudging that there's cases to be made or not. He's just basically loosening up the bureaucracy in case there's a big one. If there is a big one, he says in this memo, we don't really want to wait until it's too late to do anything about it. So all he's doing is essentially saying, look, this isn't going to be throttled on a D.C. level. It's going to be something that you can pursue, in your judgment, if you think there's a real case out there."

      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, look, these are folks that they're going to give you that reaction, no matter what. There's a lot of people that feel very much against the attorney general. But I have read the memo a couple of times. I used to be at DOJ. I was at a U.S. attorney's office before that. I get the vibe. When you're at a U.S. attorney's office, you're not dying to involve main Justice on every issue. And this basically says, hey, if you find something that's huge, you're on your own, go for it, not wait in line at DOJ and hope that somebody at Public Integrity authorizes it. So, yes, look, I don't think that's a radical proposition. I think it's one that respects the career prosecutors out in the offices and one that he will get criticism for, but it's unfounded."

So, from a legal perspective, it's not just then about counting those ballots, right? I mean, what else is involved here to weed out chicanery or, as the administration has said, fraud?"

    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",

And, frankly, some of these lawsuits are starting to gravitate in that direction. Like, the Michigan 78-page complaint has testimonials, has declarations of people saying, we backdated ballots. So, you have a chance, if you have got sufficient scale, like you're making mention of, to affect the overall vote. But the other challenges are more constitutional, like the Pennsylvania Supreme Court creating new rules, against the legislature's wishes. That's the type of stuff that can win the day and create some sort of remedy all the way up to a revote in Pennsylvania, based on the conduct the separation of powers issue and the constitutional violation, as opposed to good-old fashioned cheating. So, there's a combination of lawsuits that are out there. They're all going to have to be proven up with some level of satisfaction to these courts. But they're not, on their face, outrageous. There's some -- again, there's sworn statements attached to them. And there's at least some allegations."

      "speaker": "TRUSTY",

And Pennsylvania has the best likelihood of that, because, if they didn't segregate late ballots, and it turns out those late ballots are invalid, then what's the solution? You can't just reward the people that refuse to segregate them by saying, oh, well, we can't count them. You can drift towards either electors making the decision or a revote.

I certainly hope the -- all of us would understand, at a very human level, why anybody, and particularly this president, would be deeply disappointed not to be reelected. He invested a lot in this. He's very proud. But there comes a point where you have got to acknowledge that more than personal interest or party interest is the interest of the country. And once he has his days in court, I hope, even if the president disagrees with the courts' decisions, he says, I have tried my best. Maybe he will say, I'm not leaving politics. Maybe he will say, I'm thinking about running again in 2024, but he will concede and let the transfer power go forward, so that the incoming Biden..."

Somebody else, not me, said, in 2024, the Republican candidate for president will be Donald Trump or somebody else Donald Trump has endorsed. But four years is a long time. Look, Al Gore was thought to be ready to run again in 2004. He thought about it a while. And, at the end of 2002, he said that he was not going to run again. So, that's in the future. For now, I just hope the president has his day in court. And if he doesn't win, which I suspect he won't, then he will put the country first, which he always says he's all about, concede, let the Biden administration come in and begin its work. And he can go off and do whatever he wants to do."

There is Moderna and a host of others that are rounding the bend with promising cures, treatments, vaccines of their own. Don't get me started on Johnson & Johnson. To Ali Mokdad right now, Health Metrics professor, chief strategy officer for population University of Washington. Think about, Doctor.

      "speaker": "DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon to you. It appears that the High Court is in favor of keeping the Affordable Care Act intact, this after Supreme Court -- Justice Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh both signaled that they believe that the ACA can stay intact, despite getting rid of that controversial individual mandate. It's all about severability. Now, this is the third legal challenge in the 10-year history of the law. President Obama signed it into law in March 2010. The question for the court, whether the key funding mechanism for the law, as I mentioned, the individual mandate, can be taken away and if the rest of the ACA can stay intact without that mandate. The mandate forces someone to buy health insurance. Some say that is a tax. The chief justice, who upheld the law in 2012, made it clear he believes the act could survive without that mandate. The Trump administration got rid of that penalty in 2017. But they couldn't get rid of the law entirely that year. Why? Arizona Senator John McCain famously gave the thumbs down on the Senate floor, a very dramatic moment, to get rid of that measure, and he actually helped save it after the administration wanted to get rid of it. A group of conservative states argue that law must fall if that individual mandate falls. As you mentioned, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, she actively participated today. It's just her second week sitting on the High Court. She had to do things through teleconference because of COVID-19. And, today, she questioned Texas' solicitor general about the mandate. Listen."

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. So, holiday celebrations are likely to be different this year than other years, definitely smaller. But hopes of a vaccine might mean a few more travelers this time around, the most since before the pandemic started. United adding 1,400 flights, predicting last-minute bookings for Thanksgiving, with half buying their tickets less than a month before departure. And it's not just United. We have JetBlue adding 25 nonstop flights from New York to Florida, Puerto Rico, the Dominican, and Haiti. Now, travel has been decimated by COVID, but some hope that, with this Pfizer news of a vaccine approval before year's end, that the sector will be staging a comeback, some of the best performing stocks over the past week, recovering 10 to 20 percent, still, though, as you know, Neil trading at half the levels that they were before. But, hopefully, things will get better from here. And, hopefully, Neil we can see our families pretty soon."

      "speaker": "LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "They're talking about keeping the whole thing shut down. It's really sad for people who make their living at the Magic Kingdom. No Doubt had an album in the '90s called \"Tragic Kingdom,\" because they grew up in Anaheim. Fun fact. But the point is the park and its adjacent sister park, California Adventure, they're great because you can spread out. And if you have a third of the visitors you would normally have, you still have a lot of revenue, people working, people buying trinkets, gear, ears, and turkey legs to snack on as they park-hop between the two, which not only makes people happy and pacifies their children, who have been long bored by digital learning. It also gives the people who work there a few shekels in their pockets so they can take care of their own damn children. But, of course, being California, it is commie land. So, Disneyland is still shut down."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, the governor has been arguing that, obviously, with the spikes in cases, they have got to be very, very careful. But it doesn't apply to everything. So, restaurants and all, some of them are allowed. I just don't understand why Disneyland can't be doing the exact same thing they're doing at Disney World on the other side of the country in Orlando. I mean, it seems to be working out just fine for them. But just to shut it down, keep it down, not even talk about reopening, it just seems extreme."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MONTGOMERY",
      "utterance": "It is extreme. And it's the case of two different governing philosophies. The governor of Florida likes people and wants them to work. The governor of California wants control over people and of their lives. That's creating a cycle of dependency, inviting millionaires and billionaires to move to places like Texas and Tennessee, which they are doing in droves. It's bad policy. And people need some joy. They need something to look forward to. A trip to Disneyland with the fam, that would do it. Maybe I'm wrong here, Neil. Maybe you should call the fun police and have me locked up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, no, Disneyland is cool. And you know that whole area very well. By the way, I'm sure governors of both states like people here. They argue, in this case in California, I think Governor Newsom was saying, has to do this to address this. But it is weird, Kennedy, because we're getting these spikes in other cases in the New Jersey/New York area, Connecticut to a lesser degree. They are spiking again. They are revisiting the old thing, close restaurants by 10:00 p.m., no drinking after that point."

      "speaker": "MONTGOMERY",
      "utterance": "They are. And the long-term deficits of these type of protracted shutdowns will be almost impossible to remedy. And the longer you go, the harder it is to get back to what we once knew as normal. And people feel demoralized, because they look at their friends and neighbors in other states, and they realize that there are governors and mayors who trust people to listen to mask mandates, to stay six feet apart from each other, to bathe in Purell, and everything else we know how to do. And they're having more success doing that. It's just very interesting that a lot of these places where they have a dim view of human nature, they're seeing spikes in cases."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know what's weird about it? We don't much time. But Germany was doing all the right things, one of the first on the mask thing, one of the first separating people, distances. They have got the spikes. Japan now all of a sudden has some spikes to worry about. They were doing everything right. France. Italy. So, sometimes, everything you want to do by the book, you're still looking at spikes."
