      "sentences": "What would such a soft pretty man ever know about keeping anyone safe? Not much. Weaken ineffective leaders don't change course even when COVID recedes, because I've said for almost two years now, this was never about the virus. It was about creating a compliant public. A compliant public that was kind of primed to obey the next lockdown order. No questions asked. The assaults on our basic liberties have been wide ranging. School closures denied children quality education. That was the freedom to learn. Vax and max - vax and mask vaccine mask mandates deprived us of our freedom to decide what we put into our own bodies. Stay at home orders destroyed small businesses, while large corporations thrived. That was our freedom to work. Then Big Tech censorship, where YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, they acted as proxy speech police for the government. Our freedom of expression. Anyone who didn't tow the Fauci line, even treating physicians and renowned researchers were threatened. They were suspended, maligned and even banned completely. Some lost their jobs, calling something COVID misinformation, gave the government carte blanche through their proxies to trample on free expression. Now, who'll ever forget how Democrat governors let you shop together but not pray together? Churches shuttered our freedom to worship, halted. The experts never thought that faith was essential, but somehow they deem that liquor stores were. So this anti-freedom coalition on the left even deployed intimidation squads and corporate in school settings with the goal of silencing employees and parents who spoke out. Now, take this fascinating case of Jennifer Sey. She was an Elizabeth Warren supporter from the Bay Area, who was forced out of her high profile job merely for speaking out against school closures and lockdowns. Now, Ms. Sey, then president of Levi Strauss, felt passionately about the need for in-person schooling. She wrote, \"I kept calling out hypocritical and unproven policies. I met with the mayor's office and eventually uprooted my entire life in California, so that my kindergartener could finally experience real school.\" Well, back in March 2021, Jennifer appeared on the 'Angle'.",

It can't be that we live in a country where freedom only exists for the connected and wealthy, who can go maskless at the Super Bowl as third graders sweated out in N-95 masks in class in LA. But they'll always feel justified when they take away your freedom, or when they skirt the rules. It's going to be that the roads are dangerous; the climates warming; the variants are coming. And almost six years ago, it was that Trump was running. They had to stop him. Rules be damned. The left didn't think twice when they locked the children out of schools. And the Clinton campaign didn't think twice when they deployed internet spies in an effort to destroy Trump and nullify your vote. Even though the ends for them always justify the means, we know what was going on. And the press, they did too. But they didn't cover the stories that mattered. They covered them up. But here's the good news. The anti-freedom coalition is unraveling. And that 'Angle'. We'll have more on the potential criminal indictments coming from the Durham bombshell later on in the show.

Joining me now is Stephen Miller, America First Legal founder, former senior White House adviser; also with me Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator, and filmmaker. Dinesh, China is rising and America is faltering under Biden. So free speech is under attack here. Canada's moving toward martial law. But is the tide turning? DINESH D'SOUZA, \"THE DINESH D'SOUZA PODCAST\" HOST: I think it is. And the reason it's turning is because what people are looking for when they when they think about freedom is nothing more than the scope or the space to normalize their life. We're not talking about some exotic exercise of freedom, we're talking about things like going to work, getting your kid to school. And so these are - this is freedom in the normal sense of the term in the same common sensical sense that I am free to move my arm. Now, Biden and the left have stigmatized freedom in such a way that they're making the - they're presenting the idea that somehow it's not freedom, if it affects somebody else. But all freedom affects somebody else. If a woman takes a job, as opposed to staying home, that affects the workforce, that affects her husband, that affects her children. So it's not as if the normal exercise of freedom doesn't have an impact on others. The real question is, does it hurt the rights of other people? Obviously, if I swing my arm, it makes contact with your jaw. That is an unacceptable use of freedom. But if I'm going to a grocery store or a mall, and somebody else goes, Oh, by you showing up here without a mask or unvaccinated, you're increasing my risk of COVID. Well, nobody's asking you to go to the mall. You can stay home. So this idea that somehow one group of people gets to live their life, and they can force other people not to, this is the essence of the issue, I think.",

But that's where we are right now. The reality is, and I think a lot of us who have been paying attention to be concerned about this for a while, is that modern leftism is only a hair's breadth away from fascism. If you look at cancel culture, that's the left using corporate power to punish dissent. It is a very short road from that to using state power to punish dissent, to punish political enemies. And so everywhere you look, you see the strong armed against the weak. Administrators against helpless students, powerful CEOs against wage earners. And now you see the leaders of countries against peaceful protesters.

And so if you're looking, for example, at COVID, obviously COVID may be spiking in certain places, not spiking in others. Circumstances vary from one place to the other. So why shouldn't people living in their own local communities be able to make rules that are adapted to their own particular situation?

It's bigger than six or seven states. It's an enormous jurisdiction. And a race like that ought to be viewed like a governor's race, like a very, very high stakes race. But it's typically not, especially in a place like this, where people are much more concerned about national politics, generally have a broader focus than what's happening locally. And so this guy, he's kind of squeaked in. And he became one of the worst Covidian petty tyrants in the entire country, as you pointed out. He's got his deputy saying, they still want to do the vaccine passport, restaurant mandate thing. And they said, We'll shelve it for now, but next variant, we're going to bring it right back out. We're going to be ready to go on that. He's been horrendous every step of the way. And he has no curiosity to actually understand what any of these numbers mean. And so he says, Oh, we should have CDC moderate transmissions. You know what that means, Laura? It means 50 cases per 100,000 population per week.

So there has been no hint that this was there. So that's number one. Number two, it shows why Sussmann was lying, or allegedly lying, according to Mr. Durham. Remember, the argument has been in the press by the defenders of Michael Sussmann, oh, this was a mistake, or, hell, everybody knew that Sussmann and Perkins Coie had done work for the Clinton campaign. But this was a very specific question he was asked. He was there at the FBI talking to the general counsel about supposedly a crime committed by the Trump campaign. And he was asked, who are you here for? Are you here as a good citizen or are you here representing a particular client? And he said, no. And he said no a couple of months later to agency two, I think we know who that is. And the bombshell that Durham laid out shows why. It gives a motive for why Sussmann was doing it. As John said, as John Ratcliffe just said, because if he didn't lie, it would reveal the wide-ranging conspiracy going on. I don't know if it's a criminal conspiracy, but it's a conspiracy going on involving the Clinton campaign to both, number one, feed lies to the FBI about Trump and, then, number two, leak to the press that the FBI is investigating this. That's exactly what they did with the Alpha Bank server allegations, which were not true. And that is what Sussmann was there at the FBI that day to talk about.",

Weaken ineffective leaders don't change course even when COVID recedes, because I've said for almost two years now, this was never about the virus. It was about creating a compliant public. A compliant public that was kind of primed to obey the next lockdown order. No questions asked. The assaults on our basic liberties have been wide ranging. School closures denied children quality education. That was the freedom to learn. Vax and max - vax and mask vaccine mask mandates deprived us of our freedom to decide what we put into our own bodies. Stay at home orders destroyed small businesses, while large corporations thrived. That was our freedom to work. Then Big Tech censorship, where YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, they acted as proxy speech police for the government. Our freedom of expression. Anyone who didn't tow the Fauci line, even treating physicians and renowned researchers were threatened. They were suspended, maligned and even banned completely. Some lost their jobs, calling something COVID misinformation, gave the government carte blanche through their proxies to trample on free expression. Now, who'll ever forget how Democrat governors let you shop together but not pray together? Churches shuttered our freedom to worship, halted. The experts never thought that faith was essential, but somehow they deem that liquor stores were. So this anti-freedom coalition on the left even deployed intimidation squads and corporate in school settings with the goal of silencing employees and parents who spoke out. Now, take this fascinating case of Jennifer Sey. She was an Elizabeth Warren supporter from the Bay Area, who was forced out of her high profile job merely for speaking out against school closures and lockdowns. Now, Ms. Sey, then president of Levi Strauss, felt passionately about the need for in-person schooling. She wrote, \"I kept calling out hypocritical and unproven policies. I met with the mayor's office and eventually uprooted my entire life in California, so that my kindergartener could finally experience real school.\" Well, back in March 2021, Jennifer appeared on the 'Angle'."

I was told to say that I am an imperfect ally.\" Well, then she said she refused to do any of that. Now, this woman was on track to be the CEO of a major company, a liberal with biracial children, canceled by the corporate mob. Think about that. So the left is so freaked out now, because their COVID fortress of rules and edicts is collapsing before they had the chance, of course, to make their new normal permanent.

It can't be that we live in a country where freedom only exists for the connected and wealthy, who can go maskless at the Super Bowl as third graders sweated out in N-95 masks in class in LA. But they'll always feel justified when they take away your freedom, or when they skirt the rules. It's going to be that the roads are dangerous; the climates warming; the variants are coming. And almost six years ago, it was that Trump was running. They had to stop him. Rules be damned. The left didn't think twice when they locked the children out of schools. And the Clinton campaign didn't think twice when they deployed internet spies in an effort to destroy Trump and nullify your vote. Even though the ends for them always justify the means, we know what was going on. And the press, they did too. But they didn't cover the stories that mattered. They covered them up. But here's the good news. The anti-freedom coalition is unraveling. And that 'Angle'. We'll have more on the potential criminal indictments coming from the Durham bombshell later on in the show.

Dinesh, China is rising and America is faltering under Biden. So free speech is under attack here. Canada's moving toward martial law. But is the tide turning? DINESH D'SOUZA, \"THE DINESH D'SOUZA PODCAST\" HOST: I think it is. And the reason it's turning is because what people are looking for when they when they think about freedom is nothing more than the scope or the space to normalize their life. We're not talking about some exotic exercise of freedom, we're talking about things like going to work, getting your kid to school. And so these are - this is freedom in the normal sense of the term in the same common sensical sense that I am free to move my arm. Now, Biden and the left have stigmatized freedom in such a way that they're making the - they're presenting the idea that somehow it's not freedom, if it affects somebody else. But all freedom affects somebody else. If a woman takes a job, as opposed to staying home, that affects the workforce, that affects her husband, that affects her children. So it's not as if the normal exercise of freedom doesn't have an impact on others. The real question is, does it hurt the rights of other people? Obviously, if I swing my arm, it makes contact with your jaw. That is an unacceptable use of freedom. But if I'm going to a grocery store or a mall, and somebody else goes, Oh, by you showing up here without a mask or unvaccinated, you're increasing my risk of COVID. Well, nobody's asking you to go to the mall. You can stay home. So this idea that somehow one group of people gets to live their life, and they can force other people not to, this is the essence of the issue, I think."

But that's where we are right now. The reality is, and I think a lot of us who have been paying attention to be concerned about this for a while, is that modern leftism is only a hair's breadth away from fascism. If you look at cancel culture, that's the left using corporate power to punish dissent. It is a very short road from that to using state power to punish dissent, to punish political enemies. And so everywhere you look, you see the strong armed against the weak. Administrators against helpless students, powerful CEOs against wage earners. And now you see the leaders of countries against peaceful protesters. I think anybody who cherishes liberty and freedom and Western civilization should be profoundly alarmed about what we are seeing unfold right now."

Like, well, we are asking for freedom. This is a far right tactic. What? I mean, these people were the free speech people that so long ago. They believed - they were about free love, free speech, free expression, artistic expression, teachers' expression in classroom, you couldn't touch it, you couldn't regulate it.

And so that would be things like free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of conscience and so on. But we haven't spoken about the other type of freedom the left is also attacking, and this is the freedom of local communities, to be able to make decisions for themselves. And so if you're looking, for example, at COVID, obviously COVID may be spiking in certain places, not spiking in others. Circumstances vary from one place to the other. So why shouldn't people living in their own local communities be able to make rules that are adapted to their own particular situation? Biden seems to imply that you have to have a federal or a centralized approach to the problem, whereas a second form of freedom would be the freedom of local self government."

It's bigger than six or seven states. It's an enormous jurisdiction. And a race like that ought to be viewed like a governor's race, like a very, very high stakes race. But it's typically not, especially in a place like this, where people are much more concerned about national politics, generally have a broader focus than what's happening locally. And so this guy, he's kind of squeaked in. And he became one of the worst Covidian petty tyrants in the entire country, as you pointed out. He's got his deputy saying, they still want to do the vaccine passport, restaurant mandate thing. And they said, We'll shelve it for now, but next variant, we're going to bring it right back out. We're going to be ready to go on that. He's been horrendous every step of the way. And he has no curiosity to actually understand what any of these numbers mean. And so he says, Oh, we should have CDC moderate transmissions. You know what that means, Laura? It means 50 cases per 100,000 population per week.

The Clinton campaign attorney Mark Michael Sussmann fed this garbage to the FBI in 2016, and unnamed second agency in 2017. Joining me now is John Ratcliffe, former director of National Intel.

And the answer was, Well, we don't have any. Not a little bit, but we don't have any. And that's why, Jim Comey and John Brennan and James Clapper went all pressed under oath, is there evidence of Trump Russia collusion, they all said, no, there isn't. But what I found was interesting. That I didn't know as a member of Congress is that, we had a lot of intelligence of fake Trump-Russia collusion. What do I mean? We had intelligence that Hillary Clinton had a plan to create this narrative, this false Trump-Russia connection. And that is the notes that I declassified, John Brennan's handwritten notes that showed that he briefed President Obama and Vice President Biden and their national security team about that plan. But in addition to those declassified documents, Laura, I gave John Durham thousands of other documents that are still classified that detailed what that plan was, and these public filings are starting to be - John Durham is starting to reveal to the public what some of the details of that plan specifically were."

I was on the Judiciary Committee, I was on the Intelligence Committee, no member of Congress was aware of this intelligence until I declassified it. And when I did, they said, Well, no, it's Russian disinformation. But now, John Durham is putting it in federal criminal pleadings and charging people. It's very real.

      "speaker": "SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, the reason why, one of the reasons why it is a bombshell is because Durham hasn't been leaking, unlike some other famous prosecutors. So there has been no hint that this was there. So that's number one. Number two, it shows why Sussmann was lying, or allegedly lying, according to Mr. Durham. Remember, the argument has been in the press by the defenders of Michael Sussmann, oh, this was a mistake, or, hell, everybody knew that Sussmann and Perkins Coie had done work for the Clinton campaign. But this was a very specific question he was asked. He was there at the FBI talking to the general counsel about supposedly a crime committed by the Trump campaign. And he was asked, who are you here for? Are you here as a good citizen or are you here representing a particular client? And he said, no. And he said no a couple of months later to agency two, I think we know who that is. And the bombshell that Durham laid out shows why. It gives a motive for why Sussmann was doing it. As John said, as John Ratcliffe just said, because if he didn't lie, it would reveal the wide-ranging conspiracy going on. I don't know if it's a criminal conspiracy, but it's a conspiracy going on involving the Clinton campaign to both, number one, feed lies to the FBI about Trump and, then, number two, leak to the press that the FBI is investigating this. That's exactly what they did with the Alpha Bank server allegations, which were not true. And that is what Sussmann was there at the FBI that day to talk about."

So there could be further lies that were told to clean up the messes you talked about. When Clinton didn't win, when Trump won, oh, my God, we've got a mess to clean up. So there could be all kinds of things that went on that Durham is still looking at.

      "utterance": "The good news and the thing that is on the side of the protesters is this is outdoors, and in some cases people have taken the personal responsibility of wearing a mask."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What does this reveal? Joining me now is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford Medical School professor, and Dr. Peter McCullough, cardiologist, epidemiologist based in Dallas. Dr. Bhattacharya, pretty emblematic, don't you think, of how policy infected public health? I'm laughing because it's so obvious what they did."

    {
      "speaker": "DR. JAY BHATTACHARYA, STANFORD UNIVERSITY EPIDEMIOLOGIST",
      "utterance": "I think the right to protest is a fundamental right. I support both the right of the BLM protesters to protest as well as the truckers to protest. But I do think that it is very interesting that the medical establishment supported one versus the other. And it's not as if people don't notice. This has real consequences. If the people on the right think that public health is not supporting their basic civil rights, they are going to distrust public health. And in fact, I think that has already happened and will have long- term negative consequences."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Dr. McCullough, you have been talking a lot about the public trust waning given the attacks on you, obviously the entire Great Barrington Declaration, all of you have been trashed morning, noon, and night, and you've turned out to be right about pretty much everything. But we still have people on television who are involved in the scaremongering. Doctor Leana Wen today, watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Lifting a government-imposed mask mandate doesn't mean that it's suddenly safe. It doesn't mean that people should go out and rip off their masks because COVID is gone. I do think that there is a level of unfairness in this in that life has now become less safe for those who are the most vulnerable. If they are now going to be surrounded by people who are maybe unvaccinated and also unmasked, they could be more exposed than before."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

      "speaker": "DR. PETER MCCULLOUGH, MD, MPH, INTERNIST AND CARDIOLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Laura, the two Super Bowls were night and day. Remember, last year, it was in Tampa Bay, and they let in just a few vaccinated, uncertain health care workers. This time, it's in L.A., the stadium was packed. I noticed all the interviews afterwards. There were no masks, no cameras on six-foot sticks. It's completely changed. The emergency phase of the pandemic is over. People know it. And it's time to move on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Dr. Bhattacharya, I was talking to one of our mutual friends the other day, and he said by his calculation, he's a pretty good mathematician, we could be at 94 percent seroprevalence. Explain what that means and why it could be significant?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BHATTACHARYA",
      "utterance": "When the disease first arrived, no one was immune. No one had any exposure to it. And it could cause severe disease. Now, what 94 percent seroprevalence means is that a very large fraction of the population is either recovered from COVID or has some protection due to the vaccine. That means that it is no longer an immune 90 population. The disease is nowhere near as dangerous to the population as it once was simply by dint of the fact that the population has protective immunity to it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Dr. Mccullough, Biden's former COVID adviser lamented what he thought was the backlash, not against people like you, but against the controllers. Watch."

    {
      "speaker": "DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, EPIDEMIOLOGIST",
      "utterance": "We have two pandemics going on right now in this country. One is caused by COVID, and it surely is taking a heavy toll on us. The second one is a pandemic, a loss of trust in government, in public health, and in some cases the media. And in all cases where we lose the trust of the people, to try to get them to comply with recommendations to help save their life and the life of their loved ones becomes very challenging when they don't believe you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But that begs the question, Dr. Mccullough. It is challenging why? Why is it challenging to try to get them to believe you next time?"

    {
      "speaker": "MCCULLOUGH",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, once there is a series of committed statements --"

      "utterance": "We lost him. There we go. Go ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCULLOUGH",
      "utterance": "Once there is a series of committed statements and they turn out not to be true or misleading, trust is broken. And it's very difficult to repair. We should have always seen teams of doctors working in groups, coming in consensus. It is far safer than what happened over the course of the pandemic with our public health agencies and their communication plan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Dr. Bhattacharya, should we have ever shut down this country at all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BHATTACHARYA",
      "utterance": "I do not think a shutdown was ever justified. What was justified was focused protection of the vulnerable. We knew from the very early stages of the epidemic that it was older people and certain other folks with chronic conditions that were really at high risk. We should have moved heaven and earth to protect them instead of closing schools, which did nothing to protect them and hurt our kids."

      "utterance": "I received a very special Valentine's Day card today from my son Niko. It was so great. I'm going to read it, OK. \"Dear mom, you are the best mom ever. Everything you do for me as an act of kindness. I could not ask for more from anyone. Whenever I see you, you brighten my day. I love you to the moon and back and 100 dogs.\" It's kind of a thing with us. It's great. But everyone, I hope you had a wonderful Valentine's Day.
