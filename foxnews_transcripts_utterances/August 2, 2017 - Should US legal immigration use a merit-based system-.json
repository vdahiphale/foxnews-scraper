We have the top 100 draft picks of the NBA, and instead we choose to pick people randomly out of the Karachi phonebook. This does not make sense. We should be doing what Canada and Australia are doing and cashing in on the fact that the world wants to come in. This is so obvious it's almost amazing we haven't done this.

I do think it's interesting to see at a time when Donald Trump has had some setbacks. He's had to swallow this bill on Russia sanctions which we may talk about later, and of course we saw the kind of fiasco that health care reform turned into. In the last week or so we've seen the transgender military ban, done by tweet, might not actually happen, possible challenge to college affirmative action policies with \"The New York Times\" reported overnight, and now this move on legal immigration. I think you're seeing Trump really taking some steps that are going to be really popular with his base, and particularly that part of the coalition that people refer to as populist, nationalist, going back to that idea of Americans who have been left behind, who have gotten a raw deal in the economy. Workers, particularly in the rustbelt in some of those states that he snatched from Hillary Clinton feeling like nobody is looking out for them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think this kind of proposal plays to that audience. And in particular I am struck -- I see this, like Steve Miller, who we saw talking about the legislation, and Steve Bannon, who are really proponents of this vision and the White House, I hear their voices when Trump says in the sound bite that you played, which I think is the critical one, that this legislation will not only restore our competitive edge in the 21st century but will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens, really touching on a larger theme of national identity and populist nationalism that I think is going to be very politically good with his base at a time when he really needs them.",

      "utterance": "Yes. That's negotiable, though. But there are two main problems with our immigration system, our legal immigration system. And one is that it's not focused on skills enough, and, two, the portion that does focus on skills is really poorly designed. Only 13 percent of people coming into the country have anything to do with an economic case, and only half of those actually are merit-based, 6.5 percent or something like that. So having an immigration system that matches more with what Canada does or Australia does, that's actually just long overdue."

But 2015 back, about 1,051,000, these are new green card recipients. You look at how many green card holders are here in the U.S., this goes back to 2014, 13,200,000. Charles, a big issue and one that the White House thinks they can have a win on?"

I love the hypocrisy of the liberals who are so shocked by this, people who swoon over Canada's progressivism with its national health care and its matinee star liberal prime minister who want him to be the leader here. All of a sudden when the U.S. proposes essentially the Canadian system, a merit-based system, are shocked at how mean and racist it is. This is a no-brainer. Here's the analogy. The United States is the place everybody wants to go, every immigrant. You find somebody on a raft on the South China Sea, where do they want to go? The United States. We have the top 100 draft picks of the NBA, and instead we choose to pick people randomly out of the Karachi phonebook. This does not make sense. We should be doing what Canada and Australia are doing and cashing in on the fact that the world wants to come in. This is so obvious it's almost amazing we haven't done this. And that I think is the core of the issue."

      "utterance": "It is going to be a bipartisan effort, and it is going to be tough sell legislatively. There aren't going to be any Democrats on board. You're already seeing some Republicans complain, Lindsey Graham as one example. And you have business groups and economists who are saying this may not be the right solution for the economy. We can argue about that. I do think it's interesting to see at a time when Donald Trump has had some setbacks. He's had to swallow this bill on Russia sanctions which we may talk about later, and of course we saw the kind of fiasco that health care reform turned into. In the last week or so we've seen the transgender military ban, done by tweet, might not actually happen, possible challenge to college affirmative action policies with \"The New York Times\" reported overnight, and now this move on legal immigration. I think you're seeing Trump really taking some steps that are going to be really popular with his base, and particularly that part of the coalition that people refer to as populist, nationalist, going back to that idea of Americans who have been left behind, who have gotten a raw deal in the economy. Workers, particularly in the rustbelt in some of those states that he snatched from Hillary Clinton feeling like nobody is looking out for them. And I think this kind of proposal plays to that audience. And in particular I am struck -- I see this, like Steve Miller, who we saw talking about the legislation, and Steve Bannon, who are really proponents of this vision and the White House, I hear their voices when Trump says in the sound bite that you played, which I think is the critical one, that this legislation will not only restore our competitive edge in the 21st century but will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens, really touching on a larger theme of national identity and populist nationalism that I think is going to be very politically good with his base at a time when he really needs them."

Can they get one with this? And what Democrats are going to sign on to this effort?"

The fact is a high level of unskilled immigrants, some legal, some illegal, are going to depress wages. That's not a complicated economic theory. Here's the irony. The irony is that the pushback is going to come from the Chamber of Commerce, who I think you could appease by adding a guest worker program as Reagan did, and then the limousine liberals on the left who don't suffer and infrastructure gain by having low skilled people doing their lawns and looking after their children. The people who suffer from illegal immigration, depression of wages, are particularly those who are the less educated. And it isn't only white rustbelt workers. It's African-Americans, it's Hispanic immigrants, legal Hispanic immigrants. And I think we ought to face up to the fact that if you really want to help the wage stagnation of the country, one way to do it is to not have a flood of low-wage workers, unskilled workers who compete with Americans. That's kind of uncomplicated."
