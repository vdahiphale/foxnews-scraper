Like clockwork, Jeb Bush tweeted today, \"Encouraged the president is seeking bipartisan solutions to our immigration challenges.\" I'll bet. Color me concerned. While the president seems eager to do a DACA deal, I would caution that this is not the reason why he won. The American people elected him to protect their security and well-being first. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, I have five thoughts for the president and the GOP.

So, we need to keep the focus on what's good for American citizens and legal immigrants. Law and order remains popular, necessary to the Trump agenda. Number three, let everyone be honest -- passing DACA will be some magic elixir for Americans. The GOP is going to be drummed out of office if they are seeing as being more compassionate toward illegals than American citizens. Number four, if we don't change our legal immigration system and fast, the melting pot will break beyond repair. Assimilation, patriotic immigration, and merit must be central to any discussion. If we don't get this right, we want to be two countries, we're going to be ten countries. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Number five, if Republicans can't get Democrats to agree on chain migration, getting rid of it? We really know that they care more about illegal immigrants than the working Americans. That will be good for Republicans. Of course, it will be bad for the country. Remember, the U.S. went from 9 million immigrants to 45 million immigrants coming in and just half a century. That was the largest movement of people in the history of the world. So, whatever they finally agree on, after today, we should all agree on this. The president is fully engaged and fully committed to the tricky and often unpleasant process of shaking up Washington. If he can get these entrenched elites in D.C. to secure this border and focus on the needs of the American people in the immigration debate, that alone will be a massive victory for this president and the country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As the details of this DACA plan unfold, we are going to be watching and very closely.

      "sentences": "Welcome back. The little Wolff and the black dresses, that's the focus of my bonus angle. First, I was remiss on Friday because I did not mention the part of that Michael Wolff's screed that mentioned yours truly. It's just a small anecdote that claimed that at the funeral of former FOX News chairman Roger Ailes, quote \"Right-wing professionals remained passionate in their outward defense of Trump but were rattled, if not abashed, among one another. At the funeral, Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham struggled to parse support for Trumpism even as they distanced themselves from Trump himself.\" OK, I can tell you that that is totally fabricated. It never happened. And by the way, it's really poorly written. What does parsing support even mean? And after talking to others even there, I can tell you that Trump wasn't really even discussed much if at all at the funeral. But Wolff didn't care. He wanted to advance his rickety anti-Trump agenda, the facts be damned. He didn't care. And no I didn't buy the stupid book. I borrowed someone else's. Second, the Golden Globes, for once I wasn't in the slightest annoyed when my cable went out on Sunday night. I have one of those systems that are supposed to be so great, they control all the TVs. It never works. I was blissfully unaware of that #Timesup and those black dress decorations by women who for the most part just happen to be a bunch of leftwing Democrats, same women who were mostly silent during Harvey Weinstein's reign of sexual terror. Excuse me, but watching a bunch of self-absorbed actresses trying to one up each other with emoting and conjured up empathy isn't exactly my idea of a fun Sunday night. That \"Times Up\" group led by leftwing industry types announced before the show that they would all be wearing black to protest men who harass women. There wasn't much of a mention of women who harassed men as I recall. Imagine the pressure on young actresses in attendance to conform. Not only are so many in the industry afraid to express views that may be remotely conservative, now they are afraid to dress the way they want to dress and the color they want to wear. So how is it any less demeaning and domineering for a bunch of powerful women to tell other women what to wear than it is for powerful men to do the same? Answer -- it's not. And as for resulting in some tangible change for the farmworkers and the hospitality workers, well, I'll let Rose McGowan, the actress largely responsible for blowing the whistle on the sleeve in Hollywood sum it up. She said \"That's a Band-Aid to make yourself feel better about what you have all known about and have been silent witnesses to and/or participants in that silence. And no, I don't forgive.\" Now Washington is taking up that tedious torch of fake protest. A group of Democratic lawmakers have announced that they are going to be wearing -- wait for it -- black in support of Times Up and that movement at the State of the Union. Another reason not to watch. If it weren't for President Trump, I wouldn't. Must every moment of our communal life be overshadowed by protests? And then there's Oprah Winfrey. I caught her speech on YouTube. I had a five hour delay coming back from the big game last night. It was nicely written and it was well-delivered, her talk at the Golden Globes. But it was also purely political. Are we to believe that she, like Meryl Streep and all the other actresses and producers and so forth, just had their epiphanies about Weinstein, Spacey, and all the rest of them in Hollywood? Oprah, who by the way, has spoke really compellingly about the abuse she suffered as a child -- she had the biggest megaphone in the media for decades. Surely she knew that both straight and gay men in Hollywood had abused their positions of power for years. There are victims all over the place. So my question is, what took them so long? Here's my angle on this. Since that Russia collusion narrative about President Trump hasn't materialized and since all these predictions about the Trump-apocalypse hasn't come through, the economy is doing so well, the left is desperately scrambling for anything to hold onto, anything to give them hope. So it's \"Hoprah,\" she is their lifeline. I say Oprah should throw her hat in the ring, why not? The president apparently feels the same.",

Yet, look at the way The Washington Post headline characterized the event, \"We got a glimpse of Trump negotiating today. It didn't go well.\" That is just absolutely pathetic.

The bureaucracy moves too slowly for Trump. All that he wants to get done, it's hard to get done on how glacially this whole thing goes. I think it's all about time that the Trump hating media and political elites, why not have their own fitness for their own jobs examined. Call me crazy, but I actually think your abilities and fitness should be measured by your track record and your accomplishments or lack thereof. Think for a moment about the politicians in both parties as well, who failed their constituents with stupid policies and ideas that did zero except waste our hard-earned money or suffocate economic opportunity. Look at the crime in Chicago and Baltimore. The homelessness, the epidemic that we are seeing up at in San Francisco and L.A.

Like clockwork, Jeb Bush tweeted today, \"Encouraged the president is seeking bipartisan solutions to our immigration challenges.\" I'll bet. Color me concerned. While the president seems eager to do a DACA deal, I would caution that this is not the reason why he won. The American people elected him to protect their security and well-being first. So, I have five thoughts for the president and the GOP. Number one, focus on how immigration affects the American worker in the language that you use, even when you talk about doing something for the DACA kids. Number two, Trump won because his position on immigration differed from everyone else's in that room for the most part. So, we need to keep the focus on what's good for American citizens and legal immigrants. Law and order remains popular, necessary to the Trump agenda. Number three, let everyone be honest -- passing DACA will be some magic elixir for Americans. The GOP is going to be drummed out of office if they are seeing as being more compassionate toward illegals than American citizens. Number four, if we don't change our legal immigration system and fast, the melting pot will break beyond repair. Assimilation, patriotic immigration, and merit must be central to any discussion. If we don't get this right, we want to be two countries, we're going to be ten countries. Number five, if Republicans can't get Democrats to agree on chain migration, getting rid of it? We really know that they care more about illegal immigrants than the working Americans. That will be good for Republicans. Of course, it will be bad for the country. Remember, the U.S. went from 9 million immigrants to 45 million immigrants coming in and just half a century. That was the largest movement of people in the history of the world. So, whatever they finally agree on, after today, we should all agree on this. The president is fully engaged and fully committed to the tricky and often unpleasant process of shaking up Washington. If he can get these entrenched elites in D.C. to secure this border and focus on the needs of the American people in the immigration debate, that alone will be a massive victory for this president and the country. As the details of this DACA plan unfold, we are going to be watching and very closely. That's the Angle. For reaction, let's bring in our guest, columnist for the \"Washington Examiner\" and Fox News contributor, Byron York here in Washington, \"Washington Times\" opinion editor and Fox News contributor, Charlie Hurt and in Miami, five-time, Emmy award-winning journalist, Elvira Salazar, currently the anchor of mega-TVs nightly news cast. Great to see all of you. Elvira, let's start with you on this. The president pleased Jeb Bush today with his approach to immigration. He looked to me very in command of the room. He was looking like he wanted to come up with some solution. I may not love the solution in the end, but boy, he seems to want to get to results and bring all parties to the table."

I wrote in the beginning of this year for Newsmax that Trump was going to be for immigration what Nixon was for China. Only somebody that is such anti-staunch, anti-illegal immigration could pave the way to what we saw today to acquire and to be able to achieve something that has not been able to be done in the last 30 years, which is to not only to give some type of legality to the DACA kids but to take care of 11 million people. We can go into discussion, how are we going to do that?

But what I think is most interesting, for an hour, Donald Trump opened up that meeting so that the American people could see what politicians when they get behind closed doors talking about this stuff. All they talked about was DACA. They must have said DACA a thousand times. All the other people that are affected by illegal immigration -- none of that ever got brought up. Everybody could agree upon was DACA. If Republicans go along with this and do some sort of DACA deal, it doesn't include serious enforcement including chain migration. They're going to be --"

He recognizes that the international system leads to global prosperity. At the same time, superseding all of that is his America first strategy, taking care of the American worker, American business, American families, infrastructure and et cetera. He gave an interview with the \"Financial Times\" about five or six months ago, Laura, where he basically explained that duality in his personality. So, I was trying to get that out over there. Thank you for letting me get it out over here. But I would say he is a U.S. person first, an America person first.

To discuss the impact of that moment we are joined by Joe Theismann who quarterbacked the Washington Redskins to Super Bowl victory of 1982. Boy, do we miss you, Joe. He's in Scottsdale, Arizona, and of course it's great to see you, Joe. I'm such a big fan. And by the way, the president walked out with those ROTC members, members of the military, the salute to wounded veterans, and veterans, military folks. It was a beautiful moment. It was overwhelming cheers in the stadium. There were a few boos from misguided college students, but overwhelmingly huge positive reaction. What did you think and watching that, comparing that to the NFL and what we've seen this season with a drop-off in viewership and so forth?"

I had the opportunity to play in front of President Jimmy Carter. And I can tell you something, when the president is in attendance it's a different type of a game. But to see so many people celebrate this great flag, this great country of ours -- and the NFL has taken a hit for it. I think the viewership is down. There are a lot of people that have served this country, there are a lot of people who have sacrificed and had family members that have sacrificed for the freedoms that we had. And that's sort of the double-edged sword a little bit. The flag stands for something very special. It's stands for those people that have sacrificed to allow us to be who we are and have the freedoms that we have. And to me, I never agreed with some of the things that the players have done, but yet they do have the right to do that because that's what freedom for the flag was all about. But to see the president out there last night at that football game, he's a huge fan. He's a fan of sports, he's a fan of football. And to see him at that game I think was very, very special."

They don't know when the wake up the next morning what the day is going to hold in store for them. And that's why I think they should be honored. And that's why the flag honors them.

Those are U.N. sanctions that have been put in place because of the Trump administration, plus also unilateral U.S. sanctions. And we see this. Kim Jong-un in his new year's address talked about sanctions being an existential threat to his government. Also there is anecdotal evidence of so many instances of people not getting money. So this is a real indication that the underlying Trump policy of cutting off money to the North Korean regime is actually starting to work.

It's just a small anecdote that claimed that at the funeral of former FOX News chairman Roger Ailes, quote \"Right-wing professionals remained passionate in their outward defense of Trump but were rattled, if not abashed, among one another. At the funeral, Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham struggled to parse support for Trumpism even as they distanced themselves from Trump himself.\" OK, I can tell you that that is totally fabricated. It never happened. And by the way, it's really poorly written. What does parsing support even mean? And after talking to others even there, I can tell you that Trump wasn't really even discussed much if at all at the funeral. But Wolff didn't care. He wanted to advance his rickety anti-Trump agenda, the facts be damned. He didn't care. And no I didn't buy the stupid book. I borrowed someone else's. Second, the Golden Globes, for once I wasn't in the slightest annoyed when my cable went out on Sunday night. I have one of those systems that are supposed to be so great, they control all the TVs. It never works. I was blissfully unaware of that #Timesup and those black dress decorations by women who for the most part just happen to be a bunch of leftwing Democrats, same women who were mostly silent during Harvey Weinstein's reign of sexual terror. Excuse me, but watching a bunch of self-absorbed actresses trying to one up each other with emoting and conjured up empathy isn't exactly my idea of a fun Sunday night. That \"Times Up\" group led by leftwing industry types announced before the show that they would all be wearing black to protest men who harass women. There wasn't much of a mention of women who harassed men as I recall. Imagine the pressure on young actresses in attendance to conform. Not only are so many in the industry afraid to express views that may be remotely conservative, now they are afraid to dress the way they want to dress and the color they want to wear. So how is it any less demeaning and domineering for a bunch of powerful women to tell other women what to wear than it is for powerful men to do the same? Answer -- it's not. And as for resulting in some tangible change for the farmworkers and the hospitality workers, well, I'll let Rose McGowan, the actress largely responsible for blowing the whistle on the sleeve in Hollywood sum it up. She said \"That's a Band-Aid to make yourself feel better about what you have all known about and have been silent witnesses to and/or participants in that silence. And no, I don't forgive.\" Now Washington is taking up that tedious torch of fake protest. A group of Democratic lawmakers have announced that they are going to be wearing -- wait for it -- black in support of Times Up and that movement at the State of the Union. Another reason not to watch. If it weren't for President Trump, I wouldn't. Must every moment of our communal life be overshadowed by protests? And then there's Oprah Winfrey. I caught her speech on YouTube. I had a five hour delay coming back from the big game last night. It was nicely written and it was well-delivered, her talk at the Golden Globes. But it was also purely political. Are we to believe that she, like Meryl Streep and all the other actresses and producers and so forth, just had their epiphanies about Weinstein, Spacey, and all the rest of them in Hollywood? Oprah, who by the way, has spoke really compellingly about the abuse she suffered as a child -- she had the biggest megaphone in the media for decades. Surely she knew that both straight and gay men in Hollywood had abused their positions of power for years. There are victims all over the place. So my question is, what took them so long? Here's my angle on this. Since that Russia collusion narrative about President Trump hasn't materialized and since all these predictions about the Trump-apocalypse hasn't come through, the economy is doing so well, the left is desperately scrambling for anything to hold onto, anything to give them hope. So it's \"Hoprah,\" she is their lifeline. I say Oprah should throw her hat in the ring, why not? The president apparently feels the same."

      "utterance": "Oprah's accomplished, she's fun to watch, she's smart. And I think she will also quickly see just how different politics is from hosting a talk show. It's a different game. America isn't the room who gave her the standing O on Sunday night. If she did run, before long I predict she's going to have a lot more respect for just how hard it was for Donald Trump, a total outsider to politics, to have run, beaten all those Republicans, beat the Obamas, beat the Clintons, beat the media, beat Hollywood, and win it all. Oprah Winfrey versus who? Who could she run against? She can run against Matt Damon, George Clooney, Rosie, Elizabeth Warren. What other parade of horrible can I trot out? Before we go, be sure to stay right here. We have a lot more to get to."

A district court judge appointed by Bill Clinton has put a temporary hold, a preliminary injunction granted, in forcing the president to reinstitute the terms of DACA. The administration has to return the terms of DACA. The administration has to return the terms of DACA as they're renegotiating DACA, this is judicial activism at its finest. We'll report more on this tomorrow and I'll also do it on radio. Now, Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team are up to take it from here, Miss Shannon.
