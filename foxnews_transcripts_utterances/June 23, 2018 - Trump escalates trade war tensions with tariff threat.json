The House left town this weekend without moving on immigration legislation, delaying a vote on a compromise measure until next week after failing to pass conservative bill on Thursday. President Trump tweeting Friday that the GOP should stop wasting its time on immigration until after the November election saying, quote, \"We can pass great legislation after the red wave.\" Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, columnist, Bill McGurn, and columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, Jason, I guess with a policy retreat the administration is explicitly acknowledging it was a mistake what they did, at least a political mistake. What lesson do you take away from it? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Paul, it reminded me of the travel ban fiasco early on in the administration. Regardless of the merits, it seems they had no real plan for a rollout. The execution was a mess. They looked like the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing. And similarly here, they were not prepared for the blowback they were going to get on both the left and the right.

I know the Cruz people, they are worried that this issue could really maybe even cost Cruz reelection unless it's solved. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, Paul, I think we are now seeing why both Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the Senate did not want to bring this subject up in this term to Congress because it is intractable, it is impossible to make forward movement on it, and it is just become negative event. What happened down there in Texas -- let's leave aside the substance, the solutions and all that -- as a political event, it was entirely negative. And it's now back to the White House and Congress to do something. Republicans, at this point, own it because they're the ones attached to it.

But what's interesting to me about this case is, typically, when we talk about affirmative action in higher education, it's been about blacks, whites and Hispanics. This one is centered around Asians. This racial balancing that is being attempted at the schools is being done at the expense of Asian-Americans. We are almost punishing them for excelling academically. And I'm encouraged that so many in the Asian community are pushing back against this. They know it's a zero-sum game at these elite schools.

      "speaker": "PAUL GIGOT, HOST",
      "utterance": "Welcome to the \"Journal Editorial Report.\" I'm Paul Gigot. That was President Trump Wednesday signing an executive order ending the separation of families accused of crossing the border illegally in a retreat from a policy that had generated opposition from both sides of the political spectrum. The House left town this weekend without moving on immigration legislation, delaying a vote on a compromise measure until next week after failing to pass conservative bill on Thursday. President Trump tweeting Friday that the GOP should stop wasting its time on immigration until after the November election saying, quote, \"We can pass great legislation after the red wave.\" Joining the panel this week, Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, columnist, Bill McGurn, and columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley. So, Jason, I guess with a policy retreat the administration is explicitly acknowledging it was a mistake what they did, at least a political mistake. What lesson do you take away from it? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Paul, it reminded me of the travel ban fiasco early on in the administration. Regardless of the merits, it seems they had no real plan for a rollout. The execution was a mess. They looked like the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing. And similarly here, they were not prepared for the blowback they were going to get on both the left and the right. And they weren't prepared for those images that people were going to see. Trump also had a problem in that he misled people. He said he couldn't do anything about this. He said Congress had to act. Then he did a 180 on that and actually turned around and did it. Incompetence on some level I think is the message."

It's an incentive to come here. How do you solve that problem?"

    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",

    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "That's going to suck up all of the oxygen in the debate. But the restrictionists do have a point here that the system is being gamed. This is an orchestrated event. Activists are rounding these people, sending them north, telling them what to say when they get to the border, and they are not all fleeing persecution. So there is a point there. People are gaming the system. So we have to figure out a way to do something about it but in a humane way. Clearly, people don't think this is the humane way to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    {
      "speaker": "BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Right. I think we could find -- I don't think the solutions are that hard to find. The problem is we have two clumps of people, some Republicans would want to keep the status quo rather than have anything they regard as amnesty, and there's another group in the Democratic Party, I think we have seen it since 2008, they would rather have the issue, the status quo because they get the charge Republicans with being racist. I have to say if I were looking at the politics of it, I think it benefits more the Democrats because they want to run on it. And that's why I actually think, at this point, without the president having gone on national TV to explain the problem, lay out what he wants and what a deal would be, I think -- I don't see Charles Schumer getting him out of his jam."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

I know the Cruz people, they are worried that this issue could really maybe even cost Cruz reelection unless it's solved. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, Paul, I think we are now seeing why both Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the Senate did not want to bring this subject up in this term to Congress because it is intractable, it is impossible to make forward movement on it, and it is just become negative event. What happened down there in Texas -- let's leave aside the substance, the solutions and all that -- as a political event, it was entirely negative. And it's now back to the White House and Congress to do something. Republicans, at this point, own it because they're the ones attached to it. And the Congress is finding it impossible to move a piece of legislation forward. They've moved their vote into next week. The president wants them to move it until next January. And you've got the -- the reality is you have at-risk Republican seats out there that are very close. And the question is, is this going to put negative pressure on those 20 vulnerable seats."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

I think he believes, and a lot of people in the White House believe it, that this is an advantage as an issue for Republicans and that's why he's looking for these enforcement pressures, the enforcement actions that can galvanize the debate between now and November. Dan suggests it's not a good idea for Republicans. What do you think?"

    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Well, it plays well to the base to a point. I don't think the base is comfortable with looking at kids in cages. But to some extent, Trump continues to talk about this because it works for him and enables him to paint Democrats as weak on border security."

      "speaker": "RILEY",

And there are elements in this bill that he likes, it does something for DREAMers, it reduces legal immigration, something I don't think we should be doing, but that's what it does, and it gives him money for a border wall. He needs to come out and say, this is not amnesty and be for this and vote for this bill."

    {
      "speaker": "FINLEY",

And judges, on a case-by-case basis, will have to look and say, well, consider the Wayfair decision and see if this is an undue burden on interstate commerce or if the company doesn't have a substantial nexus, this is going to be difficult for companies or businesses to prove, though."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",

And Congress had avoided fixing the problem, so to speak, because they knew it was going to result in higher prices for consumers and they didn't want to have to eat that or explain that to voters. The court left Congress off the hook. Now, I think it's Congress' job to make sure the states don't abuse this and put some parameters in place."

I mean, what could be better than to tax people who can't politically complain. And the question is, where does it stop. I mean, now that you will be able to tax Internet transactions, there are politicians out there looking at such ideas such as taxing your e-mail transmissions, taxing financial transactions.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes, exactly. I mean, this was -- this was a victory against the administrative state. These judges are often appointed by managers inside agencies like the SEC, but those judges have huge financial authority over private citizens who come before them in cases brought by agencies like the SEC. There was no real political accountability there. And if you're going to be brought before a judge, that judge ought to be accountable politically to someone.

They make no bones about it. The diversity officers run the institutions like that. Professors write about this. This implies, in many cases, explicitly, disadvantages Asia applicants and white males because they are what is are known as \"privileged.\" This is quite open, there's no question about it. They want to suppress Asian applicants and white males. Now the question is, is that constitutional. I have to tell you, Paul, part of me would think that a place like Harvard and Yale, if they want to turn themselves into reparations factory, they ought to be able to do it.

They cannot use it as the dominant factor. But that gives a lot of running room for schools. JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: And they have taken advantage of that, Paul. In 1978, when that decision was made. And, yes, the schools, in all fairness, have not been given hard lines, real parameters on what they can do, and they've been given a lot of wiggle room. But what's interesting to me about this case is, typically, when we talk about affirmative action in higher education, it's been about blacks, whites and Hispanics. This one is centered around Asians. This racial balancing that is being attempted at the schools is being done at the expense of Asian-Americans. We are almost punishing them for excelling academically. And I'm encouraged that so many in the Asian community are pushing back against this. They know it's a zero-sum game at these elite schools. There are only so many slots, and if you're going give advantages to one group, you have to disadvantage another group. And that's wrong."

      "utterance": "And places like Cal Tech have a 43 percent Asian-American component. so Harvard is around 20. It's been that way even though the population of Asian-Americans has -- has more than doubled. Look, Harvard's argument is our commitment to racial diversity means we have to discriminate against racial minorities."

      "utterance": "Yes. That's exactly what's going on in New York City at the top schools. Mayor de Blasio wants to introduce de facto racial quotas by expanding admissions from a test, which is merit based, and the Asian community --"

After that referendum passed, and they no longer -- California colleges no longer took race into account, at elite schools, in the University of California system, Berkeley and UCLA, Asian enrollments spiked, even though they claimed they were not artificially keeping low Asian enrollment. Once they could no longer take race into account, Asian enrollment spiked. And when the government out there, when California tried more recently to roll back that proposition, it was Asian lawmakers and their Asian constituents who said, no, you are not going back to the old --"

      "utterance": "Paul, the Southern Poverty Law Center is a liberal activist group and they made a name for itself back in the 70's suing hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan. But more recently, they have been going after and smearing anyone who disagree with their politics, calling them bigots. It finally caught up with them. Recently, they smeared a man who was an anti-Muslim extremist, and he sued. And the Southern Poverty Law Center settled with $3.3 million and got a public apology. I think more people should follow his example."

      "utterance": "Paul, a big miss this week for Senators Susan Collins and Richard Burr, who blocked a debate in Washington on a bill that would have clawed back $15 billion in federal spending. Now I know $15 billion, when we have trillions of dollars of entitlement problems, is not a lot, but it is more than Republicans had been able to accomplish yet. What's so disappointing is that so many Republicans we wanted to pass it and it was derailed at the 11th hour by two Senators."

His health commissioner came out this week and said, basically endorsed legalizing, saying, look at the pros and look at the cons and the pros outweigh the cons. OK, he looked at the political pros and political cons and decided that because his opponent, primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, decided to make an issue out of this in promoting legalizing pot."

When it came Charles' turn to speak on any subject, listeners felt a rare sense of anticipation at what they would hear. They couldn't guess what Charles Krauthammer would say about something. Charles combined his believes with facts, produced opinions which did that rare thing, he improved his admirers' understanding of a complicated world. The contribution of Charles Krauthammer is missed already."
