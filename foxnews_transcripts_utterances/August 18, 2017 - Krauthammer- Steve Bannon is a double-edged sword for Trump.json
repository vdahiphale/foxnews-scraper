      "utterance": "Absolutely. Look, what happened today is that the civil war moved from inside the White House to outside the White House. But the war continues. Bannon is very clearly going after the same list of people he found were undermining the president that he talked about in that interview. He is going to go after them from the Breitbart platform or any other. He's going to go after all the softies as he sees it on policy. And, you know, this is going to be really a bloody affair. I think he has been immensely strengthened. I mean, who heard of Bannon a year ago? Everybody has heard of Bannon now. And I think the meeting with the Mercers is very significant. He has billions of dollars behind him, the platform, the machinery of Breitbart under him. And he has got a clear free fire zone. He is not held back anymore. This -- I mean, for Trump, it was quite a risk which is I think why it took him so long to get rid of Bannon. It was a double-edged sword, and he is now going to have to face one of those edges."
