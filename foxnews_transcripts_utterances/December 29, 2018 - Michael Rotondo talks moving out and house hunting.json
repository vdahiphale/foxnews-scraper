We begin with the biggest scandal of 2018, Robert Mueller and the Russia probe. A year and a half into his investigation, and the Special Counsel hasn't unearthed any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. But in the final days of the year, Mueller made some very serious moves involving several key players. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials is cooperating on at least three investigations. Former Trump campaign Chair Paul Manafort entering into a plea deal with Mueller before breaking it. He's awaiting sentencing next year and Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen sentenced to three years in prison for his role in hush money payments to a porn star and a former \"Playboy\" model before the 2016 election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But much of the investigations seem to start with former campaign aid, Carter Page.

We begin with the biggest scandal of 2018, Robert Mueller and the Russia probe. A year and a half into his investigation, and the Special Counsel hasn't unearthed any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. But in the final days of the year, Mueller made some very serious moves involving several key players. Former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials is cooperating on at least three investigations. Former Trump campaign Chair Paul Manafort entering into a plea deal with Mueller before breaking it. He's awaiting sentencing next year and Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen sentenced to three years in prison for his role in hush money payments to a porn star and a former \"Playboy\" model before the 2016 election. But much of the investigations seem to start with former campaign aid, Carter Page. I spoke with him earlier this year about the abuse of power in the FISA court and how he became tangled up in the Russian web."

It's another thing to lose our appreciation for the people who do the kinds of jobs that make civilized life possible for the rest of us. I'm not a shrink, but there is something interesting about the way we grow to resent the very things we wind up depending most upon. And if you look at our workforce and if you look at the jobs that are available right now, 6.3 million available jobs; 75% of them don't require a four-year degree. That's amazing. They require training. They require certification and they require a willingness to do something that most people aren't willing to do.
