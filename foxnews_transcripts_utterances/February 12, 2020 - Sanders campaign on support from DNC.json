So of course the focus on last night's Presidential primary was on the Democrats who are in a battle to choose a candidate to run against President Trump and President Trump, like most incumbents, cruised to victory among New Hampshire voters, but it's the size of the win that's getting some attention tonight because the President amassed more votes in the granite state than any incumbent in history. Brad Parscale, President Trump's Campaign Manager of course is happy about that and he is here to react to that and he also has some brand-new numbers of reactions among independents after the State of the Union that we are going to look at as well. Also, Congressman Ro Khanna National Co- Chair for the Sanders Presidential Campaign on his candidates wins last night and whether this might be an issue for his campaign. Listen to this from Van Jones."

The enthusiasm people had - and we don't really have anybody running against, we were only against 16 just no names. And the President just crushed it. People are showing up because they want to be, they are so excited for November though they are already to come out today."

They were very determined and that was interesting of course the Democrats that we spoke to have a lot of people to pick from and they're figuring it all out. But and a few things were driven by impeachment."

I don't think they understood the Democrats, just how much they were building up - people across this country saw what the President is doing and his policies are working."

So we just want to put that out front. You say that the State of the Union speech that you pulled suburban persuadable voters who lean against the President and that you see these moves 15-point improvement on image, 14-point improvement on policies, 12-point improvement on ballot scores and 56 percentage say that the President is moving the U.S. forward."

But what's really amazing was when you remove the media filter, you hear the President speaking, talking what happened? And what he is going to do? They move in large distances towards the President. This is because when the President now gives speeches, they see the success. They finally see the truth. The media filters who does it. Sometimes we see a 50, 60, 70 point difference between somebody is actually watches the President gives the speech and after they see it reporting from other outlets."

She doesn't like the way he acts. She doesn't like the tweets. She is uncomfortable with it. She said she voted for him last time. She's a hockey mom. At the end, who are you going to vote for? I guess I'm going to vote for President Trump. You hear a lot of that? People who are not moved?"

Look are there people in 2016, there were 15 percent of people that voted for the President that didn't approve they voted for him, but when they see the policies of what the President has done, the success of this country, they vote. When they get in the voting booth, policies matter, what successes he's had matters. Look, there is also going to be a - also something across the other side that policies are going to be very bad and very bad for these economy, very bad for this country and so when you put that the contrast, we're not there yet and that's going to be a big deal."

The President has been supportive of stop and frisk and he said and I understand this he said about Michael Bloomberg he should have stood by it, he should explain why he things that it worked. But now you have #bloombergisaracist on your Twitter feed. Is that fair in this society where everyone sort of instantly gets termed a racist and when you breakdown what he said, he's talking about a situation and numbers that are valid in many ways regardless of how we came across."

      "utterance": "So you know in the introduction, we played this sound bite from Van Jones and he was saying that Bernie Sanders is a phenomenon, he is appealing to people across all different parts of society. Why isn't anybody talking about him? Tom Perez the DNC Chair did a whole interview this morning and your candidate who has now essentially won Iowa and New Hampshire - I mean, they are re-canvassing some of Iowa, but very strong showing in both places wasn't even - didn't even come up in a conversation with the DNC Chair. What do you say about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "I agree with Van Jones. Look at the coalition that Senator Sanders is building. He won working-class whites without a college degree in New Hampshire. He won rural voters, he won independents, he won young voters, he won Latino voters. So he's building the type of coalition that can really defeat Donald Trump. And Trump actually understands it. I mean, Trump understands the power of crowds, he understands the power of having an online following, and he's right to recognize that Bernie Sanders is the person on the other side who is building that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So are you concerned that the DNC is going to sort of work against the Sanders campaign like we saw last time? I mean, I remember standing on the convention floor and all the Bernie Sanders supporters had their backs turned physically to Hillary Clinton when she came out to accept that nomination. There was a lot of anger and do you think they might go back to having super delegates coming in on the first ballot?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "I don't think so. I think this time it's going to be so clear that the energy is behind Bernie Sanders. He is going to go in to the convection with a lead. And hopefully we're the majority. I'm confident we are going to do well in Nevada. I think we're going to win California. So it's very different and I think more and more people are coming on board and we are seeing this coalition expand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So we've seen some backlash today from some of the unions in Nevada. They are concerned about the plan to take away their health care plans that they really like, and instead have Medicare for all, single payer program in this country. How is Senator Sanders going to work with that opinion when it gets to Nevada?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "We have to listen to those Union Leaders and assure them that the contracts that they negotiated aren't going to be effective because the transition in Senator Sanders plan is four years, many of those contracts are three years, and those will be grandfathered in. So I do think--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So you are saying to them that if you're going to keep working there for the next ten years or your children are going to be in this union after you, you are not to have this plan. I mean that's going to be a tough sell for a lot of them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "Well, look what you are saying is you're going to keep everything you've bargained for. Next time you are going to get health care, you won't have deductibles, premiums, or co-pays, and by the way you're going get a wage increase because you're going to get that health care but you're not going to lose anything. But I have a lot of respect for the culinary union. I think we have to sit down with them, listen to them, engage and make sure that their concerns are being addressed in any plan that the President Sanders candidate Sanders would sign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So you know in terms of the economy, there is a restructuring of the economy essentially in the Bernie Sanders plan and you look at the Gallup poll and you've got 61 percent say that they are better off than they were three years ago when President Trump took office. How do you campaign against that when people feel 61 percent that is going in the right direction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "When I go into rural communities, when I go into towns in Ohio in Pennsylvania and Michigan, people still feel that jobs are going offshore, they still feel that their wages aren't going up high enough, that these towns have seen their kids leaving, and they want to build more infrastructure, more manufacturing. They want us to be investing in the heartland of this country and minority communities."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "I do actually you know if you look at the manufacturing index, its downs at the lowest point since 2008. And the reason I think there will be more is Bernie Sanders has a clear message: he said we will not give federal contract to any company that offshore its jobs. I saw in Burlington Iowa people 50 and 60-year-old blue-collar workers stand up and applaud when he stood up and said that. Why should we be giving federal contract when they're shipping our jobs overseas? His message actually relates and appeals most of the voters who went from Obama to Trump and I think Donald Trump knows that, he can compete in Wisconsin and Michigan in Western Pennsylvania."

She presided over the trial, she listened to the witnesses she is uniquely well-positioned to decide whether or not that enhancement should be in play, but the notion - prosecutors don't sentence people. Presidents don't sentence people, fox news commentators don't sentence people, judges do. We give them life tenure so they can make these calls. But the notion that Bill Barr should resign is about the dumbest damn thing I've ever heard. If the United States Senator really believe if the head of Department of Justice cannot weigh in on what a proportional sentence is, I mean there are child pornographers who do not get nine years Martha there are people who rob banks and do not get nine years. Let the judge decide. I think two or three years is about right."

My -- I have a small part of that, the new energy frontier, which deals with carbon captures specifically. And it has two parts to it. So, one part is simply using existing funds at the Department of Energy to invest in research and development and pilot programs for carbon capture within the natural gas sectors. And this isn't science fiction. This already exists. There's a plant outside of Houston that powers 5,000 homes, taking natural -- takes in natural gas, recirculate CO2 through the facility and has zero emissions.
