No.  Well, we lost our status in the world, while we elevated his status. If that's how you value these things, no wonder we've made no progress. You will never make any progress because if you keep saying that diplomacy causes a loss in status, why have diplomacy at all? Forget about it.

And essentially what it does, it shows these diverging paths that North Korea could go on. And one is isolation and destruction, and the other is prosperity and peace. And so that's the argument that President Trump is continue to make to North Korea. These are the two paths you have. These are the two choices you have. It's either one or the other.

I also point out the mayor, Ted Wheeler, do you remember -- I think it was back -- or last year -- an ICE building, a field building in Portland, Oregon, was literary under siege.

Because even if it's said during the Democratic primary, you're still going to have all those Democratic candidates particularly if one of them ends up being the nominee raising their hand to give health care to illegal immigrants and what Democrats don't understand about the immigration issue is these policies serve as a magnet for more illegal immigration. Yes, it does. And our policies directly contributed to people wanting to come here as evidenced by people gaming the system and trying to seek asylum. I think if Democrats actually cared about the humanitarian issue, they would want to try to discourage people from making that trip because you see people dying in the desert, drowning in the Rio Grande. 10-year-old girls having to take a pregnancy test because of the prevalence of rape and assault. So, if you actually cared about the humanitarian aspect, you would want to try to discourage that trip from ever happening.",

And especially on a foreign trip, the United States press corps, the White House press corps has to travel as a unit, you have to look out for each other because it is like sharp elbows and the rest and she was willing to defend the President.

It's a process. But I think you can acknowledge, everybody can acknowledge it's heading in the right direction. That direction can change. But at this point, no more nuclear testing and our posture remain strong in the region. We've just opened up the largest U.S. military base in the entire world in South Korea. We have 25,000 military personnel there. The naval fleet is right off the coast. And they're still under the nuclear umbrella. Everything that other presidents have done have not worked. It has gotten more dangerous and more dangerous in North Korea. This president come on, tries something different, he's criticized the entire time. The tweeting, the summits, one of whom which he walked away from. But I think everybody can agree we're heading in the right direction.

So you can keep those and you can -- and then your goal is to remove the psychological barriers or the threats that are perceived by the adversary who thinks that maybe you want to kill them. Trump has removed that. He's saying, look, we're not interested in blowing you up. You don't need to have these nuclear items. But, I mean, casting diplomacy as a zero sum game. We've talked to him, therefore we lose something, right? So what did we lose? Did we lose money? Did we lose land? Did we lose lives? No.  Well, we lost our status in the world, while we elevated his status. If that's how you value these things, no wonder we've made no progress. You will never make any progress because if you keep saying that diplomacy causes a loss in status, why have diplomacy at all? Forget about it.

But what I think he is trying to do is he's trying to convince Kim Jong-un that he doesn't have to be isolated from the rest of the world, and that nuclear weapons aren't key to the regime's survival. I think the most telling example of this and the most, you know -- the argument that he's trying to make is depicted if you watch the video that President Trump presented Kim Jong-un in Singapore, it's like a really interesting video that he showed him. And essentially what it does, it shows these diverging paths that North Korea could go on. And one is isolation and destruction, and the other is prosperity and peace. And so that's the argument that President Trump is continue to make to North Korea. These are the two paths you have. These are the two choices you have. It's either one or the other. I think everything we've seen of President Trump trying to do of late is to encourage diplomacy, to increase the sanctions, to try to do whatever he can to push him in the corner of peace and prosperity, which I think we should all support."

And I think that's a dangerous scenario to be in, and dangerous mentality for these people to have. I also point out the mayor, Ted Wheeler, do you remember -- I think it was back -- or last year -- an ICE building, a field building in Portland, Oregon, was literary under siege. And these Antifa people and protestors were not letting individuals in and out of the building. They literary stopped a car from being able to leave.

Like politics has changed -- you think about how Obama was like the social media president at that time. He's like -- they've figured out this new technology and were able to drive forward. The Republicans caught up, and then you had President Trump. He's actually utilizing it. And now Republicans are catching up on small donors and it's faster, and it is moving quickly, and he is running a campaign from two cycles ago. And I wonder if he'll be able to keep going.

So that's a five percent gap in the Morning Consult poll where Biden's at 33 percent. Harris is tied with Warren at 12 percent. That's a 20 percent plus different. It's a big difference I think in the way we look at this, if you see somebody like Biden still in the lead by 20 percent plus points versus just five percent."

If he does punch down and initiate an attack against her, does it make him look weak? Does it make him look insecure or nervous?

Yes, it does. And our policies directly contributed to people wanting to come here as evidenced by people gaming the system and trying to seek asylum.

And especially on a foreign trip, the United States press corps, the White House press corps has to travel as a unit, you have to look out for each other because it is like sharp elbows and the rest and she was willing to defend the President.
