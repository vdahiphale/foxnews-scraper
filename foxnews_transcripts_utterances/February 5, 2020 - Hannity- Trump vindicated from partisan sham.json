For the sake of this country, we need to now get to the truth of what happened here, including the truth about the hearsay, non-whistleblower whistleblower.

The argument he gave against my position is that if a president were to pardon Republicans rather than Democrats, that would be an impeachable offense. No, it wouldn't be. Let me give you some proof of that. When George H.W. Bush pardoned Caspar Weinberger and four other people on the eve of his trial in order to end the Iran Contra investigation, Mitt Romney didn't call for impeachment investigation.

The most powerful moments from the president's speech also last night surrounding the courageous Americans in attendance. There were so many amazing people in this country. The parents of Kayla Mueller, you know, one of the last surviving Tuskegee airmen, the family of an American soldier serving abroad being brought in to that chamber, a little girl receiving a life-changing scholarship. Some Democrats couldn't even stand for these moments. Unbelievable. Nowhere has the tale of two Americans been more apparent than three years of the Democrats and the success that we scroll on that screen. We have, on one side, we have the Republicans, a president standing up and cheering fellow Americans and their success and their jobs and their safety and their security and their prosperity, and applauding American exceptionalism and the heroes that make it possible every day. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have on the other side, very same time, Pelosi, which was a weird distraction the whole night. The petulant, bitter, indignant colleague sitting on their hands and frowning at things that we should all agree on. A scholarship? A changing the life of young American? Record-breaking jobs numbers? The historic progress for every demographic women in the workplace? Record low African-American, Hispanic-American unemployment rates? Or the strike against Iran's top terrorist? Really, we can't agree on that? The last surviving Tuskegee airman or the grandchild of that person? Amazing moments last night. Now, what you see on the other side is petty, it is small. The Democrats are exposed and diminished. It is -- I can't describe it. You have got one America and then have you got this crazy America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Socialist congresswoman, part of the squad, Congresswoman Tlaib, walking out, midway through the speech, saying he is bigoted. Nancy Pelosi I had to consciously stop looking at some point. It was a distraction for almost the whole time, mumbling to herself, weird faces. If I was writing a skit for \"Saturday Night Live,\" I'd just show that, clearly seething with rage and hatred. Beyond bizarre. Looking totally, completely unhinged, like a person who has been -- become completely and utterly broken and beaten again by Donald Trump. At the end of the address and an over-the-top, dramatic display of resistance. Really? Ripping up the official transcript of the speech and calling it all a pack of lies, was it Tuskegee airmen? She ripped that up or was she talking about the scholarship that was given out or the family of Kayla and the story of our brave men and women killing Soleimani, Baghdadi and the caliphate? Is that what she is doing? Is that what she ripped it all up because it's all a lie and she was being courteous? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And now, in a brand new ad, Senate Republicans -- they are highlighting this ad is it. This is one of the best ads I have ever seen. Pack of lies that Pelosi ripped to shreds. Take a look. By the way, apparently, we don't have it. Are we going to get it? Somebody tell me some point, somewhere? Constitutional scholar, Jonathan Turley, is an independent voter. He didn't vote for Donald Trump. Remember, he was brought in as a so-called opinion witness. He is the one that says you guys are abusing your power, calling for Pelosi to resign, writing, quote: The conduct of Speaker Pelosi at the State of the Union Address this week will go down as a day of infamy for a chamber as an institution, continuing: Pelosi seemed to be intent on mocking President Trump from behind his back with sophomoric, facial grimaces and head-shaking, culminating with her ripping up a copy of his address. If Pelosi cannot maintain the dignity and neutrality of her office at the State of the Union, she should resign as a speaker of the House of Representatives. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich calling for Pelosi to get censured, tweeting that he is disgusted and insulted by the viciously partisan actions of Nancy Pelosi. Of course, not everyone is condemning Pelosi's sad behavior. The mob, the media, state-run Democratic TV, all things rage Trump every second of every hour of every day, they're applauding the speaker. Over fake news CNN -- there he is. Humpty Dumpty, our good friend and, by the way, his assistant, a wannabe Humpty Dumpty, a guy named Oliver somebody who kind of stalker like guy who says, you know me, right? I'm like, no, I don't know you. Who are you? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Anyway, over at fake news CNN, Humpty Dumpty actually commending Pelosi because they are so fair and balanced and he's a journalist, taking a page out of the president's playbook. No, that's not opinion at all. That's journalism, according to fake news CNN. And meanwhile, others in the mob focus their vitriol on radio legend Rush Limbaugh, diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. President Trump honored Rush at the State of the Union with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I thought liberals like free speech. Now, the same liberals attacking Rush today, they will put up with you can't go to a 7-Eleven unless you have a slight Indian accent or Dunkin' Donuts, and every other bizarre thing that Joe Biden has said. And the media's reaction has been utterly predictable, totally petty, small and predictably classless and harmful to we, the people, because they lie, they tell conspiracies, they slander, they besmirch. And now, they're going to pay a lot of money to Nicholas Sandmann as fake news CNN has done. I wonder if Humpty is reporting on that. Take a look.",

It is sad and, frankly, it is dangerous and beyond repulsive. But make no mistake, this isn't over. This must not be over. Let me say this tonight. For the sake of this country, we need to now get to the truth of what happened here, including the truth about the hearsay, non-whistleblower whistleblower. The truth about the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar Adam Schiff and whatever relationship he, his staff had with the non-whistleblower hearsay whistleblower. We must get to the truth of why the tools of government were weaponized yet again against this president. Now, tonight, the only Republican senator to side with the radical Democrats was, well, Mitt Romney. He gave a speech today, even -- he even was peddling the liberal talking point that quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter were exonerated. Like what? Wow. His arguments were constitutionally incoherent and, by the way, his double standard and hypocrisy beyond words. I know a lot of you, especially in Utah and around the country are mad at Mitt tonight. You have every right to be as far as I'm concerned. Frankly, it is sad. Mitt Romney is now a diminished figure, clearly losing a presidential election ruins people. You don't believe me? Look at Al Gore, look at Hillary Clinton. And even to some extent I would argue John McCain. I like Mitt Romney. I don't regret fighting hard for him in 2012. He clearly cannot accept and get over the fact that he lost. He absolutely could have won in 2012. He did not fight. The difference between him and Donald Trump is Donald Trump fought every single day, was tough and tough enough to win. The president pointed this out tonight in a brand new ad that is beyond powerful and sadly truthful. Take a look."

We're now less than 24 hours removed from what is the single best State of the Union Address I have seen in my adult lifetime. And now, it's 31st year in radio, my 24th year at FOX. We're going to have a full recap coming up tonight, including the very worst moments from the very angry, rage-filled leader of this Democratic radical socialist group in the House, Nancy Pelosi. But, first, joining us now is the author of \"Guilt by Accusation\". He was one of the president's -- part of the president's defense team. He has taken a lot of hits. I think you had, Alan Dershowitz, professor, Harvard law professor, the finest moments of your career and intellectual honesty, common sense reason that an exposed hypocrisy that was breath-taking to me on the -- on people in your party and you should take a bow and be very proud in spite of the fact that I know you have taken a lot of personal attacks. ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AUTHOR, \"GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION\": Well, I don't mind the personal attack. I'm used to it. But there's been attacks on my family, on my friends, just because I stood up on principle. I made exactly the same argument I would have made had Hillary Clinton been impeached on these grounds of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. They're not constitutionally permissible grounds. And Mitt Romney who I liked when he was the governor of Massachusetts was just wrong constitutionally. The argument he gave against my position is that if a president were to pardon Republicans rather than Democrats, that would be an impeachable offense. No, it wouldn't be. Let me give you some proof of that. When George H.W. Bush pardoned Caspar Weinberger and four other people on the eve of his trial in order to end the Iran Contra investigation, Mitt Romney didn't call for impeachment investigation. And there was no impeachment investigation. You need to find a crime or criminal type behavior akin to treason or bribery, and they didn't find that they didn't even charge it in this case. So, today was a great day for the Constitution. The Constitution was saved from people who were trying to destroy it and diminish it."

I said, what if the back of Joe Biden's mind who I like very much, in the back of his mind, he was saying, you know, this is in the public interest but, you know, it might help my son a little bit and the company - - according to the managers that would be an impeachable offense. Just because in the back of his mind, he had interest in his son or interest in re-election, that's the point I was trying to dispute. Every politician is interested in their re-election. That doesn't turn innocent conduct into impeachable conduct. Of course, if a president commits a crime, he should be impeached. That's what the Constitution says. But if he commits completely innocent conduct, but he is motivated in part by re-election, do you know what you call people like that? Politicians. That's what all politicians do."

That's not a crime, but that is malfeasance in office. What I'm particularly interested in is what Democrats think makes a prima facie or a threshold case for being able to investigate something. With Trump, it's a conversation at a doggone bar. That's enough to launch a FISA probe into someone. With the Bidens, \"Politico\" and \"The Hill\" just pronounced that there's no evidence. Who's looked into it? If it's going to be looked into, it needs to be by law enforcement. Look, I love my colleagues in the House and the Senate.

And it did make me proud that we live in the single greatest country God has ever given mankind. Speaking of legendary radio pioneers like Rush Limbaugh and another one called a friend of mine, Barry Farber, he once said, I was a teenager listening to it, he speaks 33 languages, never been a country in the history of the earth that has accumulated more power in the United States and abused it less. And I add to that, there's no country that has accumulated more power than the United States and used that power to advance the entire worldwide human condition than this great country. America is home to the most creative, the hardest working, freedom-loving, freedom and fun. We work hard, we play hard, people in the entire world. President Trump highlighting all of this American greatness, American exceptionalism and what was a passionate, powerful, unapologetic address to this country, touting the amazing accomplishments in three short years with no help from any Democrats. Now moving on to 8 million new jobs to be created, 7 million Americans plus off of food stamps, 10 million Americans lifted off of welfare. The lowest unemployment rate in five decades, the lowest unemployment rate ever for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, the -- 70-year record low unemployment for women, 72 percent of new jobs created last year are for women in the workplace. The military veteran unemployment rate dropping to a record low. Unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low. I know we talk about millions and millions and millions -- this is a millions of families. These are American family, our family as a country succeeding, prospering. Soleimani, number one state sponsor of terror, Iran, he led that terror, dead. Baghdadi, associates dead. The ISIS caliphate, crushed and destroyed and defeated. And you can go on as you watch the scroll on the screen throughout the night tonight. Nobody else in the media mob, as corrupt as they are, want to ever tell you that story. Why is that? Because that goes against their rage, their hate, their psychosis, every second, minute, hour of every day against Donald Trump. The most powerful moments from the president's speech also last night surrounding the courageous Americans in attendance. There were so many amazing people in this country. The parents of Kayla Mueller, you know, one of the last surviving Tuskegee airmen, the family of an American soldier serving abroad being brought in to that chamber, a little girl receiving a life-changing scholarship. Some Democrats couldn't even stand for these moments. Unbelievable. Nowhere has the tale of two Americans been more apparent than three years of the Democrats and the success that we scroll on that screen. We have, on one side, we have the Republicans, a president standing up and cheering fellow Americans and their success and their jobs and their safety and their security and their prosperity, and applauding American exceptionalism and the heroes that make it possible every day. We have on the other side, very same time, Pelosi, which was a weird distraction the whole night. The petulant, bitter, indignant colleague sitting on their hands and frowning at things that we should all agree on. A scholarship? A changing the life of young American? Record-breaking jobs numbers? The historic progress for every demographic women in the workplace? Record low African-American, Hispanic-American unemployment rates? Or the strike against Iran's top terrorist? Really, we can't agree on that? The last surviving Tuskegee airman or the grandchild of that person? Amazing moments last night. Now, what you see on the other side is petty, it is small. The Democrats are exposed and diminished. It is -- I can't describe it. You have got one America and then have you got this crazy America. Socialist congresswoman, part of the squad, Congresswoman Tlaib, walking out, midway through the speech, saying he is bigoted. Nancy Pelosi I had to consciously stop looking at some point. It was a distraction for almost the whole time, mumbling to herself, weird faces. If I was writing a skit for \"Saturday Night Live,\" I'd just show that, clearly seething with rage and hatred. Beyond bizarre. Looking totally, completely unhinged, like a person who has been -- become completely and utterly broken and beaten again by Donald Trump. At the end of the address and an over-the-top, dramatic display of resistance. Really? Ripping up the official transcript of the speech and calling it all a pack of lies, was it Tuskegee airmen? She ripped that up or was she talking about the scholarship that was given out or the family of Kayla and the story of our brave men and women killing Soleimani, Baghdadi and the caliphate? Is that what she is doing? Is that what she ripped it all up because it's all a lie and she was being courteous? And now, in a brand new ad, Senate Republicans -- they are highlighting this ad is it. This is one of the best ads I have ever seen. Pack of lies that Pelosi ripped to shreds. Take a look. By the way, apparently, we don't have it. Are we going to get it? Somebody tell me some point, somewhere? Constitutional scholar, Jonathan Turley, is an independent voter. He didn't vote for Donald Trump. Remember, he was brought in as a so-called opinion witness."

If Pelosi cannot maintain the dignity and neutrality of her office at the State of the Union, she should resign as a speaker of the House of Representatives. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich calling for Pelosi to get censured, tweeting that he is disgusted and insulted by the viciously partisan actions of Nancy Pelosi. Of course, not everyone is condemning Pelosi's sad behavior.

No, that's not opinion at all. That's journalism, according to fake news CNN. And meanwhile, others in the mob focus their vitriol on radio legend Rush Limbaugh, diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. President Trump honored Rush at the State of the Union with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I thought liberals like free speech. Now, the same liberals attacking Rush today, they will put up with you can't go to a 7-Eleven unless you have a slight Indian accent or Dunkin' Donuts, and every other bizarre thing that Joe Biden has said. And the media's reaction has been utterly predictable, totally petty, small and predictably classless and harmful to we, the people, because they lie, they tell conspiracies, they slander, they besmirch.

The Iowa Democratic Party said they were withholding the caucus results because they wanted to make sure they got it right after their app suffered unspecified coding problem. But when they finally put out partial results, they even got that wrong, calling this a botched job would be understatement. Today, they had to redact results they put out mid- afternoon and issue a correction after the numbers reportedly allocated state delegates that should have gone to Senator Bernie Sanders to former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. Some of Elizabeth Warren's support actually went to Tom Steyer. They did, however, post the correct information afterwards. What we do know as of now is former Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a hair ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders with 92 percent of precincts reporting. Buttigieg is in the lead by just .9 percentage point with Warren in third and former Vice President Joe Biden in fourth."

You remember some years back, he said basically, of course, Hillary had a private server. She didn't want Louie Gohmert rifling through her emails, and he was right then and he's right again now. But what they -- what the powers that were trying to cheat Bernie didn't realize, they thought by keeping him off the campaign trail here in Washington, that that would be the end of his campaign. Little did they know that if he's not allowed to go talk to the voters in Iowa and other states, he zooms up in the polls. He's doing so much better since he hadn't been able to go out there and talk to people. AOC and others have been doing it. But Carville is right. They're in trouble right now."

But what everyone ought to be scared about is what we do know, and Democrats in particular. And Iowa is meant to be a broad gauge of voter sentiment in each party. And you look at the top tiers of the group of that candidate, and you've got Sanders and Buttigieg and Warren. And they take the lion's share of the voted. What does that mean? It means the progressives are winning. And so, when I see a Jim Carville or I see a Biden who is now lashing out at Bernie Sanders' plans and they're saying, oh, this is terrible -- I want to ask, where were you a year ago when the Green New Deal got going, when Medicare for All was out there, when impeachment got rolling? Because, it's your obligation to stand up and say these ideas are bad for our party. And instead, you just let these guys roll. Some of these ideas have caught fire out there with progressives.

It ended in nothing but a full acquittal for the president. Joining us now -- he's also the author -- this is a great book about how important our judiciary is and all the judges that have gotten appointed, thanks to the hard work of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Sir, I watched today and I watched you closely throughout this whole process. And, you know, you win again. I'm not sick of winning -- but I saw a party for three years angry, unhinged. They've done nothing for the American people and they look diminished and small and petty and insignificant to me. That's how I see your -- the other side of the aisle. Your thoughts?"

How childish and petty is that? What kind of example does that set for the American people about how we ought to conduct ourselves? I mean, have we forgotten how to be civil to each other? Particularly, when we're in Congress, sitting together, not out on the campaign trail. Not at rallies.

And they did it, on a party line vote. And you could best describe it as Trump derangement syndrome. In other words, whatever he's for, they are just -- have Pavlovian negative response to it almost immediately. Look, I think the thing to take away here and I said it in my press conference today and I think you led with it -- this was a thoroughly political maneuver. If it was, it was stupid. It backfired. The president has got the best numbers he's had since he's been in office. My members who are in tough races are all looking at better numbers than they were before impeachment started. So, if this was all about the November election, it seems to me, we can conclude at least in the short- term here, this was a colossal political mistake."

Senator Romney on the whole has been supportive of what we have been trying to accomplish in the year that he's been there. I think this was a mistake. I disagree with it. On the other hand, we've got a lot more votes to cast between now and November. And I'm going to need his support on a whole variety of things that are important to the president and to the country."

And he did a masterful job last night of laying all this out in front of the American people at a time when a lot of them are tuning in and paying attention. And all the Democrats were left with was sort of pouting on the floor, you know, trying to avoid any kind of positive response to anything he said.

But he mentioned HBCUs, our black colleges have been struggling for a long time. A bunch of them have gone under. He threw a lifeline to them in real life in his budget. He talked about that. He talked about criminal justice reform. He talked about Opportunity Zones.

They want to know whether he was on Air Force One or Air Force Two and they have evidence that Hunter Biden was actually conducting business during some of this travel. So, this is really significant developments.
