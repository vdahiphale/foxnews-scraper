      "sentences": "A crazy busy, insane at news night. Welcome to \"Hannity\". Thank you for being with us. Two days ago, you, we, the people, went to the polls, we settled our political differences at the ballot box, remember? Well, this is the lifeblood of our great constitutional republic. But sadly, we have some extremists on the left clearly preferring mob rule. We will lay this out tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We had last night an angry group of purported Antarctica's surrounding the home of our friend, fellow Fox news host Tucker Carlson. This is where he lives, his wife, his children. They tried to break down his door, vandalizing his house. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, they were shouting threats through a bullhorn. His wife was inside, alone, locked herself in a pantry, had to call the police. Coming up, we're going to respond to the continuing angry, left wing mob in this country. These are unacceptable tactics. And it better stop. Somebody is going to get hurt or worse, as I have been warning. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight, we will show you how MSNBC conspiracy TV, fake news CNN, once again at cheerleading for Robert Mueller to find something, anything on Trump. By the way, the clearest evidence we have, they weren't too happy with you and Donald Trump on Tuesday night. We also have a message for Jim Acosta, conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow tonight, and we'll show you the latest dirty trick tactics from the Democrats, including a plan to impeach Justice Kavanaugh. Yes, they want to go back there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And just breaking moments ago, Rick Scott filed a lawsuit against Broward County, he should have. We'll explain it in detail. And bring you important updates from the sad, horrific shooting that affected a friend of this program in California. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Stay tuned.

      "sentences": "All right. You've heard me say this over and over again. There is no place for violence, threats, intimidation, in the United States of America. For years, many on the left have outright vilified President Trump -- and by the way, anyone associated with him, any Republican, any conservative. We have seen it all throughout this election season -- Nazi comparisons, racism, sexism, and really far worse. Prominent Democrats Maxine Waters, Cory Booker, urging followers to get in other people's faces, the faces of their political opponents, and of course, create crowds, follow them into grocery stores and gas stations and department stores, and tell them that they're not welcome anywhere anymore.  Get your crowds. Now, we have some deranged far left lunatics are following suit. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Before the election, what did we see? DHS Secretary Nielsen run out of a restaurant, Sarah Sanders with her kids run out of not one but two restaurants. So, too, Senator Ted Cruz with his wife, Pam Bondi accosted at a movie theater, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a guy banging on his desk, followed him through airports, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, his wife, with him and literally accosted on a number of occasions. Kevin McCarthy, his office vandalized. Two Republican politicians punched in Minnesota. One victim, a serious concussion, the other, a woman. And we had, just before the election, packages, white powder, mailed it to the president, his son, Don Jr., his wife, Mattis, Wray, Gina Haspel, Fox News has also been a target of the mob. We just saw Brian Kilmeade -- well, he was a stocked through the streets of New York City, harassed, followed in a subway, called out in a subway. Now, I've had more threats in my personal life than you can ever imagine.  I don't talk about it often. Last night, our friend, Tucker Carlson, targeted at his own home in Washington, D.C. Angry group, far left extremist surrounding his house, his wife, home alone, having to barricade herself inside the house and calling the police. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But not before the mob literally cracked his front door, throwing themselves against it, vandalizing his driveway, and his car with spray paint, shouting threatening messages over a bullhorn. This is your radical left-wing Democratic Party tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

In other words, what they did in the course of the night -- well, related to, or they say they are related to, groups like Antifa and others, that's what they say. They published our home addresses online for everybody to see. Why? They are spurring threats, violence, intimidation -- by the way, for me, I'm not living my life in fear, I won't be intimidated by nobody. No one is going to silence me. I have been through this for most of my career. I feel sorry for people that are now seeing what others have lived through for a long time, but I do have a serious warning. Nothing good is going to come out of this. This mob mentality has got to stop. Somebody is going to get hurt or worse. Now some of the Democrats finally, even some on CNN and MSNBC, are speaking out against what happened to Tucker. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, earlier tonight, Tucker thanked everyone for on either side of the aisle for their support, but with all due respect, they are a day late and they are a dollar short. Remember, before the election, Democrats were silent, crickets, following all of the cases of mob rule against a Sarah Sanders, Pam Bondi, Kirstjen Nielsen, CNN was busy playing the word police, if you recall, chastising anyone who uses the term \"mob\" to describe a mob. Remember this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

What we are now seeing is downright apocalyptic coverage from fake news at CNN, MSNBC -- by the way, only say fake news or use a conspiracy TV or people chant that \"CNN sucks\", they kind of do, but that's not a threat. That is an opinion.  Those are words. By the way, others -- all of this conspiracy around Jeff Sessions departure, they obviously -- by the way, a great indicator, they weren't happy about Tuesday, they don't want to talk about the blue -- the blue little trickles. So they are back to their old conspiracy theories. That means they are not happy with the we, the people, again, and Donald Trump, again. In other words, that the world was shocked, again, they didn't get what they want. Many are now claiming that this is an attempt to meddle with their golden goose, the Mueller witch hunt. There you have it, MSNBC, Rachel Maddow, get this, she is now actively promoting -- and this NBC News, she says in interviews, she is a journalist -- I say I'm a talk show host, being a talk show host, I do news, I do opinion, I do straight interviews, I do debates, I give strong opinion -- we are the whole newspaper. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When you say you are a journalist, you are supposed to be fair and balanced.

This is what she tweeted: It's happening, this is glass in case of emergency plan to protect the Mueller investigation, 5:00 p.m. local time, protest tomorrow, Thursday, November 8th, we knew this would happen at some point, the day has arrived. This is the group she is supporting, moveon.org. In case you forgot, they are the group that put out -- remember, General Betray Us, that ad? In 2004, they made an ad that compared George Bush to Adolf Hitler. This is the group that NBC wants to align themselves with? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, there is a lot more than even mod. Just pick this up before, President Bush, Adolf Hitler, oh, filmmaker Michael Moore partners with them, and they want to, well, expletive punch to burn at this mother down. That's the group NBC and conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow is now helping to organize, promote, radical leftist protest. Tom Brokaw, what's going to happen when someone gets hurt at your break the glass moment led by Rachel?

Rick Scott will join us in just a moment. Currently, Nelson trails by nearly 20,000 votes, but that is still close enough for the mandatory recount. How Nelson has hired, get this, Marc Elias, name sound familiar? He is the Clinton campaign attorney at Perkins Coie that paid Fusion GPS for the dirty Russian dossier on Trump. So, just to be clear, the lawyer at the center of the major recount effort happens to be the same one at the center of the biggest corruption scandal abuse of power scandal in our history. He has organized an effort behind a dirty dossier for Clinton, he is at the very center of the Democrats' efforts to use campaign op research to malign Trump before and after the election. Now he has hired Bill Nelson. And now, it looks like the Florida governor's race could also be headed for a recount despite Democratic Andrew Gillum conceding the race to Ron DeSantis. Now, Marco Rubio, rightly sounding the alarm, warning of these possible tricks in Broward County, saying Broward election supervisors, ongoing violation of Florida law, requiring timely reporting, isn't just annoying incompetent, it has now opened up the door for lawyers to come in here and steal a seat in the U.S. Senate and Florida cabinet. There are so many unanswered questions. Why can't Broward and Palm Beach report like every other county in Florida? Now, what is also taking place, by the way, why is it taking so long to count the votes? Where serious, mysterious, uncounted ballots, where are they all coming from? Don't forget, a federal judge recently ruled the county elections chief Brenda Snipes, illegally destroyed ballots, that was in the Wasserman Schultz 2016 primary race during a pending lawsuit. Snipes, she is still in charge of Broward County. Moments ago, learned that Governor Scott filed a lawsuit, rightly so, against her over serious violations of the law. He will join us. Finally, tonight, we end with a sad and tragic story. The White House flag lowered at half-staff today, in remembrance of the 12 victims of this morning's senseless shootings in Thousand Oaks, California. One of the victims was California Sergeant Ron Helus. He was the first one on the scene, responding right after. Our good friend, Adam Housley, he also lost a niece in all of this.

Two days ago, you, we, the people, went to the polls, we settled our political differences at the ballot box, remember? Well, this is the lifeblood of our great constitutional republic. But sadly, we have some extremists on the left clearly preferring mob rule. We will lay this out tonight. We had last night an angry group of purported Antarctica's surrounding the home of our friend, fellow Fox news host Tucker Carlson. This is where he lives, his wife, his children. They tried to break down his door, vandalizing his house. Now, they were shouting threats through a bullhorn. His wife was inside, alone, locked herself in a pantry, had to call the police. Coming up, we're going to respond to the continuing angry, left wing mob in this country. These are unacceptable tactics. And it better stop. Somebody is going to get hurt or worse, as I have been warning. Also tonight, we will show you how MSNBC conspiracy TV, fake news CNN, once again at cheerleading for Robert Mueller to find something, anything on Trump. By the way, the clearest evidence we have, they weren't too happy with you and Donald Trump on Tuesday night. We also have a message for Jim Acosta, conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow tonight, and we'll show you the latest dirty trick tactics from the Democrats, including a plan to impeach Justice Kavanaugh. Yes, they want to go back there. And just breaking moments ago, Rick Scott filed a lawsuit against Broward County, he should have. We'll explain it in detail. And bring you important updates from the sad, horrific shooting that affected a friend of this program in California. Stay tuned. It's time for a busy night, breaking news, opening monologue."

For years, many on the left have outright vilified President Trump -- and by the way, anyone associated with him, any Republican, any conservative. We have seen it all throughout this election season -- Nazi comparisons, racism, sexism, and really far worse. Prominent Democrats Maxine Waters, Cory Booker, urging followers to get in other people's faces, the faces of their political opponents, and of course, create crowds, follow them into grocery stores and gas stations and department stores, and tell them that they're not welcome anywhere anymore.  Get your crowds. Now, we have some deranged far left lunatics are following suit. Before the election, what did we see? DHS Secretary Nielsen run out of a restaurant, Sarah Sanders with her kids run out of not one but two restaurants. So, too, Senator Ted Cruz with his wife, Pam Bondi accosted at a movie theater, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a guy banging on his desk, followed him through airports, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, his wife, with him and literally accosted on a number of occasions. Kevin McCarthy, his office vandalized. Two Republican politicians punched in Minnesota. One victim, a serious concussion, the other, a woman. And we had, just before the election, packages, white powder, mailed it to the president, his son, Don Jr., his wife, Mattis, Wray, Gina Haspel, Fox News has also been a target of the mob. We just saw Brian Kilmeade -- well, he was a stocked through the streets of New York City, harassed, followed in a subway, called out in a subway. Now, I've had more threats in my personal life than you can ever imagine.  I don't talk about it often. Last night, our friend, Tucker Carlson, targeted at his own home in Washington, D.C. Angry group, far left extremist surrounding his house, his wife, home alone, having to barricade herself inside the house and calling the police. But not before the mob literally cracked his front door, throwing themselves against it, vandalizing his driveway, and his car with spray paint, shouting threatening messages over a bullhorn. This is your radical left-wing Democratic Party tonight."

Now, another far left group, they have doxxed the personal information of Tucker, Ann Coulter, yours truly. In other words, what they did in the course of the night -- well, related to, or they say they are related to, groups like Antifa and others, that's what they say. They published our home addresses online for everybody to see. Why? They are spurring threats, violence, intimidation -- by the way, for me, I'm not living my life in fear, I won't be intimidated by nobody. No one is going to silence me. I have been through this for most of my career. I feel sorry for people that are now seeing what others have lived through for a long time, but I do have a serious warning. Nothing good is going to come out of this. This mob mentality has got to stop. Somebody is going to get hurt or worse. Now some of the Democrats finally, even some on CNN and MSNBC, are speaking out against what happened to Tucker. And, by the way, earlier tonight, Tucker thanked everyone for on either side of the aisle for their support, but with all due respect, they are a day late and they are a dollar short. Remember, before the election, Democrats were silent, crickets, following all of the cases of mob rule against a Sarah Sanders, Pam Bondi, Kirstjen Nielsen, CNN was busy playing the word police, if you recall, chastising anyone who uses the term \"mob\" to describe a mob. Remember this."

And, by the way, there's plenty of -- well, vilification of political differences. I'm not against any free speech. Words are words. Threats are a very different thing. Let's not create the crowds, follow people, cabinet members, into department stores, gas stations, and so on, and tell them they are not wanted anywhere anymore, or to kick them, or we can't be civil. Let me tell you if you are a conservative tonight, let me say this. And let's say you see somebody you don't like it, politically, someone you disagree with. Leave them alone. Leave them alone. They are with their families, they are eating, leave them alone. We don't want to be like these left-wing radicals. What we are now seeing is downright apocalyptic coverage from fake news at CNN, MSNBC -- by the way, only say fake news or use a conspiracy TV or people chant that \"CNN sucks\", they kind of do, but that's not a threat. That is an opinion.  Those are words. By the way, others -- all of this conspiracy around Jeff Sessions departure, they obviously -- by the way, a great indicator, they weren't happy about Tuesday, they don't want to talk about the blue -- the blue little trickles. So they are back to their old conspiracy theories. That means they are not happy with the we, the people, again, and Donald Trump, again. In other words, that the world was shocked, again, they didn't get what they want. Many are now claiming that this is an attempt to meddle with their golden goose, the Mueller witch hunt. There you have it, MSNBC, Rachel Maddow, get this, she is now actively promoting -- and this NBC News, she says in interviews, she is a journalist -- I say I'm a talk show host, being a talk show host, I do news, I do opinion, I do straight interviews, I do debates, I give strong opinion -- we are the whole newspaper.

Just pick this up before, President Bush, Adolf Hitler, oh, filmmaker Michael Moore partners with them, and they want to, well, expletive punch to burn at this mother down. That's the group NBC and conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow is now helping to organize, promote, radical leftist protest.

That also became the basis to lie to the American people to help Hillary win, propagated by top people in the intel community. And then, course, they use it a basis of circular reporting so that they can get Robert Mueller appointed, Comey leaking. Now, regardless of the outcome or the timeline of Mueller's witch hunt, Democrats in the House, they are still planning to wage a never ending, full-scale investigation into everything. Let me make you a promise tonight. We will be watching every day. Let's see if they do anything for you, we, the people. And, by the way, they just want to attack Trump, they don't care about anything else, that's their top agenda item. Jerrold Nadler, likely chair of the judiciary committee, overheard on a train from New York to D.C. bragging about his plan to launch full-scale investigations again after two years into Russian collusion and plot to impeach Judge Kavanaugh, good luck with that.

He constantly accuses Trump and his administration of everything, racism, sexism. Acosta is a self-serving liberal hack with zero journalistic integrity. But don't take my word for it.

You do a disservice to real journalist in the press corps, and it is a disservice to the American people. We will have more in a moment. Let's turn to another story. We'd go to Florida, now bracing for a massive recount tonight. Defeated Democratic Senator Bill Nelson moving ahead on his recount plans after losing to Republican Rick Scott. Rick Scott will join us in just a moment. Currently, Nelson trails by nearly 20,000 votes, but that is still close enough for the mandatory recount. How Nelson has hired, get this, Marc Elias, name sound familiar? He is the Clinton campaign attorney at Perkins Coie that paid Fusion GPS for the dirty Russian dossier on Trump. So, just to be clear, the lawyer at the center of the major recount effort happens to be the same one at the center of the biggest corruption scandal abuse of power scandal in our history. He has organized an effort behind a dirty dossier for Clinton, he is at the very center of the Democrats' efforts to use campaign op research to malign Trump before and after the election. Now he has hired Bill Nelson. And now, it looks like the Florida governor's race could also be headed for a recount despite Democratic Andrew Gillum conceding the race to Ron DeSantis. Now, Marco Rubio, rightly sounding the alarm, warning of these possible tricks in Broward County, saying Broward election supervisors, ongoing violation of Florida law, requiring timely reporting, isn't just annoying incompetent, it has now opened up the door for lawyers to come in here and steal a seat in the U.S. Senate and Florida cabinet. There are so many unanswered questions. Why can't Broward and Palm Beach report like every other county in Florida? Now, what is also taking place, by the way, why is it taking so long to count the votes? Where serious, mysterious, uncounted ballots, where are they all coming from? Don't forget, a federal judge recently ruled the county elections chief Brenda Snipes, illegally destroyed ballots, that was in the Wasserman Schultz 2016 primary race during a pending lawsuit. Snipes, she is still in charge of Broward County. Moments ago, learned that Governor Scott filed a lawsuit, rightly so, against her over serious violations of the law. He will join us. Finally, tonight, we end with a sad and tragic story. The White House flag lowered at half-staff today, in remembrance of the 12 victims of this morning's senseless shootings in Thousand Oaks, California. One of the victims was California Sergeant Ron Helus. He was the first one on the scene, responding right after. Our good friend, Adam Housley, he also lost a niece in all of this. Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody there. All right. We have a lot more to get to tonight. When we come back, Rick Scott will join us as what we now see, the law broken again in Broward and Palm Beach. We'll explain next."

She was supposed to hand over vote totals, she hasn't. The number of ballots canvassed and to be canvassed, she hasn't. And then the most egregious is under the law, the governor is allowed to make a written request to look at the public records of this, she refused to do that. So, she has a long and distinguished history of violating the law, you know, judge, as you pointed out in your monologue, I already found several months ago, that she unlawfully destroyed ballots, and now the sudden discovery of 78,000 ballots, is she creating ballots, whereas before she destroyed ballots?

This actually happens more times than it gets coverage, and here's what I know after spending 36 days in the Florida recount in 2000. The more they count then the worst it's going to be for Rick Scott. He is doing the exact right thing. Ronna Romney at the RNC is doing the exact right thing, take them to court.

What we know is this, just as a Congressman Jordan said, that Rod Rosenstein is basically conflicted out anyway, and let's not forget about the testimony of James Baker, the former general counsel at the FBI, who basically testified that Rod Rosenstein himself, himself, was discussing possibly invoking the 25th amendment, and actually recording, you know, the president, secretly taping him. The New York Times was the first to break that story, and that a story has been confirmed over and over again."

We still don't have the James Baker 302s, and we still don't have the Bruce Ohr--"

      "utterance": "The attorney general is being fired! Being asked to leave. It is perfectly constitutional. And yet, the left is running around talking about a constitutional crisis. They still believe that Robert Mueller has evidence that a Trump colluded with Russia. And they think that Trump is getting rid of Sessions so that Trump can put somebody in there who is going to shut this down so that the truth about Trump stealing the election doesn't come out. That is what they believe."
