The other conspiracy theory box is president's beloved is too much, he's the world's ultimate tyrant, he has this massive power he's abusing and he's all over everything all the time.

So there can be serious consequences if our legislation passes and Chinese officials refused to even respond to those lawsuits. Our legislation will also allow China to fess up, say come forward for what they did, create a pool of money from which people can recover, as we also did for the 9/11 victims, and then we would turn off that sovereign immunity. Let's just say that I don't expect communist China to do that, and therefore, it's important that we open up our courts to the American people to sue the Chinese officials who are responsible for unleashing this pandemic on the world.",

But unfortunately, some of the Democratic Party, some in the media basically want to take the side of anyone Donald Trump as opposed to, and President Trump has made it clear that China is responsible for this virus. Or, for example, as you said, he's made it clear that Tedros at the World Health Organization, badly, badly heard (ph) and probably was just spinning for China. And what do you have? You have Democrats and the media rushing to the defense of the World Health Organization.

But looking back in January when the rest of Washington was obsessed about the impeachment trial, I saw the contrast between Chinese rhetoric on the one hand that tried to say everything was calm and under control and this virus couldn't pass from human to human when they knew that it was highly contagious, and even lethal, versus Chinese action which reflected that knowledge. They shut down schools in all of mainland China. They literally welded the doors shut on apartment buildings in Wuhan. They shut down air travel with China -- to Hong Kong which they otherwise would never do.

So, we saw a couple of smaller studies come out of California, the biggest one being released from New York just this week, 3,000 patients, albeit but is still a small sample size when you're considering the population of New York state, but what it is telling us is, that there's a higher infection rate which means there's also going to be a lower fatality rate, meaning the fewer amount of people who are affected are actually going to die from this virus. But that being said, this is very different from that nasal swab that we've been talking about, that PCR test, the molecular test. That nasal swab is actually looking for the presence of the virus. The serology test or this blood test is actually looking for the antibodies that your body has produced in response. So, it is much easier in the fact that you are just having to give blood like you've done many times before as opposed to that very invasive nasal swab. In terms of at home usage, I'm not necessarily sure of that but I can tell you there are many, many, many private and public companies who are stepping up and developing their own antibody tests so that people can have increased access to them.",

In New York, 94 percent of people with severe illness or who died had at least one pre-existing condition and when you have 60 percent of Americans with pre-existing conditions, that is why so many people have fallen ill here. We had to make makeshift hospitals in Central Park because we didn't have enough room in our hospital systems because of this chronic illness epidemic that we have in our country.

Expert table boost access to testing as well as test numbers. The president also signed legislation today replenishing the small business lending program with $484 billion, $310 billion of that goes towards the Paycheck Protection Program, which quickly ran out of money a few weeks back. President Trump and Vice President Pence also spoke with the nation's governors today. Topic one was testing, with the vice president saying that a month ago, 80,000 Americans had been tested. Today, it's 5 million. Governors are also reporting that hospitals and ICUs nationwide are seeing very positive trends.

Well, tonight, as President Trump works around the clock to coordinate this country's pandemic response, some Democrats are attempting to remake America in accordance with their own far left agenda. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has her eyes on a massive new spending bill. It's a bill that would bail out liberal states on the brink of bankruptcy. Now, these are states that have squandered billions of dollars on entitlements, generous pension plans for public employee union members, green energy programs and much more. Now, Nancy Pelosi wants to give them more of your money. And while Pelosi tries to get all of her friends to get a giant payday, other Democrats are using the virus as a political weapon. House lawmakers led by Congressman James Clyburn have already assembled a panel to investigate the president's handling of the virus. Now, keep in mind, it's the same James Clyburn who told colleagues that the coronavirus was a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.

That's what they push during this crisis. And they have attacked the president so much so they have now created a special select committee. It wasn't good enough for the Crossfire Hurricane, wasn't good enough with the Mueller investigation, couldn't get the president with this crazy impeachment over the Ukrainian phone call, so now they're going to create a select committee to go after the president, even though, as Mr. Gohmert knows, we already have eight different entities doing oversight over the coronavirus response."

And if you saw the speaker's comments, she said we are going to do this in a bipartisan way, and probably has a 100 percent partisan vote to create a committee to try to impeach President Trump. That's what it's all boiling down to. But -- and as far as our friend, Max, when he first said what he did about disrespecting cops, telling cops drop dead, I had to ask, is he talking about Mayor de Blasio? But apparently, he was talking about Mitch McConnell. And saying a state might file for bankruptcy is not the same as telling a state's employees to drop dead, for heaven's sake -- cops, firefighters, these first responders, they're all essential and any bankruptcy court would rule that way. They are essential. They've got to keep being paid. But it's not lawful to file bankruptcy for a state at this time and a lot of it, Jim, and I have talked about it -- you know, we have been concerned all along that they would follow Rahm Emanuel's advice, not let a good crisis go to waste, and you've got Democrat cities, controlled cities and states that are basically bankrupt, and they might try to use this crisis to bail them out, and that's totally inappropriate.

So, this committee is a bipartisan politics.

And this idea that governments are stopping people from attending church, particularly on Easter Sunday, is just flat out wrong. So, Bill Barr is defending liberty.

Remember, they are going to have a pretty big platform fight about their policies and they don't want the American people to see that. But this is during a fund-raising call, as you note, sir, and I think there's a point here, because Biden has had a horrible time fund-raising, and will continue to have a difficult time compared to the historic fund-raising the president has been enjoying. So, that's a sign of lack of enthusiasm. So, once again this is an attempt to frighten people. This is all the Democrats have, is an effort to frighten their own people into thinking that this is going to be some kind of a coup. Whereas in fact, the president I think is looking forward to this, clearly, wants to have an election. It is something, it is a restatement about the reformation, and clearly the approval of the way he's been handling this extraordinary situation that none of us could of predicted speaks to his leadership. So they are going to want to, as they've been doing for several years, besmirched his character, lied to people about the nature of what he means and what he's doing, and they're going to end, you're right. This year, it's going to be awful, but the fact is that's all they have. Now they are also just lying to their own people in an attempt to create more confusion and more fear."

I mean, you know, and listen, I know it's an election and obviously we should question Joe Biden's fitness for office, it is appropriate. But really sometimes, Governor, I mean it, it's like sad to watch. He seems like he is grossly under prepared for this. Now, this is a bizarre conspiracy theory. Tammy's absolutely right, you are right as well. That Trump is somehow going to move -- it's just so dumb. I can't believe we have to cover this but we do because it was brought up by a major party candidate. But what's weird, the Democrats have their conspiracy theory boxes with the president. One conspiracy theory box is President Trump is not fit, he doesn't do anything, he just sits there all day and because he missed the ball and all of those he is not suited for the job. The other conspiracy theory box is president's beloved is too much, he's the world's ultimate tyrant, he has this massive power he's abusing and he's all over everything all the time. This is from the Trump is a tyrant box, that he has the power, despite Trump clearly saying this is ridiculous, that he plans on delaying the election. This is from the tyrant box where they just pulled in a reasonably grabbed one. But this is really just dumb. I mean, let's be honest, this is stupid."

During the Kavanaugh hearings, I noted that women should be taken seriously and enjoy due process as we look into the nature of some of these allegations that phone call is important, because part of what Ms. Reade said, she told her mother, that was her mother, she told her brother and her friend. And her mother, she said, had called \"The Larry King Show\" at the time she was aghast that this had happened, and somehow that now has been found once \"The Intercept\" put up that this was out there and it would be good to find it. So this confirms the nature of the series of what she has said she did and this is now -- look, what we've known from the start is that, and what I've written about is that sexism, homophobia, and racism live on the left. They are using women, they ruined the dynamic about taking women seriously in the Kavanaugh hearings because they said there needs to be no due process, that men are guilty until proven innocent, and in this case, they simply do nothing at all and they've been ignoring it. So, they will continue to ignore it but this is a lesson for the American people. It reinforces the fact that the people who've said they are the champions for women and others who are disenfranchised have been lying for generations, and it's time to make a change when it comes to how we live our lives and who our leadership is."

For example, in Houston a new mandate would find residence 1,000 bucks just for not wearing a mask in public. Houston's police union president is calling the measure draconian. Others are protesting the mandate, which is now facing a court challenge. And in Michigan, state lawmakers are attempting to restrain the governor's emergency powers after she issued widespread bans, at one point even prohibiting members of the same family from visiting each other. My guess is there are some families who would actually approve of that, but not many. Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced today that she is going to ease some of the stay-at-home orders by the governor continues to face a wave of criticism. And in Washington state, that stayed one vote away from releasing some of its most dangerous inmates, all to fight the spread of COVID-19. And a 5-4 decision, the state Supreme Court denied the release of these convicts, including potentially the Green River killer. Joining us now with more, FOX News contributor Trey Gowdy. Trey, you were in Congress long enough to not like it very well. You are back home in South Carolina, but what we are seen all across the country is some very heavy handed policies being passed out at the local level by governors and county commissions and mayors.

Any time governor asks the citizenry to do something there has to be a rational basis for it, and the greater the freedom you infringe, the more compelling the reason has to be. So, if I'm going to imprison you or fine you for not wearing a mask, why can I hold you down and vaccinate you against the flu this fall? I mean, you don't want the flu and COVID-19, so can I involuntarily vaccinate you? Can I show up at your house and make sure you are doing your burpees and planks and your jumping jacks because obesity and COVID-19 don't go well together? Where does it stop? And in Houston, Governor, if you can believe this, they are threatening to punish people for not wearing a mask. Meanwhile, on Washington state, they are going to let a serial killer, they are one vote away from letting a serial killer out because of COVID-19. So, you go to jail for not wearing a mask but if you kill four dozen women because of COVID-19, we might let you out. That is a rational."

So he understands that for government to be able to impinge on a freedom or infringe on a freedom, there has to be a rational basis and sometimes a compelling reason. So, if I'm going to tell you, governor, that you can't visit your mom, that is a fundamental right that you have. So, the reason that I'm -- the reason I offered to keep you from doing that has to be incredibly compelling. It has to be more than just the governor of Michigan thinks it's a good idea. If I tell you that you have to wear something in public, there has to be a rational basis for that. So, Barr is smart enough to know that and he'll put the power of the federal government and grants for those states and municipalities who don't want to go along, the power of the purse and the power to go to court."

So, good luck convincing anyone that mowing your front lawn is going to make you more susceptible to COVID-19. Look, I get encouraging people not to see those who are vulnerable. But asking me to not see my mom is very different from telling me that I am forbidden on penalty of law from going to see my mom and that's what the protesters and others -- I'm not a protester but I want government to explain to me, if I'm going to infringe on your freedom, it's for a compelling reason.

Here to explain more is the author of the book \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" Gordon Chang. Gordon, I'm delighted you are here. I don't know if anyone that can speak to this more clearly and effectively. Just how much misinformation do you believe we are seeing from China right now on coronavirus? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Well, from the very beginning of the outbreak until now, there has been one piece of misinformation after another. And the reason is for the communist party, the most important thing is controlling the narrative. We learned that governor on January 26 when the communist party announced its task force for the coronavirus epidemic, there was nine people on the roster. Almost all of them were propaganda types or political hacks. There was only one public health official and I believe that her degree wasn't something other than public health.

There were a couple Americans on the world health organization team that went to China for two weeks in the middle of February and they were basically shuttled around to various locations. They did get to go to Wuhan for two days, February 20th and 21st, but they didn't get to do anything important. It was just sort of meet and greet, and I believe the Americans were not permitted to go to Wuhan, but I need to confirm that.

At the Wuhan Institute of Virology which is expected to be the source of the outbreak, they kept more than 1,500 types of coronaviruses, and the question is, what were they doing their with those coronaviruses? Now most scientists believe that the coronavirus that did get loose was naturally occurring, it was not spliced, but I think Chinese officials, having seen what the disease did to China, crippling society, I think that what they tried to do was to try to make sure that it escaped China to level the playing field. They did two things, governor. First of all, they tried to convince the world that this disease was not human to human transmissible when they knew that it was. Also, they pressured countries to accept arrivals from China. You put those two things together, and the inevitable conclusion is, no, this wasn't a bio weapon when it started but it turned into one because Chinese leaders saw an opportunity to cripple other societies."

      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Well, Governor, typically, foreign officials are immune from lawsuits in our federal court system. Sovereign immunity is a principle in international system, going back hundreds of years, but it's not absolute. We've waived it, for instance, for the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks. Congressmen Crenshaw and I think we should waive it for the victims of this terrible virus. Because the Chinese officials lied about the nature of this virus, they intentionally allowed this virus to escape outside their borders, to level the playing field with the rest of the world so they would not suffer all of these harms alone. They ought to pay the consequences. Now, that's just the first step. There's a lot of other things we can do. I have legislation with Congressman Mike Gallagher to bring back pharmaceutical manufacturing from China to the United States. We'll get a legislation out this week that will invest a lot more in our military to deter Chinese aggression in the Western Pacific. But one immediate thing we can do is open our courts up to the Americans who have been so grievously harmed by this virus."

    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, a lot of -- in a lot of occasions, they probably won't, but there are consequences for that as well. Default judgments can be entered, assets can be seized, it can put difficulty on them traveling or coming to the United States. So there can be serious consequences if our legislation passes and Chinese officials refused to even respond to those lawsuits. Our legislation will also allow China to fess up, say come forward for what they did, create a pool of money from which people can recover, as we also did for the 9/11 victims, and then we would turn off that sovereign immunity. Let's just say that I don't expect communist China to do that, and therefore, it's important that we open up our courts to the American people to sue the Chinese officials who are responsible for unleashing this pandemic on the world."

What are they thinking? Why aren't they saying, that's great, let's go after ‘em?"
    },

      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I hope they will, Governor. In some cases in the past, I've worked together pretty well with, for instance, Chuck Schumer on the issues related to China. Maybe the only time we've worked together on a legislation. So I do suspect some Democrats will join us. But unfortunately, some of the Democratic Party, some in the media basically want to take the side of anyone Donald Trump as opposed to, and President Trump has made it clear that China is responsible for this virus. Or, for example, as you said, he's made it clear that Tedros at the World Health Organization, badly, badly heard (ph) and probably was just spinning for China. And what do you have? You have Democrats and the media rushing to the defense of the World Health Organization. So, I think there's some -- in this issue, there's some simply kneejerk reflection of opposition to President Trump. Even as is so often the case, he is on the right side of this issue."

One can feel vindicated or feel good about for seeing all of this when we have over 50,000 Americans who have died and 27 million Americans who have lost their livelihoods. That's not the thing about which one wishes to be proven right. But looking back in January when the rest of Washington was obsessed about the impeachment trial, I saw the contrast between Chinese rhetoric on the one hand that tried to say everything was calm and under control and this virus couldn't pass from human to human when they knew that it was highly contagious, and even lethal, versus Chinese action which reflected that knowledge. They shut down schools in all of mainland China. They literally welded the doors shut on apartment buildings in Wuhan. They shut down air travel with China -- to Hong Kong which they otherwise would never do. So, the contrast between their lying rhetoric and their drastic, extreme action told me that this virus had the potential to be a deadly pandemic."

Dr. Saphier, I want to start with the idea of testing.

I'm hearing some that may even come in the mail to people."

      "speaker": "DR. NICHOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, Governor, it's great to be on with you this evening, and the truth is we have been waiting for this random serologic prevalence testing because that really gives us a good idea of not only how many people have been infected with the virus but how many people have recovered and are possibly immune to it at this point. So, we saw a couple of smaller studies come out of California, the biggest one being released from New York just this week, 3,000 patients, albeit but is still a small sample size when you're considering the population of New York state, but what it is telling us is, that there's a higher infection rate which means there's also going to be a lower fatality rate, meaning the fewer amount of people who are affected are actually going to die from this virus. But that being said, this is very different from that nasal swab that we've been talking about, that PCR test, the molecular test. That nasal swab is actually looking for the presence of the virus. The serology test or this blood test is actually looking for the antibodies that your body has produced in response. So, it is much easier in the fact that you are just having to give blood like you've done many times before as opposed to that very invasive nasal swab. In terms of at home usage, I'm not necessarily sure of that but I can tell you there are many, many, many private and public companies who are stepping up and developing their own antibody tests so that people can have increased access to them."

We have finally flattened the curve, which has been our goal for the last six weeks, and in many cases, we are actually seeing declining numbers. But the truth is, we have to be cautiously optimistic. Yes, it is absolutely time that we start reopening but we have to do it in a smart manner because the economic fallout, the anxiety, the depression, the suicide and drug overdose deaths that may happen after decreasing employment rates, we have to take that into effect as well.

We know that the elderly are dying from this but also those with pre-existing medical conditions. In New York, 94 percent of people with severe illness or who died had at least one pre-existing condition and when you have 60 percent of Americans with pre-existing conditions, that is why so many people have fallen ill here. We had to make makeshift hospitals in Central Park because we didn't have enough room in our hospital systems because of this chronic illness epidemic that we have in our country. Had we been more prudent before, living healthier lifestyles and really just having positive incentives to live a healthier life, we would've been much more prepared for this virus.

And it's when you look into their eyes that you know that even if they're doing something good, they're sort of thinking, I could weep at what a good person I am. Oh dear. I say bravo, Ricky Gervais. Well, unfortunately, that's all the time we've got left this evening. My thanks to Sean Hannity for allowing me to host \"Hannity\" tonight and an invitation to see my show hotly named \"Huckabee\" on TBN, Saturday, 8:00/11:00 p.m. Eastern. Guests include Roger Stone, Congressman Matt Gaetz, Paula Peres, Max Lucado, and country singer Clint Black. Cable, satellite and broadcast or you could go to huckabee.tv for local listings or to watch online. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Sean is going to be back on Monday. I know you're glad to hear that. Stay safe, be well this weekend. \"The Ingraham Angle\" starts right now. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
