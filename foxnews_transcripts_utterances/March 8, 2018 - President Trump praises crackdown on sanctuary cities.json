California's response to this though is that they're not interfering. That, in fact, what they're doing under the tenth amendment, which guarantees them the right to protect public safety, is taking steps to make sure, one, for example, private employers aren't simply trying to avoid paying people by calling the feds and say, hey, get these guys out of here before I had to pay them. Or secondly, that people who are not criminals but are immigrants are not abuse when they are detained and house in facilities, sometimes for a profit facilities. There's been a history of past abuse of immigrants. And when it comes, Greg, to -- this talk about slavery, that was brought up not by Kamala Harris. That was brought up by our attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who said that the southern states believed in nullification of federal law, and that's what he said California was up to. I think that there are areas here where California is going to say we're not trying to nullify any law. We're simply trying to protect the state of California.

If you read Dave Grossman book it's called, Assassination Generation. The reason why our troops improved their shooting skills so much from World War I to now is advancement in target practice. They move to fix targets to moving targets. And now, if you look at video games, they're similar to what you might do in simulation, learning how to shoot in modern-day warfare. So, Grossman points out that when you look at lot of these spectacles, these mass shootings, there are a lot more head shots because kids are just better at it. But, the data won't help you. New academic study shows as video games have become more and more popular, U.S. school shootings are down and they're safer than ever. Northeastern University, it was James Alan Fox, he's a professor of criminology, four times as many children were killed in schools in the 90's than they are now. Over 55 million school kids, an average of ten students a year that have been killed over 25 years. So you can do the math. It's compared to other things, it's very small. So as video games go up, it seems that this is on the decline. The only differences what we're seeing are spectacles and we have to admit that, that the numbers out of Chicago, obviously, people are getting killed in far greater numbers, but these spectacles grab our attention.

Saint George, Utah, homemade explosive was found in a backpack. On Monday, a student saw the backpack in a common area at Pine View High, which looked to be smoking. The police have the student who notified faculty and the school officer prevented an explosion that would have caused mass casualties. Police got to the suspect's home, found the bomb making materials as well as info suggesting he'd been researching ISIS. Last month, the suspect may have also replaced the American flag at a different high school with an ISIS one and painted part of an ISIS-inspired threat on one wall. So why don't you hear about this story? Well, it's obvious. First, the bomb didn't go off. That's how news works. We never report when the plane lands safely. And of course, the weapon was not a gun but a bomb. Anyway, we should be grateful that no one got hurt, but don't be relieved because the only reason why no one got hurt is that they got lucky. That backpack smoked and a kid saw it. I return to the solution: hardening soft targets. Surveillance cameras should have caught the kid painting the wall or replacing the flag. Metal detectors could do a lot to reduce all threats. But right now all we have to rely on our eyeballs and chance. We can do better. So Dana, this story was on the front page of USA Today.",

He opened the door between the lower press office and the briefing to say that there was going to be a major announcement from South Korea at about 7 p.m. tonight. The topic will be North Korea. The South Korean national security advisor has been at the White House all day with his staff, meeting with H.R. McMaster, our national security advisor, to talk about what looks like a bit of a breakthrough here, with Kim Jong-un agreeing that he will come to Panmunjom border crossing between North and South Korea and go to what's called the Peace House, which is actually on the South Korean side of the border, for the very first talks that he has ever had with Moon Jae-in, who is the South Korean president. In fact, it will mark the first time since the Korean War that a North Korean leader has actually been on South Korean soil. All of this, the White House hopes, would be leading toward direct talks between the United States and North Korea about getting rid of its nuclear weapons program. The president has said that he would only talk to North Korea if it was about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, and it looks like we may be getting closer to that point. We don't know what the substance of the announcement will be here, but it will be on North Korea and it will be coming from South Korea, Juan, in the Brady Briefing Room at about 7 p.m. So keep watching for that.",

What the mayor of Oakland did the other day was a disgrace, where they had close to a thousand people ready to be gotten. She went out and warns them all. Scattered. So instead of taking in 1,000, they took in a fraction of that. Very dangerous from the standpoint of ICE and border patrol. It's very dangerous. You really made law enforcement much more dangerous than it had to be."

So California has obviously been in all of this, you know, leaders and the governor to the senate governor, quite aggressive against President Trump, aggressive against his immigration policies. You have mayors making a protest, warning illegals is there's about to be a raid, etcetera. So you also wanting to sue him environmentally about the about the wall, taking a lot of heat about that. And everybody who's running for office for governor next feels the same way and wants to sue. OK. So I don't think that's going to work out very well for them. But what I like about President Trump is he's not shying away from any kind of adversity. He's going to go there. He's going to make his opinions known. He's going to check and see what's going on. I think it's going to be contentious. There'll probably be protest, etcetera. But ultimately, I believe he's going to prevail on this issue."

I mean, when they're bringing up slavery or when you're bringing up any kind of civil rights you take this. Are you as a Californian OK with far left activists basically drumming up an issue to a point where it could be -- lead to violence. That is absolutely nuts. Yet, they're doing it. I think I mentioned it yesterday. Talking about like our paths or our civil wars -- slavery -- 600,000 people died in the civil war. It's a little bit irrational to bring up these things when you're talking about illegal aliens and a federal law, you know, and sanctuary cities. It's a bit irrational. And I go back to the other point, I said if you're OK with violating a law that you don't like, then you better be OK with me violating a law that you like. So, can I have a sanctuary city for open carry or an abortion-free zone. What would really tick off the left?"

He won because the court said that federal law, when it comes to immigration, is supreme and is the law of the land and states shouldn't interfere. California's response to this though is that they're not interfering. That, in fact, what they're doing under the tenth amendment, which guarantees them the right to protect public safety, is taking steps to make sure, one, for example, private employers aren't simply trying to avoid paying people by calling the feds and say, hey, get these guys out of here before I had to pay them. Or secondly, that people who are not criminals but are immigrants are not abuse when they are detained and house in facilities, sometimes for a profit facilities. There's been a history of past abuse of immigrants. And when it comes, Greg, to -- this talk about slavery, that was brought up not by Kamala Harris. That was brought up by our attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who said that the southern states believed in nullification of federal law, and that's what he said California was up to. I think that there are areas here where California is going to say we're not trying to nullify any law. We're simply trying to protect the state of California. We're trying to protect."

The point isn't about the bigger, broader population, although if you're here illegally, you're here illegally, but it's the criminal element. And 80,000 times during the Obama administration there was somebody that was incarcerated, gotten tangled with the law, they were convicted of a crime, and then President Obama released them back out into the United States as opposed to deporting them.

We'll go to little blueberry spice over here, who is our expert on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, thank you for that. I am blueberry spice. All right. What complicates -- OK. There are some disturbing issues about this idea on both sides. If you read Dave Grossman book it's called, Assassination Generation. The reason why our troops improved their shooting skills so much from World War I to now is advancement in target practice. They move to fix targets to moving targets. And now, if you look at video games, they're similar to what you might do in simulation, learning how to shoot in modern-day warfare. So, Grossman points out that when you look at lot of these spectacles, these mass shootings, there are a lot more head shots because kids are just better at it. But, the data won't help you. New academic study shows as video games have become more and more popular, U.S. school shootings are down and they're safer than ever. Northeastern University, it was James Alan Fox, he's a professor of criminology, four times as many children were killed in schools in the 90's than they are now. Over 55 million school kids, an average of ten students a year that have been killed over 25 years. So you can do the math. It's compared to other things, it's very small. So as video games go up, it seems that this is on the decline. The only differences what we're seeing are spectacles and we have to admit that, that the numbers out of Chicago, obviously, people are getting killed in far greater numbers, but these spectacles grab our attention. But I don't think -- I think we're all trying to look for the magic villain."

And I do believe we have devalued the human currency in our pop culture. But I don't know if that translates by the numbers into deaths. I don't think you can make that leap, Though I understand the urgency to blame that when you see this stuff and you think all these kids do all day is try to kill each other. You know, it's got -- it has to have some kind of correlation."

I think that you have the video industry, as Kimberly said in the introduction of this segment, saying, hey, we distribute around the globe. There is no other country where you see these mass shootings. Even as you say Greg, there's been a decrease. We have more mass shootings in any country in the world, and we don't have a specific limit in terms of who gets our violent video games."

Remember the killing -- the mass killing - - I think it was Aurora, Colorado, in 2012, the summer, you know, at a Batman movie. This kid -- I mean, he was so mentally unstable.

The police have the student who notified faculty and the school officer prevented an explosion that would have caused mass casualties. Police got to the suspect's home, found the bomb making materials as well as info suggesting he'd been researching ISIS. Last month, the suspect may have also replaced the American flag at a different high school with an ISIS one and painted part of an ISIS-inspired threat on one wall. So why don't you hear about this story? Well, it's obvious. First, the bomb didn't go off. That's how news works. We never report when the plane lands safely. And of course, the weapon was not a gun but a bomb."

I don't mind having some precautions in place, but I think we have to discuss kids who are mentally ill, coming back to your family breakdown stuff, no father, no direction.

Which, you know, is very troubling, in and of itself. They're going to find a way to do it. But I am a very big proponent of having dogs and utilizing them. I've seen them be very effective with law enforcement. When I worked as a prosecutor and also in schools that I have taught in as an educator, as well.

I'm not sure. But it's good news, because it seems that he's flexible. The bigger story is when you look at Mike Pence, OK? What happens when you're an ideologue who's trafficked in the team sport of left versus right and now you're walking away from those beliefs, because some of those beliefs were pure free trade? And it creates a new war of opposition. So now we have new labels. We have \"You're a globalist, and I'm a nationalist.\" And so instead of calling you a RINO, I'm going to call you a globalist, which is every bit as silly as every other team sport ideology.

He opened the door between the lower press office and the briefing to say that there was going to be a major announcement from South Korea at about 7 p.m. tonight. The topic will be North Korea. The South Korean national security advisor has been at the White House all day with his staff, meeting with H.R. McMaster, our national security advisor, to talk about what looks like a bit of a breakthrough here, with Kim Jong-un agreeing that he will come to Panmunjom border crossing between North and South Korea and go to what's called the Peace House, which is actually on the South Korean side of the border, for the very first talks that he has ever had with Moon Jae-in, who is the South Korean president. In fact, it will mark the first time since the Korean War that a North Korean leader has actually been on South Korean soil. All of this, the White House hopes, would be leading toward direct talks between the United States and North Korea about getting rid of its nuclear weapons program. The president has said that he would only talk to North Korea if it was about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, and it looks like we may be getting closer to that point. We don't know what the substance of the announcement will be here, but it will be on North Korea and it will be coming from South Korea, Juan, in the Brady Briefing Room at about 7 p.m. So keep watching for that."

But when we talked about it when the news first broke that there was going to be this statement, I thought it was coming from South Korea. But it's actually, at the end of today And one of the things the North Koreans had tried to do was to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea.

The company says it's working to fix the unprompted laughs coming out of some of its virtual assistants. Meanwhile, Movie Pass just fixed a feature from its app that let the company track customers after widespread backlash. Is technology generally becoming too creepy? I happen to think the answer is yes. But Kimberly, what do you think?"

But you do have to be careful, because you notice all the tracking devices, all those apps that you download, they all say allow them to access them, or allow them to track you. Why do they need to be tracking you? Because they are just sucking all the information for marketing purposes about your life. It is very Big Brother-ish. And if you're kind of creepy like Greg, you should be concerned."

No. 1, Amazon could actually have mined the consciousness of their workers, downloaded them into each device, and those laughs are actually cries for help.

Although I was creeped out today. This happened this morning. I walked by a shoe shop in Columbus Circle. And I was like, \"Oh, those are cute.\" So I went online, as one does, and I checked the price. I was like, \"God, those are so extensive.\" So I put it away. By the time I got off the subway, I got an email from them saying, \"We noticed you were checking us out.\" Don't do that to me."

I haven't seen that realized yet. What bothers me is the sense of lack of privacy. I think that there should be an assumption -- and I think the courts would side with me on this -- that you have a right to the expectation of some privacy. So for example, on the Moviefone deal, Greg and I were talking about it. It's a great deal. You get to watch a movie a day, set prices much cheaper. But then they track you even when you leave the movie theater. You know, or like Dana, when I walk around around there's some -- I think it's Foursquare will tell me, \"Hey, you're in midtown Manhattan. Do you want to eat here?\" And I think, \"Get away for me.\""
