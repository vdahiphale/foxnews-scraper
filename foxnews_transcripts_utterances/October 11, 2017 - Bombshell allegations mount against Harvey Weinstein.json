We've learned that the movie mogul has boarded a flight to Europe for sex rehab as more victims have now come forward, the latest being Cara Delevigne who claims she was a victim of his unwanted advances, and there's more.

I guess knowing what they knew at the time, I do have to say I'm really impressed with Ronan Farrow and how composed he was, and that's not easy to do an interview, at least they did the interview on MSNBC. It's a parent company. The question being did they actually stifle the story that Ronan had worked on for quite a while? And they said, no, take it somewhere else. And he takes it to the New Yorker. I thought that was pretty remarkable that perhaps it is a lot more widespread. Chris Hayes who is a host at MSNBC said you have to wonder if Hollywood is staring at something that would be as big as the scandal that the Catholic Church went through 15 years ago."

But a lot of these actresses that have come forward, and some of their former boyfriends or current boyfriends who said that they tried to confront him directly, they didn't take it public. And probably, that's because they're in the business together and they want to succeed. But I do wonder if at this point they're realizing that they have a much bigger problem on their hands because they were laughing about it, excusing it, but you actually might have legal action that will take him -- I think it's very curious, Kimberly.

      "utterance": "To Greg's point, in all industries, men continue to abuse their power, and it's starting to slow down as light has been exposed to this. Harvey looks like a serial sexual predator, and it was an open secret. And it's so cliche when you think about it that an ugly, fat, old Hollywood producer dangles the dream of success in front of a young starlet on a casting couch, the stereotype is just so sick."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Either way, the cliche is true if you look at them. Now, if you look at the industry of Hollywood, they're so limited amount of roles that these women are pursuing. There's only a few big production houses in Hollywood. So you have a few rich, powerful men like Weinstein who control and are the gatekeepers for very hotly contested roles. So you have women coming across from Europe, from Asia, from all over the country to compete and try to land their dream job, and he preys on their dreams and he exploits their dream for sexual gratification. Now, it's not the victim's fault for not coming forward. But like you said, it was so open that everybody knew about it. And instead of doing something about it, they put their own self-preservation, and their own success, and their own access above doing the right thing. So Hollywood is so self-congratulatory and self-righteous. You see them at the award shows patting themselves on the back. They decide that they're the arbiters of what's right, what's appropriate in this country. And they're quick to point the finger when any of their enemies across the moral lines they've designated. But the fact that this went on for so long and they did nothing, completely undercuts their credibility when they champion the causes that they claim to want to champion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Juan, let's touch on the most important aspect of this which is the victims. There're many reasons why people don't come forward. They don't feel that they have economic power or a voice that will be heard. Many of them want to make sure that they can try to get a chance in the industry and it's very uncomfortable. Some people said they didn't want to come forward out of -- not to embarrass his family or wife or children, that type of thing. Or they feel just, you know, humiliated and self- shamed. I dealt a lot with that with sexual assault, you know, victims, people who were raped, sex abuse crimes, where they don't want to come forward because of the stigma."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "I think there's so much changing in the country with regard to the relationship between men and women. But in the workplace, exactly what you say is at play, Kimberly, because I think lots of women saw this as an opportunity to get ahead. So we know about the women who have come forward and said Harvey Weinstein behaved inappropriately. What's not said oftentimes it's the women who may have had some relationship and it might have advanced their career. I even read in the paper today one woman had his initials tattooed on her because, you know, he made her career. But now, all of a sudden, I think people feel, like, you know what, Harvey Weinstein is, as Jesse said, a clear sexual predator. And the question becomes not just Hollywood, but as we're seeing in the paper today, what about the politicians who were taking Harvey Weinstein's money, from the Clintons, to the Obamas. Why were those people silent? And again, you come back to the idea that -- you know what? He had power, he had money, and men like sex, and they want sex with younger woman, and here he had the opportunity to act in a way that said it's my prerogative. It comes with the power. You know on Wall Street, this is a problem. You read about people in Washington, and congressmen having affairs than saying to the mistress let's have an abortion even though he says that he is pro- life. And then you hear about things, I mean, like John F. Kennedy and all the women that were around that, or you hear about -- I mean, to me, a lot of what's going on in the college campuses where the colleges don't know how to deal when a young woman says that the guy behaved inappropriate."

They joke about it on awards shows. So it became -- the hypocrisy that Jesse brings up is so true. This is an industry that lectures us on morality, on all kinds of morality, whether it's about sexuality, or gender, or climate change.

So that's an interesting factual analysis to see, what did he put forward, and who in fact made the call to not, you know, take that story and go with it to the point that it was buried and kept like this. But there's also intimidation that he did to people when they tried to cross him, or he felt they were trying to do something against him, like Ronan said he had that problem with him personally. But I just want to touch on something too, because when you think about Roman Polanski, and now you see he's going to sex rehab in Europe. And as a prosecutor, I'm just telling you the first thing I'm thinking of, wow, this guy just skipped town. Where did he go in Europe? Is he going to be able to be brought back? I even contacted the Los Angeles district attorney's office where I used to work, and in terms of the sexual assault unit, you know, you're looking at, yes, misdemeanor battery, even if three years. Felony if there's rape when the victim is adult at the time. There's statute of limitations or aggravated rape, forcible rape of more than 2 victims, that sentence could be 15 to life. We don't know all the facts here, what's transpired, but it certainly warrants a full and thorough criminal investigation for assault of sexual misconduct, and what has been so far alleged in terms of the media. And so, if you're the LADA office or whether it took place in New York, they have to be checking in with that."

But when you see an investigation like this, I mean, I've had cases in front of a grand jury, an indictment just about to be returned in the Doug-Mullin case, and my two defendants fled. There was a high-speed chase and the whole deal. So you've got to be like on top of this. That's what I think because this just broke.

She needs to not be a hypocrite about women's empowerment. And what it means to be -- what has she done privately in her private life? She's on a book tour talking about herself in a campaign she lost. She's not talking about women's empowerment. She's not trying to help victims of sexual assault."

I do wonder about the going forward -- one of the ways to deal with this is actually just a change in leadership at some of these companies. And so, you look at someone like Reese Witherspoon, who in her career and success has developed a production company. She did Big Little Lies, which is a big hit last year. She's optioned four more books in order to turn them into movies or television series. They're all written by women. She's casting more women.

In this case, I think Kimberly is on to something when she said, if you're in the shoes of the Clintons or the Obama's, this guy is a major donor to the Democratic Party and to your cause.

He tweeted this morning, quote, if congress gives us the massive tax cuts and reform I'm asking for, those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds. #MAGA. The president went on, it would be really nice if the fake news media would report the virtually unprecedented stock market growth since the election. Need tax cuts. Meaning there's a period there. Need tax cuts. Yes, exclamation point because he might just ran out of characters, Kimberly. I think this is an interesting and good tactic to take the message narrowly to different groups of people. I do think he has one problem and he was pointing to it this morning in his tweets, and that is, he's taking credit for an economy that's doing really well. The unemployment rate down to 4.3 percent, stock market on a tear like record after record, people feeling pretty good about the economy, and yet, when you want tax cuts, you're basically trying to say it's because we have a problem that we need to fix.

You say, 'Let's let this go and run the path.'\" However, what he needs to say, and fashion a great message, which is this is going to give it the boost to go, you know, the rest of the way down the field. Like, this is what we need to continue this period of economic growth and prosperity and to continue to stimulate the economy with more available tax dollars in the hands of Americans, hardworking Americans so that they can spend and put it back into the, you know, financial flow and back into the economy and into the free market, to capitalize on it.

There are families that have saved this money for years who are now dead, and you are essentially digging into their grave and taking money from them.

Of course, the media is hailing it as brave, culling the best lines from this predictable noise. I can't wait for Chris Cuomo's line-by-line analysis, with Fareed Zakaria nodding thoughtfully in agreement. Me, I'm just happy Eminem has moved from threatening his mother or wife. No longer just a misogynist, he's a politically relevant misogynist. Good for him. I guess he learned something from Weinstein. Or \"Winesteen.\" Bottom line, Eminem's peer-approved rap makes \"Morning Joe\" sounded edgy. Not a single thought surprises you. He breaks less ground than a broken shovel. No wonder the media loves it. He's Brian Stelter with hair."

And I thought he put himself out there in a very interesting way and in that cultural divide that you and Dana are discussing, because he was very clear. He thinks this guy is destructive. He thinks that he is not a good president and leading us into World War III.
