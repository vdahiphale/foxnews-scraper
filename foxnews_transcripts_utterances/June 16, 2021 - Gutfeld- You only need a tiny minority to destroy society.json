But setting fire to things is bad, very bad, unless it's one of Hunter's paintings. But we should all condemn arson, correct? Well, not so fast hypothetical viewer I'm having an imaginary conversation with. You haven't heard the story of Daniel Elder, a talented musical artist specializing in left-wing religious music. He made the horrible mistake of publicly scolding arsonists after a George Floyd protests in his hometown of Nashville. It turned violent, resulting in assaults, vandalism and the torching of a historic courthouse. Elder again, a very liberal dude posted this, \"Enjoy joy burning it all down, you well-intentioned blind people. I'm done.\" That sounds like what I say after I use the bathroom. Susan. Then he deleted his Instagram account, and then he was deleted himself. It began the next morning when the online mob caught wind of his offense. How dare you condemn violent lawlessness they seem to say. They spammed his Facebook accusing him of racism, and of course, being a white supremacist piece of garbage, which according to statistics now makes up 85 percent of the country. In fact, you don't even need to be white anymore to be a white supremacist. You could be a black conservative. And if you're Asian, it depends if you're getting beaten up or trying to get into Yale. Hell, you can be a Christmas tree worm, sorry, holiday tree worm. But all you need is a pulse and a wacky desire to not see your neighborhoods burn. But that's not what the story is really about. It's about corporate cowardice. We spend a lot of time on canceled culture here, focusing on the mobs thirst for scalps. Again, my apologies to Liz Warren. But the real ire should be directed at companies who when faced with a mob, toss a scapegoat into their grubby, ghoulish hands, like Pontius Pilate heading Jesus to the Romans. I'm referring to GIA a. It originally stood for Gregorian Institute of America, but now it stands for Groveling Idiotic (BLEEP). GIA is the leading publishers of contemporary Catholic liturgical music. Songs you might find on the Pope's playlist right after all that death metal. I'm not going to pretend that I've ever heard of this company, so I'm not going to say well, I used to be a fan. But damn, I'm no fan now. GIA is an offence to Gregorian monks. They should have taken a vow of silence on this. But when faced with temporary online backlash, what did they do to one of their composers? GIA President Alec Harris and media editor Susan LaBarr contacted Elder and demanded an apology. Even after admitting he did nothing wrong. But they were so spooked by losing money over boycotts that these greedy capitalists actually wrote the gutless apology for him. Here's a sample. \"Over the weekend, I made a post that was insensitive and wrongly worded. I deeply apologize for the anger, offense and harm that this post caused.\" There is no justification for my post. So rather than try to offer an excuse for what was done, I offer a promise for what I will do going forward. I commit to making amends to dialogue. I continue -- I commit to continue educating myself about privilege and bias. My work begins now. All that was missing, him telling his family that they're treating very well to put the unmarked bills in a gym bag. That was a kidnapping reference, audience. Elder said he wouldn't do their sniffling vomitus apology. So the GIA back him up against the temporary bring mob. Nope. They chose the mob dropping him like Bill de Blasio trying to hold the groundhog. They immediately terminated the relationship over his incendiary remarks. Funny how his incendiary remarks are actually worse than actual incendiary action, like arson. So are jokes about O.J. Simpson actually worse than what O.J. Simpson did? Well, only if Jimmy Kimmel is delivering them. I wonder what the angry white male has to say.",

It's about companies who after benefiting from your work at banding with the slightest negative pressure. This is no small crime because in every case in which a person is sacrificed to the hoard of torch toters we assume this hoard is large when it's actually smaller than AOC's book collection. It's the companies that are large but their spines are as weak as weed was in 1992. Fact is, you only need a tiny minority to destroy society. Revolutions are not unleashed by the masses. The masses do it to themselves when faced with an immovable minority. In this case, four tweeters sitting home alone with their 10 cats and zero friends. They could bring a company of thousands to its groveling knees by scaring their cowardly execs. It's a microcosm of all the bloodiest revolutions. It's never tens of millions, but a handful of over educated radicals who get the population cowering. And they run right through them like COVID-19 through a Cuomo-run nursing home. This is the blueprint for revolution and it's tearing through our education system, our government, our businesses. GIA should be ashamed of themselves, and they should apologize. In fact, I'm going to do it for them. We are sorry, we abandoned one of our artists just to protect our bottom line. If Jesus Christ were asked about this mess, what do you think he would say? It wouldn't be sorry if my remarks upset the Pharisees maybe we should have more money changers in the temple. He might say forgive them father, they know not what they do. And under his breath say what a bunch of A-holes.",

But at least they admit the goal of reporting is to make sure criminals don't face consequences. The A.P. will also stop publishing mug shots too. So, no names no faces pretty soon no crime. Maybe they can use a generic picture and just draw Tippy, remember Tippy? I loved Tippie. I could never draw him. After the recent mass shooting in Austin, Texas, their local paper ran and editor's note, \"People have only released a vague description of the suspected shooter as of Saturday morning, the American statesman is not including the description as it is too vague at this time to be useful in identifying the shooter and such publication could be harmful and perpetuating stereotypes.\" That heaven forbid you protect your readers. We can't describe that maniac with an axe. It's unfair to lumberjacks. No wonder crimes out of control. Nationwide gun violence is up 40 percent from a year ago, and here in NYC the numbers nearly 70 percent.

But setting fire to things is bad, very bad, unless it's one of Hunter's paintings. But we should all condemn arson, correct? Well, not so fast hypothetical viewer I'm having an imaginary conversation with. You haven't heard the story of Daniel Elder, a talented musical artist specializing in left-wing religious music. He made the horrible mistake of publicly scolding arsonists after a George Floyd protests in his hometown of Nashville. It turned violent, resulting in assaults, vandalism and the torching of a historic courthouse. Elder again, a very liberal dude posted this, \"Enjoy joy burning it all down, you well-intentioned blind people. I'm done.\" That sounds like what I say after I use the bathroom. Susan. Then he deleted his Instagram account, and then he was deleted himself. It began the next morning when the online mob caught wind of his offense. How dare you condemn violent lawlessness they seem to say. They spammed his Facebook accusing him of racism, and of course, being a white supremacist piece of garbage, which according to statistics now makes up 85 percent of the country. In fact, you don't even need to be white anymore to be a white supremacist. You could be a black conservative. And if you're Asian, it depends if you're getting beaten up or trying to get into Yale. Hell, you can be a Christmas tree worm, sorry, holiday tree worm. But all you need is a pulse and a wacky desire to not see your neighborhoods burn. But that's not what the story is really about. It's about corporate cowardice. We spend a lot of time on canceled culture here, focusing on the mobs thirst for scalps. Again, my apologies to Liz Warren. But the real ire should be directed at companies who when faced with a mob, toss a scapegoat into their grubby, ghoulish hands, like Pontius Pilate heading Jesus to the Romans. I'm referring to GIA a. It originally stood for Gregorian Institute of America, but now it stands for Groveling Idiotic (BLEEP). GIA is the leading publishers of contemporary Catholic liturgical music. Songs you might find on the Pope's playlist right after all that death metal. I'm not going to pretend that I've ever heard of this company, so I'm not going to say well, I used to be a fan. But damn, I'm no fan now. GIA is an offence to Gregorian monks. They should have taken a vow of silence on this. But when faced with temporary online backlash, what did they do to one of their composers? GIA President Alec Harris and media editor Susan LaBarr contacted Elder and demanded an apology. Even after admitting he did nothing wrong. But they were so spooked by losing money over boycotts that these greedy capitalists actually wrote the gutless apology for him. Here's a sample. \"Over the weekend, I made a post that was insensitive and wrongly worded. I deeply apologize for the anger, offense and harm that this post caused.\" There is no justification for my post. So rather than try to offer an excuse for what was done, I offer a promise for what I will do going forward. I commit to making amends to dialogue. I continue -- I commit to continue educating myself about privilege and bias. My work begins now. All that was missing, him telling his family that they're treating very well to put the unmarked bills in a gym bag. That was a kidnapping reference, audience. Elder said he wouldn't do their sniffling vomitus apology. So the GIA back him up against the temporary bring mob. Nope. They chose the mob dropping him like Bill de Blasio trying to hold the groundhog. They immediately terminated the relationship over his incendiary remarks. Funny how his incendiary remarks are actually worse than actual incendiary action, like arson. So are jokes about O.J. Simpson actually worse than what O.J. Simpson did? Well, only if Jimmy Kimmel is delivering them. I wonder what the angry white male has to say."

It's about companies who after benefiting from your work at banding with the slightest negative pressure. This is no small crime because in every case in which a person is sacrificed to the hoard of torch toters we assume this hoard is large when it's actually smaller than AOC's book collection. It's the companies that are large but their spines are as weak as weed was in 1992. Fact is, you only need a tiny minority to destroy society. Revolutions are not unleashed by the masses. The masses do it to themselves when faced with an immovable minority. In this case, four tweeters sitting home alone with their 10 cats and zero friends. They could bring a company of thousands to its groveling knees by scaring their cowardly execs. It's a microcosm of all the bloodiest revolutions. It's never tens of millions, but a handful of over educated radicals who get the population cowering. And they run right through them like COVID-19 through a Cuomo-run nursing home. This is the blueprint for revolution and it's tearing through our education system, our government, our businesses. GIA should be ashamed of themselves, and they should apologize. In fact, I'm going to do it for them. We are sorry, we abandoned one of our artists just to protect our bottom line. If Jesus Christ were asked about this mess, what do you think he would say? It wouldn't be sorry if my remarks upset the Pharisees maybe we should have more money changers in the temple. He might say forgive them father, they know not what they do. And under his breath say what a bunch of A-holes."

But at least they admit the goal of reporting is to make sure criminals don't face consequences. The A.P. will also stop publishing mug shots too. So, no names no faces pretty soon no crime. Maybe they can use a generic picture and just draw Tippy, remember Tippy? I loved Tippie. I could never draw him. After the recent mass shooting in Austin, Texas, their local paper ran and editor's note, \"People have only released a vague description of the suspected shooter as of Saturday morning, the American statesman is not including the description as it is too vague at this time to be useful in identifying the shooter and such publication could be harmful and perpetuating stereotypes.\" That heaven forbid you protect your readers. We can't describe that maniac with an axe. It's unfair to lumberjacks. No wonder crimes out of control. Nationwide gun violence is up 40 percent from a year ago, and here in NYC the numbers nearly 70 percent. Defunding cops didn't help, and crime reporting that says, hey, look out for a guy wearing a thing isn't going to help either.

The FAA has logged 1300 reports of unruly passenger behavior since February, and there's been a lot of speculation as to why there's been an uptick, some blame alcohol, but that's been there before, others blame extended lock downs. Perhaps, this is a sign that we're returning to normal? But it's like my dad used to say to us on vacation, we need a bigger hole to bury gramps. Terrence, is it, you know, people keep talking about the lock downs, is it because we've been apart so long that we can't settle disputes amicably or amiably? I never know which one of those to use."

That satirizes, satirizes the sitcom cliche of fit women married to portly man. Port is a great word. It's a trend that dates back to the honeymooners all the way to Kevin Can Wait, notably not mentioned, of course, Roseanne. Ironically, the satire completely missed the point of the joke. The woman who is beautiful and ethical is the straight person that reacts to the devious and portly man. The Times note an episode of King and Queens where Kevin James who is obese schemes to make sure his wife stays thin. They say the joke is evil and hypocritical. That's the point, you idiots.
