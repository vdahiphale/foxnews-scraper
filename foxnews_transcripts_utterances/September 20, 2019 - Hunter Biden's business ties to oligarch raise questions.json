We need to find out what the president said, what the United States said, and what the president of Ukraine said. Who brought this up? How was it discussed? But in a larger sense a lot of Republicans feel that Democrats and some people in the press are getting spun up for Trump-Russia two. And just like in Trump-Russia one, they are using secret information to try to bring attention to their allegations. There is something really big going on but we can't tell you what it is.

You also had a big \"New Yorker\" expose on Hunter Biden and all of his use of his family connections for personal financial gain. And that story came out and it kind of just went away. So there's a lot that is here, but I do think it is -- not just that, I want to say, also that the Ukraine was meddling in the 2016 election. And that is something the \"POLITICO\" reported a couple years ago and also kind of went away. So we do have interesting issues with Ukraine. A lot of the central characters in the Russia hoax are located in or around their dealings with Ukraine. You have Hunter Biden having some financial problems in Ukraine. So there is something interesting here, but I do think people are not willing to accept the media spin that this is a problem for Donald Trump because we just went through many years of a hoax involving whistleblowers and selectively edited leaks.

Here's the president who has had this fixation on this issue that Ukraine has to investigate Joe Biden, who isn't just some random dude. He's probably going to be his political opponent for reelection in 2020. And at the same time he's pressuring the president, the new president of this fledgling democracy, he's got his hands on $250 million in military aid without which Ukraine might not be able to survive.

Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" Byron, where are we here? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": A couple of things. One, the allegations outlined in this \"Wall Street Journal\" story are serious, they need to be taken seriously. And we need to find out what was said in this phone call or communication. We need to find out what the president said, what the United States said, and what the president of Ukraine said. Who brought this up? How was it discussed? But in a larger sense a lot of Republicans feel that Democrats and some people in the press are getting spun up for Trump-Russia two. And just like in Trump-Russia one, they are using secret information to try to bring attention to their allegations. There is something really big going on but we can't tell you what it is. And so to avoid the torture of two years of Trump-Russia one, we should find out this stuff really soon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, and the House Minority Leader said the DNI is coming up to testify next week. But what's interesting about this, if you want to call it Russia two, is that at the bottom of this phone call as an actual story that deals with Joe Biden and his son that \"The New York Times\" has been kind of digging into for some time. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": You had \"The New York Times\" reporting on this. You also had a big \"New Yorker\" expose on Hunter Biden and all of his use of his family connections for personal financial gain. And that story came out and it kind of just went away. So there's a lot that is here, but I do think it is -- not just that, I want to say, also that the Ukraine was meddling in the 2016 election. And that is something the \"POLITICO\" reported a couple years ago and also kind of went away. So we do have interesting issues with Ukraine. A lot of the central characters in the Russia hoax are located in or around their dealings with Ukraine. You have Hunter Biden having some financial problems in Ukraine. So there is something interesting here, but I do think people are not willing to accept the media spin that this is a problem for Donald Trump because we just went through many years of a hoax involving whistleblowers and selectively edited leaks. And so the burden of proof I think is much higher now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "The burden of proof is high. As I did with the House Minority Leader, if he did eight times say you need to investigate Joe Biden and his son while talking about $250 million in lethal aid to Ukraine, is that a problem that will lead to something on Capitol Hill? CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Yes, indeed. And let's be careful and review what supposedly was going on here. Here's the president who has had this fixation on this issue that Ukraine has to investigate Joe Biden, who isn't just some random dude. He's probably going to be his political opponent for reelection in 2020. And at the same time he's pressuring the president, the new president of this fledgling democracy, he's got his hands on $250 million in military aid without which Ukraine might not be able to survive. And that is a high-pressure situation and not exactly the most appropriate use of presidential authority. That's the worst --"
