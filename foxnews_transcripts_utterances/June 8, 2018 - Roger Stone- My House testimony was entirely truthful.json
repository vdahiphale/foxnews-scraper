Ranking House member of the Intel Committee Adam Schiff claimed last night that Roger Stone lied to the Congress. Tonight Stone will respond exclusively here. Plus President Trump's America First talk is driving the media and allies absolutely bonkers as he heads into these trade talks, very important day. And Friday Follies with Raymond Arroyo features a new art exhibit that is literally full of it. And a rampage video that you must see to believe, it's hysterical, we were screaming in the car about it. Also my exclusive interview with football legend Lou Holtz on the disappearing border between sports and politics. But we begin with the shocking allegation that a New York Times reporter has been in bed, literally, with a source accused of leaking sensitive information. The New York Times says the department of justice has seized the phone and emails records of its reportee Ali Watkins. And according to the paper, she had been in a three year relationship with the former director of security for Senate Intel Committee James Wolfe. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He was arrested yesterday and the DOJ charged him with lying for denying that he even knew the reporter, and for denying he gave her information on former campaign advisor to Trump, Carter Page. Now the Times said it appeared the FBI was investigating how Watkins learned that Russian spies were trying to recruit Page back in 2013. She reported that in an article for Buzz Feed on April 3rd of 2017. There is reporting tonight that there was an effort by this Senate Intel staffer to purposely target Carter Page. That's a move that could have been instrumental in starting this entire probe into the Trump Presidency. Here's how President Trump reacted to the news. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It's very easy to say we are going to give nukes, we're going to liberalise our country but North Korea does not negotiate in good faith, both with the southern citizens and with the international community. So on paper they can do some things that are very simple like ending the Korean War and promising further talks and this and that, and that would look great but you can't trust this man again. Again, he kills members of his own family, and his sister who the press was doting over, was in charge of brain washing children in that country. So this is nation or the beast that we're dealing with.",

But number two, the issue, the constitutional issue is can the government compel him to violate his religious beliefs? There is sufficient federal law that says that they must make a reasonable accommodation if he has religious beliefs. In those cases they're really well established around the country.

Ranking House member of the Intel Committee Adam Schiff claimed last night that Roger Stone lied to the Congress. Tonight Stone will respond exclusively here. Plus President Trump's America First talk is driving the media and allies absolutely bonkers as he heads into these trade talks, very important day. And Friday Follies with Raymond Arroyo features a new art exhibit that is literally full of it. And a rampage video that you must see to believe, it's hysterical, we were screaming in the car about it. Also my exclusive interview with football legend Lou Holtz on the disappearing border between sports and politics. But we begin with the shocking allegation that a New York Times reporter has been in bed, literally, with a source accused of leaking sensitive information. The New York Times says the department of justice has seized the phone and emails records of its reportee Ali Watkins. And according to the paper, she had been in a three year relationship with the former director of security for Senate Intel Committee James Wolfe. He was arrested yesterday and the DOJ charged him with lying for denying that he even knew the reporter, and for denying he gave her information on former campaign advisor to Trump, Carter Page. Now the Times said it appeared the FBI was investigating how Watkins learned that Russian spies were trying to recruit Page back in 2013. She reported that in an article for Buzz Feed on April 3rd of 2017. There is reporting tonight that there was an effort by this Senate Intel staffer to purposely target Carter Page. That's a move that could have been instrumental in starting this entire probe into the Trump Presidency. Here's how President Trump reacted to the news."

If he's referring to the emails that were cited by the Wall Street Journal, that proved that I had no direct contact or source and was using back channel, why those fell outside the precisely worded scope of the Intelligence Committee's request. A scope co-signed by Mr Schiff himself. The real issue here Laura is very clear, Mr Schiff has said that he has seen \"significant evidence of Russian collusion in the 2016 election\".

They tried to tap it into Papadopoulos, that poor hapless figure, that old Carter Page, now he's seen his fortunes go down the tubes because of all this. He's fighting in court, they have these convictions of tertiary figures, except for the deal with Manafort, we'll see where that goes and his associate.

By the way, Oleg Deripaska apparently also wanted to testify. He said he'd testify, he didn't claim he wanted immunity, he wanted to do it in public. The billionaire who they tried to get roped into this collusion thing. He said, it's ridiculous and they wouldn't have him come testify. They haven't brought that Russian lawyer in the Trump Tower meeting, Veselnitskaya.

And he's talking about righting wrongs that have gone on since about since about 1950 in terms of our being taken advantage of in the trade field. So adding this additional basically brilliant ploy, the Russians aren't here and they should be, it's another effort for him to recast the international stage and as I say if he wins, if he succeeds at this, even partially, it embarrasses 30 years of policy makers, talking heads and heads of state in our own country as well as overseas.

Now Michael does this inspire confidence or give you pause, this kind of approach the President took to the debates and he made that point this morning at Marine One, \"Look Hillary was prepping for months, I basically winged it\" He really didn't prepare much, he kind of winged it and went by his gut and I got to say his political gut has been really good on most issues.

What matters is how can we trust them and how can we verify what they are going to promise. It's very easy to say we are going to give nukes, we're going to liberalise our country but North Korea does not negotiate in good faith, both with the southern citizens and with the international community. So on paper they can do some things that are very simple like ending the Korean War and promising further talks and this and that, and that would look great but you can't trust this man again.

She was s Wild Alabama fan which i inherited, no particular reason, she just like Baird Bryant and it was always viewed with the sense of patriotism and love of country, and we're now at a place where an invitation to the White House turns the super bowl champion coach into, you know, a puddle of goo. They're like debating for weeks how to handle it. What has happened in our country?"

Once again they were not going to earn millions of dollars a year by playing professional football, but I think that we get fouled up and what our priorities are. The one thing I always I told our team and I believe they so strong, would not use our football team to promote anything except the university of the Philadelphia Eagles or the New York Jets, whatever the case may be. If you want to promote a cause and use your time and your money, that's fine. The locker room belongs to the players of the NFL. They can say anything they want in there. However the football team on the field belongs to me. We have to be focused on one thing. We're here to win the Super Bowl. Nothing else is matter. I don't want any other distraction unless football team except one focus, I congratulate Coach Peterson (INAUDIBLE) a tremendous job, he lost a great quarterback and yet he still manage to win the Super Bowl. And I'm very proud that he was looking forward to getting to the White House and it's unfortunate the players don't get that experience."

We just have these military sing-alongs at the White House to show how patriotic we are even though we don't know the words. It's just incredible. It is incredible. But I am really proud of people in this country who are recognizing what's happening and instead of turning this into a political game."

      "utterance": "Look, first of all, where is he living. I think Golden State is out around San Francisco, that's probably the view of most people. Laura, I'm an individual, I remember when my father went to the pacific for almost five years and I never saw my father for five years, but fortunately he came back. Many children's fathers didn't come back because they paid the ultimate sacrifice. I've been to Afghanistan, last June I was in Korea at the DMZ zone, go into a hospital in Afghanistan to see people who lost their legs et cetera and yet they still have the love of this country. When you talk about politics, then that is what's coming into this game. If you don't believe in something, and I think that it comes back to saying that President Trump is a racist, I get tired of hearing racist, homophobia, et cetera, for 77 years he did business. He was in the public line. There was never a claim one time about him being a racist. I was in Detroit yesterday, Ben Carson, we're trying to do some things for the disadvantage youth under President Trump's leadership, they had a sign that I thought was great, he said talent equally distributed around the world. Opportunity is on. Let's work to give people an opportunity particularly the young people. But either there been for (INAUDIBLE) this year in the previous year, it's just keep looking at it, is absolutely insane, because we don't focus, we have a problem, because we have a different objective. We might have a difference of opinion of how to make America great, how to give people an opportunity, how to win a championship. Coach Kerr done a tremendous job. He has some great athlete. He also won several championships with his players. Congratulations on that, but when you talk about a political statement, read Steve Kerr's comments, that says it all."

It was packed out and to me that's what it's all about. We put aside politics, it's about the country, and that's the people's house, celebrating the national championship. Lou, it's so great to see you, a huge fan, and come back soon, would you?"

High school teacher in Brownsburg, Indiana, it saying he was forced to resign after he challenge the district's policy on transgender students. That policy requires teachers to address these students by their preferred name instead of their birth name. Teacher John Kluge says that that violates both his religious beliefs and his constitutional rights. I recently spoke to both Mr. Kluge and his attorney, Ross Stovall, and I began by challenging Mr. Stovall on whether the school district really violated the client's rights."

So, if somebody is a teacher of anthropology suddenly wants to get up and talk about his or her view on, you know, Nazism or creationism, and so that is my free speech, oh yes, OK, but you're under contract with the school to teach, you know, Spanish. So you can be fired for that, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSCOE STOVALL, ATTORNEY FOR JOHN KLUGE",
      "utterance": "Right, right, right. Well, yes, to your point, we believe there is a constructive discharge here. That they unreasonably threw out an accommodation that was in place. They actually had a written agreement John to allow John to actually express his convictions by using only last names of all of the students. That reasonable accommodation was tossed out by the administration after the school year. He was told either resigns, he follows the line of the school, using these transgender names that were not as he said the birth names or he will be suspended and then terminated. Those were the choices. That's an (INAUDIBLE) choice. So from the standpoint of our legal position, we believe we have an illegal discharge. That's number one. But number two, the issue, the constitutional issue is can the government compel him to violate his religious beliefs? There is sufficient federal law that says that they must make a reasonable accommodation if he has religious beliefs. In those cases they're really well established around the country. We believe this is a new one, though, because it deals with an insidious effort by a governmental entity, if you will, a school paid by taxpayer funds. So we see this as a different wrinkle and we've seen before in the cases coming up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the studies on transgenderism are very difficult. First of all, there is no real long, you know, peer-reviewed study that we can look at whether hormone blockers, we don't need to get into that, it's not relevant here. But all I say is that there's a really explosive growth in kids calling themselves transgender. And just in the British study, they went from I think it's 94 referrals as gender dysphoria, the technical term from 2009-2010. 94 at this clinic to now between 2016-2107, 1,986 referrals including some of those where children younger than six years of age. Now, well, a lot of people are believing, thinking that this could be gender affirming treatments are actually encouraging kids who call themselves transgender, most grow out of it. That's just the way it is. Most o them grow out of it. But also other studies, adolescent health journal saying that they are two to three more times likely to suffer from depression, suicide, other mental disorders, very difficult. So John, are you acting in part out of concern for these kids thinking that they're getting bad advice from their parents or others?"
