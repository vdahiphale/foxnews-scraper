And Mayorkas this weekend when he's asked about what are you doing to prevent this from happening in the future knowing that we have thousands more people. We're in South America coming up now because they know the door is open, that thousands of people are being released into the country. And he doesn't give any solution. And if you go back to the campaign trail, Joe Biden said in August of 2019 we can absorb two million people a year in this country. So when we're looking for solutions, when you look at the Democrats and they were asked if they would give free health care to illegal immigrants, they are perfectly fine with this. So, when the question of, is this going to continue, what is the solution? They don't want any solutions to this problem. And in terms of the whip gate hoax, it wasn't just a miscommunication between branches about them changing their language. This is very clearly a strategy to scapegoat and accuse border patrol agents doing their job to distract away from the fact that there were thousands of people under the bridge. And the big question is, well who suffers here? American suffer. Border town suffer. Why is there two sets of rules for American citizens? So, if you trespass you get prosecuted for that, but if you trespassed into the country. One final point. There's been this talking point from people like Congresswoman Waters that these are just people seeking asylum from Haiti. They've had it rough.

So that's -- I mean, Democrats are pointing that out as well. And so, the thing that Chris Wallace push I thought with the best thing he got out of him was, sir, why did you ever let them across the border to begin with. When you go back to say, well, in 2019 this, and 2018 that, the difference was the remain in Mexico policy because something that border patrol will tell you, people on horses and Texans will tell you is those migrants don't have any more right to be in Mexico than they do here. So once they are here, we can't just push them back across the border, and that's why it was so important for border patrol officers that the tools they need to stop people from getting across that river and under that bridge to begin with, trying to take advantage of our system. Our own reporters are showing their paperwork that shows that they've been wherever they've been in and shows their residency in South American companies, they're ripping them up and throwing them away before they get to the border and say, I'm a Haitian migrant, you can't send them back to Haiti because it's a mess right now. And so, they are taking advantage of our whole system that Democrats have worked really hard to give them that opportunity to do. And it's nothing against those people but it's everything to do with the people in this country and the people that I know in Dalton, Georgia, that came here from South American countries, some of them were illegal and then their kids became DACA and some of them are naturalized. And the fact that once you get here and you live in the shadows and the system you never are a part of the American dream. And that's why it's important to develop an immigration system that lets people become part of the American dream, otherwise it's just a class system. And you're warning, as Democrats invite people into a worst scenario almost because now, you're living in the shadows, threw your four families to a home, sending most of your money back to Mexico for Mexican migrants.

It's also masking in schools is working. The CDC just put out a new study in 18 counties, kids who had to be masked, half the rate of COVID infection than those who were unmasked. So, mandates are working. But Dr. Marty Makary was just on in the previous hour and he wrote a Washington Post piece about this.

Now after clearing that area out DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas now admitting that most of them actually came to the United States.

They know we know they're lying and yet they still live. It's like, everybody knows you made the story up, OK? We have the photos.

How many lumps he wants? I don't know, three or four. He's like, how many people are in the country? He goes, I don't know, 10,000, 12,000 or it could be more. Like that's a big arrow, right? It's like imagine like Dana is doing the show with Bill and like, what time do you get out? I don't know, you get out at nine, but maybe nine, 10, maybe nine. Like your only job, my man, your only job is to know who's in the homeland. You're the secretary of homeland security.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well, and the left is driving border policy for the Democratic Party. I mean, it's very clear. And Mayorkas this weekend when he's asked about what are you doing to prevent this from happening in the future knowing that we have thousands more people. We're in South America coming up now because they know the door is open, that thousands of people are being released into the country. And he doesn't give any solution. And if you go back to the campaign trail, Joe Biden said in August of 2019 we can absorb two million people a year in this country. So when we're looking for solutions, when you look at the Democrats and they were asked if they would give free health care to illegal immigrants, they are perfectly fine with this. So, when the question of, is this going to continue, what is the solution? They don't want any solutions to this problem. And in terms of the whip gate hoax, it wasn't just a miscommunication between branches about them changing their language. This is very clearly a strategy to scapegoat and accuse border patrol agents doing their job to distract away from the fact that there were thousands of people under the bridge. And the big question is, well who suffers here? American suffer. Border town suffer. Why is there two sets of rules for American citizens? So, if you trespass you get prosecuted for that, but if you trespassed into the country. One final point. There's been this talking point from people like Congresswoman Waters that these are just people seeking asylum from Haiti. They've had it rough. Well, the facts are that they were -- they went for asylum in South America and have been living South America for years after claiming asylum. They are coming here because the door is open, which is --"

So that's -- I mean, Democrats are pointing that out as well. And so, the thing that Chris Wallace push I thought with the best thing he got out of him was, sir, why did you ever let them across the border to begin with. When you go back to say, well, in 2019 this, and 2018 that, the difference was the remain in Mexico policy because something that border patrol will tell you, people on horses and Texans will tell you is those migrants don't have any more right to be in Mexico than they do here. So once they are here, we can't just push them back across the border, and that's why it was so important for border patrol officers that the tools they need to stop people from getting across that river and under that bridge to begin with, trying to take advantage of our system. Our own reporters are showing their paperwork that shows that they've been wherever they've been in and shows their residency in South American companies, they're ripping them up and throwing them away before they get to the border and say, I'm a Haitian migrant, you can't send them back to Haiti because it's a mess right now. And so, they are taking advantage of our whole system that Democrats have worked really hard to give them that opportunity to do. And it's nothing against those people but it's everything to do with the people in this country and the people that I know in Dalton, Georgia, that came here from South American countries, some of them were illegal and then their kids became DACA and some of them are naturalized. And the fact that once you get here and you live in the shadows and the system you never are a part of the American dream. And that's why it's important to develop an immigration system that lets people become part of the American dream, otherwise it's just a class system. And you're warning, as Democrats invite people into a worst scenario almost because now, you're living in the shadows, threw your four families to a home, sending most of your money back to Mexico for Mexican migrants. It's a mess and they know it."

It's also masking in schools is working. The CDC just put out a new study in 18 counties, kids who had to be masked, half the rate of COVID infection than those who were unmasked. So, mandates are working. But Dr. Marty Makary was just on in the previous hour and he wrote a Washington Post piece about this.

Biden and everyone have been pushing these vaccine mandates, these hospitals are regulated. Do you not think they are afraid of what's going to happen? And secondly, that mask study. If I hear one more person cite this dope mask that did. Did you read it? That's not what the mask study said. It's clear right there. Everyone go right now, please.

It's not my right or job to tell her if she gets the vaccine or not, but she knows life and death pretty well and she knows taking care of people pretty well. She's been through the worse of it.

And what is she going to say or her accomplishments for the last four years that are going to get her out of a huge primary field because I assume it won't be 18 or 21, but it'll be more than -- more than one."

They didn't want that someone that ambitious. I mean that's what at least leaked out in the media. I mean, is this -- is this -- is that the best idea to hire someone --"

      "utterance": "Well, I think he also was looking for someone who would have show some institutional experience, somebody like a steady hand on the tiller, that kind of guy. And he was a very good vice president for him. If you're thinking about loyalty to Obama, whatever it was, yes, sir, Mr. President, he got it done. This situation I think is very curious because she was the first to drop out in the Democratic primary. And now she's hired another image consultant. To me, she might want to consider asking them what are the root causes of her likability problems and her political problems. That is actually a little bit more concerning. You can't blame the communicators for everything. They are -- the communicators are not at fault at all of this. The other thing that's very strange to me is that she's not negotiating this 3.5 trillion, right? She was -- she was in the Senate. Why isn't she there talking to all of her former colleagues trying to get this done? Like, that that major job, they didn't give to her."

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "If she wants an image makeover, she should do what a vice president does. They should let her be the bulldog for the administration. I mean, you know, friendly Uncle Joe was kind of the thing before we all realized how absent-minded he is. She's absent. Bring her back in and let her just attack, attack, attack. But unfortunately, Jen Psaki and President Biden does a pretty good job of that. You know, when the President stands up there and says we're going to make them pay, you don't think he means a bunch of kids and some aid workers in Afghanistan, right? And so, let her go be the bulldog."

    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "I don't think she had ever any intention of actually solving that problem, first of all. But I would say to address Dana's question of what is the root cause of her unlikability. The Vice President's problems are created by the Vice President. I mean it's very difficult to hire an image consultant to change things when you have a background of having no real principles or policy positions that you stand on. And if you look at the primary, the perfect example of this was when Bernie Sanders did a CNN town hall and he was asked, do you think that felons should be able to vote from prison including the Boston bomber, and he said yes. Kamala Harris came out after that and was asked the same question and she just followed his lead which got her into a whole bunch of trouble. And so, I don't think that no matter who you hire in terms of an image consultant, based on the fact that she has no real principles, she's not going to improve."

We're going to have Judge Jeanine and Larry Gatlin. I have no idea how that's going to turn out. I would wear ear plugs or double -- and then on the next day, we have Candace Owens who is part of the Daily Wire and does her show down here in Nashville. She's amazing. Pete Hegseth -- so, you see it's like a weird combination. We have -- oh, and then we have somebody named Dana Perino. She's going to be on probably towards the end of the week, with Kathie Lee Gifford. So, that should be interesting. Let's hope one of them is sober."

And there's like no food except for like -- it's kind of interesting. I'm surprised in Nashville. But obviously, there's obviously some great food. I had the world's greatest cheeseburger at a place -- at the bar called the Listening Room. That's where we are tonight and all week.

So, they -- I think they have to like -- they only need to have a few drinks before the show starts.

He was a teacher and he taught like FFA, you know -- FAA, excuse me. Future Farmers of America, excuse me, not FAA -- FFA, and was livestock judge. He won numerous awards throughout his career. He was very active in the community. I know he was loved by many because I spent a lot of my summers and Christmases with him. His aunt Donna is my aunt and her sister barb with a his mother and his sister was Marney. And we spent a lot of time growing up together. And I just want to send you all so much love and strength.

And so, obviously I have one of those. And they bring them in and we're going to go to West Point. I don't even have the full itinerary. I'm going to be a part of this next week.
