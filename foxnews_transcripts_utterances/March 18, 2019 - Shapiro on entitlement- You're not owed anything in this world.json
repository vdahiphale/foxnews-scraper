The President's opponents have spent the last 72 hours calling him, a white nationalist. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson is here with an exclusive to defend the President and tell us a lot of other things about what's happened at his department and Ben Shapiro has a new book out tomorrow and is making his first stop here at \"The Ingraham Angle.\" His reaction to \"The Entitlement Generation\" fostered by the left plus a new national poll that half of the respondents believe that Mueller -- the Mueller probe is politically motivated and yes, it's a witch hunt. The man who ran the Clinton probe, Ken Starr and his deputy in that case, Sol Wisenberg are here to explain why. But first the scourge of Generation 'E,' that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.

      "utterance": "Of course, it was easier hanging out with your friends and emoting about saving the planet and chanting really badly or studying let's say, the federalist papers or doing your physics lab. Well, come on, that's an easy answer especially when schools excuse the absences, teachers themselves are encouraging the protests or that it is overwhelmingly left wing and college admissions, well, they undoubtedly count activism as a legitimate extracurricular activity. And naturally, members of Generation E believe he or she should get into the best colleges, even if he or she does not have the best grades or the best course. And they develop by the way, this warped view of their own self-importance because Mommy and Daddy raised them to believe that they were special, really special. Special in every extra special way. Come on, these are parents who hung their kids soccer participation metals on the bulletin board in the kitchen, they helped them write their term papers, they help them do their science projects. How else would an 8 year old kid know how to design his own homework app. And as a college admissions fraud story revealed, these are the types of parents who even commit crimes to guarantee their kids have doors open for them. I think it's important to ask this tonight, what's the end result here? Well, many of these young people and it's not just the wealthy kids grow up to be demanding entitled adults and even ingrates and at a time when American students are falling behind in science and math and reading, more and more kids at the same time here are indulged and even encouraged to become political activists before they've even earned their first pay check. According to one assessment out of 71 countries, the US was 38th place in math and 24th science. But forget about mastering things like math or science or life skills such as manners or self-reliance or speaking and writing ability. And why bother with all that, when society celebrates you for being a punk with a political point of view. Oh, case and point. At the university of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, grad students are now demanding that the school remove ICE and border patrol job listings from their career services platform. Why?"

Well, that's when the praise from celebs starts coming in. Actor Armie Hammer in an interview today said, \"I love that guy. I hope he inspires copycats. Everyone should be like egg boy. Everyone. Egg boy should get together with pyjama boy, it'll be fun. All right, think about the Covington Catholic kid, Nick Sandman, he just stood still and the elites like Armie Hammer and others like accused that kid of being a racist in a provocateur. But in the Australia case, they take the kids side because the politician, he assaulted albeit with an egg, was himself far right. So if the target is someone not telling the social justice line, it's okay to assault him, even have copycats. And if it's gotten worse though than this because now, the activists are even feeding on their own. When Chelsea Clinton showed up at NYU to pay her respects after that horrific slaughter in New Zealand, a member of Generation E didn't thank her. She confronted her."

Activists though are in our schools and they're aggressively propagandizing, Hollywood and even churches do as well and what they're selling is a political world view that numbs the young to socialism. That's the end game. It's an exercise in wealth confiscation that will leave us less free, less prosperous and less tied to that age old American value that hard work makes the man. Oh, well, though I feel offended that I just said man, you are an honorary member of Generation E. You're entitled to your opinion but I'm not entitled or required to celebrate it.

We know that there is no free money. All right, it doesn't grow on trees. If there's a redistribution of wealth, that means it's coming from businesses and other dynamics that are supposed to be creating jobs, creating income, right -- allowing people to live lives that best suit them. There's an interesting disconnect here. And I -- look, who doesn't really want? -- If you can go and live on a paradise island and have everything you wanted at the snap of the fingers, you know you'd be Elizabeth Montgomery I guess in Bewitched. Who wouldn't want that? The fact is though that these kids have been abandoned, these young people have by adults who know that that's not possible, who knows that life and work is something very, very different and so they're using these young people but at the same time, the Democrats don't have really anything else to offer. The economy is good, we see what the President Trump economy and mission has accomplished force and the Democrats do I have to stand for something else but you can only argue for these things when the economy is good, I mean, that's the irony here.

Oh, my next guest has become a sensation touring colleges across the country and offering the very message that I stressed in tonight's Angle. Joining me now, Ben Shapiro, Editor in Chief of 'The Daily Wire' and author of the brand new book, \"The Right Side of History\" in stores tomorrow. All right Ben, I want to begin with what we were talking about earlier and it dub-tails into everything you've write about in your book. The emergent merging politics of grievance and entitlement, Generation E. Your thoughts on how to best thwart this, combat this, cure this."

The fact is that freedom comes along with the duty to achieve and you're not owed anything in this world, why should you perceive yourself to be to owed to a college slot? Why should your parents give you everything? That that sort of mentality is foreign to a lot of the bases for western civilization and the basis for America, this idea that we were supposed to go forth and conquer, that we were supposed to forge into the wilderness and we're supposed to build something out there, that sort of mentality unfortunately has been abandoned in favor of this grievance culture as you suggest, that says we're owed something from the world and if we don't get it, it's because the system has failed us well."

It's demonstrative of how subjective feeling have taken the place of objective facts. What Chelsea Clinton had to say about Ilhan Omar was basic objective fact, she was speaking anti-Semitism, Chelsea Clinton called her out on that and somehow she's now responsible for the Christchurch shooting because she did all of that but that's how some people feel and therefore it becomes the truth and they've been told that that right and that they're special and that they are -- they're wonderful individuals because they go to places like NYU.

Every single person in western civilization who saw that and was a decent person, was appalled by that slaughter obviously and the attempt to immediately jump into the manifesto of the killer and then give it the broadest possible coverage by the media, to do exactly what the killer wanted, which was to generate all sorts of political controversy in an attempt to tear apart western civilization is really quite despicable. And one of the things that I thought was so fascinating if you actually take a look at the manifesto which I would recommend everyone should not but if you actually take a look, what the killer does is, he says essentially western civilization is white people and what you see from the intersection left is a similar perception of what western civilization. Western civilization is a hierarchical system of racial domination, that's not what the West is at all which is why we all as civilized human beings, mourn the slaughter of innocent people, no matter what their religion, living in our civilization."

I just spoke at University of Michigan last week. We had a 1000 people in the audience and 6000 people on the waitlist, that's not because I'm something special, it's because there really is a hunger for a different point of view at a lot of these campuses, that's being shielded from by the administration."

Here with answers, Glen Greenwald, founder of the Intercept. Glen, great to see you like you notice that hardly any of the democratic Presidential candidates and the list is growing seemingly by the day, they even mentioned Trump and Russia so is a reality finally sinking into the Democrats or some of these new polls about Mueller, really what they're thinking about."

To the exclusion of virtually everything else, which is not just the claim that Trump colluded with Russia but that Russia actually controls Donald Trump in some sort of you know, in some sort of Clancy, kind of espionage way as a result of blackmail or other kinds of leverage. That disappeared from the winning campaigns in 2018 because they know that people don't wake up in the morning worried about Putin and the 2020 candidates now see that the wheels are falling off the cart of the Mueller investigation and barely mention it at all in recognition of that fact."

Now, if that were true at all, if Robert Mueller had any evidence of that and hasn't shown it to us, he would almost be guilty of treason. And if Nancy Pelosi really believes that Donald Trump is serving the interest of Russia and decides, oh, we are going to just take our time in removing him from control over the nuclear arsenal and the executive branch and the military until we feel like we are ready to do it, you would wonder, does Putin have something on Pelosi, too? Why would you leave in place somebody controlled by the Kremlin for two years if you really believed, if you have evidence for it?

He's only been in office for two months. There's incredible amounts of concrete, tangible evidence that has been publicly disclosed linking him to the world's worst paramilitary gangs and extrajudicial murderers in the country. That's what a real scandal looks like. Instead in the U.S., we have two years of speculation and conspiracy theorizing and all kinds of espionage fantasies that the Democrats are now realizing is never going to come to fruition. Mueller has not indicted one American for the crime of collaborating with the Russians, and people don't think he's going to."

The president chooses to do the attacks himself. And there's no question, it erodes the confidence, especially as time goes on. And the indictments, even though there have been indictments and criminal pleas and so forth, guilty pleas, nonetheless there has not been an indictment that points specifically to collusion. So I think fatigue, but also just the effect of the president's attacks."

A lot of people in the office, not all of them, but a good chunk, will put up a graphic, donated by Democrats.  That's dispositive about how they're going to handle the case, but I think that was one of the facts that drove people to think, this might not be all that fair in the end.

So something has happened since October. Maybe fatigue, maybe the cumulative effort of things like the way Roger Stone was taken down, I don't know. But I do think it's important to point out that Bob Mueller will be no more affected by the polls then we were. Also, he's got a long way to go before he's as low as we were. We were only two points ahead of Saddam Hussein."

And by the way, there were some real truth seekers, as you know, Laura, Souceman (ph) of \"The Washington Post,\" Jeff Gerth of \"The New York Times.\" But you're right. Overall it was really a very ugly. So we were just determined to try to do our job as best as we can. But to come back to your point about the partisanship and what Rudy calls the 13 angry Democrats and so forth, I wouldn't use those terms, but I will say this. In light of the criticism that these were very active -- some of them were very active, then you need to take steps to provide confidence on the part of the public, may be skeptical members of the public, that this is not politically inspired. So that's one of the reasons, just very briefly, we hired Sam Dash of Watergate fame, a Democrat, to come on board and to give us his advice and counsel. He approved of every word of the referral that we made to the House of Representatives. We do not have those kinds of assurances from Bob."

But when he's talked about this investigation, I've said this before, he acts like somebody who has something to hide. So it'll be incredibly ironic if there is no, ultimately no collusion case and no obstruction case against him. But keep in mind, when you attack relentlessly prosecution teams, they are human. And they feel it. They try to be professional to it, as much as they try to, they feel it. And any toss-ups in that report by Mueller and his team I think are going to go against the president.

We only have 330 million people. China and India have four times that many people. We will never be able to compete with them unless we learn to develop our people, and I think we understand that."

So adjusting to that, but not adjusting to the point where you can capitulate to that. Trying to change it. We brought into HUD now a CFO. We didn't have a CFO for eight-and-a-half years. Can you imagine with the billions of dollars flowing through there?  So there was really not the kind of fiscal control that you would expect.  Now we have that. We are bringing in the kinds of controls that actually will allow us to give more freedom to the various jurisdictions because we can keep track of where the money is and how it's being used and what the timelines are. All of those things are changing. We are upgrading our I.T. systems. We still have a good ways to go, but we are making progress there."

It was extremely enjoyable. And you had a great deal of freedom. And you a lot of influence because I was speaking a lot more at that time. But what we are doing is also incredibly important."
