When she arrived to the courthouse, Felicity Huffman was smiling him look calm, but appearing before the judge Huffman was nervous and tearful, apologizing to the students and parents and colleges impacted by her actions saying she was deeply ashamed and did more damage than she ever imagined. Huffman attributed her actions in part to the bewilderment of being a mother. But the prosecutor shot right back saying motherhood does not make you a cheat and a felon. In handing down the sentence, the judge agreed that trying to be a good mom was no excuse saying the college system is already distorted by money and privilege and yet for Huffman that wasn't enough so she took one more advantage for her child. But the judge also noted that Huffman immediately accepted responsibility, is not a threat to her community and has apparently regained her moral compass. So along with serving two weeks in prison, that's the sentence, Huffman will pay a $30,000 fine, perform 250 hours of community service, and serve a year probation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The judge noted that without this sentence, the community around Huffman would ask why she got away with it. The actress is hoping to serve her time in an all-women's low-security prison in Northern California famous for housing people like the Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss and Patty Hearst. After leaving the courthouse, Huffman said there are no excuses or justifications for her actions, period. And she hopes her family friends and community will forgive her. Remember, Huffman is the first parent to be sentenced in the college admission scandal. Full House star Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband are charged with paying a half-million dollars to bribe their daughters into USC. They've pled not guilty and are fighting the allegations but are also facing up to 40 years in prison. Some legal experts say that even if Loughlin ultimately decides to cut a deal, she and her husband are facing a lot more jail time than Felicity Huffman. Ed?",

But we start with chief breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher again with the back story highlighted in a new Fox Nation documentary called Runway of Hope: A 9/11 story. Good to see you again, Trace.",

A few hours later, passengers and pilots vividly remember walking into the airport terminal and seeing it lined with tables, of cooked food, a buffet for 7,000. Those who were there say they were astonished how people from Gander treated people from 90 different countries, like long lost friends, and how the hospitality lasted for almost a week. Kevin Tuerff knows he'll never be able to pay back the people of Gander but he decided he could pay it forward. So, on the first anniversary of 9/11, Tuerff who owned an ad agency told his employees to team up. He gave each team $100 to spend, helping others and asked the teams to come back at the end of the day and share their stories. Turf says the stories were inspiring, heartrending, and magical. Pay it forward spread to other companies even the cast and crew of the Broadway show \"Come from Away.\" They took up the challenge, Tuerff says, Come from Away is more than a Broadway show, it's a movement like the rest of what he has done.

      "utterance": "Thank you. All right, breaking tonight, it appears we're finally getting closer to the point where justice may finally come to former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, and possibly, former top officials like James Comey. Word breaking tonight that the DOJ inspector general's report on whether or not they abuse their powers to target the Trump campaign is now in the hands of the attorney general. The news coming on the heels of another story, saying McCabe is possibly edging closer to being indicted. Raising questions what this means for the deep state tonight and one time officials like McCabe, Comey, and all of them. Good night -- good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum. It's good to be back on “The Story.” Remember for months now, the I.G. has been proving the FISA warrants at the center of the FBI's Trump surveillance. Yes, those FISA warrants that relied heavily on an unverified anti-Trump dossier, compiled by a man who was hired by Fusion GPS, and a firm funded by the Clinton campaign, and yes, the DNC. And to the man deeply involved in that surveillance, Andy McCabe. The federal indictment reportedly breathing down his neck as he finally ready to talk and maybe turn on others. After all, though McCabe once enjoyed a pretty close relationship with his former boss, James Comey, The Washington Post, at one time referred to them as venerated G-man who worked hand in glove if seemed to split as the story heats up with Comey, even indicating months ago, he may eventually testify against McCabe."

      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION",

Plus, this looming I.G. report mean we're about to see the unraveling of what Trump allies believe was basically a failed coup attempt against the president.

What does that mean, for example, for the prosecutor in Connecticut who has been looking at possible indictments of former Obama officials?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, that's all going on, on two tracks at the same time, Ed. So, I think that there's been coordination at the Justice Department between what Inspector General Horowitz is doing, and what the U.S. Attorney John Durham, who is looking into the origins of the investigation is doing. They've worked this out in a coordination fashion, no doubt. And it probably -- it's the end of a phase of Horowitz's investigation, but I don't know that it will impact Durham's work much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "And then, what about McCabe and the fact that we're hearing that might be closer to him being indicted for basically lying. When he was one of the FBI officials going after General Flynn and others, and saying send them to jail for lying, now, he may be in trouble himself."

    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

And frankly, when you look at Horowitz's report on the full statements allegedly made by McCabe, it doesn't look like a minimal case to me. But, I think, because you have this hovering issue of whether we have a two-tiered justice system where the connected get a break."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "What about the question I raised at the top about his relationship, Andy McCabe with James Comey? Comey, himself saying, \"Look, at some point, I may have to testify against McCabe. They were the top two officials at the FBI, as you know better than anyone. If McCabe does get indicted, does he start singing about what James Comey really did?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple of things there and I think that when Comey made the statement that he might be a witness, he was simply stating a fact on the circumstances where he did not want to make a public statement about the investigation of McCabe because he might be in the position of having to testify if McCabe gets indicted and that case goes to trial."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "That simply true. I think as far as, you know, what their relative positions in the investigation are concerned, obviously, if there were charges against McCabe, just like there are charges against anyone that creates a higher incentive to be cooperative."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "But, it's hard to say because we don't know what's going on behind the scenes. We don't know what the Comey camp is telling the various investigations. We don't know what McCabe's people have been telling them. So, it's a little speculative to lay that out."
    },

      "utterance": "So -- yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, last question, you wrote a column in National Review, suggesting, look, the president's attacks on Andy McCabe could backfire because if -- and I stress, \"If McCabe is indicted, he is going to face a probably a pretty liberal jury -- grand jury in Washington, D.C. that may - - you know, not be friendly to the president, obviously. On the other hand -- I've got 30 seconds. Does the president have some sense of vindication tonight as we hear this news about McCabe and the alleged lies? As well as this I.G. report? This is some of the president has been talking about for months and months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, I wouldn't spike the football until it actually happened. And I do think that the reason that the false statements case against McCabe might be attractive to the Justice Department is because the facts of it really don't have to do anything with President Trump, it has to do with him leaking the existence of the Clinton Foundation, and then, lying about it. So, I think, they're better off with a case like that, than one in which the president was a major presence."

You know, on the day that Jim Comey was fired, Peter Strzok sent a text message Lisa Page, saying we better get that case open, we've been talking about while Andy is the acting director of the FBI, the very next day, Andrew McCabe opens the obstruction of justice investigation into the president. That is where that investigation begin. Andrew McCabe is also the very same person who took to Hillary Clinton e- mail investigation out of the hands of the D.C. field office and put it in the hands of the senior leadership team where politics appeared to be more at play. So, central to both of those investigations, now, McCabe appears to be potentially at the business, and of an indictment for his false statements where he was trying to shape the media narrative regarding how the FBI and the Department of Justice were impacting on the -- were interacting on the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation."
    },

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "But Congressman, haven't we heard this before and so, I wonder what is going to be different this time?

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Recent reporting indicates that McCabe's lawyers made their last- ditch appeal to the senior leadership of the Department of Justice to receive special or different treatment, maybe because McCabe at served at the FBI. The reporting indicates that the Department of Justice is going to apply the law equally to everyone. That means Andrew McCabe, that means the president, and I think that the right standard. But here, the facts have Andrew McCabe, they had the rights. He lied to Comey, he lied to the inspector general, and he lied to the internal affairs investigators, who had determined that he had authorized the release of information that disclosed the work that was being done regarding the Clinton Foundation."

For the next ten years which according to some of them is the last ten years of humanity, here's how we do it. Half the country, the Liberals live without electricity, without cars, without bear planes, without any oil, which means without any plastics. They get rid of it all. Those of us who are conservative, we rib eyes, we drive cars, we fly in planes, we have motorboats. And after ten years, let's see which of us, which half of America is happier.

I don't know what was laughable about what Elizabeth Warren said when she's talking about moving to electric cars. That's something that we've already seen happening. We've seen individual states, some conservative ones including Texas for instance that loves their wind power, making the changes that they need to for a growing workforce, first of all, that needs those jobs but also to make sure that we have a sustainable planet. I want to rig up something that's really important since everyone is focused on votes. There are 24 million Gen Z's that are going to go to the polls in 2020. They don't think it's a laughing matter, Governor Huckabee. And I know the Republicans are doing their best to alienate all young people in this country.

And so when I hear this from Elizabeth Warren, she's talking about a multi- trillion-dollar transformation. So these people are going to not be able to buy a Tesla at $90,000 or hydrogen fuel-cell at $150,000. So there's no information how we're going to afford this, how we're going to transform the whole of American auto fleet. I personally use a car about ten percent of the time of a 24-hour cycle, so that's not a very good investment to junk an entire fleet to do this. And I have one last -- you know, I'm kind of cynical because every time Elizabeth Warren proposes something, she adds the word regulatory or regularly. And she said that about straws and fracking and so-called assault weapons and what does that mean? Does that mean getting Congress in a bipartisan fashion to pass a bill and have a president sign it or does that mean an administrative state passes that by fit?"

When you're the President of the United States of America talking this morning about light bulbs and how they make him look more orange or whatever he was saying, you see that only one party is actually serious about dealing with climate change. So I don't see it as backfiring. Folks who are anti-regulation don't see the worth of it. They weren't going to vote for us anyway.

When she arrived to the courthouse, Felicity Huffman was smiling him look calm, but appearing before the judge Huffman was nervous and tearful, apologizing to the students and parents and colleges impacted by her actions saying she was deeply ashamed and did more damage than she ever imagined. Huffman attributed her actions in part to the bewilderment of being a mother. But the prosecutor shot right back saying motherhood does not make you a cheat and a felon. In handing down the sentence, the judge agreed that trying to be a good mom was no excuse saying the college system is already distorted by money and privilege and yet for Huffman that wasn't enough so she took one more advantage for her child. But the judge also noted that Huffman immediately accepted responsibility, is not a threat to her community and has apparently regained her moral compass. So along with serving two weeks in prison, that's the sentence, Huffman will pay a $30,000 fine, perform 250 hours of community service, and serve a year probation. The judge noted that without this sentence, the community around Huffman would ask why she got away with it. The actress is hoping to serve her time in an all-women's low-security prison in Northern California famous for housing people like the Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss and Patty Hearst. After leaving the courthouse, Huffman said there are no excuses or justifications for her actions, period. And she hopes her family friends and community will forgive her. Remember, Huffman is the first parent to be sentenced in the college admission scandal. Full House star Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband are charged with paying a half-million dollars to bribe their daughters into USC. They've pled not guilty and are fighting the allegations but are also facing up to 40 years in prison. Some legal experts say that even if Loughlin ultimately decides to cut a deal, she and her husband are facing a lot more jail time than Felicity Huffman. Ed?"

Now with that said, Joe Biden does not do well in the debate format and the problem is that if he becomes president, he's going to spend the next four years of his life in the debate style setting where he's going to have to think quick on his feet and defend his policy."

The better question was in effect of line of attack. And no, because the delivery wasn't effective.

Seven thousand scared, confused people from 90 different countries were diverted to that tiny town of Gander where they were welcomed with very open arms by the community in a remarkable show of compassion on a tough day.

But minutes after word got out, residents began opening their homes, their schools, their hearts. And it wasn't just shelter. They needed food, and water, a thousand different things. A few hours later, passengers and pilots vividly remember walking into the airport terminal and seeing it lined with tables, of cooked food, a buffet for 7,000. Those who were there say they were astonished how people from Gander treated people from 90 different countries, like long lost friends, and how the hospitality lasted for almost a week. Kevin Tuerff knows he'll never be able to pay back the people of Gander but he decided he could pay it forward. So, on the first anniversary of 9/11, Tuerff who owned an ad agency told his employees to team up. He gave each team $100 to spend, helping others and asked the teams to come back at the end of the day and share their stories. Turf says the stories were inspiring, heartrending, and magical. Pay it forward spread to other companies even the cast and crew of the Broadway show \"Come from Away.\" They took up the challenge, Tuerff says, Come from Away is more than a Broadway show, it's a movement like the rest of what he has done.

And then -- because back there, there were no cell phones with international service, there was no Google. And so, we sat and waited. And five hours later, the pilot did come on we are on Air France plane and he said in broken English that the World Trade Center had collapsed. Nobody had believed it. Nobody believed it. And so --"
