      "utterance": "Of course, the long-term solution for this is energy independence and a shift to renewable energy here in this country. There are lots of things that are way more under our control than the dynamics of global oil markets at a time when an oil producing country is going to war."

And if you are unhappy, and if inflation is hurting your family big time, or if you are a trucker, you are paying twice as much, just wait 20 years and we'll be OK. We'll be fine. We'll make the transition. This won't do. And the alternative of going after this dirty oil, this oil from these dictators, is impossible. We can do it here. We were doing it here for heaven's sake. And fine, make the transition, but don't make the transition at a time when people are suffering so badly, so deeply. Joe Biden thinks the American people are not only out of money but out of memory that they think this is all Putin. They know who started this. They know who is responsible. I'll use the word again."

      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Inflation defeats presidents. And even if it isn't Joe Biden's fault, it is his problem. There is inflation all over the world. Gas prices, energy prices are up all over the world. All of that isn't Joe Biden's fault. But he is the party in power, and he is going to pay a political price for it. They did try to make a shift. Democrats felt that maybe the ban on Russian oil and gas could help them kind of shift the politics around, inflation at the pump, Putin's price hike. But it's going to be tough. And polls show people say even if prices go up, they are still in favor of this oil and gas ban. Sure, that's what they say now, but three, four, five, six, seven months from now, we don't know if they will be as willing to sacrifice."

That includes his energy policies, that includes his defense policies, and it also includes his social spending policies, which combined with our lax monetary policy over the past few years have created this inflation. He needs to reverse course."
