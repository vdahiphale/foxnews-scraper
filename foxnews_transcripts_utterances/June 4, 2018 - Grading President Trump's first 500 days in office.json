New stories breaking, it always seems to happen right before the show but the Me Too Movement is catching up with Bill Clinton who comes unglued wagging that bony finger during an interview about Monica Lewinsky. Juanita Broderick and Cathleen Willey are here to discuss the questions NBC failed to ask. Also Bayern New York has a stunning new piece out, new information that could open the government's case against Michael Flynn. Plus the Supreme Court rules on the religious rights of a baker who was sued by a same sex couple but Mike Huckabee says it settles nothing. And why is the border patrol union chief now saying that the deploying the national guard to the border was a waste? You are going to want to stick around for his explanation. But first, Bill Clinton and a party in denial, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Twenty years later, Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party refuse to learn the lessons of the past. Even when confronted with reality, they have a problem processing the truth. During an interview to push this new thriller that he supposedly co-wrote with James Patterson, Former President Bill Clinton was asked this by NBC anchor Craig Melvin if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Even Clinton's own party at this point seems to want him to go away. This is the ruined past of the party confronting its pathetic present. Because like Clinton the Democrats refuse to learn the lessons of the past. Despite their previous embrace of sexual predators from Weinstein to Spacey, the Democrats have erected a Me Too Movement and created a political infrastructure that they hope, they hope will deliver female voters to the polls in November. But Bill Clinton remains a bothersome obstacle to their assuming the moral high ground on sexual harassment. A poll of registered votes in May found that 80 percent of Democrat voter considered sexual harassment a top issue for them. And only 38 percent of Republicans feel the same way. The Democrats believe that this is their new wedge issue. Obama and Hillary Clinton, come on let's remember they were all about dividing Americans using race and gender to drive people to the polls. Amazingly Democrats have embraced that approach today. And while Obama disparaged working class as bitter people clinging to their guns and religion, Hillary questioned women's sanity for daring to vote for Trump. But the curious thing beyond the impeachment and his shameful behaviour id that Bill Clinton could actually teach the Democrats a lot.

Well that worked out well. Like Bill Clinton's failure to read the signs of the times and appreciate the lessons of the past, Democrats refuse to acknowledge and respect the voters that Trump has brought into the fold. Should this continue? Clinton and James Patterson may want to reconsider a new title for their book when it premiers in paperback, `The Democratic President is Missing, and so are his Voters'. And that's the Angle. If Clinton got that upset discussing Lewinsky, imagine if the Today's Show asked about the women who had told him no.

Welcome back to the Ingraham Angle. This morning the President tweeted, \"This is my 500th day in Office and we have a lot. Many believe more than any President in his first 500 days\". He's very competitive, okay. In fact most Republicans do agree based on ballot numbers. Trump has the second highest ratings ever by a President's own Party after the 500 day mark at 87 percent, that's second only to George W. Bush and that of course was after 911.

Because like Clinton the Democrats refuse to learn the lessons of the past. Despite their previous embrace of sexual predators from Weinstein to Spacey, the Democrats have erected a Me Too Movement and created a political infrastructure that they hope, they hope will deliver female voters to the polls in November. But Bill Clinton remains a bothersome obstacle to their assuming the moral high ground on sexual harassment. A poll of registered votes in May found that 80 percent of Democrat voter considered sexual harassment a top issue for them. And only 38 percent of Republicans feel the same way. The Democrats believe that this is their new wedge issue. Obama and Hillary Clinton, come on let's remember they were all about dividing Americans using race and gender to drive people to the polls. Amazingly Democrats have embraced that approach today. And while Obama disparaged working class as bitter people clinging to their guns and religion, Hillary questioned women's sanity for daring to vote for Trump. But the curious thing beyond the impeachment and his shameful behaviour id that Bill Clinton could actually teach the Democrats a lot. Though of course he was a committed globalist on issues like China getting into WTO and NAFTA, he was also a Southern Democrat and he did understand that blue collar sensibility, the working people.

And even during his wife's campaign, he reportedly confronted her staff about their seeming disinterest in working class Americans, and he reportedly urged them reach out to those voters who were feeling ignored. His advice was dismissed though. Led by Robby Mook, Hillary's campaign decided to double down on targeting young Latino and Black voters in an effort to win the Presidency. Well that worked out well. Like Bill Clinton's failure to read the signs of the times and appreciate the lessons of the past, Democrats refuse to acknowledge and respect the voters that Trump has brought into the fold. Should this continue? Clinton and James Patterson may want to reconsider a new title for their book when it premiers in paperback, `The Democratic President is Missing, and so are his Voters'. And that's the Angle. If Clinton got that upset discussing Lewinsky, imagine if the Today's Show asked about the women who had told him no. Joining us now are Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick, author of the new book, \"You'd better put some ice on that, how I survived being raped by Bill Clinton\". It's great to see you both of you. I have been thinking about both of you all day and also Paula. Juanita, I want to start with you. Bill Clinton did approach you, did he not in 1992 to apologize, correct?"

I go out and the man points down around the corner by the elevator and so I go down there and as I round the corner, there stands Bill Clinton with two of his Arkinsaw state police guards. And he rushes over to me and he starts this profuse apology and saying, \"I'm so sorry for what I did, I'm a changed man, I'm just not the man I used to be, and even said I'm a family man now\". And I just looked at him Laura, and I was just flabbergasted and I said you go to hell and I walked off. And I could not believe it and then nurses that were with me, followed me out. And they came over to me and said, \"What did he want?\" and I told them. And then I began to feel a little bad that I said that. I kept thinking, well maybe he really meant that, maybe he really was apologizing."

Well okay, but he hasn't apologized to the people that he hurt and the people that he destroyed, the women that he destroyed. He hasn't apologized to me, he has not apologized to Paula. He apologized to Juanita but as we see there was a plan to that, there was a purpose for that.

Now let's get insight from Democratic Pollster Doug Schoen who helped Clinton rebrand his message after the shellacking in the `94 midterms. Doug it's so great to see you tonight. I was watching Bill Clinton's press conference that he did at the White House. I know you remember well on November 9th 1994, oh my God we were all young back then Doug, we were all kids. We were watching that and he said, \"Look I take partial responsibility for what happened. The voters want change. I'm going to work with Republicans. I'm not going to turn my back on my goals but I'm going to work with Republicans\". He basically said because that's what the people want. That is what the people want today too I believe."

We distribute, resist, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed healthcare but no individual initiative. No job creation, no helping business and Laura most of all, no inclusive policies because what we did with Bill Clinton which was, I think right, was we brought the country together, balanced budget, welfare reform. I'm proud of that and I think he's proud of that. If there were aspects as there are of his record that frankly require apologies and no pride, well we heard that today. But he does have, I think, a record that represents a better direction for the Democratic Party than the current one."

And the surging progressives who represent basically socialism and a series of policies that guarantees outcomes, rather than opportunities. I think it's bad for America, bad for the Democratic Party and I think you're right and sadly all that was good about what we were able to do in the '90s has disappeared.

They don't want to do the amnesty for almost two million illegal immigrants last February, because Donald Trump said we have to do something about chain migration.

You're absolutely right about policies to benefit the economy. I don't understand why the Democrats are doing what they are doing because it's sure not helping them in the polls and if they go on this course, it will lead to them losing the senate as most observers predict and even falling short of winning the house which is something that still remains within reach for them."

And speaking of 500 days, Trump now has the backing if his own party like few Presidents have had before him, we are going to debate that and Trump's message for the Philadelphia eagles today, that's next. Welcome back to the Ingraham Angle. This morning the President tweeted, \"This is my 500th day in Office and we have a lot. Many believe more than any President in his first 500 days\". He's very competitive, okay. In fact most Republicans do agree based on ballot numbers. Trump has the second highest ratings ever by a President's own Party after the 500 day mark at 87 percent, that's second only to George W. Bush and that of course was after 911. So does this all spell some trouble for the Democrats who've already lost their big lead in the midterm generic election polls? They're all now dead even. Let's dive into that with Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union and Democratic Strategist and good friend of the program Joel Payne. Alright we are going to do our report cards as well. We've got our report cards but 500 days in Matt, I've got to say I thought Trump would do well, I didn't think he'd do this well. I did not predict, I predicted he was going to win the Presidency. What I did not predict is what looks like a projection to 4 percent+ GDP next quarter, confidence up, African American unemployment on historic lows, the list goes on, Jerusalem moving them embassy.

What we learned now is that everybody in the White House knew that in real time that basically Flynn had told people that the FBI agents had told him that not only did they think he had not lied but they thought they were winding this down. You can say maybe we shouldn't trust Flynn on this, but it's consistent with what Comey had told the House and the Senate. It also means on February 14th last year when James Comey wrote that memo about meeting with the president and the president said, I hope you can see your way to letting this go, letting this Flynn thing go, at the time it appears the president, one, knew that the FBI didn't think he had lied, and, two, thought the investigation was all but over."

It's unusual, but prior to sentencing, in the interest of justice, the lawyers for Flynn can convince the judge that the predicates for a guilty plea, which the judge's obligation to find out, whether the person is pleading guilty voluntarily and without coercion and duress. So I think that is one factor here that you just mentioned is potentially a factor. And number two, the predicate facts for the guilty plea, it's not for the judge to accept someone's guilty plea if the facts are not there. And so if the facts aren't there, and remember this is a judge who has recently well after the plea ordered the government to disclose the Brady evidence, exculpatory evidence to the Flynn team. That indicates to me the judge has a question as to the predicate facts. And so now it's up to Flynn's lawyers to tell the judge that the plea was not based on full information, and/or --"

There could be a question that is posed without the significance being known, and then all of a sudden it turns into a major federal crime because there was a witch hunt going on.

Let's discuss today's seven to two decision with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and law professor Mark Rienzi, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. Great to see both of you. All right, Gov, you are not wild about this decision, and I know it's because Justice Kennedy, we call him AMK at the court because of his middle initial, Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion. Why are you not thrilled?"

      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR",
      "utterance": "It's not that I'm unhappy. I think it was a great decision for the baker. And it was a good first step. The court didn't really get into the religious liberty, but it is very significant that it recognized that the government had overreached and had essentially told someone who is a creator, he's an artist, that the government can't tell an artist what kind of art to produce. And it would have been different, Laura, had they said that the baker wouldn't sell anything in his bakery to people who were gay. But that wasn't the issue. He was open for business, but he wasn't going to create something that violated his conscience. And by the way, he didn't create certain things at Halloween either because it violated his conscience. And this was a good decision. It could have been better, but it certainly was an important decision and a very vital first step to stay that you can't have a government just telling people what they will believe and how they will practice their craft. The government doesn't have that kind of power."

So the justice is right. They weren't concerned about stigma then. But now Justice Kennedy is -- he was playing pretty soft on this. I think this is a very clear-cut case."

Justice Kennedy said for seven members of the court, pretty broad agreement, that when the government says that your religious beliefs are illegitimate or like racism, or you are wrong and need to be extinguished, that then the government is violating the free exercise clause. So I think what you are going to see is in a lot of these cases, that's precisely what the argument is. It's people pounding on the race card. This is just like racism. This is like supporting the holocaust and things like that. That kind of argument is now gone and it's going to make government policy illegal."

But this guy, he said I'll make cakes for showers that you have, or birthdays, or other celebrations. He actually said that. So I think a lot of people who just read the headlines didn't know that, that this man was going to do lots of things for this couple. He was willing to do that, but just not the wedding cake, which I think tipped it over the edge for --"

It's about some people trying to drive out religious believes that they think are illegitimate and wrong. So it wasn't that people need a cake or they need a bouquet of flowers. It really is that they want the government to drive up believes that they don't like."

It's just like, oh, the Christians aren't going to kick up a fuss. But in this case, this baker decided, you know something? I'm not a bad person. I'm not going to be driven out of business. I'm going to fight for my right. And I think a lot of other religious Americans of faith have to be willing to fight for their own rights, just like gay people want to fight for their rights. Other people have rights, too, and it doesn't make them bad people."

Are you going to tell an Orthodox Jew that runs a delicatessen that if someone comes in and says I want bacon wrapped shrimp for my reception that he has to do it? Nobody thinks that is legitimate. So why should a Christian, or for that matter, a Muslim, have to create something -- again, not something that is on his shelf that he regularly makes, but something that is a part of his artistry, something that is above and beyond and is a unique creation for a specific occasion, and a person who is in business should have a right to say that's not really within my creative capacity, or it violates my convictions and conscience, and I simply cannot do it.
