There are a lot of artist spanning across the history of art, in paint, in poetry, in acting who are profound scoundrels, and we still listen to them. We still enjoy their music.

Smollett was originally charged with just one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report for his alleged hate crime in which he claimed President Trump supporters beat him, put a noose around his neck, and called him racial and homophobic slurs.

So, Patrick and friends had a sleepover, where they played video games all night, to make sure they wouldn't dozen off before morning.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi is facing new questions about how much control she has over her own party. This comes after a week of infighting about an anti- hate resolution at the House passed yesterday. Some Democrats have said that the final measure did not mention Ilhan Omar by name following her recent comments that are being called anti-Semitic. In an apparent dig at the freshman lawmaker, a senior House Democrat telling Fox News, quote, all of our problems are caused by three people. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy blasting Pelosi for failing to rein in her new numbers."

      "speaker": "REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALIF., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER",
      "utterance": "He need to mark it as a moment that the new Democratic socialist swing of the party overtook their own leadership. The socialist grip could not be tighter. This isn't the Democratic Party that we've come to know. The transition is now complete that the Democrats socialist wing of the party controls their own leadership."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "It's interesting, Brian, that Nancy Pelosi really owes her speakership not to these new fire brands, the freshmen that are making all the noise in the news, but to the moderate that won in swing districts and beat those Republicans that are having a tough time. But now it's like the only one that can get attention are the freshman members that are making a lot of noise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIAN KILMEADE, HOST",
      "utterance": "It's unbelievable because in the beginning it was like, look how powerful she is. Look at the command she has. And look at how Paul Ryan dropped the ball. And then they thought, well, can she going to be able to go to the middle to make sure those moderates keep those seats. And now the story is how did she get this so out of control where need to 48 hours just to have a resolution that would say anti-Semitism is wrong. Now we have a resolution that says everything we've learned in first grade still holds. Don't be mean to people. And now we have a situation where somebody actually told us to these freshmen, this Minnesota freshman, in particular, Omar. When she came out and said, oh, by the way, I need you to change the rules because I'm going to be wearing this headdress. One hundred eighty one years, no one was allowed to wear anything on their heads, now they can. Then they go out and go Lindsey Graham is compromised. I thought to myself, what's going on here? And then we find out about all these other past tweets and apologies and back tracking. And then you see a situation where no one can rein them in. I thought she chose in the beginning not to, now I realize she can't."

    {
      "speaker": "LISA BOOTHE, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I don't think they've really gotten past it because the resolution was a joke, right? And even Democrats criticized it like Representative (ph) who is a Jewish Democrat member of Congress called his party out for failing to specifically address the anti-Semitism. But to your point earlier, Nancy Pelosi is facing this big challenge because there's no doubt that the party is gearing towards the left. You look at something like Medicare for all which Bernie Sanders introduced during the 2016 election. That was once considered outside of the mainstream. Now it's a mainstream part of the Democratic Party. And you see the front runners for the 2020 presidential election embracing it. It's almost a litmus test. You look at things like the green deal. You look at extreme stances on abortion. So the party is certainly going to the left. And the problem for Democrats, which you pointed out Dana, is a lot of these moderate Democrats members who represent Republican leaning districts who could be jeopardy in 2020. And also alienating independent voters headed into 2020. And also some of these rustbelt states and critical states that Democrats need to win."

So, essentially, they have run over what Pelosi wanted to be the message at this time. I will say this I think Pelosi did a great job.

She argues that the Democratic president operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor and said, we can't be only upset with Trump, his policies are bad but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies.

Instead of acknowledging it and putting her name up there like they did -- with Steve King, they threw it into a bucket of other wrongs which dilutes the actual condemnation. I think we know that that's the obvious strategy by inserting it with other kinds of hate crimes and hate thoughts and so on and so on.

You have a sister, Latoya Jackson in 1993, telling MTV, basically, accusing her brother of being a pedophile saying what business does a 35- year-old man have having little boys stay with him for 30 days, right? So this information we have known. There was, again, another documentary in 2003 by Martin (ph) talking about all of this. A 12-year-old cancer victim saying that Michael Jackson told him if you love me, you'll spend the night in my bed, so why now? It's pathetic that it's taken this long.

Big question that -- like they're talking about -- OK, a radio station will say we'll no longer gonna play his music. It's about who sells the music. Will they actually stop selling the music? You can still, you know, go see Roman Polanski movie. You could see Charlie Chaplain movies if you want. There are a lot of artist spanning across the history of art, in paint, in poetry, in acting who are profound scoundrels, and we still listen to them. We still enjoy their music. There's an interesting point that Eric Weinstein makes, the radio station banning Jackson should actually shutdown because the inventor of the radio, Marconi, was a fascist supporter of Mussolini. So if you're going to go -- if you're going to take virtues signaling to the ultimate level you will have nothing left to listen to. You'll have nothing left to watch.

He later claimed it was a racist and homophobic hate crime. Matt Finn is in Chicago with this latest chapter. Matt, is this - 16 counts, were you expecting this?"

      "speaker": "MATT FINN, REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Right now, we are working to independently confirm this Brian. I just spoke to a clerk at the Cook County Criminal Court who over the phone told me that a grand jury did return 16 additional charges against Jussie Smollett. The courts just closed here, so unfortunately don't have the documentation in front of us to confirm this. But there are several news outlets here in Chicago right now that are reporting a grand jury just returned an indictment with 16 additional charges against Jussie Smollett for disorderly conduct, for filing a false police report, apparently for all of the additional follow-up interviews and reports that Jussie Smollett gave to officers and detectives. Smollett was originally charged with just one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report for his alleged hate crime in which he claimed President Trump supporters beat him, put a noose around his neck, and called him racial and homophobic slurs. The actor now is apparently in much more legal trouble. This new set of charges each carries a possible sentence of probation to four years in prison. He's already pleaded not guilty to that initial first charge, but he's currently free on $100,000 bond, Brian."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I imagine that what they've - what the indictment says I'm reading here there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed. So Smollett says not guilty, and in fact he went to the set of Empire and told his colleagues that this was not true that he in fact was sticking by his original story. Apparently, even after the delays orchestrated by his lawyers to try to introduce more evidence, the grand jury didn't buy it. And so, Smollett, it seems to me is in deeper water as a liar."

      "speaker": "KILMEADE",

      "utterance": "Well it was just surprising, because just on its face, the story didn't seem to be credible right. But what Smollett knew was he understood how so many people in the media on the Left see the world and so that's how this story played into that, and also their assumptions about Trump and Trump supporters, that they are racist, that they're homophobic, that they're all these things. It's the same thing as the Covington kids story where the media bought the narrative, because it's the way that they view the world."

We haven't heard one thing about that since then. And a grand jury is made up of the citizens of Chicago, who have returned this indictment in a grand jury setting and that's obviously very serious.

Will the media learn? No, right now on CNN, I was watching CNN, they had a chiron hate in America right. That was it, so what they actually did to the police years ago, where they create the illusion of panic, they're doing with hate crimes and they can't even realize that they're burning their hands on the Smollett stove that they haven't learned a single lesson.

He says that these people that perpetrate these hoaxes, these celebrities, especially that they don't even realize that they've been had or that they've been caught. And we're all way ahead of him, like the grand jury's way ahead of him, and he in his mind so thinks that he's a victim.

So, if he is like Tom, he was an awesome dude and I'm sure he had a long and great life. So, our condolences from everyone here on THE FIVE and The GG Show and everywhere else at Fox. All right, so let's get to the less deep stuff. Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow Saturday 10 p.m. I got Heather Zumarraga, Rob Long, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. That's 10 pm, greatest show in the universe."

Patrick Lanigan is a senior at Persephone High School, he rallied his friends and classmates to help shovel a neighbour's driveway at 4:30 a.m. So, the neighbor is Natalie Blair (ph) and she's currently on kidney dialysis and would not have been able to make her 6:00 a.m. treatment because an ambulance has to come and pick her up. So, Patrick and friends had a sleepover, where they played video games all night, to make sure they wouldn't dozen off before morning. And within just half hour of shoveling, they cleared the path and of course Natalie (ph) said Patrick is a wonderful young man and thanked all of his friends. And what a good example they set, these nice young guys. Brian?"

      "utterance": "Yes, this is a great story. So, happy birthday to the most - to the highest paid lineman on the Cleveland Browns. What a classy thing to do, they witnessed - they said happy birthday to 29-year-old Kevin Zeitler. Isn't that nice? Two hours later, they traded Kevin Zeitler to the New York Giants for Olivier Vernon. So, he is now in New York Giants, but he just knows that his old team wished him happy birthday. It looks like an even swap. Vernon was getting paid too much for not doing enough. He also sat during the national anthem. So, the Giants offensive lineman, and now the Browns have another great player. The Browns are going to be a force this year."
