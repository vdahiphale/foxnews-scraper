A lot people figured out it this was a very good way to get into the country, that you would be able to just pass through if you brought children. That increased the number of children who were used as you were crossing the border. And so you started to see the number of cases of people crossing this way just skyrocket. So they need to make a deterrent out of this as people have figured out this is a good way to cross. There is a moral cost to not following the nation's laws. There's a moral cost to separating children from their families.

At some point they have to be willing to answer the question which illegal aliens are no longer allowed to stay in the country? They created this loophole, really a massive front door entryway into the United States by bringing a child with you, then all of a sudden it became quite easy to stay in the country. So you want to fix the issue of separating parents and children while being processed.

Don't bring your kids here because you're going to get separated from them if you cross illegally. But it turns out that I think President Trump wants credit for being tough on immigration. Today he says we don't want our country to turn into a migrant camp or a holding pen for refugees. But he doesn't want to take responsibility for the unpopular part of the policy which is the separation of kids from their mothers. So he is blaming the Democrats."

      "utterance": "It's been talked of a deterrent in parts because of what happened as people have learned what previous administrations did in handling this law. So you saw in previous administrations that when people cross the border illegally and then claimed after they were caught they were asylum-seekers, they would just sort of be let go and asked to report back at a later date. A lot people figured out it this was a very good way to get into the country, that you would be able to just pass through if you brought children. That increased the number of children who were used as you were crossing the border. And so you started to see the number of cases of people crossing this way just skyrocket. So they need to make a deterrent out of this as people have figured out this is a good way to cross. There is a moral cost to not following the nation's laws. There's a moral cost to separating children from their families. And it is important that Democrats and Republicans come together to respect the laws of the land, and they need keep families together."

      "utterance": "That's why Trump I think understands this has to be handled. You can't have mothers being separated from incredibly young children. I do think there will be a good faith effort to solve that part of it. But there is a legacy of lawlessness here, and at some point I think it becomes all too apparent that not just the Obama administration but the current Democrat party would prefer a situation where essentially anybody who can get in the country can stay. At some point they have to be willing to answer the question which illegal aliens are no longer allowed to stay in the country? They created this loophole, really a massive front door entryway into the United States by bringing a child with you, then all of a sudden it became quite easy to stay in the country. So you want to fix the issue of separating parents and children while being processed. But you also do have to enforce the law about people who are coming here illegally, and, by the way, in many cases claiming asylum in bad faith. They are saying what they've been told to say. The word is out. Secretary Nielsen has been addressing that. The young people who are coming who are unaccompanied, they are in jeopardy. There are many thousands of unaccompanied minors who have showed up to the border without anybody. So that's dangerous for them too. The incentive that was put in place by the Obama administration has to stop. This has to end."

Now it is something akin to that, but also we want to do something about separating kids from their families. Donald Trump has asked for a 44 percent decrease in legal immigration which the Democrats have balked at. I think that if you've got it down to a pretty skinny bill, wall, Dreamers, kids and family policies, maybe you could get something, but I don't know if that's where Congress is heading."

It takes so long to deal with adjudicating these illegal border crossings that then claim asylum that it ends up in family separation. His bill would require that you adjudicate this within two weeks, and if you fail to pass the test, you're deported as of family, and otherwise you can be reunited at that point."

What matters is what has happened doesn't matter. What has happened in Germany since the massive migrant wave, and there it's quite clear that you have had about a 10 percent increase in violent crime, in homicide, in rapes, the kind of crimes that people care about and notice in a country like Germany where you already had a low once those start to hit the airwaves. And by the way, I think there is a hesitation in some of these European countries to speak openly about these crimes. We see it in Sweden. We see it in Germany. The press doesn't want to deal with it. She's just wrong on the facts. Rather, she is misconstruing the reality of what's happening by cherry picking what has happened since 1992. They do have some very serious problems in Germany with the migrant wave, serious problems in other parts of Europe as well. And I think Mrs. Clinton knows that, but right now it's better to play to the emotions of --"

The other aspect of that tweet, he went after Angela Merkel. I've never seen a U.S. president do this before. He was suggesting that her hold on power was teetering on the brink because of this. It was almost as if he was echoing his ambassador to Germany who said that he wanted to encourage conservative parties to take over in these countries. That is the kind of meddling that I don't think he would like if a foreign leader did in our polity."
