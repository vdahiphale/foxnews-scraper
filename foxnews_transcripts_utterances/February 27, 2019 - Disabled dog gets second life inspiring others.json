He just ran through every tweet ever done by Keith Olbermann. At the end of that thing, he knew when he said that Trump was a racist con man in chief, that he fulfilled the media mission as offering the perfect sound bite, the perfect lower third. Every network had that lower third. It had racist con man cheat. They knew. Lanny Davis knew that if he met the media assumptions, this thing would be a major success, so he met the media assumptions. He went through the litany of everything the media feels about Trump without ever laying a hand on collusion, without ever putting any news out. We had to sit here the whole day and not talk about real news and talk about this crap. WATTERS: Clearly that final statement by Michael Cohen was written by Lanny Davis because it played all the hits.

It wasn't because of the far Left, those seats were going to be Democratic anyway.

But I actually can see what's more likely is another summit maybe at the end of the year in 2020 because you have to understand from the perspective of the North Koreans, they are still at war with us. We don't. We've been through many other wars since then. We don't even, I think the average American doesn't really think about North Korea but the average North Korean and leadership thinks that the Americans are out to get them and are out to invade their country. So that's the mindset of the person that's at the other side of the table. So I think, there's two things to look for as they negotiate over the evening our time is, is there a peace deal which would end you know officially in the war and what happens with sanctions? The President has said that he is going to keep these economic sanctions on North Korea until there is a you know, a consensus on what denuclearization means but is there some sort of leniency on the sanctions so that the North and the South can do more economic partnership, more business deals together. The South Koreans want that so those are the two things that I'm looking for that could that could come potentially out of the summit tomorrow.",

Wrote this book in the beautiful illustration called Keller's heart. It's written by John to inspire others maybe with special needs and let them know, it's okay to be different. Now get this, over 800 people waited to meet Keller in person at the book launch in Albany. John Gray is a Fox Anchor in Albany and they give a portion of proceeds to shelters that help dogs with special needs and so far as like over $3000. Like look at all those people.

He just ran through every tweet ever done by Keith Olbermann.

We've had that over and over again, that's why one of the greatest country in the world and the history.

We don't know if it's true or not. The president also wrote tweets that were taken as a threat against Michael Cohen which is why he didn't testify earlier. So, that's why he's there today. But in general, I would say, you know what, for all of the static, remember that documents don't lie. What you saw today, a check with Donald Trump's EKG-like signature on, $35,000 as president of the United States for an illegal activity, a payoff to a porn star, That's a campaign finance violation on the face of it. So that's news. That's different. I think also when you stop and think about collusion, oh, my gosh.

OK, good, that's great. They hang up the phone.

Then you have to believe that everything that he said before, there's a litany of things before Congress, under oath, media interviews, you either believe that version of Michael Cohen or you believe the one today? I found it to be far more political than I expected actually. I mean first of all when you're in - when the President is in the middle of negotiating with North Korea about nuclear weapons which by the way, the real news today is that India and Pakistan, two nuclear armed states are threatening each other again. I mean that is real news today that affects everybody. That's why the President is in North Korea dealing with excuse me, in Vietnam dealing with North Korea because of the seriousness of nuclear weapons. So I think because they've moved this three times, they could have moved it today. It did need to happen today, that was very overtly political and I felt that you know most of what you said today for me, I didn't buy the contortion. I didn't buy the tears. I thought it was a very political testimony and so the big question is who does any of this matter to? It matters primarily to Senate Republicans because the House is going to do what the House is going to do. They may over extend and impeach him but Senate Republicans are the ones who will determine if the House impeaches, what his fate is and there is nothing that he said today for me, that would lead any of the Senate Republicans to vote him out of office."

You know, Democrats are very eager to get to, right? Like is this going to be Nix again? Is this going to be John Dean who gave very incredibly compelling testimony if you go back at that time and look at the tapes. There was someone else you know, who also showed remorse, it was a part of the Nixon time. That was Chuck Colson and I think you could go back and see. He completely changed his life after that happened and went on a very you know a very Christian spiritual adventure. I did not see John Dean today in powerful testimony.

In Elijah Cummings' wrap up statement, he took great offense to Republicans who said that this is the first hearing and that they're not doing anything else. That's not true. We talked about the high price of drugs, especially insulin and people that can't afford it and we talked about voting rights. Those are two actually substantive issues. For Pelosi, they know that it's going to be incumbent upon them to show that they can govern and not just try to impeach the President. Because how did they went in the House of representatives? It wasn't because of the far Left, those seats were going to be Democratic anyway. It's because they won in moderate districts and suburban districts where they actually want people to get things done and one of the most effective people today I thought was Katie Hill. She's a young woman from Southern California. She used to work in the Obama administration. She is one of the freshman Democrats who's not got a lot of attention but she's like solid and moving forward.

I will say this, when I hear Chairman Cummings say that what happened on Capitol Hill today was important because history will record whether or not we at this moment stood tall in terms of defending democracy. I don't think it's a small story and I don't think that just because these two guys had dinner, they haven't even started their hearings yet, that we should ignore what's going on here in this country that is of such magnitude and impacts the presidency of the United States. So that's the way I feel about it. By the way, I don't know what the President has done overseas that amounts to so many wins. I know the first time he met with this guy, we didn't get much out of it."

You know, I think the major thing and I think we talked about this but yesterday is the patience required in diplomacy. I don't think, maybe we'll have a big win coming out of this. But I actually can see what's more likely is another summit maybe at the end of the year in 2020 because you have to understand from the perspective of the North Koreans, they are still at war with us. We don't. We've been through many other wars since then. We don't even, I think the average American doesn't really think about North Korea but the average North Korean and leadership thinks that the Americans are out to get them and are out to invade their country. So that's the mindset of the person that's at the other side of the table. So I think, there's two things to look for as they negotiate over the evening our time is, is there a peace deal which would end you know officially in the war and what happens with sanctions? The President has said that he is going to keep these economic sanctions on North Korea until there is a you know, a consensus on what denuclearization means but is there some sort of leniency on the sanctions so that the North and the South can do more economic partnership, more business deals together. The South Koreans want that so those are the two things that I'm looking for that could that could come potentially out of the summit tomorrow."

He's a really cute little dog. An animal control found him, recommended putting the puppy down as an act of mercy due to his disabilities but a surgeon took a chance on Keller, cleaned him up and eventually John Gray and his family fell in love with him during a visit to the shelter, they brought him back and they've created this book. Wrote this book in the beautiful illustration called Keller's heart. It's written by John to inspire others maybe with special needs and let them know, it's okay to be different. Now get this, over 800 people waited to meet Keller in person at the book launch in Albany. John Gray is a Fox Anchor in Albany and they give a portion of proceeds to shelters that help dogs with special needs and so far as like over $3000. Like look at all those people.
