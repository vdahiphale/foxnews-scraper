What I do know is that the big infrastructure-only package got voted on, and now they're working with a far more expensive package, at least twice as much, that Democrats are convinced they can get done, and done soon. The devils in the details, but, right now, as far as signing off on that bipartisan infrastructure agreement, people might have to chill a while. Try about a week.

And if the U.S. is going to be in that ballpark, where we already have to pay a federal tax, a state tax, depending on the state you live in, you got to pay vehicle registration, you have to pay property tax, when is it that we're at the point that we have been taxed enough already? Not to mention the Build Back Better plan has been raided by Wharton's to cost more than double of what they're saying that it was going to cost, which, obviously, the administration said it was going to cause zero dollars, which we know to be a lie.

Meanwhile, the administration push to say -- and this is something you hear from other Democrats -- that none of this is inflationary. In fact, it will actually tame inflation over the years. They're not talking about the infrastructure-only package by itself. They're talking about the far bigger package that is in the work, and they usually cite more than a half-dozen Nobel-Prize winning economists. Be that as it may, getting that one through and getting that one done and getting that one agreed to and before the holidays, well, it's a leap. Hillary Vaughn on how big a leap at the Capitol.

Dan, it's always good to see you. Welcome. Are you surprised, Congressman, the fact that six largely progressive members of your party decided not to vote for this? Now, you did pick up 13 Republican votes, so that more than wiped out that concern. But did you expect that, know that there were Republican votes to give you some comfort room or what?"

I mean, it was clear that they would have supported both bills had we been able to put them together. But, of course, I was of the view that we should take the bipartisan infrastructure bill, get it passed, and then continue to work on this other piece of it. The 13 Republicans that voted for it, I think, do represent a larger number within the Republican Conference that are supportive of that bipartisan bill, but it was a decision that the Republican leadership made that they wanted to whip pretty hard against it."

She knew she had at least some of those Republican votes in hand to offset the Democrats who voted no. Now, had they not done that, as you know, Congressman, this would have been a big defeat. Those 13 Republicans are being targeted by some of their colleagues as helping Nancy Pelosi and, by extension, yourself. So what do you tell them?"

I occasionally differ with our leadership, and I will vote against them from time to time. I think this is really hard infrastructure. This is the same kind of infrastructure bill that we passed that former President Trump would have, I think, supported. He certainly made the effort to get infrastructure on the agenda. We were able to get this one across the line. We do have big differences. But we should all be able to agree that we need to get lead service lines out of the ground and we have clean drinking water. That's partly what the infrastructure bill does. Highways are not partisan. Drinking water systems are not partisan. So I'm grateful to the 13 who stood with us. And I do believe, as I said, they represent a much larger number that were not willing to buck their leadership."

They constitute the two votes that gets us to the 50 plus one in the Senate that we need. So what I have been counseling my friends in the House to do is, let's understand that, even if a person is a progressive, that the root word of progressive is progress. We never completely finish.

The AFL-CIO, the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, who don't agree on anything, they all supported it. This is a good bill, Neil. Contrast that to the Build Back Better bill that's going to be potentially voted on next week, which is a single-party solution. It does raise taxes, unlike the bipartisan infrastructure bill, so two very different bills. And I think, by the way, Neil, interesting to my colleague Dan Kildee's comment, the bipartisan bill passed the Senate August 10."

And I will tell you this, Neil, because I speak to my G-20 Colleagues in the Senate, including Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, two tremendously courageous people. There's a lot going on behind the scenes here. We have taken the hard infrastructure out. We have taken that the non-offensive pay-fors out, including recapturing unused COVID relief money, including recaptured unused state unemployment insurance augmentation, that $300 a week extended benefit edition that came back from a lot of the states. We don't open up the tax code at all in this bill. So what they're now left with on reconciliation is social or human infrastructure, as they refer to it, and tax increases. And I think that Joe and Kyrsten are going to do their job now that this hostage has been removed, because the progressives essentially were holding our bipartisan bill hostage, so that they could gain leverage over Joe and Kyrsten on the reconciliation package. That hostage has been removed. Joe and Kyrsten can now do her thing, and do what's best for our country."

Certainly, we need to be competitive with the rest of the world. We think about other countries like Germany, who's paying 47.5 percent, Ireland 48 percent. And if the U.S. is going to be in that ballpark, where we already have to pay a federal tax, a state tax, depending on the state you live in, you got to pay vehicle registration, you have to pay property tax, when is it that we're at the point that we have been taxed enough already? Not to mention the Build Back Better plan has been raided by Wharton's to cost more than double of what they're saying that it was going to cost, which, obviously, the administration said it was going to cause zero dollars, which we know to be a lie. So, at this point, I wonder, who thinks this is a good idea outside of really far left progressive people?

That's happening all over the world, but it's particularly bad in the United States. And when you back to previous administrations like the Eisenhower administrations, 50 percent just isn't that bad.

Officially now, after, what, almost 20 months, foreigners are welcome into this country, as long as they have been vaccinated, everything is hunky- dory on that front; 33 countries would be part of this mix that could forever change maybe right through the holidays. How pleasant the flying experience is going to be. Grady Trimble at O'Hare International Airport on that. Hey, Grady."

And all of the major airlines have said they have already seen a surge of international travelers coming into the U.S. Delta expects many of its international flights to be completely full. United says it's expecting around 10,000 more passengers to fly from other countries into the United States today compared to just a week ago. And across airlines, the travel booking app Hopper says searches for international flights to the states up 338 percent since the reopening was announced. Delta's CEO did warn, though, that things could get sloppy -- that is his word -- with long lines, because now you have to show your passport and prove your vaccination status. In addition to that, there are concerns that understaffed airlines won't be able to handle this influx of international travelers combined with the busy holiday travel season. The commerce secretary was here at O'Hare today, though. She made the case that the airlines are ready and that reopening is extremely important for the U.S. economy."

He's just so passionate about making sure people are safe and healthy and well, Dr. Kevin Campbell, K Roc Consulting, president and CEO. He's a cardiologist as well. People this smart generally scare me. But, anyway, Doctor, it's very good to have you. I know your biggest concern has been whether we're rushing things. And you worry about the spikes in cases in parts of Eastern Europe, the big spike, obviously, in countries like Russia and China. The breakdown on some of the countries, including Germany that are now admitted in here, is that they are experiencing spikes of their own. But, again, the only ones coming are those who've been vaccinated and testing negative. So does that ease your concerns?"

I think, when we have folks that are vaccinated, I feel pretty good about them coming into our country and spending money here and seeing family and traveling and enjoying our beautiful countryside. I do worry if they are not vaccinated. That's a horse of a different color. So I am perfectly comfortable with the vaccination -- with the travel ban being eliminated as long as everyone is vaccinated."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

They hand you sanitary wipes when you come on and you wipe your hands and your seat area. And, also, you're wearing a mask on the plane. So I think it's a pretty safe place. I just recently traveled internationally, and I felt very, very safe both directions."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
      "utterance": "You know, the further we get into this, Neil, the more that I feel much more comfortable with the vaccine. I think the vaccine is the key to eliminating the pandemic. However, having these tools like these oral agents from Merck and from Pfizer that can treat the disease in people who are unvaccinated or vaccinated who have mild to moderate disease, the data is pretty darn convincing. And I think you will see that, as our scientific community continues to do important research and do important studies, we will have more and more tools. I think it still comes down to vaccination. You have got to get vaccinated, got to get your kids vaccinated, and make sure that you protect yourself and those around you. That's the key to eliminating this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The studies are still in the very earliest stages, Doctor, but, as a cardiologist, some of them that seemed focus on heart-related -- patients who were dealing with issues, the irregular heartbeats and the rest, and some of these other conditions that seem to be, seem to be unique to that subset of the population, should they worry?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPBELL",

It's a very uncommon side effect, and it's usually self-limited. And if I had a child in that younger age group, I would absolutely get them vaccinated without a worry."
    },

      "utterance": "What if that child has myocarditis?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
      "utterance": "So, if you develop myocarditis, we see most of these cases, again, very rare, they're self-limited. Many of them don't even need to come to the hospital. Some of them do. They may have shortness of breath or chest pain. We typically treat them with steroids or other drugs to help their heart pump more efficiently. Almost all of them resolve. So, again, it's incredibly rare. So you're seeing an increase incidence of a very rare problem in people who get the vaccine, but very, very rare either way."

And right now, signs are that gas prices will continue climbing, some are saying for an average of over $4 a gallon. Right now, only two states are under that point right now, as things begin to escalate, and talk that the administration is seriously considering shutting down yet another pipeline. Ashley Webster in Palm Coast, Florida, with what's on the agenda there -- Ashley."

The administration confirming it is studying the feasibility of replacing the so-called 5 pipeline that stretches across Michigan carrying more than half-a-million barrels of crude oil a day from Western Canada. The administration says it is not considering shutting down the existing pipeline, simply looking at safer alternatives. Here's what the administration's response was when pressed by FOX News' Peter Doocy earlier today. Take a listen."

The oil and gas industry, as well as Canadian lawmakers, were quick to respond at any hint of a change to the pipeline, saying it would only drive energy prices higher, especially for propane that many families rely on for heat in the winter. By the way, a group of angry Republicans already sent a letter to President Biden, urging him to make no pipeline changes and accusing him of already making America reliant again on foreign oil. But Energy Secretary and former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm told MSNBC that U.S. oil and gas companies actually have more than 7,000 land leases to do drilling that are simply not being used. Take a listen."

      "speaker": "WEBSTER",
      "utterance": "The pipeline in question is operated by Canadian energy company Enbridge, which is already involved in a legal battle with the state of Michigan that tried to shut Line 5 down back in May. Now it's all in court. And on top of that, Canada has also triggered a 44- year-old pipeline treaty dispute mechanism, which means any changes to the pipeline must be approved by negotiators from both Canada and the U.S.. Oh, what a complicated web we weave. However, that pipeline for now, Neil, wide open."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, thank you, my friend, very much, Ashley Webster. Let's go to Bill McGurn right now, FOX News contributor, Wall Street Journal columnist, great writer. Bill, this seems relatively easy to address by just opting into all forms of energy. You want wind, solar, have at it, but not at the expense of what we have in abundance. And the distinction the energy secretary seemed to make for available lands on which energy companies can operate, it's the federal lands on which they were operating that are now off-limits. That has complicated the picture, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, look, their whole M.O. since they have come in is to limit supply. When you limit supply, prices go up or you have short -- you can have shortages and so forth. And that's what we have. And let's remember that the limiting of supply has been a deliberate effort to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Joe Manchin just got taken out of the Build Back Better bill the electricity programmed to close down coal plants. All this stuff is having an effect on prices. And normally liberals favor this, because they want the high prices to discourage the use of fossil fuels. The problem is, it's come on so fast and so heavy, people are really feeling the impact, and they're responding to the politics. I mean, we're in this insane position of reducing our supply while begging OPEC to increase theirs because then that counts against their green emissions, not ours. It's just insane."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And begging the Russians, as an OPEC Plus country, to help us out. And they seem to be relishing not moving on production."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBSTER",
      "utterance": "Right. Right. Look, we're just going to empower many of our rivals. Look Russia and China didn't even show up to the climate summit there. They don't take this seriously. And I think their view is, if the United States wants to harm itself and weaken itself, be our guest. But this is a very clear cause and effect. The administration has taken on a lot of these green policies, which sees fossil fuels as the enemy. And we're still very dependent on fossil fuels. So you take that away, or you raise the prices so high, people start to hurt."

Among the claims attorneys are making is that organizers did not have enough medical or security personnel for a crowd of that size; 50,000 people were at the concert Friday night and hundreds or injured as the crowd surged towards the stage, making it almost impossible for folks to move. And many could hardly breathe. When some people started passing out. It was almost like dominoes, with bodies being buried or trampled, as the show went on for more than half-an- hour."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS",
      "utterance": "Well, 24 hours before Governor Christie was speaking in Las Vegas, Donald Trump was talking to supporters in Mar-a- Lago. And as we reported at RealClearPolitics, surprise, surprise, the former president says that he's absolutely not kidding about a possible rematch with Biden. Every Republican who is thinking about a White House bid in 2024, they are confronting the same set of facts as Governor Christie. The difference is that he is laying out in real time a potential blueprint for how you balance those two things. And his takeaway is really simple. It's, one, go your own way, because you don't know what the former president is going to do, and, two, fight for your message and focus on the future, but do it the way that Glenn Youngkin did in Virginia without making people's ears hurt. If Christie does hop in the race, we could be pointing back to that speech, and this might be an important milestone."

There's a significant bench on the right currently, but they don't know whether or not they can go up against the former president. On top of that, there's an open question the right, which is, can a populist candidate, without the populist baggage of President Trump, appeal to the Trump voter? And I think that, if you're going to answer that question and be a contender, the one thing that you need to prove to these voters is that you're going to fight. Even if Trump wasn't their preferred candidate, I don't think we're going to go back to the days of Republican candidates who were mom jeans, right? So you have to prove that you're going to fight. And I think that..."
