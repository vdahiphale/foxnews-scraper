And I think Democrats are making a huge mistake, Shannon. What they underestimate is the gun issue's effect in 2016. And I think a lot of those swing voters, a lot of voters who made up the margin in those key swing states, the typically independent or Democratic voters who swung for Trump, is someone who cares deeply about the gun issue. So the Second Amendment helps Donald Trump in 2020 and it hurts Joe Biden or the whole rest of the field.",

Bernie Sanders, by the way, you remember he had a lot of problems with Hillary Clinton calling him out for NRA and what he did in 2016.

But Bernie and Biden are at the top of all the polling for them, two older white men. TOM ROGAN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": But the challenge, I think, for Joe Biden is to decide whether he skews to that line that Tim suggested, the more moderate, consensual, perhaps more populist in terms of being able to get centrist voters into his ticket if he were to be the nominee, which he clearly has a mind to -- he doesn't have to take those same risk that some Democrats have to take to move up the polls. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the challenge for him is that he recognizes a political constituency in the Democratic Party, that activist base, that were some of these other candidates to drop out could suddenly galvanize either around someone like Kamala Harris or perhaps out of his corner into Bernie Sanders' ticket. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so the next couple of weeks I think it will be very interesting to see whether his strategy is to try and skew to that more uncomfortable, I feel I can play and not take risks towards keeping that general election popularity, or whether he's trying to preach to that crowd. And of course, President Trump is banking on this being a long and brutal fragment where they all run to the left.",

OK, so Matthew, the president speaking to the NRA today. He and Cory Booker see this issue very differently. How do you think it plays going into 2020? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": It's not just Trump and Booker who see it differently, but it's Trump and the entire Democratic field. And I think Democrats are making a huge mistake, Shannon. What they underestimate is the gun issue's effect in 2016. And I think a lot of those swing voters, a lot of voters who made up the margin in those key swing states, the typically independent or Democratic voters who swung for Trump, is someone who cares deeply about the gun issue.

Bernie Sanders, by the way, you remember he had a lot of problems with Hillary Clinton calling him out for NRA and what he did in 2016. And I think for Joe Biden it's not the most important issue for him. Cory Booker is saying it, Kamala Harris is saying it. They need to get attention, so they're pushing that issue really hard to show that they're strong. Vice President Biden is just going to sit there and bide his time, I think, and just say I'll figure out a way to get these things done.

TOM ROGAN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": But the challenge, I think, for Joe Biden is to decide whether he skews to that line that Tim suggested, the more moderate, consensual, perhaps more populist in terms of being able to get centrist voters into his ticket if he were to be the nominee, which he clearly has a mind to -- he doesn't have to take those same risk that some Democrats have to take to move up the polls. But the challenge for him is that he recognizes a political constituency in the Democratic Party, that activist base, that were some of these other candidates to drop out could suddenly galvanize either around someone like Kamala Harris or perhaps out of his corner into Bernie Sanders' ticket. And so the next couple of weeks I think it will be very interesting to see whether his strategy is to try and skew to that more uncomfortable, I feel I can play and not take risks towards keeping that general election popularity, or whether he's trying to preach to that crowd.

Absent, though, any other problem with the economy, that's usually number one issue. And international incidents sometimes bring us together, sometimes tear us apart. The war in Iraq brings us together. Jimmy Carter with the Iran hostage crisis tears us apart and hurts the president. But 3.2, that's a good number."

And I think one of the things he'll be doing, the White House campaign strategy, will be to say, look, look at Democrats in terms of their policy suggestions. Look at what that has meant in France in terms of the biggest state, more generous welfare. A lot of the similar things. Youth unemployment there, unemployment here, GDP, the unemployment rate is twice as high and the GDP is about half. And so there's a narrative he could skew to."

      "utterance": "But that's belied by the polling that you just said, which is this overwhelming approval of Trump's performance on the economy. It is his biggest strength, and it's something that the Democrats are going to have a lot of trouble contending considering the fact that at every step along the way they have opposed his economic agenda. From Election Day in 2016 when Paul Krugman in \"The New York Times\" said that the Wall Street indexes would collapse, to Nancy Pelosi calling the Trump tax cuts Armageddon. They have all been proven wrong. And so Trump needs to make that case again and again in the election."

But also we have this story today on the issue of immigration, about 1,300 or so Cuban migrants who were being detained at the southern border in Mexico, their southern border, who escaped, walked away, left somehow this detention facility. Tim, we are told that many of them have been gathered back in, but this administration is very tough on Mexico in saying, listen, if you don't help us with this problem, we're not going to help you with some --"

And until there is an issue like this that's something that brings the two parties together, it's not going to change much. I will say that it's a great issue for President Trump, it's a great issue for Democrats because they can raise money off it. Although I think he's got a better case now that there's an acknowledgement there is an overwhelming number of people trying to get in this country form the southern border. But it's just another point, it's just another story about how bad things are."

      "utterance": "Tom, a lot of people saying Cuban immigrants, why were they going through Mexico versus trying to come to Florida as many have done, and you touch U.S. soil and you get here, it's a different way of doing it. It adds to the conversation about what people are really doing in escaping as they go through Mexico."

      "utterance": "True. It could be the sharks in terms of the water there, in terms of there's obviously, very tragically, a lot of risk coming through. But I think to Tim's point, the political expediency for Democrats here is fundraising. The political expediency for President Trump actually in terms of people like Jeh Johnson backing up the idea of a crisis at the border, really it is flipping in Trump's political favor, I think."

He's turning \"Jeopardy!\" into the World Series of Poker. I'm not sure that's a good thing, but it definitely makes for good television. My loser is Kamala Harris for her flip-flop of sorts related to whether we should give the Boston Marathon bomber voting rights, like Bernie Sanders is advocating. Kamala does this unusual thing where she sidesteps difficult issues by saying we need to have a conversation about them. I think she needs to have a conversation with her staff about her lackluster performance in the polls."

He was number in the MLB draft, stayed another year at Oklahoma, had an amazing year, won the Heisman. And this all despite some controversy about tweets, or things that he had written, homophobic comments he made when he was a teenager, understanding that he's not much older than that now. But I still think it's a great story. And the loser of the week is words, maybe the English language, because we had the Webster's dictionary words like \"stan,\" \"buzzy,\" \"gig economy,\" \"cubit,\" \"garbage time.\" And I think they do it just so people have to go online to Webster's and find out what they mean."
