It allegedly involves smashed computer hard drives, a laptop that was found stashed in a crevice in a building on Capitol Hill, and an aide to the former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, nabbed at the airport as he was trying to leave for Pakistan. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is quite a story. His lawyer is now disputing some of these elements, which we're going to tell you about in a moment. But it begs the question when others on the Hill fired Mr. Awan after he was accused of accessing congressional computers with no permission to do so, why did Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz keep him on her payroll until yesterday? Watch this rather aggressive exchange with the Capitol Hill Police about getting her laptop back in the middle of all of this. It was seized during the investigation.

Attorney Chris Gowen also told Fox News that his client, seen here with former President Clinton, had received a green light to travel abroad from the U.S. Attorney's office weeks before FBI officers, U.S. Capitol Police, and Customs and Border Agents swooped down on Awan at Dulles Airport, Monday night.

In the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives said a statement issued by Awan's attorney's this afternoon, adding: \"For months, we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media, but from sitting members of Congress. Now, we have the Justice Department,\" the lawyers went on to say, \"showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter. The government had been informed he would travel and have stated no objection. Yet on Monday night, he was hastily arrested at Dulles Airport.\" The lawyers concluded, \"We are confident that Mr. Awan will soon be able to clear his name and get on with his life.\" A hearing is set for next month in Federal District Court here in Washington, Martha.",

And the effort that Anthony and Scaramucci, you heard him described, it seems to me to be a worthy undertaking as well.

And Browder claims the smear campaign was actually orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya. Remember, she is the Russian attorney who had that controversial meeting last year with Donald Trump Jr. In his prepared testimony, Browder, calls out Fusion GPS saying, quoting here: \"While they were conducting these operations in Washington, D.C., at no time did they indicate that they were acting on behalf of Russian government interest, nor did they file disclosures under the Foreign Agents Registration Act or FARA. This was one of the best examples of Putin's propaganda.\" So, now, Senate Intel Committee Chair, Chuck Grassley, wants to know why, if fusion GPS was hired by Natalia Veselnitskaya, they never registered as a foreign agent. Grassley also points out, that while Trump allies -- Paul Manafort and Mike Flynn -- have often been criticized for retroactively registering under FARA, Hillary Clinton confidante, Cindy Blumenthal never did, even though he gave Clinton documents on behalf of a foreign political party.

Still, the Globe never missing opportunity to go after the former governor writes, one Republican who appears to be unbothered by all the political tumult would be Mitt Romney, to which we say, Mitt Romney gave people a chance to make him the decision-maker.

It allegedly involves smashed computer hard drives, a laptop that was found stashed in a crevice in a building on Capitol Hill, and an aide to the former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, nabbed at the airport as he was trying to leave for Pakistan. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is quite a story. His lawyer is now disputing some of these elements, which we're going to tell you about in a moment. But it begs the question when others on the Hill fired Mr. Awan after he was accused of accessing congressional computers with no permission to do so, why did Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz keep him on her payroll until yesterday? Watch this rather aggressive exchange with the Capitol Hill Police about getting her laptop back in the middle of all of this. It was seized during the investigation. Watch."

Attorney Chris Gowen also told Fox News that his client, seen here with former President Clinton, had received a green light to travel abroad from the U.S. Attorney's office weeks before FBI officers, U.S. Capitol Police, and Customs and Border Agents swooped down on Awan at Dulles Airport, Monday night. Awan was arraigned on and pleaded not guilty to one count of bank fraud charges stemming from home loan application, seemingly unrelated to the $4 million in I.T. work that he and several members of his family performed for leading House Democrats."

And then, there was this arrest at Dulles Airport. His other family members, who had worked on the Hill left the country earlier in the process as all of this was sort of coming down.

He couldn't do his work because of the investigation, and because he had lost these privileges, and she was still paying him. And she was obviously very adamant to get that laptop back. And yet again, I have to say, it's pretty remarkable. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has, as I've said to somebody earlier today, left a debris field larger than the Hindenburg now across the Democratic Party. She has just found so many ways to hurt her fellow Democrats, and this is just one."

We're talking about bank fraud, criminal cyber security activities, and the mere fact that he -- Mr. Awan was so close to Debbie Wasserman Schultz. I think it's the making of not only a suspense novel but a Pulitzer prize- winning story for the journalist who actually wants to follow the scandal. Unfortunately, you see so many journalists focused, you know, on Trump fever, and on Russia that there's little room or little space to even talk about what could be a, potentially, a very devastating situation for Debbie Wasserman Schultz."

I can't speak to Debbie Wasserman Schultz' H.R. decisions, they're beyond me.

My point is: we've got to let this court case play out. Let's look at the facts, and let's have the justice system do its job. Clearly, he shouldn't have left the country, but the Justice Department allowed him to leave the country. And so, there are so many problems here that I think we've got to let the courts, and the FBI, and investigators do their job. The same as we should do in the Russia investigation, let Mueller and his team do the job, and then we'll come up with a conclusion for the American people."

I've never seen a President do this to a cabinet officer or a close advisor ever. And Trump is so -- this President, President Trump is so unorthodox that it is just possible, Martha, that all he really wants to do here is to send some signals to Jeff Sessions to get the move on some of these issues. I suspect, Martha, that the investigation that we believe that the attorney general is going to announce in the leaks has probably underway for some time. I mean, some of these leaks are criminal, we've known that for a long time, and they're certainly worthy of investigation. And the effort that Anthony and Scaramucci, you heard him described, it seems to me to be a worthy undertaking as well. I don't think that would be something -- the announcement timing is going raise questions about whether he just did this to save his job. You know, I doubt that's the case. But if the president is looking for a way to, you know, say that the attorney general is now back in his good graces, this might be it. I just -- it's very hard to assess this. I wish I could say to you, Martha, that the last time something like this happened, I remember it. And it turns out such and such a way, but I can't remember anything like ever."

And I think a lot of people have said, you know, you just have to just kind of throw out the background and the history on how these things go, because we're just living in a completely different environment now. And as you say, even if this has been something the Justice Department has been digging into for some time, if now that they talk about the fact that they're investigating leaks, it puts him in a very difficult, awkward position -- Jeff Sessions. Because it's going to look like he's doing this to please the President, which is not really what his job is."

      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, let's see what he says about the inquiry, and when it was launched, and how long it's been going on and make -- I think will be able to make a better assessment of that at the time. We are existing in a media atmosphere, in which everything that the administration does was with few exceptions is going to be interpreted in the most negative possible light. So, you know, we have to guard against that. And one of the things that worry me about all the stuff that's been going on, Martha, is that I think Mr. Trump is so different from any president we've seen before that we tend to read him as we would other presidents. For example, his continued irritation at the special counsel's investigation and his behavior about it makes you think, well, he must have something to hide. But he's -- you know, I don't think you can necessarily judge him that way. It may be that he's innocent and he knows he's innocent, and he just wishes these people would come out and say he's innocent the way he wanted Comey to, which Comey told him privately. So, I just, I think, you know, he's hard to understand. I don't think many of us understand him very well. Newt Gingrich has a whole book out attempting to understand him. And I'm not even sure that Newt, although he has some access to him, understands him very well, either."

It is not to be his personal, as I put it, goalie, to protect him from any investigation that might come in his direction. That's simply not the proper job of the attorney general.

We've got to get that stopped now. These individuals that may be are holdovers from the previous administration or individuals that just want to be able to get their version of the story out are leaking out parts of the story, but holding back other parts of it to gain some sort of political advantage. That's incredibly toxic, but what it signals is all of our partners around the world that help us in intelligence gathering don't share with the United States, because this information may be leaked out. Or if you're a source, they're constantly afraid that their information or their identity may be leaked out. That hurts us in our national security. So, this is not a political issue, this is a national security issue that we need to be able to make sure that we keep America protected.

      "utterance": "All right. So, in terms of Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, and you've watched what's going on here. There are about ten Senators who have come out and basically said to the President that they don't want him to be fired, that they think that would be a big mistake. Where do you stand on that?"
    },

      "speaker": "LANGFORD",
      "utterance": "I think that'd be a big mistake as well. Again, the people that work for me and around me, if I have a problem, we sit in my office, and we get a chance to talk it through and then be able to settle it; I don't go to the media to be able to resolve those issues. I just don't think that's the right way to be able to resolve it. The president has access to every person on his staff at any time that he wants to visit with them. And if there is an issue with Jeff, he should certainly call him in and sit down, and say let's try to resolve whatever issues may need to be there, but Jeff Sessions' firmly inside of the law. The law does not allow him to be involved in the Russia investigation. Because of his role during the campaign, he needs to recuse himself, should recuse himself. But that doesn't mean that the investigation is going to be unfair. They're going to go after facts, trying to deal with the facts. And what Brit Hume was saying before that Jeff Session is not the president's personal goalie, could not be more true. He has to be able to actually implement the law. So, he's putting in U.S. attorneys around the country. He's working with the criminal cases that are happening. He's putting together issues on religious liberty in the administration. He's doing what the attorney general needs to do and needs to be allowed to do. And the president's lost trust in him, resolve it."

We are joined by two veterans of recent wars who have very, very different takes on this story. Also tonight, new allegations of a shadowy company paid by Russian agents to run a smear campaign against President Trump. Bill Browder has a lot of insight into this group, which is based here in the United States. He's dedicated his life to fighting Russian corruption.

They are investigating alleged Russian agents inside the United States potentially breaking the law. The Senator singled out one company called Fusion GPS. It is allegedly behind a smear of the president during the 2016 campaign. And now, we're learning that the firm may have some ties to people at the Kremlin. Trace Gallagher, joins us now live from our West Coast Newsroom with more on this intriguing story. Hi, Trace!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST",
      "utterance": "High, Martha. Fusion GPS is in opposition research firm founded by a pair of ex-Wall Street Journal reporters. The infamous Trump dossier that Fusion GPS helped produce is a document filled with salacious details, but they're phony details about President Trump's connection to the Russians. Now, Financier, Bill Browder, plans on telling the Senate Intel Committee that Fusion GPS conducted a smear campaign against him in retaliation for his support of the Magnitsky Act -- that's the U.S. law that imposes sanctions on dozens of wealthy Russians and those involved in the death of Attorney Sergey Magnitsky, who was fatally beaten in prison after uncovering a massive Russia fraud scheme. And Browder claims the smear campaign was actually orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya. Remember, she is the Russian attorney who had that controversial meeting last year with Donald Trump Jr."

      "speaker": "In his prepared testimony, Browder, calls out Fusion GPS saying, quoting here",
      "utterance": "\"While they were conducting these operations in Washington, D.C., at no time did they indicate that they were acting on behalf of Russian government interest, nor did they file disclosures under the Foreign Agents Registration Act or FARA. This was one of the best examples of Putin's propaganda.\" So, now, Senate Intel Committee Chair, Chuck Grassley, wants to know why, if fusion GPS was hired by Natalia Veselnitskaya, they never registered as a foreign agent. Grassley also points out, that while Trump allies -- Paul Manafort and Mike Flynn -- have often been criticized for retroactively registering under FARA, Hillary Clinton confidante, Cindy Blumenthal never did, even though he gave Clinton documents on behalf of a foreign political party. Here is Grassley."

      "utterance": "So you're supposed to be there, today. They evoked a two hour rule, which is very unusual. So now, you're going to testify on Thursday. Let's get to sort of the heart of the matter here. You feel that the Magnitsky Act, which was sanctions against some of Vladimir Putin's sort of elite crew in Russia, and he very much wants them lifted and has had this campaign to do so, which -- Natalia Veselnitskaya have been a part of. That there's a link also to all of that from Fusion GPS, which is an American -- firm, as Trace just said started by two Wall Street Journal reporters. What is their connection to all of this in your mind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL BROWDER, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CEO",
      "utterance": "Not in my mind, it's on paper. Basically, Natalia Veselnitskaya put together a huge team, a very well-financed team -- people in Washington, D.C., to help her on this project to get these Magnitsky sanctions lifted. And what we know, as a matter of fact, is that she employed a law firm called Baker Hostetler, and Baker Hostetler employed Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson as part of this campaign to get the Magnitsky act lifted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And they never registered with FARA, which is the entity that you have to do in terms of compliance to say we're an American company, but we're doing some work for a foreign entity, that never happened. I just want to read something from Thor Halverson, who's a human rights advocate, who is also scheduled to testify, and here's what he says about Fusion GPS. He said it's a sort of thing they specialize in. He's talking about the dossier that was compiled by, then candidate -- now President Donald Trump. They say the mainstream false smears, allegations that are so salacious and over-the-top that people assume they must be true. He said they did this with Browder, meaning you, of course. They did this with two other whistleblowers, and they did it to me. So how did Fusion GPS get linked up with this Russian lobbyist entity?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROWDER",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not sure how they got linked up, but what I do know is that when they did get linked up they didn't spare any effort to try to basically run with the Putin narrative and try to change the entire story of the murder of my lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. What Glenn Simpson did was he pitch to journalists in major publications that Sergei Magnitsky hadn't been murdered. That he died of natural causes, which is patently false. He said that Sergei Magnitsky wasn't the whistleblower, that he was a criminal. When in fact, Sergei Magnitsky was murdered because."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So they tried to dismantle your story, which I know you believe is the truth. About what happened to your friend, because they didn't like the sanctions and they want to sort of dismantle that whole underpinning to the story. In terms of the meeting that Natalia Veselnitskaya had with Donald Trump, Jr., and Paul Manafort, and others, they all came to that meeting under the pretense in the email that Veselnitskaya was going to deliver some dirt on Hillary Clinton. Knowing the players here, how do you think that part of it got cooked up? Because I know you believe that they were really just trying to get them in the room to get them on board with lifting these sanctions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROWDER",
      "utterance": "So what you have to understand about these people is that this is effectively a Russian operation, a Russian government operation. There's a specific objective, which is at the top of Putin's list, which is to get rid of these sanctions. And they would have sat down for many weeks beforehand and they would have studying their target. In this case, the target is Donald Trump Jr. They try to figure out something that they could say, some offer they could make, some enticement that they can put forward which would get him into a room or potentially into some type of deal. And so, they obviously looked on what they thought was the most interesting thing that they could offer, and that was what they offered because they had something big they wanted in return."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So they claimed that once they got in the room, you know, it was all about adoption, which we now know is linked to the Magnitsky Act and all of that.

The regime successfully test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile back on the fourth of July, and this news follows a chilling report that Kim Jong- un could be capable of launching a nuclear attack against a North American city, according to their outlook on this by next year. So a move that sparked a lot of heated debate tonight, President Trump shatters yet again, another Obama-era policy, issuing a brand-new ban, this time on transgender people in the military, the president this morning tweeting that he will not allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory, and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you, he ended it. Joining me now, Robin Biro is the first openly gay army ranger, and Carl Higbie is a former navy SEAL. Gentlemen, welcome to both of you. Let me get your thoughts on this.

One thing that I have to say that I love about our military is it is essentially a giant melting pot of all different races, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, and we always are able to see beyond those differences and accomplish one goal, which is defending our country and fighting the common fight. We have been taught and trained. It's been beaten into our heads to look past these differences. This right now is dividing us. Frankly, I'm concerned for the over 6,000 currently serving trans troops that we have, and I worry what's going to happen to them."

    {
      "speaker": "CARL HIGBIE, VETERAN NAVY SEAL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that sometimes we make personal choices that affect our career opportunities, and this might be one of those cases. The first thing I want to address here, is look, the military's job is to put bullets in bad guys. If you think adding an additional variable like transgenderism, whatever that is, to an already stacked against us fight, it doesn't help. If you can answer the question honestly, how does adding transgender to the military helps us defend the United States of America? I'm happy to have that conversation, but the fact is it doesn't. This is not a social experiment. The military is there to defend the United States. Not anything else. It's not a time for you to try new things."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Carl, I mean, I have never been in battle, you have. And I respect that greatly for both of you. So, you know, feel free to jump in here. But the same conversations were heard when African-Americans entered the military, when women entered the military, that it was all about all being the same, and that that was a problem that could not be overcome. Why is this any different?"
    },

      "speaker": "HIGBIE",

You can change, you can add or subtract anything via surgery you want, but the fact of the matter is you're still a guy or a girl as you were born. This is something that adds a totally new dynamic. We've two genders right now, we've done away with the race thing, because as you mention before the race thing has been done away in the military. We have two genders right now. You start adding a half male."

      "utterance": "The fact that it's -- and Robin, you can jump in here. I mean, there's already -- the estimates range for 7 to 11,000 that I've read today, people who are already serving. Now, there's a decision that needs to be made here, whether or not you in the middle of this process, whether you're undergoing surgery, if there are medical reasons why you cannot be there, and no one should necessarily expect that these surgeries should be paid for by the military, Robin, do agree with that part of this?"

      "speaker": "BIRO",

The military pays for the medication, just like you would for any other illness. They do not pay for the surgery, but they pay for the medical condition to treat genders dysphoria, which is a medical condition."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's worth pointing out that when asked, I mean, we don't have time to play this right not, but General Mattis at his confirmation hearing said, you know, frankly, senator, I never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with. And he indicated in a number of ways, Carl, that he was OK with this program moving forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HIGBIE",
      "utterance": "Look, I have no problem. If you want to be transgender in your own time, go ahead. But here's the fact, when I came back from Iraq in 2009, I had skin cancer in my family, so I want to get tested for skin cancer. The military wouldn't pay to send me to a dermatologist, but now they're going to pay for people to be transgender? That just doesn't make sense. It's on the backs of the American taxpayer. And that's not what I'm OK with. Do whatever you want on your own time. Don't put it on the backs of the military. And, certainly, don't make us conform because many of the military members I've spoke too, actually, all of them, don't support this policy."

Talking about their agenda, which is about jobs, and the economy, and their children's education, and repealing and replacing Obamacare, and so he is going to continue to go out and bypass the mainstream media.

Look, this investigation has been going on for nearly one year, August. It will be a year next month. Multiple congressional investigations, the department of justice, special counsel, millions of taxpayer dollars spent, and not one ounce, not one shred of evidence that there's been any collusion or working with the Russians at all."

There is this man, he ran for president, yes, but the moment he holds no elected office. What do the Globe would like him to do exactly about health care and other pressing issues on the hill is unclear. Still, the Globe never missing opportunity to go after the former governor writes, one Republican who appears to be unbothered by all the political tumult would be Mitt Romney, to which we say, Mitt Romney gave people a chance to make him the decision-maker. Having been denied that honor, we're glad to see that he's enjoying his summer and his family.
