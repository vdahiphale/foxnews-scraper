Former Democratic Senate aide Jackson Cosko, he was accused of revealing the numbers and addresses of the Republican senators, remember. He has a more complicated background than first known. The Daily Caller News Foundation reporting that not only did he possess that sensitive Senate data, but he's also the son of a wealthy family from California who has, big surprise, close ties to Dianne Feinstein. Now, remember, Senator Feinstein, who many believe timed that leak to the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh in order to destroy his nomination, yes, that Di Fi, well, the connections are hard to miss. The wealthy family, the ties to folks in power, it just represents another example in a long line of offenses to people on the right that people on the left would rather go unchallenged and have no repercussions, of course. Between the college admissions scam we talked about earlier this week, the Covington Catholic story, the Smollett hoax, and so many others, offenses seem to be quickly excused so long as the victims are on the right. So what should we take from all of this? We need real consequences and real repercussions in cases where the powerful are allowed to act, it seems, to a lot of us, with impunity, even to the point of criminality. Also tonight, as we mentioned at the top of the show there is a tendency on the left to not just use tragedy to win political arguments, but to shut down speech they don't like.

I think what the left has lost the ability to do is make an argument, and the reason they have lost that ability is because they are in charge now. They were for free speech when they are on the outside looking in, fighting the establishment. Now they are the establishment, and so free speech is a threat to them, as it is to all establishments, by the way. They're not the first people in charge to clamp down. Woodrow Wilson put people in prison for disagreeing with the First World War.

It was horrific, women, children exploded, you know, Catholic priest had been murdered during mass in Iraq. Christians have been killed and brutalized across the globe and mostly of course by Islamists, radical Muslims who take it upon themselves to kill any infidel, whether they're Muslim, Christian, Jews or whoever.

As a result, a 59-year old woman is now dead, brutally murdered in her own home, she lived alone and the response from the county officials. Well, silence. Now we're now going to tick through a few names, central to this outrage. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren whose district this happened in is refusing to come on this show or even give us a written comment. Santa Clara county council, James Williams said this was all ICE's fault and that they should have gotten a warrant against Carranza. Now he's not speaking to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE tonight, however can't get them on the line and Santa Clara county supervisor Dave Cortese said that in general, ICE doesn't show up to take custody in a timely manner to avoid release into the community.\" He also won't talk to us. Santa Clara city councilwoman Pam Foley, whose district includes the neighborhood where Larson was killed had nothing to add beyond being, \"deeply saddened by Larson's death. She declined to appear on the show tonight and finally Maricela Gutierrez, Executive director of the Services Immigrant Rights Network in California. She says ICE cooperation, \"would have a chilling effect on illegals coming forward to report crimes. What? She likewise refused to appear tonight. Now, here now to react Claude Arnold, former special agent in charge of ICE in Los Angeles, Joe Alioto Veronese, he's a Democrat running for DA in San Francisco and Mark Morgan, former Obama border patrol chief. Mark, this complete lack of interest or the concern of an American citizen, brutally slain, stabbed apparently multiple times, it was a grisly - grisly scene in her home.

He had met Hayden Williams, the young man who was on the Berkeley campus, who was doing nothing but handing out literature or whatever and got punched in the face, unprovoked.

      "utterance": "No. No can do. There is a tendency, by the way, for the left to use tragedy to not just win a political argument but to circumscribe, limit speech in the process. Tucker Carlson is here late on a Friday night to explain, next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Here's an important follow-up to one of the more under-covered stories of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing. Former Democratic Senate aide Jackson Cosko, he was accused of revealing the numbers and addresses of the Republican senators, remember. He has a more complicated background than first known. The Daily Caller News Foundation reporting that not only did he possess that sensitive Senate data, but he's also the son of a wealthy family from California who has, big surprise, close ties to Dianne Feinstein. Now, remember, Senator Feinstein, who many believe timed that leak to the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh in order to destroy his nomination, yes, that Di Fi, well, the connections are hard to miss. The wealthy family, the ties to folks in power, it just represents another example in a long line of offenses to people on the right that people on the left would rather go unchallenged and have no repercussions, of course. Between the college admissions scam we talked about earlier this week, the Covington Catholic story, the Smollett hoax, and so many others, offenses seem to be quickly excused so long as the victims are on the right. So what should we take from all of this? We need real consequences and real repercussions in cases where the powerful are allowed to act, it seems, to a lot of us, with impunity, even to the point of criminality. Also tonight, as we mentioned at the top of the show there is a tendency on the left to not just use tragedy to win political arguments, but to shut down speech they don't like. Now here's just one example of this tactic."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, in other words, stop advocating for border enforcement using strong language, stop talking about sovereignty, Donald Trump, and anyone else who believes the same way he does. We're now joined by our own Tucker Carlson, of course the host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" at 8:00 p.m. right here on Fox. Tucker, of course, you've gone through your deal this week. But it isn't enough to blame Trump. They want to go further than that, don't they? They want to circumscribe speech."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, of course. And virtually every crisis or disaster or mass shooting, terror attack, even natural disaster, is used as a pretext to work toward a preexisting goal, which is to make it a more authoritarian society and get rid of the rights that are in the way of accumulating more power. The First and Second Amendments are first and second on that list."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The left was already moving against the NRA and Second Amendment rights. You've heard that all over the Internet, Tucker. And of course, that's happening in New Zealand, but let's focus on the United States. The left was always priding itself, go back 30 years. They were the freedom party. Make love, not war. We're for happiness, love, all the smiley faces. But now the left is the anti-freedom party, and we're seeing this in so many ways. Obviously, on the speech front, they want to shut down people they don't like. They want to try to get them off the air or change the way they use language. But now when a freak, an evildoer, terrorist, in another country thousands of miles away, when he uses a phrase, now no one else can use that phrase. Where does this end up going, Tucker?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "You can't squelch ideas, actually, over time. And the Internet, for all of its unintended bad consequences, and there are certainly many, probably too many to count, the one thing that is heartening about the Internet is you can't really control it. It's just not built to be controlled. And so, this is fruitless. You can shut down this social media engine or you can kick these people off Twitter, you can deplatform people and not let them use PayPal. But in the end, if an idea seems right, people will be convinced by it. I think what the left has lost the ability to do is make an argument, and the reason they have lost that ability is because they are in charge now. They were for free speech when they are on the outside looking in, fighting the establishment. Now they are the establishment, and so free speech is a threat to them, as it is to all establishments, by the way. They're not the first people in charge to clamp down. Woodrow Wilson put people in prison for disagreeing with the First World War. But it's so interesting that it has happened so quickly that the same boomer generation, the same people who were protesting in Berkeley in 64 for the free speech movement, are now telling us hate speech is real and you need to be punished if you disagree with them. It's amazing."

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "I don't really. I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case. I don't know enough about it yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, so Donald Trump comes out and makes some brief remarks. The lower third at CNN for, I think it seemed like it was an hour, maybe it was shorter than that, Tucker, was Donald Trump, basically, downplays white nationalism, or claims that white nationalism isn't on the rise. And I'm thinking, you might as well just mock him up in a white hood in a KKK outfit, OK, because that's what they were -- it wasn't even implying. It was explicit. Unbelievable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's also boring. What does this story have to do with Trump? It was a Brit in New Zealand shooting up a mosque, two mosques. That has nothing to do with the United States, or Donald Trump. It's a measure of their monomania. Everything is about Trump. And I think that's one of the problems that I have with this moment is not only is it authoritarian, obviously, but it's just completely uninteresting. If everything is about Trump then there is no room for anything else. There's a lot of other stuff going on. And you see what I'm saying? So rather than look at, why did this guy do this? We're not exactly sure. The manifesto obviously gives us a lot of clues, but none of that has to do with Trump. It's weird."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Tucker, there was a moment where Peter Bergen, who is fairly well respected, he interviewed bin Laden years ago. He's a pretty interesting guy."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But he was on CNN today -- I've interviewed him a bunch of time, I'm sure you have, too. But he's trying to equate New Zealand and the horrific act of terrorism there with the general populist movement in Europe, the pro-sovereignty movement. And I want you to listen closely to how he phrases it, because I think that's where ultimately this is going, to a totally ideological war because of the connection and the words used in this manifesto. Let's watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETER BERGEN, JOURNALIST",
      "utterance": "Look at the rise of white, essentially ultranationalist parties in Europe. These used to be very marginal five years ago. But Marine Le Pen is now a very powerful politician in France. Geert Wilders is a very powerful politician in Holland. Poland and Hungary are controlled by ultranationalist politicians. So the whole environment, it's not just simply white nationalists, violent extremists, but the whole environment in the west has become much more sympathetic to these ideas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Tucker, they are sympathetic to the mass killer because the elites failed Europe, and the standard of living of most people hasn't been going up, and they are frustrated with their governments. So they are making that connection now. That was probably the most infuriating comment of the day for me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "His point about nationalism is right, I think. I don't think it's a bad thing. Countries should be nationalist. Nation states should be nationalist states. Of course. They are nations. It doesn't mean -- exactly, they don't need to be violent or ethno-states or anything creepy like that. I personally reject all of that stuff, obviously. But they should act in their own interest. That's not weird. Angela Merkel is weird. She's the anomaly, did a lot to destroy German. And if a resurgent right, a nationalist right emerges in Germany and it will make us all nervous, definitely me included, you can blame Angela Merkel. So what's so interesting is a smart guy like Bergen, who actually I know him and I like him, he's a smart guy."

      "utterance": "Yes, me, too."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But take the next step. Why is this happening? It's happening because the people in charge are morons and they govern for their own benefit. They're totally ideological and they can't change course even when the current course has been proven to be disastrous. So that's the real story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The global elites screwed up, the people reacted, and sometimes they are going to overreact, and then they never take a moment and pause and say, gee, how can we do this better? How can we make a difference here? Unbelievable. Tucker, love having you on. I know you stayed up late. Thank you so much. We really appreciate."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "All right, it's time for my Twitter smackdown of the day. And of course, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeting up a storm today, including this, \"Daily reminder that we have a Muslim ban in this country made out of the president's hostility to Muslim people with little to no supporting evidence, and a Republican Party that tolerates it. There is so much work to do. Repealing the ban is square one.\" Well, I had to set her straight, obviously, and tweeted, \"Ignorance must be bliss. The travel ban is not a Muslim ban. Obviously if it was it would have included the three biggest Muslim countries and it doesn't -- Indonesia, India, and Pakistan.\" If you didn't learn this in your Congressional orientation or any little reading that you do on the side, maybe you should go back to hit the books.
