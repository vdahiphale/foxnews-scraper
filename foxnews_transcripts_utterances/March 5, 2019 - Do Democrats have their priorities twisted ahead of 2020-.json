      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” We want to begin this evening with the story of Mike, the headless chicken. It sounds implausible, but it really happened and it tells you something. It begins this way. One afternoon in the fall of 1945, a farmer in western Colorado called Lloyd Olson walked into the barn yard to get dinner. His wife said she wanted some chicken, so Olson found a five-month-old bird called \"Mike\" and then beheaded it with a hatchet, but then a funny thing happened, Mike didn't die. In fact, Mike lived another full year and a half, he lived long enough to become a traveling sideshow attraction before he ultimately choked to death in a motel room in Phoenix, a sad story. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the question is, how did Mike live for 18 months without a head? Well, scientist had a number of explanations for how he did it, but the real reason is simple. Mike had no idea he'd been killed so he just kept going. Mike was too dumb to die. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Something very similar just happened in the Russia investigation this week. For two years, we've been told that there was some form of collusion between the Russian government and the 2016 Trump campaign. Details were sketchy, so we paid for an independent counsel and a number of congressional investigations to find out exactly what happened. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then last week, Democrats hit pay dirt. They produced the perfect witness, the one man in America who would know exactly what happened between the Trump campaign and Russia. Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen was Donald Trump's personal lawyer for ten years. Communications between Trump and Cohen were supposed to be privileged and protected, so Trump would have been free to tell Cohen anything and everything. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If there's one person who would know firsthand about Russian collusion and all its detail, it's Michael Cohen. And if there's one person who would be happy to tell Congress about Russian collusion in all its detail, it's also Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen hates Trump. He has said so repeatedly and vehemently. So last week, Democrats on Capitol Hill put Cohen under oath and asked him about Russian collusion. Here's what happened next. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

In fact, they are still issuing subpoenas. Yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee sent out at least 81 of them.

We can watch on television. We can assess for ourselves what we think of Jerry Nadler and his friends. Best of luck to the Democrats on that. But take three steps back. What's the cost of all of this? To the rest of the country? Well, it's hard to assess that really, but a story in the paper this morning does give you some hint of it. It's this. In 2017, the combined death rates from alcohol, drugs and suicide in this country hit their highest recorded levels ever -- ever -- since recordkeeping began. But you know this if you live here.

It's like it's not even happening. Maybe that's because in their world, it isn't happening. Everything is fine where they live. People there are prosperous and secure and happy and they plan on staying that way.

The people in charge of this country are ignoring them as they die. You've got to wonder how long this can continue. It's too frivolous, it's too dishonest.

So were I her, I would ask this gentleman in the photo here, who is a multimillionaire tech and finance smart guy who is running her campaign, I would say, \"Hey, why am I moving this money, these donations that were made to me from this PAC over to this other account that I control? I control them both, why move it? What difference does it make?\" Well, one difference could be, look at the rules that govern both and the rules that govern a PAC are very clear and much more strict about how much you can spend? Where it came from? What you have to disclose? How you list things? When it's an LLC, a limited liability corporation, the rules are very different, much lighter and she marked a lot of stuff strategic consulting, and you can do that rather than itemizing things. Now, is this illegal? I don't know. Both sides are going to have their arguments in court about this, no doubt. And by the way, the rules that govern campaign finance are written by the very people in power who are trying to hold onto it. So talk about the fox guarding the hen house. So the people who wrote these roles that she's saying, \"We are going to rewrite the rules,\" more people who have come to power that are trying to hang onto it. So is this legal under the rules? I don't know. We have people saying it is not, both sides will argue and we will see, but what's interesting is you just have to ask yourself, why did you need to move it from one thing you control totally to another thing you control totally in order to make the expenditures? It sounds like that's dark money that she's talking about, but we will see when they investigate.",

They don't really want -- they prefer to have their agency expropriated by others who can take care of themselves. Because to not be a victim means to say, \"I don't want to be exceptionalized.

Well, these attacks are the reason tech companies are in part so vocally left wing, it's why James Damor at Google had to be fired immediately for expressing his opinions. At Google, leaders decided to do an internal investigation on the question of the pay gap. They reviewed every employee, every employee's job, every employee's performance to see if there was sexism lurking in the hearts of their employees and reflected in their paychecks, and it turns out there was sexism. They found white a bit of it. There were thousands of people being paid less than colleagues doing the same work, but in a twist, most of these employees were in fact men. Google and \"The New York Times\" were apparently shocked by this finding, but why would they be? It's exactly what you would expect. The press has spent years attacking one sex as naturally bigoted and demand the other be hired more, paid more, prioritized more and thanks to those calls, guess what they were?

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” We want to begin this evening with the story of Mike, the headless chicken. It sounds implausible, but it really happened and it tells you something. It begins this way. One afternoon in the fall of 1945, a farmer in western Colorado called Lloyd Olson walked into the barn yard to get dinner. His wife said she wanted some chicken, so Olson found a five-month-old bird called \"Mike\" and then beheaded it with a hatchet, but then a funny thing happened, Mike didn't die. In fact, Mike lived another full year and a half, he lived long enough to become a traveling sideshow attraction before he ultimately choked to death in a motel room in Phoenix, a sad story. But the question is, how did Mike live for 18 months without a head? Well, scientist had a number of explanations for how he did it, but the real reason is simple. Mike had no idea he'd been killed so he just kept going. Mike was too dumb to die. Something very similar just happened in the Russia investigation this week. For two years, we've been told that there was some form of collusion between the Russian government and the 2016 Trump campaign. Details were sketchy, so we paid for an independent counsel and a number of congressional investigations to find out exactly what happened. Then last week, Democrats hit pay dirt. They produced the perfect witness, the one man in America who would know exactly what happened between the Trump campaign and Russia. Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen was Donald Trump's personal lawyer for ten years. Communications between Trump and Cohen were supposed to be privileged and protected, so Trump would have been free to tell Cohen anything and everything. If there's one person who would know firsthand about Russian collusion and all its detail, it's Michael Cohen. And if there's one person who would be happy to tell Congress about Russian collusion in all its detail, it's also Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen hates Trump. He has said so repeatedly and vehemently. So last week, Democrats on Capitol Hill put Cohen under oath and asked him about Russian collusion. Here's what happened next."

After two years, the most far- fetched spy story in American history ends abruptly. The Russia conspiracy is dead, killed with hatchet on stump finality on live television. But here's the twist, nobody in Washington seemed to notice. They had no idea what just happened. Like Mike the headless chicken, they are still running around bumping into things. In fact, they are still issuing subpoenas. Yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee sent out at least 81 of them. The subpoenas are aimed at individuals, organizations and government agencies that might have damaging information about Donald Trump. Information that for some reason, a reason nobody can explain, his personal attorney of 10 years did not have. Apparently, it's extra double secret information. If this all seems a little nuts, prepare yourself. We learned on CNN yesterday that it's simply the beginning."

Democratic leaders have assured us again and again, they have no plans to impeach, but they are lying. Their voters demand impeachment. So really they have no choice. In some ways, an impeachment trial would be an upgrade from the creepy secretive process we have now. Shadowy intelligence agencies won't be spying on anyone during and impeachment trial. Federal agents won't be rousting anyone from bed at rifle point. Impeachment is a public and fairly transparent process. We can watch on television. We can assess for ourselves what we think of Jerry Nadler and his friends. Best of luck to the Democrats on that. But take three steps back. What's the cost of all of this? To the rest of the country? Well, it's hard to assess that really, but a story in the paper this morning does give you some hint of it. It's this. In 2017, the combined death rates from alcohol, drugs and suicide in this country hit their highest recorded levels ever -- ever -- since recordkeeping began. But you know this if you live here. If you haven't been to the funeral of someone who's died from booze, drugs or suicide lately, count yourself lucky because they're everywhere. The surreal thing is that nobody on television ever mentions any of this. It's like it's not even happening. Maybe that's because in their world, it isn't happening. Everything is fine where they live. People there are prosperous and secure and happy and they plan on staying that way. They resent any attempt to remind them that in the world beyond the coastal cities, America is killing itself. That means that people who built this country are dying. The people in charge of this country are ignoring them as they die. You've got to wonder how long this can continue. It's too frivolous, it's too dishonest. They keep telling us, the only thing that matters is Trump. They know that isn't true. They just want to talk about the rest of it because they are implicated in it. Rochelle Richie is a former Press Secretary for the House Democratic Policy and Communication Committee and she is nice enough to join us tonight. Richelle, a lot for coming on."

That's a good sign for Republicans and that's sort of a sign to Democrats that, \"Look, you can't just ride this 'We hate Trump' train and think that people are going to support you as far as an impeachment.\" There has to be a political process and that's why Nadler said in that interview with George Stephanopoulos, where he said, \"Look, we have to persuade the American people.

But they didn't run an endless investigations and they certainly, Tucker, didn't run on some of the other stuff they've been talking about, such as reparations, which is Elizabeth Warren and others who are running for President are now talking about reparations. She wants to extend it to Native Americans. They are talking about all of the elements of the Green New Deal, which is extraordinary. I mean, we are talking here about a program of actions that are not simply implausible or difficult, they are impossible. These are things that can't happen and won't, but four or five of their presidential candidates have endorsed it and are cosponsors of that. Not to mention the fact that they are talking about Medicare for All, which is utterly unaffordable and every serious person who's looked at it will tell you that, but this is what they are doing. They've staked out these positions, these exotic positions on a range of issues, they're following Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez around as the pied piper of the new Democratic Caucus. She has completely eclipsed Nancy Pelosi and is undoubtedly giving her fits. So I don't think that if this keeps up, Tucker, and you can couple that with this endless investigations and so on, that this is really a very good platform to run on in 2020."

You may be able to do some other things, but they are going to be overshadowed by all of this exotic stuff or whatever the stuff is, it makes a lot of news and that's why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for all her callousness and arguable shallowness is able to become so prominent. She makes news and she's kind of compelling. She's kind of adorable sort of in the way that a five-year-old child can be adorable, and she is at the moment, I think it's fair to say, she's the de facto leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives."

But if this keeps up and she is able to continue to promote these exotic positions and get people - prominent people, important people to sign on to them, she will leave that party off a cliff. I don't think there's much doubt. And in the meantime, of course, we thought or we should expect the Mueller report to him and as expected now, it does not convict the President or accuse the President of collaborating with the Russians to get himself elected, I think a lot of the air will go out of the investigation because no matter what Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, no matter what they try to do, they don't have anything like the investigative resources Mueller has and therefore their probes cannot be expected to find anything like as much as he does and if he doesn't find it, it's probably not there."

So it should be noted that the group that brought the complaint to the FEC is a right-leaning organization. we want to say that upfront, but if you boil it down, basically what she and her Chief of Staff are accused of doing is moving almost a million dollars from a PAC fund that they controlled over to an LLC, a limited liability corporation that they controlled. So were I her, I would ask this gentleman in the photo here, who is a multimillionaire tech and finance smart guy who is running her campaign, I would say, \"Hey, why am I moving this money, these donations that were made to me from this PAC over to this other account that I control? I control them both, why move it? What difference does it make?\" Well, one difference could be, look at the rules that govern both and the rules that govern a PAC are very clear and much more strict about how much you can spend? Where it came from? What you have to disclose? How you list things? When it's an LLC, a limited liability corporation, the rules are very different, much lighter and she marked a lot of stuff strategic consulting, and you can do that rather than itemizing things. Now, is this illegal? I don't know. Both sides are going to have their arguments in court about this, no doubt. And by the way, the rules that govern campaign finance are written by the very people in power who are trying to hold onto it. So talk about the fox guarding the hen house. So the people who wrote these roles that she's saying, \"We are going to rewrite the rules,\" more people who have come to power that are trying to hang onto it. So is this legal under the rules? I don't know. We have people saying it is not, both sides will argue and we will see, but what's interesting is you just have to ask yourself, why did you need to move it from one thing you control totally to another thing you control totally in order to make the expenditures? It sounds like that's dark money that she's talking about, but we will see when they investigate."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "It doesn't make it bright money. It doesn't make a transparent money, it makes it obscured money. At the very least, it is obscured. There is not a bright light shining on it. But, Tucker, I mean, you made the point before, think about what socialism is. Like the very definition is a government takeover of the means of production. It's a power grab. That's what she's been all about, is a power grab. \"I'm in charge, I'm the boss.\" We go to Washington, we decide, we get the means of production, we get control and we tell you all what you get. It all has the same theme if you boil it down to its most basic sense, so she doesn't want other people using planes, but she will use a plane going back and forth between D.C. and New York because she's important. It means that she's the ruling class. She's powerful. She's important. So she gets to do these things, but for you and me, we are just the serfs along the way, so we shouldn't have a carbon footprint, we should do all these other things."

It's big business in America today because to be a victim is to take on the mantle of permanent innocence. It is to become a certified moral icon and when you become a certified moral icon, you become a permanent innocent person. Your transgressor or your alleged transgressor becomes a guilty person from whom you can extract some kind of reparation and I think she bought -- She has bought into the cult of victimology as have many Americans and there's also a deeper sense of -- a deeper sense that is going on in this country in which victimized -- people who take themselves to be victims luxuriate in a sense of infantilization, I think, and they don't really want to grow up. They don't really want -- they prefer to have their agency expropriated by others who can take care of themselves. Because to not be a victim means to say, \"I don't want to be exceptionalized. I don't want to be taken as a special person, as a special case. I want to take care of myself.\" And one of the things I talk about in my book, in \"Overcome\" is that, since the end of legal oppression in this country with the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a lot of people who were legal victims of the state simply don't know what to do with themselves. So what they do is they go about creating a victim identity like this fellow, Jussie Smollett, who comparatively speaking is in the 1% in the world."

The description for that course is especially long and it goes into everything from the abolition of prisons to ableism, speciesism, but of course views them all through a leftist pro-pleasure perspective."

So is this, this is from Northwestern, apparently, a good school. Unsettling Whiteness -- 76 grand to go to Northwestern by the way -- and it's got the word \"narratable,\" which is not a word, so wouldn't a college professor know. I mean, right?

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, for many years, the left, particularly the shallow televised left has attacked companies for their sexism. Especially in tech, they have told us about a pay gap, women they tell us are paid less than men for no reason other than bigotry, sexism. Well, these attacks are the reason tech companies are in part so vocally left wing, it's why James Damor at Google had to be fired immediately for expressing his opinions. At Google, leaders decided to do an internal investigation on the question of the pay gap. They reviewed every employee, every employee's job, every employee's performance to see if there was sexism lurking in the hearts of their employees and reflected in their paychecks, and it turns out there was sexism. They found white a bit of it. There were thousands of people being paid less than colleagues doing the same work, but in a twist, most of these employees were in fact men. Google and \"The New York Times\" were apparently shocked by this finding, but why would they be? It's exactly what you would expect. The press has spent years attacking one sex as naturally bigoted and demand the other be hired more, paid more, prioritized more and thanks to those calls, guess what they were? So maybe the best way to achieve fairness is to advocate for fairness but that has never occurred to anyone in Washington, they are too dumb. Well, American tech companies used to not so long ago, tout themselves as champions of freedom in American life. Now tech has replaced government as the leading vector of censorship. Google employees have been caught discussing how to manipulate search result to promote their views on immigration among other things. Facebook has clamped down on conservative friendly new stories. Almost every tech company increasingly is willing to use its censorship powers to shape what you see in order to benefit their political agenda. Raheem Kassam is the new global editor-in-chief of humanevents.com and we are happy to have him come tonight. Raheem, thanks very much. Do you think it's fair to say that the tech sector has replaced government as the main censorship threat that we face?"

They're doing it in the United Kingdom. They are doing it all across Europe, and indeed, all around the world, but what's particularly egregious about it is that they are the benefactors not of the free market, they are the actual benefactors of government intervention on their behalf. The Communications Decency Act in the United States allows the Googles and the Facebooks, and the Twitters to be classed as non-publishers which means that they are just platforms and can get away with making editorial decisions. You know, I was banned last week from Facebook. That's an editorial decision they made and I have, as an individual, no recourse against them, no legal recourse against them, they are protected within U.S. legislation against me as an individual --"

Even some of the hard left in the U.K. are now being kicked off and they are starting to concern themselves with free speech all of a sudden. So it's about protecting everyone and what I don't understand, I mean, somebody who has been very good on this, by the way in particular is Donald Trump, Jr. he almost -- if you could describe it like this, rode to my rescue when I was banned from Facebook last week and made it a big international story, but it's not about me and it shouldn't be about people like me who can get Don Jr. to help me out, ordinary people use social media to keep in touch with their loved ones, to get pictures of their grandchildren and there's a big question mark, I think, over especially older people who use it to keep in touch with people who are being kicked off because they've said something incorrect or they've said something politically incorrect, right? And that's who I'm concerned about and I'm afraid your congressmen and your senators especially on the right are just sort of sitting there and letting this happen."

I mean, politicians claim all kinds of things so sometimes, it helps to judge them by what they do rather than what they say. Kamala Harris was the Attorney General of California for six long years. During her tenure, one of her top aides allegedly sexually harassed an underling, a coworker. He resigned over those allegations just three months ago. So what did Kamala Harris do in response? Well, in a remarkable interview that she gave recently, Harris admitted that in fact, she has never even bothered to talk to the accuser."

She just knows that she's morally superior and that's why she deserves to be President and that's why she is above gestures like actually caring about the people she claims to support. If only the employee had faked a hate crime instead, should be getting a lot of personal attention, but she didn't. Well, Hillary Clinton's never ending blame tour across America is premised on the idea that she is very popular and was robbed of the presidency in 2016 by underhanded means and that you feel it very sorry for her because her dreams have been dashed. But increasingly even Democrats want her to go away. They said it on CNN recently. Watch this."

This is the Hillary they voted for, but that sound after she noted that she was not going to be running in 2020, everybody thought it was an asteroid. It was all the Democrats breathing a sigh of relief and all the Republicans sobbing through bitters tears that they will miss her, but she says she is not going to be leaving, but this is what is also strange about the Democratic position. They say she should be President now, Tucker, right? That she was the winner. She was robbed by the Russians and everything, which means 2020 would be her second term and yet they don't want her then. So are they saying in fact voting for her in 2016 was in fact a mistake? That's one of the points, but the other thing that's a real revelation here is that after over two years of her complaining of the entire system saying that the current President, Donald Trump colluded with the Russians and stole the election. Americans love fairness. We don't like anybody getting robbed and yet they say no, just don't come back even though this is supposed to be hers, it tells you that all of this rhetoric, Tucker, has not worked. The American people do not believe it. They didn't believe it then, they don't believe it now. In other words, recognizing even if subconsciously all of this has been a charade, that's important for the Trump administration and the Trump campaign to realize. The American people still care about truth of the matter, facts and delivering politically and delivering on the issues."

I should say, like when you going to the movies, you really know it's not real life but you're going to allow yourself to believe so for a minute because it would be fun for a few hours. In this case, it's been a nightmare for two years and they want to out. They want to be out of the theater. They want the movie to end. They want to move on to something else and the Trump administration -- and this is what we care about regardless of what your party is, we want the future back for our families. We want the economy to be better. We want that this nonsense to end. What the Democrats are planning in the House is going to be a disaster. They've created now, not just the fact that it is a witch hunt, but they've created an enemies list with the 81 individuals and entities that they are going to try to persecute or material on Trump.
