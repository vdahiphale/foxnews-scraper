Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent of \"The Washington Examiner,\" Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for \"Axios,\" and Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" Gentlemen, welcome. Byron, your thoughts on the crime crisis we're seeing in major cities coast to coast? BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, we just heard Mayor Lightfoot saying she is doing absolutely everything that can be done. And that's just self-evidently not true. Now, lately she and the police chief have taking to blaming some judges, some of the courts, for bonding out, for freeing violent suspects. And there's something to that. That's really part of the problem. But they are focused totally -- Democrats, Mayor Lightfoot, the Biden administration, on the question of guns. And if you listen to President Biden's crime address a while back, it was just Democratic same old, same old. We've got to get assault weapons out of the hands of criminals. The fact is long guns play a very, very small part in the violence crisis in Chicago. It's handguns, handguns all over the place. So Democrats do not seem to be equipped to deal with the problem they are facing right now.",

The only context in which they wanted to be talking about crime in Biden's first year as president was in the context of criminal justice reform and increased accountability for police officers. But the homicide rates that are increasing in cities across the country have forced this issue on to their plate. And what I have learned from my reporting is that there are several Democrats who are quite influential in the party who are close to the White House who have been urging them, actually, for months that they need to get in front of this issue, that this issue is salient with voters. And, in fact, many believe who analyze the polling that the defund the police issue helped Republicans pick up seats in the House in the 2020 elections and is a real political liability for Joe Biden even though he himself has said that he doesn't support defunding the police. So, the fact that the White House is talking about this issue and trying to frame it on their own terms is revealing in and of itself because it's not something they want to talk about. They want to be talking about COVID and vaccines and the economy all day long.",

If it's seasonal, that means it's predictable, and maybe you should have been ready for it rather than taken by surprise for it. But more broadly, I think this is one of the lowest hanging fruits that could be possibly in front of Joe Biden. He actually has a record about putting more cops on the street going back to the crime bill. The rank and file Democratic voters are way to the right of the sort of blue checkmark Twitter crowd that seems to drive the messaging in all of this stuff, and the D.C. media elite. The average Democratic voter cares a lot about crime. We just saw that in New York City. He could very easily send a signal breaking with the people who have a stranglehold on the messaging of the Democratic Party by actually taking a popular position and taking crime and border security seriously.",

And what Republicans who are running from office believe is it's going to be an issue that effects swing voters and suburban women, some of these groups that they have drifted away from the Republican Party during the Trump years. So certainly, any time I talk to a candidate who is running for office, and they're the ones who are spending a ton of money on the research and the data, they see this as one of the most positive issues they have.
