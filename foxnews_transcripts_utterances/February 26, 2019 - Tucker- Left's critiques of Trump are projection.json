      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" in just a minute Donald Trump, Jr. will be joining us, Piers Morgan on the show, too, but first there are some negative things that you could say about Donald Trump. What is interesting that the left almost never says them and instead, they spend a lot of time telling how Trump is a fascist, who poses imminent and terrifying threat to our constitutional order. Sounds pretty scary. Is it true? Well, consider the major freedoms protected by our Bill of Rights - the document that makes America distinct from all other countries, freedom of speech, freedom of worship, the right to keep and bear arms, due process under the law. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, take a close look at today's news. Who exactly is threatening those freedoms? Is it Donald Trump? Whatever his faults, it is not Donald Trump. It is the left and they are doing it more aggressively than they ever have before. As usual, their critique of Trump is pure projection. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you want to know what the left is actually doing, listen to the way they attack other people. Start with our foundational freedom -- speech -- if they can tell you what to say, you are not free. There is nothing they can't make you do. That is why the Founders put it first. It is the freedom that comes before all others. The left has spent decades trying to weaken the First Amendment. They have done it in the sneakiest way possible by creating phony hate speech exemptions out of thin air. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So far, the courts have not accepted this idea, the idea that you can limit speech simply because someone else doesn't like it. So the left has a new plan now. They have allied with big corporations to make it impossible for people who say the wrong things to make a living in this country. You may have heard of the company PayPal, it's an online payment platform, the biggest. If you want to make money online and many people do, PayPal is essential. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In a recent interview with the \"Wall Street Journal,\" the CEO of PayPal, Dan Schulman explain that diversity and inclusion are his company's top values. But of course, he doesn't mean it, he means the opposite. Like most on the left, which Schulman actually wants is utter conformity, a world where only approved opinions are allowed. Last year PayPal, banned Alex Jones from using the platform for saying things they didn't like. They have also banned anti-Muslim activist, Laura Loomer, the publication \"V-Dare\" and a number of other people and organizations whose speech they believe should be silenced. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Schulman admitted that his company takes guidance on who to ban from the Southern Poverty Law Center -- that's an entirely fraudulent organization that works as an arm of the Democratic National Committee. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to Schulman quote, \"The line between free speech and hate, nobody teaches it to you in college. Nobody defined it in the law.\" Well, that is ridiculous, it is very much defined in the law and has been for 50 years. In 1969, the Supreme Court conclusively decided that hate speech does not exist. But it doesn't matter to Schulman or any of allies on the left. To them the First Amendment is merely a legal obstacle. It's something to subvert rather than celebrate. And PayPal is just one small example of this. Across the country, the left is working to crash any organization that stands in the way of its power. In New York State, Governor Andrew Cuomo is trying to shut down the NRA, why? For the crime of disagreeing with his agenda. Cuomo is harassing financial companies to do business with the group and it is working. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The media celebrate this just as they celebrate the endless attacks on Fox News. Their entire nonprofits whose only purpose is to close the network you are now watching. They are tireless and they are well-funded. If they someday succeed, you won't hear a word from the left about censorship, no. They will celebrate. An entire news media with one perspective -- that is their goal -- total conformity, which is the same thing as obedience. To achieve that, they are working to nullify the Second Amendment as well. Almost every Democrat now running for President would like to disarm the public and they say that out loud. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They plan to take your guns away. They have to. How else can they make the population obey? Once you understand that their goal is total control, their policies begin to make sense. To a literal person, for example, the Green New Deal sounds like it is something to do with the environment, it's green after all. But of course, if you really cared about the environment, the quality of air and water, you would push China to stop polluting. China is the world's biggest polluter by far, but the Green New Deal doesn't even mention China.

The President who arrived aboard Air Force One about 12 hours ago could be shrewdly using that trade deal as another reminder to Kim Jong-un about the thriving markets here in Vietnam and the potential for North Korea. And the fact that they could get in on the action to rebuild their own shattered economy. But first, Chairman Kim who arrived before the President aboard his armored train is going to have to move toward denuclearization. That is the position from President Trump in order to get the U.S. to remove sanctions that have been throttling the North Korean economy. Now to give you a sense of the excitement here on the ground before the Summit kicks off, there were crowds of Vietnamese people lining the streets when President Trump came from the airport to his hotel where we are now.

The results, not good. Some of the worst income inequality in the world. Ninety percent of the country lives in poverty while ruling class vacations in Switzerland, quite a spread. The average Venezuelan has lost 25 pounds from starvation, in a word, a \"disaster.\" But it could get worse for Venezuelans and for us here in the United States. The U.S. has just imposed new sanctions on Venezuela. Some lawmakers are now cheering on the idea of regime change there. Sound familiar? Recently, one Republican Senator tweeted out two photographs of former Libyan Dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The first showed Gaddafi smiling, the second showed him covered in dirt and blood, shortly before being tortured, sodomized and killed. The point was clear -- bad dictators will be overthrown by the United States. Maduro should watch out. What the tweet did not acknowledge is what happened to Libya after Hillary Clinton intervened and Gaddafi was toppled from power. Is Libya a thriving democracy now? No, it is not. It is still a war-torn hell hole worse even. Slave markets thrive in its major cities. Gaddafi once protected Europe from mass migration, now Libya is the main departure point for huge numbers of migrants coming into Europe illegally. The lesson here is pretty obvious. Sometimes, even horrible dictators are preferable to the chaos that replaces them. Our leaders have not learned that. How will attacking Venezuela improve this country? Will it make America safer? More prosperous? No, it won't. That is not even the point though. The idea that American foreign policy should somehow help America has become a quaint historical relic, something you don't see any more like phone booths or compelling network television. It is just gone. A Brookings Institution report predicts that the Venezuela crisis could create eight million refugees. That is even more than the number created by the Syrians Civil War. It is a disaster. Two reckless Florida Congressmen have proposed granting Venezuelans temporary protected status in the U.S. In other words, even if they came here illegally, they could stay forever. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Temporary status like this never ends. Nicaragua still has temporary status so it can recover from a hurricane that hit the country more than 20 years ago. If Venezuela gets this benefit, it will be around when your grandchildren are old, guaranteed. And if we send troops there, they will never leave either just like American troops had never left Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan or Korea for that matter. Permanent obligations to solve temporary problems. That is our foreign policy in a nutshell. In Washington, nobody learns anything. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam came very close to being expelled from the Democratic Party for the possibility that he wore a blackface decades ago.

So they are willing out of for money and for their position, for their job, to stop a bill that is the simplest thing in the world that all of us agree with that if there is a child that needs healthcare that we attend to the child.

She said, \"Look, you can have a situation where a male athlete in tennis or golf or one of the sports that relies a lot on perhaps power and size. A male athlete who is may be number 200 in the world and earning not much money that he might decide to -- decide that he wants to be a woman purely for financial gain, that he can just have some hormone treatment, doesn't need to have any surgery and then he can take part in women's sport, win vast amounts of money and perhaps after two or three years, simply go back and be a man again.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" in just a minute Donald Trump, Jr. will be joining us, Piers Morgan on the show, too, but first there are some negative things that you could say about Donald Trump. What is interesting that the left almost never says them and instead, they spend a lot of time telling how Trump is a fascist, who poses imminent and terrifying threat to our constitutional order. Sounds pretty scary. Is it true? Well, consider the major freedoms protected by our Bill of Rights - the document that makes America distinct from all other countries, freedom of speech, freedom of worship, the right to keep and bear arms, due process under the law. Now, take a close look at today's news. Who exactly is threatening those freedoms? Is it Donald Trump? Whatever his faults, it is not Donald Trump. It is the left and they are doing it more aggressively than they ever have before. As usual, their critique of Trump is pure projection. If you want to know what the left is actually doing, listen to the way they attack other people. Start with our foundational freedom -- speech -- if they can tell you what to say, you are not free. There is nothing they can't make you do. That is why the Founders put it first. It is the freedom that comes before all others. The left has spent decades trying to weaken the First Amendment. They have done it in the sneakiest way possible by creating phony hate speech exemptions out of thin air. So far, the courts have not accepted this idea, the idea that you can limit speech simply because someone else doesn't like it. So the left has a new plan now. They have allied with big corporations to make it impossible for people who say the wrong things to make a living in this country. You may have heard of the company PayPal, it's an online payment platform, the biggest. If you want to make money online and many people do, PayPal is essential. In a recent interview with the \"Wall Street Journal,\" the CEO of PayPal, Dan Schulman explain that diversity and inclusion are his company's top values. But of course, he doesn't mean it, he means the opposite. Like most on the left, which Schulman actually wants is utter conformity, a world where only approved opinions are allowed. Last year PayPal, banned Alex Jones from using the platform for saying things they didn't like. They have also banned anti-Muslim activist, Laura Loomer, the publication \"V-Dare\" and a number of other people and organizations whose speech they believe should be silenced. Schulman admitted that his company takes guidance on who to ban from the Southern Poverty Law Center -- that's an entirely fraudulent organization that works as an arm of the Democratic National Committee. According to Schulman quote, \"The line between free speech and hate, nobody teaches it to you in college. Nobody defined it in the law.\" Well, that is ridiculous, it is very much defined in the law and has been for 50 years. In 1969, the Supreme Court conclusively decided that hate speech does not exist. But it doesn't matter to Schulman or any of allies on the left. To them the First Amendment is merely a legal obstacle. It's something to subvert rather than celebrate. And PayPal is just one small example of this. Across the country, the left is working to crash any organization that stands in the way of its power. In New York State, Governor Andrew Cuomo is trying to shut down the NRA, why? For the crime of disagreeing with his agenda. Cuomo is harassing financial companies to do business with the group and it is working. The media celebrate this just as they celebrate the endless attacks on Fox News. Their entire nonprofits whose only purpose is to close the network you are now watching. They are tireless and they are well-funded. If they someday succeed, you won't hear a word from the left about censorship, no. They will celebrate. An entire news media with one perspective -- that is their goal -- total conformity, which is the same thing as obedience. To achieve that, they are working to nullify the Second Amendment as well. Almost every Democrat now running for President would like to disarm the public and they say that out loud."

To a literal person, for example, the Green New Deal sounds like it is something to do with the environment, it's green after all. But of course, if you really cared about the environment, the quality of air and water, you would push China to stop polluting. China is the world's biggest polluter by far, but the Green New Deal doesn't even mention China. Instead it's all about controlling you -- the job you have, the house you live in, the vehicle you drive. Today, those are choices that you get to make. Under the Green New Deal, the Democratic Party would make them for you. That is why so many of their candidates have endorsed the Green New Deal."

Twenty years ago, seizing people's possessions and giving them away to atone for the sins of those who died more than a century ago, that was considered a fringe position. Nobody said that out aloud and wanted to be elected. Today, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Julian Castro -- they have all said they are for it.

There are guys -- Kevin McCarthy has been pretty vocal about it -- but the reality is that nothing has changed. I put up an Instagram post two weeks ago about the Smollett thing because I had the gall to be a little bit cynical about the entire ridiculous situation that was laid out, and Instagram just deleted it. I sort of responded in my normal fashion rather aggressively, saying, \"What is wrong with this? Here is the problem yada-yada,\" and I got inundated, Tucker. Hundreds of people sending me DMs, \"Don, you know, my account was shut down because I tried liking one of your tweets. Or I tried liking one of your father's Instagram post that was like him and his grandchildren, nothing even controversial and time and time again, I've had to follow you, Don, three times in the last week because they keep unfollowing you.\" It is really sad and it is happening.

But some of the little guys, they can't. They don't have that ability. They just end up taking it, and is what has happened. You've never seen someone on the left say, \"Huh, it is weird, Don, all of a sudden I'm following Fox News, I was never following that.\" Like many conservatives are complaining to me and saying that all of a sudden they are following these crazy left-wing accounts that they never signed up for. This is happening. It is a one-way systematic attack on free speech and to me, it reads like it's a trial run for 2020. How are we going to do it? I'm not saying that every account is suppressed, but you do it enough. You take off X percent off of the top. You cut the message in half. You get rid of some of the viral nature of what my father frankly did very well in 2016. He played monkey in the middle with the media and what they tried to do with messaging. He went right to his people. He went right to the people with his message. He didn't allow them to manipulate it, he went right over them. I think, to me, it reads as though they are trying to figure out how to minimize that ability again and let the media, which again, what? Ninety three percent, ninety four percent left-wing activists at this point? And let them drive that narrative. Make sure that that is the only thing that regular hardworking Americans see.

Imagine how many other people it's actually happening to -- imagine how many don't even realize that it's happening. So I think the Republicans, a lot of these companies are getting a lot of benefits from the government, from the internet, from all of these things, you know, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to have a one-sided platform. And you saw it, I mean, you covered it in the opening segment, what is going on with PayPal? I mean, they are not even hiding it anymore. They are not even pretending anymore. It's just become the norm. If Donald Trump has shown conservatives one thing, it is that you don't just have to take the loss when the other side want you to. You can actually fight back. You can fight back and win. I think we have to take that message to heart. I think we have to start pushing back, and I think we have to start pushing back hard.

And for the Democrats to try to counter program that kind of progress -- to try to perhaps somehow distract him with this nonsense by you know, a convicted felon who has been lying to those same committees. It just goes to show you how much those Democrats really disdain Trump, but also America. I mean, who wants to try to stymie that process? Who doesn't want peace in the Korean peninsula? Who doesn't want to end nuclear proliferation and a dictatorial state? I mean, who doesn't want that, Tucker?

First, with some meetings expecting to yield an important trade deal between the U.S. and Vietnam. He is sitting down with Vietnamese officials. The President who arrived aboard Air Force One about 12 hours ago could be shrewdly using that trade deal as another reminder to Kim Jong-un about the thriving markets here in Vietnam and the potential for North Korea. And the fact that they could get in on the action to rebuild their own shattered economy. But first, Chairman Kim who arrived before the President aboard his armored train is going to have to move toward denuclearization. That is the position from President Trump in order to get the U.S. to remove sanctions that have been throttling the North Korean economy. Now to give you a sense of the excitement here on the ground before the Summit kicks off, there were crowds of Vietnamese people lining the streets when President Trump came from the airport to his hotel where we are now. They were all just trying to get a glimpse of the President. I went out and spoke to some of those people on the streets, and they said, they are of course weary of war here in Vietnam. They went through it for so long, so they are actually optimistic about the prospects of President Trump forging some peace. That is interesting to me here on the ground because it is a sharp contrast to some in the media and Democrats in Congress back home who have been talking down the possibility of a deal, Tucker. In fact, I went to this barbershop where the barber is offering free haircuts. You can either pick a Donald Trump cut that looks a little bit like the President, a little bit interesting color to it, or a Chairman Kim haircut, you imagine what that looks like, I thought it was a goof. But I asked the owner of the barbershop, \"Why did you do this?\" And he told me, he looked me in the eyes and he said, \"My family was so impacted by the war here. I want to see the President and the Chairman get peace.\" So the people here in Vietnam seem to get what this is all about, Tucker."

      "utterance": "Well, recently, a number of high-profile Democrats have been talking up an economic system called socialism. In Venezuela, they've had socialism for 20 years. The results, not good. Some of the worst income inequality in the world. Ninety percent of the country lives in poverty while ruling class vacations in Switzerland, quite a spread. The average Venezuelan has lost 25 pounds from starvation, in a word, a \"disaster.\" But it could get worse for Venezuelans and for us here in the United States. The U.S. has just imposed new sanctions on Venezuela. Some lawmakers are now cheering on the idea of regime change there. Sound familiar? Recently, one Republican Senator tweeted out two photographs of former Libyan Dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The first showed Gaddafi smiling, the second showed him covered in dirt and blood, shortly before being tortured, sodomized and killed. The point was clear -- bad dictators will be overthrown by the United States. Maduro should watch out. What the tweet did not acknowledge is what happened to Libya after Hillary Clinton intervened and Gaddafi was toppled from power. Is Libya a thriving democracy now? No, it is not. It is still a war-torn hell hole worse even. Slave markets thrive in its major cities. Gaddafi once protected Europe from mass migration, now Libya is the main departure point for huge numbers of migrants coming into Europe illegally. The lesson here is pretty obvious. Sometimes, even horrible dictators are preferable to the chaos that replaces them. Our leaders have not learned that. How will attacking Venezuela improve this country? Will it make America safer? More prosperous? No, it won't. That is not even the point though. The idea that American foreign policy should somehow help America has become a quaint historical relic, something you don't see any more like phone booths or compelling network television. It is just gone. A Brookings Institution report predicts that the Venezuela crisis could create eight million refugees. That is even more than the number created by the Syrians Civil War. It is a disaster. Two reckless Florida Congressmen have proposed granting Venezuelans temporary protected status in the U.S. In other words, even if they came here illegally, they could stay forever. Temporary status like this never ends. Nicaragua still has temporary status so it can recover from a hurricane that hit the country more than 20 years ago. If Venezuela gets this benefit, it will be around when your grandchildren are old, guaranteed. And if we send troops there, they will never leave either just like American troops had never left Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan or Korea for that matter. Permanent obligations to solve temporary problems. That is our foreign policy in a nutshell. In Washington, nobody learns anything. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam came very close to being expelled from the Democratic Party for the possibility that he wore a blackface decades ago. The Party somehow though cared a lot less about an interview that he gave just before the blackface yearbook controversy in which Northam defended the practice of literal infanticide. Watch."

That is who now say that they are the ones who are superior to us and who should decide all of our healthcare. That is one point. But the other thing is it's fascinating, Tucker, nobody wants what they are supporting. Not even Democrats. A Gallup poll from last year, 18 percent of Democrats are okay with late-term abortion, with third trimester abortion. Only 13 percent of independents are. Not even Democrats want this. And so you have to ask, why are they doing it? Who are they pandering to? All I can think is that those Planned Parenthood checks must be gigantic. So they are willing out of for money and for their position, for their job, to stop a bill that is the simplest thing in the world that all of us agree with that if there is a child that needs healthcare that we attend to the child. They can't even do that. That is why Americans are rejecting the status quo and this process. And that it's --I am beyond words, which does not happen very often. It is so appalling ..."

Now, what she wants is fairness and equality. And in her column she wrote last week for a London newspaper, she made a very, I think obvious point, which is nothing is fair or equal about what is now going on in women's sports. If you allow people who were born biologically male and I completely accept hat transgender people say, \"Look, you know I was in the wrong gender, the wrong body. I want a transition.\" I completely respect that. I have no issue with that. And it is bigoted, by the way to say that you have an issue with what is going on with the sport as some of them like to claim. But here is what Martina said. She said, \"Look, you can have a situation where a male athlete in tennis or golf or one of the sports that relies a lot on perhaps power and size. A male athlete who is may be number 200 in the world and earning not much money that he might decide to -- decide that he wants to be a woman purely for financial gain, that he can just have some hormone treatment, doesn't need to have any surgery and then he can take part in women's sport, win vast amounts of money and perhaps after two or three years, simply go back and be a man again. And that would be a corrupt thing to do. It would be the wrong to do, unethical and frankly, cheating,\" as Martina says. But it doesn't mean it can't happen.

And I hope she does. I hope she doesn't back down and doesn't succumb to the mob on this. Because it is not transphobic to express a concern about what is going on in women's sports. In fact, what it is, is unfair and unequal to young women, to girls who have been competing at a certain level and maybe have great aspirations in sporting scholarships or turn professional, who are now seeing themselves coming down the line, down the ladder, down the wrung, disadvantaged purely through biology, because they are physically not able to compete with these young transgender women who, as we can see, from that picture are tall and powerful, and have grown up in male biological bodies. And that is an issue that I think ought to be discussed rationally and calmly. I would urge transgender communities in America and around the world to be sensible about this.
