I mean, they are thick. I've seen them. It's on my website. And that would have been perfect if Trump had actually bought Greenland for us. America does need a place to store its Christmas ornaments. But hey, you can't have everything. But who cares? We have a lot. The country is still adding jobs. We're at 21 consecutive months with the unemployment rate at 4 percent or lower, like 3.5 percent. Meanwhile, Trump's got our allies making sure they're paying their bills, not us. I wonder, are we the suckers anymore?"

The Mueller report, impeachment hearings, Russia, Ukraine, it was all the same shtick. Create something from nothing. All because they're worried that their candidate won't get the job done come November. And God knows they put enough candidates out there. They're like gremlins. You leave the room for five minutes, you come back, there's twice as many there. Of course, the media's darlings turned into duds. Remember Beto? Oh, he's just like Kennedy, but enough about his driving. Kamala -- I've got it."

They didn't even make it to the primary. Did the moderate candidates get any attention? Not really. Did the only interesting one in the bunch get any attention? Not really. Right, Marianne?"

So, I, sir, I have a feeling you know what you're doing. I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field. And, sir, love will win."

The thing is, of all the candidates still in or gone, can you pick one of them looking like they're having fun out there? You know, they drink beer, they got haircuts. They played beer pong with water -- Satanist -- all to try to seem relatable to you, while the other guy checks in with his base, and everyone has a good time."

      "speaker": "Donald Trump",
      "utterance": "Is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally? [cheering] Sleepy Joe understood how to kiss the rock Obama’s ass. Maybe I’m a little different up here, I don’t know. Shifty Schiff. Crooked Hillary Clinton. Pocahontas. I’m president, and they’re not. We’re better-looking -- [cheering] -- including the men. We are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Whether you love me or hate me, you’ve got to vote for me."

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Did I say we don’t deserve him? Now, that could be tough next year to beat. No wonder they’re banking on impeachment. Now, let’s not forget, it’s also the end of the decade, too, and the decade was awesome, if you’re the stock market, at least, ending the decade around 28,000. Know where it was 10 years ago? Ten thousand. That’s a lot. If I only diversified instead of giving all my money to my bald neighbor Carl. What did I see in Carl? This decade also saw historic declines in poverty, disease, and deaths due to climate disasters, but the decade got weird, too. Safe spaces became a thing. Identity politics became a thing. University campuses started squelching free speech and free thinking instead of embracing it the way universities are supposed to. Some people learned the hard way that they could ruin their own lives with just one tweet. It’s called cancel culture, a term that didn’t exist 10 years ago. But, hey, maybe this decade -- next decade will be about lightening the hell up, which is the point of this show, and thanks to you, we’ve had our highest-rated year ever. So, everyone -- [applause] Everyone here gets a car. No, you don’t, but thanks for watching. Thanks for laughing. We’re happy you’re here, because really this show is the best thing that happened this decade. We give you the news, we give you the trends, and most of all, we give you talking animals, and so far, it’s worked out. Right, guys?"

[applause] He puts the “ew” in “Shillue.” Host of the quiz talk -- quiz show on Fox Nation, Tom Shillue. [applause] She’s quirky, smirky, and can strangle a turkey. Host of Sincerely Kat on Fox Nation, Kat Timpf. [applause] And Google Earth complains that he blocks their view. My massive sidekick and host of ‘Nuff Said on Fox Nation, Tyrus. [applause] Jonathan, welcome to the show. You look great as always. What do you make of this era? I feel like the era has no real identity until 2016, right? Like, what would you say about the 2010s now?"
    },

      "speaker": "Jonathan Morris",

But, yeah, things go so fast right now, and in part, it’s because of the politics that we’re living right now, but also in part just because of social media and technology. We are living at a very high rate, and that’s good and bad, and I think it’s a question -- you know, all these Democratic candidates and others are talking about existential. That has to do with being, right? What is being? What is our being? What is purpose? And it’s hard to do in a very fast world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "But it’s so funny and hypocritical, because none of those people really think that deeply [laughs]. I mean, they just discovered the word “existential” on a word-a-day calendar. “‘Existential?’ I’m using that one.” “No, I have it.”  “No, I have it.” You have Cuomo and Levin [spelled phonetically] arguing over the word, Tom. What was your favorite thing about 2019? And please say me."

They go -- whatever he points at, they go, and they scream at it, but the thing is, they’re into it. They -- he’s got them all wrapped up in the -- in Trumpism, you know, and they hate him for it. But like he said, he’s -- [laughs] I don’t know the logic of it, but it makes weird sense. He says, “Love me or hate me, but you’ve got to vote for me.” Like, whoever said such a thing? It’s unbelievable."
    },

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "You know, he’s also an existential threat to the media, because it’s like he’s killed old media. Like, we don’t look at -- the media is not the same anymore. He’s exposed them. He treats the media the way the media treated us as people. Like, the media was always on top, basically saying that the average citizen was stupid. Trump is doing that to the media, Kat. That’s my theory. [applause] So, you’re beginning with applause. Perhaps you will end with it."

Turns out I don’t know -- like, I don’t like a lot of the things other people like. Like, I still don't know what a Fortnite is, and I don’t -- like, the Jonas Brothers; any white millennial dude could come up to me like, “I’m a Jonas brother,” and I’d be like, “I believe you.” You know, I don’t know who they are.

    },

      "speaker": "Tyrus",
      "utterance": "Worst “R” movie ever. Every month of this decade was the end of the world, especially during the Trump presidency. “Breaking news: Trump did some [expletive], and there’s an asteroid coming to get us right now. He offended the gods.” Every week, it was the end of democracy. North Korea was going to bomb us; Syria was going to bomb us. Like, we were literally -- at the end of every show, you just didn’t know."

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Yeah, exactly."
    },

      "speaker": "Tyrus",
      "utterance": "You know? And then you wake up, and you’d be like, “That movie sucked.” Like, literally, you’d go to the -- all the anticipation. You’re excited; you’re fired up. It’s going to be the scariest thing ever, and it’s like ducks bathing in a pond. It’s really not that bad out there. It’s actually the best it’s ever been."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "That is true. It has been the best. The one problem, though, is I am frightened by ducks bathing. It’s a thing that happened when I was a child. I was attacked by ducks in a pond. Yeah, I don’t know what I’m talking about. [laughter] All right, back with more great stuff in a minute."

    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",

And Trump's like, \"Take it easy. Here's the transcript of the call.\" And then this guy makes like he's really reading the transcript out loud."

      "speaker": "Adam Schiff",
      "utterance": "I don't see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though, and I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent. Understand? Lots of it. By the way, don't call me again. I'll call you when you've done what I asked."
    },

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Except that didn't actually happen. That wasn't the real transcript. And then he claims, \"Oh, I was just making a joke.\" Yeah, that was super funny, dude. But as I watched that, I was thinking to myself, who the hell does he remind me of? So, we bought a whole lot of cheap rouge, and we did this. Watch."

Most of the dead are university students returning to class and police officers. At least 125 people were wounded. Somalia’s president calling the bombing a, quote, “heinous act of terror” and blames an extremist group with ties to Al Qaeda. This is the worst attack on Mogadishu since hundreds were killed in a deadly bombing two years ago. Meanwhile, back here at home, a New York man brutally beaten during a $1 mugging on Christmas Eve has died. Police have released this surveillance video right here, hoping to track down the suspects. Investigators say Juan Fresnado was out walking with his partner in their Bronx neighborhood when the muggers approached them. The suspects then ran away after that attack. I’m Jackie Ibanez.

Anyway, the second runner-up, Jussie Smollett, who claimed two guys put a rope around his neck while yelling, “This is MAGA country” in Chicago in the middle of the night in sub-zero temperature. Yeah, that happened, for sure. First runner-up, media coverage of Nicholas Sandmann, a kid wearing a MAGA hat that social media accused of taunting a Native American man until another tape surfaced that showed that wasn’t the case. Now, Sandmann is suing everybody for millions. Not me, though, thank God. [applause] Which leads us to the outrage of the year over a meme, a meme that Trump tweeted out. Watch."

Secondly, a little bit taking off what Kat said, you know, the great worry of so much of the media when they saw that meme of, like, he’s going to live till he’s, you know, 3,000 years old is, “Oh, my gosh, he’s going to be a king” or “he’s going to be a monarch, and that’s what he wants to be.” No king and no monarch lives to be 3,000 years old.

At the time, I was a Catholic priest, and I was totally embarrassed because I saw another priest that I knew. I'm like, \"What are we doing here?\" You know, like, \"Wasting our time doing this movie things.\" And when I -- when it came to my turn, I said to them, \"Guys, listen, I'm not really interested in doing movies for movies sake.
