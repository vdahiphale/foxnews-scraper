And so, no matter what the reason is, science proves it that this is an individual entity, this is an individual person with their own DNA, with their own dreams, with their own blood type, even. And so it's important to not only be people that stand for abortion as if it's some sort of political stance, which it kind of turns into sometimes but be someone that stands for whole life. Be someone that's willing to support not only this baby coming into the world but also to support the mother and the father that may be in crisis, whatever they may be going through.

Number one, so that you and I would be talking about it and others would be talking about the acting A.G. being under subpoena. Number two, it does compel attendance but Matt has already said he is coming. Thirdly and importantly, and what I don't think your viewers know is when Matt says I can't answer that question because it's privileged, I can't answer that question because it's an ongoing investigation. If you are under subpoena it makes it much easier for the committee to compel you to answer. That's why they are doing it. They are not worried about him not showing up. He already said he is coming.

Mr. Fairfax put his hand behind my neck and forcefully pushed my head towards his crotch. As I cried and gagged, Mr. Fairfax forced me to perform oral sex on him.\" Well, Fairfax responded by saying, \"I wish her no harm or humiliation, nor do I seek to denigrate her or diminish her voice. But I cannot agree with the description of events that I know is not true.\" So, just to recap here, there are now calls for the top three Democrats in Virginia to resign.

But instead of ensnaring Republicans who mostly dismiss this stuff, then say, \"You're snowflakes, we don't want to hear about it. This is whatever. These aren't -- these aren't the real issues.\" So, Republicans are -- don't make themselves subject to the rules. Democrats are subject to the rules, and they're tearing themselves apart.

So, there's -- the Democrats are wide open to charges of hypocrisy here unless they enforce a strict line. I think we have seen this before Al Franken in the Senate, on charges of sexual harassment. And now, you are in a situation about race in Virginia. I would say that today we learned about Mark Herring, the attorney general. I think there's a big difference between Herring and what's going on with the governor, Ralph Northam because I think blackface is always offensive. But I think, in the case of Northam, his press conference were -- to me, it looked like he was -- you know, his first says it wasn't and it was him, then he's apologizing, and not apologizing. He has made it all about himself. It's all about not wanting to be called the racist governor for life, rather than understanding the degree of hurt and the moral offense and trying to regain moral authority. His poll numbers have absolutely plummeted."

The key here though, Martha, is I think there are a lot of white people in America who say, oh, you know, it's Halloween, or you just playing around. Herring said, he was imitating a rapper from the 1980s, he was 19 years old. OK, but, to me, the idea is that a lot of people don't understand that this goes back 1800s intended to mock, denigrate, demean, black people as less intelligent, lazy, sexually abusive and all the rest. And to for men, for young white men at this period, not to realize that I think is nonsense. I think people have an idea of exactly what they're doing."

I say this because look, Mark Herring, himself set the standard when he called on Northam to resign. He's lost all credibility if he himself does not set the same standard for himself. But I really want to say one thing about Justin Fairfax, who is, of course, accused of sexual assault here. The number four in line is a Republican, his name is Kirk Cox. He has come out with a statement. It's in his political interest to say, \"Hey, he should step down.\" That's not what he is saying. He is saying we need to allow the facts that come out. The same thing Republicans said with Kavanaugh. But when it was in the political interest of Democrats, they called on Kavanaugh to step down immediately.

But women are supposed to be heard and treated with respect. The way that Fairfax responded to his accuser was shocking to me. He really did go after her. And he described her as being a very willing participant. He tried to portray her as to somebody who was lustily involved in the action and that now is either malicious or unwell to make these accusations. He did try to smear the accuser, and now understands that he blew it in such a huge way, I think he's done."

And he says, you know, that essentially, it's extremely rare. He said that this whole issue about late-term abortion is being misrepresented, that it is extremely rare and it's only in the cases of health for the mother. But the way that some of these laws are written, that also includes the mental health of the mother which just a lot of people feel opens up a very wide definition of reasons that a person could compel a doctor to do something very late-term or even at the moment of birth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATSON",
      "utterance": "We're living in a time, Martha, of abortion on demand. We're living in a time of relativism. And while I would agree that hopefully these happen in very rare instances where someone would wait nine months before having an abortion, the fact still remains that whether it's at nine months or whether it's at 8 days or 18 days, when the heart is developing, when the baby is breathing, it's still the same life. And so, no matter what the reason is, science proves it that this is an individual entity, this is an individual person with their own DNA, with their own dreams, with their own blood type, even. And so it's important to not only be people that stand for abortion as if it's some sort of political stance, which it kind of turns into sometimes but be someone that stands for whole life. Be someone that's willing to support not only this baby coming into the world but also to support the mother and the father that may be in crisis, whatever they may be going through. I think that it turns into a divisive issue when we simply stand for the unborn but we are willing to neglect the mothers that are going through these difficult choices."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And I mentioned before the image of Joe Manchin standing and applauding and then there were rows of women behind him who were not -- who were not in favor of what the president was talking about. What's your message for men? You say even if it wasn't demonstrated for you by a father, you can be different."

    {
      "speaker": "WATSON",

Many women would not be seeking abortions if the men involved in their lives were doing what they were supposed to be doing. And that's a challenge to myself. That's a challenge to all men who are listening. That's a challenge to men everywhere to step up and be men. A lot of the issues that we face in our country, whether it's the abortion issue or education or whatever it may be, sometimes incarceration, whatever it may be, if men were doing their job, these things would be eradicated. And so my message to men is a lot of times me looking in the mirror and encouraging myself as a father, as a husband, to do what it takes to stand in the gap to step out and to lead because manhood is really falling by the wayside and the crazy thing is that abortion itself is really the ultimate form of sexism against women. And if men were standing up doing what they're supposed to do much of this would be eradicated."

Well, one last question before I let you go about covering President Trump in general because you have said that you think the New York Times is sometimes biased in their coverage of the president. And, you know, when you talk to the people in the communications department at the White House and not just talking about the New York Times, but they feel like there is such a broad brush that they basically can't get out from under every single day. There is so much negative coverage of the president. And you look at the right track, wrong track numbers and most of America seems to be very happy with the economy and foreign policy in general. And yet, they think the country is on the wrong track. And some say that's because the message that they get all the time from much of the media is so dark. What do you say to that?"

And I think, you know, they are all well-reported and factual but, you know, when you have many at once and some of the headlines will needlessly throw him in and partly it's because any time you have a story on Trump, you get a big audience. Lots of clicks and the president has been ratings bonanza especially for cable channels. You know that."

In other words, there is a debate going on inside the Democrat Party about whether socialism should be blessed or not. This is hard to believe truly given the record of socialism in the 20th century.

Look, if you say to people free college, free medicine and medical care for everybody, some of these other schemes they are talking about, people will say sure, but then look at the fine print. Look at what socialism has done. Socialism is as socialism has done. Look at Maduro, look at Castro, deprivation, poverty and suffering. Look at the real masters of socialism, Mao, Stalin, 30, 40 million dead. There should be no track at all with this idea of socialism and if they want have to have a debate on this, I think the president would welcome the debate. I know many of us would. Part of this, Martha, is because when you talk to millennials, just out of college, they will tell you many of them that they have more sympathy for socialism than they have for capitalism.

You know, delivery, delivery, delivery. His cadence was right and his points were right. It was beautifully written and very well delivered and I think it constitutes a great 2020 campaign speech.

I wish Adam were serious about oversight. There's a lot that needs to be done in the intelligence community about leaks, about FISA, he is not interested in that.

So, I'm just wondering, you know, I mean, none of us know what is in the Mueller report. But I wonder what his response is going to be if they don't -- if they don't find collusion, you know, well, nobody knows what else they might see in there.

He said he had evidence of collusion between Russia and President Trump before Bob Mueller was ever appointed. He had evidence of collusion before anybody else did according to Adam Schiff. So, why is he not constantly asked, as a Republican would be, and should be, if you claim you have evidence, direct evidence of collusion, what is it? He is either not asked or he's not forced to respond."

In terms of Mr. Nadler, Congressman Nadler who is heading up the committee and he is asking for Matt Whitaker, the acting attorney general, excuse me, who is coming in on February 8th to testify about why or why not, you know, what his process was on not recusing himself from the Russia investigation when he became acting attorney general, then they said they are going to subpoena him also even though he said he was going to come and talk to them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Yes. There are three reasons that Jerry Nadler did that. Number one, so that you and I would be talking about it and others would be talking about the acting A.G. being under subpoena. Number two, it does compel attendance but Matt has already said he is coming. Thirdly and importantly, and what I don't think your viewers know is when Matt says I can't answer that question because it's privileged, I can't answer that question because it's an ongoing investigation. If you are under subpoena it makes it much easier for the committee to compel you to answer. That's why they are doing it. They are not worried about him not showing up. He already said he is coming. Although, Martha, I hope he doesn't."

He can't talk about Mueller. He can't talk about Rosenstein. He can't talk about any ongoing investigation and he can't talk about communications he's had with the president. So, what's he going to talk about? He is not going to be there in a week. So, look, Matt got access to much better legal minds than mine, but I think I would have a cold Friday if I were him. And then by this time next week Bill Barr will be confirmed and he can come answer all of Jerry Nadler's questions. But Whitaker has got? A week left on the job?"
