      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". We begin tonight, a FOX News alert -- get this -- James Comey, I hope you're sitting down for this big breaking news only moments ago. Federal prosecutors are now reportedly investigating high-level leaks, classified material from the FBI. And the super patriot himself, according to reports, is likely the target of a criminal probe. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, remember, only a few months ago in an unrelated case, the DOJ inspector general referred Comey for a prosecution over leaks and lack of candor surrounding his communications with President Trump. Now, more trouble for Jim Comey. We'll have details analysis and more on this major story coming up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First, tonight, more manufactured hysteria from the D.C. swamp. Let me be clear there is absolutely nothing significant nothing meaningful about this charade, this miscarriage of justice on Capitol Hill. You have conspiracy theorists, con artists and liars, same people that have been doing it for the last three years, they are now dragging this country through the mud and it's all out of pure rage, denial, hatred psychosis and insanity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I want to begin with this monologue on this point, I want to ask everyone a simple question, you playing at home, answer in your mind's eye the question and I really want you to think about it. Since Donald Trump was elected in 2016, think, what have Democrats -- what are the media -- what are they ever done to improve the lives of Americans? Now, have they done anything to create jobs, prosperity, safety, security, peace? Well, today's cover of The New York Post, a perfect representation of what I am talking about. On the one side, there you have President Trump signing what many thought could never be done -- a really great, historic trade deal with China, $220 billion in the next two years alone -- this year and next year -- and that will impact the energy sector, the service sector, manufacturing sector, our farmers benefit greatly, $220 billion. That helps the American economy and helps American workers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On the other side of the picture, there's Nancy Pelosi smiling, a dozen commemorative pens to sign off on two bogus articles of impeachment, and then taking pictures with, yes, smiles. And Nancy's blatant political stunts will improve the lives of zero Americans. It will add zero jobs to the economy. It does nothing to make us more safe or secure, and we all know the outcome. It's going to die in the Senate. It was just a few months ago that Nancy Pelosi said impeachment must be bipartisan. No Republicans supported it. And then she rammed through articles of impeachment in the House with the support of only Democrats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Pelosi also said impeachment was so dire and so urgent, we got to pass it in record time. She then refused to send the articles to the Senate for over a month, a weeks-long stall that almost no one can explain. And Democrats -- that was after they passed it so quickly before Christmas so they can go on vacation for three weeks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And don't forget, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, constantly reminding we, the people, impeachment was her solemn duty. She didn't want to do it. She was so prayerful and somber. Of course, that also a lie. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Tonight, they want to introduce new B.S. evidence and charges and material and witnesses that were not part of the case. Remember, the sole power of the Constitution to impeach is in the House. They passed it already. Now, if a few weak Republican senators try and help their radical Democratic colleagues and allow them to call new witnesses to do the job, the constitutional duty of the House, and enter all these new evidence, guess what's going to happen? This actually is a great thing -- I want to hear from zero experience Hunter Biden who's paid millions of dollars, no experience. Wow, what a deal?

But perhaps my favorite, will be calling the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar Adam Schiff, let's put him under oath. Senator Ted Cruz and now, Senator Rand Paul, vowing to trigger a reciprocal witness list if any Republican caves to the Democrats' demands. Senator Paul's predicting no Republican will vote to convict the president.

Now, Roswell Rachel Maddow's program, this is basically a hoax-filled dumpster fire of never ending fake news, never ending conspiracy theories directed by the Democratic Party, dressed up as an intellectual new show. Well, it's pathetic how wrong they have been over there the last three years. Ever get an apology for them being so wrong, Trump-Russia collusion? No apologies. No accountability. Nothing. Whoops. Wrong again. Now, let's move onto the next lying anti-Trump a narrative and new shady guest like Avenatti and new conspiracy theories. Don't be fooled. It's garbage.

That's how much credibility I put in this guy. The president was clear today that he doesn't know the guy. But there are pictures of him and the president. You know, how many photo lines I've done in the course of my 24 years here, 21 years in TV. I've done a lot. I've actually seen pictures online. I have no idea who these people are. The president doesn't remember this guy. He said so repeatedly today. DOJ says his claims are 100 percent false. His claims are full of glaring holes and contradictions.

My foreign policy is opposed to Cuba. It is unconstitutional for a statute to take away the president's sole authority over foreign policy. The only limitation on the president's authority is he can't declare war. Other than that, he can decide the Jerusalem embassy for Israel without congressional authorization.

That's what the president said he was going to do. That's exactly what President Trump has tried to do. And the GAO, for them to come out with this result, is absolutely wrong.

      "sentences": "I won't even have enough time but let's start. Remember this? Anybody remember this? This was the Mueller report. Remember all this? Hundreds of subpoenas, hundreds of witnesses, millions of pages of documents. Nothing. They still have nothing. I want to tell you how concerned the Democrats are about foreign interference in our elections. First of all, Obama did nothing to stop the Russians from interfering in the 2016 election. In fact, his administration spied on this president of the United States when he was a candidate. It was Hillary Clinton who colluded with the Russians and the DNC. They paid for that dossier. You know all this. But let's talk about the Democrats and how serious they are about foreign interference in our elections. I'll go to my book, briefly, if I may. Back in the 1990s, we had a president by the name of Bill Clinton. He was impeached, but he wasn't impeached for what I'm about to talk about. He was running for reelection. The media really didn't care about the scandal that broke. The L.A. Times and a few others did. And here's what they wrote: The chief of China's military intelligence secretly directed funds from Beijing to help reelect President Clinton in 1996. Former Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung told federal investigators. Chung said he met three times with intelligence officials who ordered $300,000 deposited into the Torrance businessman's bank account to subsidize campaign donations intended for Clinton, according to sources. Chung spent around a great deal of foreign money on Democratic candidates and organizations, and bought himself repeated access to the White House. He contributed more than $400,000 to various Democratic campaigns. This is Chinese military money. Visited the White House no fewer than 50 times and brought numerous Chinese associates to events with the president and first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. That would have been Trump's opponent, you might have remembered in 2016. Charlie Trie, a longtime friend of President Clinton, raised $1.2 million in foreign dollars for the Clinton legal defense fund and the DNC. In March 1996, Trie dropped off a donation of $460,000 at the Washington office of the Clinton defense fund with some of the money and sequentially numbered money orders made out in the same handwriting. He visited the White House 22 times. Los Angeles Times, James Riady, another longtime friend of President Clinton, who heads the worldwide Lippo Banking Group, pleaded guilty. He was involved. \"The Times\" also noted that former Democratic fund-raiser, John Huang, a onetime official at Lippo, pleaded guilty in the scandal a few years ago. What did he do? Huang raised more than $1.5 million from illegal foreign source, visited the White House 78 damn times. There is your Democrat Party. Now, what did Nancy Pelosi say when the Red Chinese military was spreading millions of dollars around to the Clinton campaign, to the DNC, and all the rest? She didn't say a thing. Where was the independent counsel investigation? There was no independent counsel investigation. Where was most of the media? They were nowhere. Here's another one for you, Democrats, out there. In the 1980s, we had a president called Ronald Reagan. He was phenomenally popular. But Ted Kennedy wanted to stop his reelection. What did he do? Information in the files. It's been reported by The London Times. Been reported by Professor Kengur (ph), in the files of the KGB, through back channels. The Lion of the Senate, who many on the left wanted to be president of the United States, tried to collaborate with the KGB to defeat Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan, in his second term. There's your damn Democratic Party. What else? Oh, the GAO comes out. Perfectly timed. Gives a damn, another bureaucracy. Donald Trump broke the law. It's not what it says. Donald Trump broke the law, they say. Well, if Donald Trump broke the law, as they point out in PJ Media today, well, then so did Joe Biden. Remember that billion dollars that Joe Biden said, hey, look, Ukraine, you're not getting that billion dollars unless you fire that prosecutor? Well, that billion dollars was appropriated by Congress in March, 2014 by a vote of 399-19 in the House, 98-2 in the Senate. And he tried to blackmail the Ukrainians and he tried to threaten withholding of funds. But where is the line that Joe Biden broke the law? Now, we have this guy, Lev Parnas. I told you, don't have a lot of time, but I'm moving. Who is Lev Parnas? Well, he is the latest guy that the Democrats are going to grab. He has been indicted on multiple felony counts. H is a foreigner who used foreign money and try to put foreign money into our campaign. Now, the Democrats want to hear from him and the media call it evidence. Evidence? Now, the media took here before with Michael Avenatti? Where is he today? His ass is in jail. Remember the porno star, Stormy Daniels? Where is she? No idea. Michal Cohen, remember him? He was going to bring down Trump on campaign charges. Where is he? He is in federal prison. Now, something funny about these two articles of impeachment. There is no constitutional violation. There is no statutory violation. There is no violation of a federal court order. This is why they keep throwing up smoke. And I want to tell these five Republicans of the Senate, the weak links in the chain -- Romney, Collins, Murkowski, Gardner, and the other one skips my mind, luckily, Alexander. Let me tell you something. You have a duty to uphold the Constitution. What the House of representatives has done here is destroy the Constitution. It's your job to fix it. It's your job to stop them. Not aid and abet by calling witnesses that the Democrats want. No. No witnesses. No witnesses. This should be dismissed. This is a disgrace. That's it.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". We begin tonight, a FOX News alert -- get this -- James Comey, I hope you're sitting down for this big breaking news only moments ago. Federal prosecutors are now reportedly investigating high-level leaks, classified material from the FBI. And the super patriot himself, according to reports, is likely the target of a criminal probe. Now, remember, only a few months ago in an unrelated case, the DOJ inspector general referred Comey for a prosecution over leaks and lack of candor surrounding his communications with President Trump. Now, more trouble for Jim Comey. We'll have details analysis and more on this major story coming up. First, tonight, more manufactured hysteria from the D.C. swamp. Let me be clear there is absolutely nothing significant nothing meaningful about this charade, this miscarriage of justice on Capitol Hill. You have conspiracy theorists, con artists and liars, same people that have been doing it for the last three years, they are now dragging this country through the mud and it's all out of pure rage, denial, hatred psychosis and insanity. I want to begin with this monologue on this point, I want to ask everyone a simple question, you playing at home, answer in your mind's eye the question and I really want you to think about it. Since Donald Trump was elected in 2016, think, what have Democrats -- what are the media -- what are they ever done to improve the lives of Americans? Now, have they done anything to create jobs, prosperity, safety, security, peace? Well, today's cover of The New York Post, a perfect representation of what I am talking about. On the one side, there you have President Trump signing what many thought could never be done -- a really great, historic trade deal with China, $220 billion in the next two years alone -- this year and next year -- and that will impact the energy sector, the service sector, manufacturing sector, our farmers benefit greatly, $220 billion. That helps the American economy and helps American workers. On the other side of the picture, there's Nancy Pelosi smiling, a dozen commemorative pens to sign off on two bogus articles of impeachment, and then taking pictures with, yes, smiles. And Nancy's blatant political stunts will improve the lives of zero Americans. It will add zero jobs to the economy. It does nothing to make us more safe or secure, and we all know the outcome. It's going to die in the Senate. It was just a few months ago that Nancy Pelosi said impeachment must be bipartisan. No Republicans supported it. And then she rammed through articles of impeachment in the House with the support of only Democrats. Pelosi also said impeachment was so dire and so urgent, we got to pass it in record time. She then refused to send the articles to the Senate for over a month, a weeks-long stall that almost no one can explain. And Democrats -- that was after they passed it so quickly before Christmas so they can go on vacation for three weeks. And don't forget, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, constantly reminding we, the people, impeachment was her solemn duty. She didn't want to do it. She was so prayerful and somber. Of course, that also a lie. Take a look."

December 18th, a great day for the Constitution of the United States, a sad one for America, that the president's reckless activities necessitated us - - our having to introduce articles of impeachment. This is nothing that anybody takes any satisfaction in. It's sad for our country. There's just no joy in this. It's sad. We must be somber. We must be prayerful."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Sad, somber, prayerful. You want a pen? You'd like a pen? Got dozens of them. Smile for the camera, we did it! So Pelosi who was so somber and prayerful, she gleefully handed the special commemorative pens to her smiling colleagues so they could all take pictures together after signing the articles, all smiles -- a political stunt borne out of rage from beginning to end. Now, the Democrats' charade continues in the U.S. Senate. Tonight, they want to introduce new B.S. evidence and charges and material and witnesses that were not part of the case. Remember, the sole power of the Constitution to impeach is in the House. They passed it already. Now, if a few weak Republican senators try and help their radical Democratic colleagues and allow them to call new witnesses to do the job, the constitutional duty of the House, and enter all these new evidence, guess what's going to happen? This actually is a great thing -- I want to hear from zero experience Hunter Biden who's paid millions of dollars, no experience. Wow, what a deal? What company would ever give you millions then you know nothing about the business? And then, of course, we've got quid pro quo Joe. Let's bring him in to testify. You're not getting the billion at least you fire the prosecutor that I know is investigating my zero experience son. And the fake hearsay whistleblowers should be called to testify. But perhaps my favorite, will be calling the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar Adam Schiff, let's put him under oath. Senator Ted Cruz and now, Senator Rand Paul, vowing to trigger a reciprocal witness list if any Republican caves to the Democrats' demands. Senator Paul's predicting no Republican will vote to convict the president. I tend to agree with them, except Mitt Romney. I don't know why Mitt Romney's angry. Mitt Romney hates Donald Trump, every second of every day. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is doing everything Mitt Romney said he would do if he had got elected president. It makes no sense to me. Here with more, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Senator, good for you. You were wrong on the War Powers Act, but that's a longstanding debate we have. But I think --"

And every day on the mainstream media, they say, oh, there's no \"there\" there. This has been investigated. There's no corruption. I think the American people don't buy it. But here's the thing, is fair is fair, and if they're going to put the president through this, they're going to have to have witnesses on both sides. But I'll tell you what my fear is, is that some Republicans are going to vote for witnesses, we'll get those, the ones the Democrats want and then when we have the votes on bringing witnesses or letting the president choose his witnesses, I think those will fail, not only because of those Republicans but because a whole variety of Republicans may not allow the whistleblower, may not allow Biden for one reason or another because they served with them. But if it turns out and the Republican base sees that this looks like only Democrat witnesses and no presidential witnesses, I guarantee that the Republican base will punish those people who set off that kind of scenario."

There was not one Republican that supported impeachment in the House. I don't think there will be in the Senate. But if people play games with the witnesses and, all of a sudden, we have one side and we have John Bolton who has an ax to grind about being fired coming in, but we don't let the president call witnesses he wishes to call, I think all hell's going to break loose, and I think the Republican electorate will boot out any of these people who allow this to be a one- sided episode."

It is breathtaking hypocrisy where we are here. And you're calling it out and we'll watch very closely. And I hope your prediction is right in the end. Senator, thank you for being with us. Now, the left's latest desperate attempt to smear President Trump, keep his impeachment charade alive, forever -- it's insane. Earlier in the week, there you go, we got the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar himself, Adam Schiff, he attached an addendum to the articles of impeachment. He's got new evidence, filled with random documents from a Ukrainian-American named Lev Parnas. Parnas is currently out on bail from a federal prison. What is he accused of? Orchestrating a massive campaign finance fraud scheme, oh, and hiding - - you can't make this up -- a million-dollar payment from where? Russia. Wow. Wouldn't even believe it in a spy novel. This guy is apparently the media mob's, the Democrats' new Michael Avenatti. And naturally, they are making him their hero, a guy that's been accused of taking a million dollars and hiding it from Russia. These are the same people, especially on fake news CNN and over there at conspiracy TV, Area 51, Roswell Rachel Maddow's conspiracy channel, both are state-run TV. They put Avenatti on the air 254 times in one year. He was begging to be on this show, the number one show in the country, but we didn't put him. And they now love Lev Parnas. Where is Avenatti? And last I heard, he is in jail facing a ton of charges. Good luck to him. Naturally, now, he is making the rounds in the media mob, including an appearance last night, of course, on conspiracy TV, state-run MSDNC. Now, Roswell Rachel Maddow's program, this is basically a hoax-filled dumpster fire of never ending fake news, never ending conspiracy theories directed by the Democratic Party, dressed up as an intellectual new show. Well, it's pathetic how wrong they have been over there the last three years. Ever get an apology for them being so wrong, Trump-Russia collusion? No apologies. No accountability. Nothing. Whoops. Wrong again. Now, let's move onto the next lying anti-Trump a narrative and new shady guest like Avenatti and new conspiracy theories. Don't be fooled. It's garbage. They hype up the anti-Trump basis of the left-wing. But, we got him this time. Last night's interview with Parnas, no exception. Now, we are talking about a guy that got paid, apparently, according to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, these are serious people there, millions of dollars from Russia, or a million dollars, and now, accusing President Trump and pretty much everyone in his administration of pretty much everything he can think of. Now, when you face a possible jail term and you think you say something that might either eliminate the jail term or might lower the jail term, most people would pretty much say anything. That's how much credibility I put in this guy. The president was clear today that he doesn't know the guy. But there are pictures of him and the president. You know, how many photo lines I've done in the course of my 24 years here, 21 years in TV. I've done a lot. I've actually seen pictures online. I have no idea who these people are. The president doesn't remember this guy. He said so repeatedly today. DOJ says his claims are 100 percent false. His claims are full of glaring holes and contradictions. Whoopsy-daisy. The foreign minister of Ukraine felt compelled to speak out and say, don't trust this guy. Take a look."

Meanwhile, the mob too busy obsessing about a hoax. They got nothing right and everything wrong. They pushed the dirty Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier -- we now know unverifiable. Even The New York Times finally came around and said, yes, that dirty dossier the Hillary paid for was likely Russian disinformation from the beginning. That would tell -- mean, oh, it sounds like Russia wanted dirt out there on Donald Trump to help Hillary. They did this whole thing while pretending to be so upset about Trump-Russia collusion that never occurred. Well, Lev Parnas, he takes a million dollars according to prosecutors in New York from Russians. They don't care. They've learned nothing. All they know is hatred, rage, all things anti-Trump.

They all knew. They were all in on it. So, my point has been, as you and I have been talking about a lot lately, is to stop treating this as if it's a real trial and not a political operation. This is a new political weapon in modern political -- in our modern political world, and Donald Trump is the first victim. A hundred years from now, if a president doesn't have the House in the same party, that president is going to be impeached. So, it's time to play hardball.

They didn't want the Iran deal. President Obama imposed the Iran deal because the president has exclusive power over foreign policy. Or imagine Congress in the future saying, we are going to give aid to Cuba and you have to send the money to Cuba. And the president says, no, no, no, that's not my foreign policy. My foreign policy is opposed to Cuba. It is unconstitutional for a statute to take away the president's sole authority over foreign policy. The only limitation on the president's authority is he can't declare war. Other than that, he can decide the Jerusalem embassy for Israel without congressional authorization. He can decide who not to give money to. And what he did, he never stopped the money from going, but postponing it to make sure that there was no corruption.

He contributed more than $400,000 to various Democratic campaigns. This is Chinese military money. Visited the White House no fewer than 50 times and brought numerous Chinese associates to events with the president and first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. That would have been Trump's opponent, you might have remembered in 2016. Charlie Trie, a longtime friend of President Clinton, raised $1.2 million in foreign dollars for the Clinton legal defense fund and the DNC. In March 1996, Trie dropped off a donation of $460,000 at the Washington office of the Clinton defense fund with some of the money and sequentially numbered money orders made out in the same handwriting. He visited the White House 22 times. Los Angeles Times, James Riady, another longtime friend of President Clinton, who heads the worldwide Lippo Banking Group, pleaded guilty. He was involved. \"The Times\" also noted that former Democratic fund-raiser, John Huang, a onetime official at Lippo, pleaded guilty in the scandal a few years ago. What did he do? Huang raised more than $1.5 million from illegal foreign source, visited the White House 78 damn times. There is your Democrat Party. Now, what did Nancy Pelosi say when the Red Chinese military was spreading millions of dollars around to the Clinton campaign, to the DNC, and all the rest? She didn't say a thing. Where was the independent counsel investigation? There was no independent counsel investigation. Where was most of the media? They were nowhere. Here's another one for you, Democrats, out there. In the 1980s, we had a president called Ronald Reagan. He was phenomenally popular. But Ted Kennedy wanted to stop his reelection. What did he do? Information in the files. It's been reported by The London Times. Been reported by Professor Kengur (ph), in the files of the KGB, through back channels. The Lion of the Senate, who many on the left wanted to be president of the United States, tried to collaborate with the KGB to defeat Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan, in his second term. There's your damn Democratic Party. What else? Oh, the GAO comes out. Perfectly timed. Gives a damn, another bureaucracy. Donald Trump broke the law. It's not what it says. Donald Trump broke the law, they say. Well, if Donald Trump broke the law, as they point out in PJ Media today, well, then so did Joe Biden. Remember that billion dollars that Joe Biden said, hey, look, Ukraine, you're not getting that billion dollars unless you fire that prosecutor? Well, that billion dollars was appropriated by Congress in March, 2014 by a vote of 399-19 in the House, 98-2 in the Senate. And he tried to blackmail the Ukrainians and he tried to threaten withholding of funds. But where is the line that Joe Biden broke the law? Now, we have this guy, Lev Parnas. I told you, don't have a lot of time, but I'm moving. Who is Lev Parnas? Well, he is the latest guy that the Democrats are going to grab. He has been indicted on multiple felony counts. H is a foreigner who used foreign money and try to put foreign money into our campaign. Now, the Democrats want to hear from him and the media call it evidence. Evidence? Now, the media took here before with Michael Avenatti? Where is he today? His ass is in jail. Remember the porno star, Stormy Daniels? Where is she? No idea. Michal Cohen, remember him? He was going to bring down Trump on campaign charges. Where is he? He is in federal prison. Now, something funny about these two articles of impeachment. There is no constitutional violation. There is no statutory violation. There is no violation of a federal court order. This is why they keep throwing up smoke. And I want to tell these five Republicans of the Senate, the weak links in the chain -- Romney, Collins, Murkowski, Gardner, and the other one skips my mind, luckily, Alexander. Let me tell you something. You have a duty to uphold the Constitution. What the House of representatives has done here is destroy the Constitution. It's your job to fix it. It's your job to stop them. Not aid and abet by calling witnesses that the Democrats want. No. No witnesses. No witnesses. This should be dismissed. This is a disgrace. That's it."

And once that starts unraveling -- you know, let me just say in a broader sense that the fact that Joe Biden is still the front runner is an indication of how weak the Democratic field is. I mean, with all due respect to the former vice president and the gaffes and all the rest of it, when you look at that field, that field -- there's no way on earth that they can stand toe-to-toe with the president. I think that's fueling the impeachment. But when I'm disappointed with, Sean, is that you failed to mention when you introduced me the fact that, you know, I have a robust life in terms of liking a drink now and then. I've been sober for a week, because I promised not to have a glass of alcohol until the president is acquitted, because I'm confident he will be. And the sooner, the better, so he can get the party back on. But I think that Democrats --"
