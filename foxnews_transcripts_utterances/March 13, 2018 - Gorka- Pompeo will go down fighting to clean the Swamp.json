According to a brand-new book out today, Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, they actually hired Fusion GPS. That's the firm that produced the phony Russian dossier.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, look at that, about 820,000 of 11 million illegal immigrants in America are convicted criminals. The U.S. Sentencing Commission has also found illegal immigrants account for 13 percent of non-immigration related federal sentencing during the fiscal year 2016.

There is a new book called 'Russian Roulette.' It's written by liberal journalists, Michael Isikoff and David Corn, it's meant to smear President Trump. But instead, it is confirming very key pieces of information that we've been telling you all about. 'The Daily Caller,' they obtained a copy of this book. They were reporting that Barack Obama's 2012 campaign -- now, this is fascinating -- they actually paid Fusion GPS $3 million for oppo research on Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign, they were able to hide it -- get this -- by funneling payments to Fusion GPS through that law firm Perkins Coie, that's the same one that Hillary used.

They paid over $12 million for a dossier that used Russian government sources and lies and misinformation and propaganda.

Former British by Christopher Steele openly doubted his own dossier to his friends, and especially one of the biggest pieces of fake news from a dossier, he had no clue if it was true.

So, Steele didn't think it was true but he included it anyway, and Hillary bought it. And then she gave it to the FBI. The FBI didn't do their job. They never verified it, they never corroborated it, which is not only protocol but that is what the FISA law tells them to do. And then the FBI used it to secure a FISA warrant, that same thing Christopher Steele didn't even believe in, to spy on an opposition party candidate in an election year. And then, of course, they never told the FISA judge that the Clinton campaign and the DNC pay for these unverified, salacious lies, and nobody had any clue if it was true.

Well, it turns out that it's a foreign businessman named Sergei Millian. The thing is, Sergei is telling 'The Daily Caller' that the dossier is, quote, garbage news. Well, that wasn't hard to figure out. Why didn't the FBI do it? And finally, 'The Washington times' reporting on yet another major revelation. Senior Obama State Department official Victoria Nuland actually gave the original approval for an FBI agent to meet with Christopher Steele about the fake news dossier. And that means the Obama administration was directly involved. We also reached out to Nuland for comment. Her spokesperson -- well, got back to us but never directly addressed our questions. Instead, he just directed us to old interviews that she had done on the topic. Gee, thanks very much. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This new revelation is a very key piece of information. Why? Because it started the entire process of spying on a Trump campaign associate and then ultimately the Trump campaign. So, how is it possible -- think about this -- in the United States of America, the FBI never corroborated this phony dossier with Russian lies, it violated its own protocols, the FISA law itself? This is a massive abuse of power. By the way, the full scope of this is now only slowly being revealed. And it's only because a few of us are working hard to get you the truth. There is even more explosive information that, you know, is going to come out in time. So, I say to everybody out there, tick tock, stay with us. All right. Finally tonight, ranking Democratic member on the House Intel Committee, liberal Adam Schiff, well, we know he's proven to be a liar, you know, for over a year now, he's been orchestrating nothing short of a propaganda, misinformation campaign against President Trump to delegitimize him and hopefully even take him out of office. By the way, Vladimir Putin would be proud of all the work Schiff is doing. Remember, the Russians' main goal -- what do we learn? -- was to sow political discord. And guess what? That is exactly what Congressman Schiff has been doing in this country nonstop, even though he is now known the entire time, no evidence, no proof whatsoever of Russia-Trump collusion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look at Congressman Schiff.

Now, for years, prominent elected Democrats, they have palled around with one of America's biggest, most prominent racist and anti-Semite, a guy by the name of Louis Farrakhan. And there's Hillary Clinton, as she continues to play the race and gender card and is still whining and making excuses about why she lost the election. And in the process, she is insulting women and every American who voted for Donald Trump. We'll break that down in tonight's mini monologue. All right. So, Louis Farrakhan, he purports to be a great leader, administer of the Nation of Islam. But in reality, he is a small-minded bigoted racist, who pedals hatred, and of course, conspiracy theories to anybody that will listen to him. And sadly, this includes, eight Democratic members of Congress, and even Barack Obama was pictured at an event with Farrakhan, prior to becoming president in 2005. Now, during the 2008 election, the Congressional Black Caucus, they made sure that no American saw that picture. That picture never saw the light of day. And that is according to the man who actually took the picture. Now, tonight, we're asking one obvious question. If these Democrats really cared as they say about combatting racism, pushing equality, why would they have ties to that vile human being? Here are just a few of his bigoted views. Take a look.",

By the way, spoiler alert, you are not going to hear outrage from liberals on this topic. Why? It doesn't help them politically. That's sad.

After visiting California and viewing border wall prototypes, and, of course, that means he is one step closer to fulfilling his campaign promise and, yes, building that wall. And also tonight, President Trump blasting the governor of California and the liberal mayor of Oakland for protecting criminal illegal immigrants who are posing a serious threat to you the American people. We have all of that plus several stunning new revelations about the Clinton bought and paid for a dossier tonight. According to a brand-new book out today, Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, they actually hired Fusion GPS. That's the firm that produced the phony Russian dossier. They were doing oppo research on Mitt Romney and they funneled through the same law firm. We have all the details. And former senior Obama State Department official, Victoria Nuland, started the process for the FBI to talk to former British spy Christopher Steele, and Steele, what actually doubted its most salacious details on claims in his dossier about Donald Trump were even true. And tonight, we'll expose the anatomy of the Russia lie and how Democrats and the media created one of the biggest hoaxes in American history. They've been caught red-handed after the House Intel Committee concluded there is no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. All of that information. Also, Rex Tillerson is out of the secretary of state. Mike Pompeo from the CIA is in and the Democrats, interesting, they are threatening to block the first woman nominated to be the CIA director. Why? Because of her history of being tough on terrorists. Ed Henry has a full report. And that's all in tonight breaking news opening monologue."

We are looking very much at the wall with some see-through capability on the other side, and then solid concrete on top, or steel and concrete on top. The round piece that you see up here, or you see more clearly back there, the larger it is, the better it is because it's very hard to get over the top. It's really deterrent from getting over the top. Who would think? Who would think? But getting over the top is easy. These are like professional mountain climbers, they are incredible climbers.

Because they won't follow the law, cooperate with federal immigration officials, and they are trying to do their job, arrest illegal immigrant criminals and remove them from the country. This is a national security issues. Democrats -- sadly, they are putting politics and subjecting Americans to unnecessary dangers. If one American is a victim of a crime committed by people that have no business being in this country, that we know committed other crimes, then Democrats in California -- well, they will have to own that. And what's so despicable about all of this is that Democrats continue to lie and misrepresent the facts when it comes to illegal immigrant crime. Here are just a couple of statistics that the left in this country don't want you to know about. According to the Migration Policy Institute, look at that, about 820,000 of 11 million illegal immigrants in America are convicted criminals. The U.S. Sentencing Commission has also found illegal immigrants account for 13 percent of non-immigration related federal sentencing during the fiscal year 2016. That's despite the fact that these illegal immigrants, they only make up 3.5 percent of the population. It is a stunning number and that number only relates to federal sentences. It is much higher when you include convictions by state and local authorities. It is beyond shameful that the left, Democrats, Jerry Brown, this Oakland mayor, they ignore the irrefutable data that is out there and they continue to protect criminal illegal immigrants. Liberals have also no clue about what actually happens at the border. I've been down there. We've shown you. I've been at least a dozen times from the Rio Grande, the San Diego on horseback, on all-terrain vehicles, boats, look at me riding a horse. I nearly fell off. We've been all over on boats and everything. I've seen the arrests of gang members. I've seen the drug tunnels. I've seen a drug warehouses and everything in between. In 2014, I sat on them as border briefing about border security with then-Texas Governor Rick Perry. During a seven-year period, illegal immigrants committed 642,000 crimes against Texans alone. This is a serious problem. When are we going to put the safety of the American people first? Watch this."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Really? Really? Here's another piece of key information the left desperately wants to keep secret from you, the American people. We like to tell you the truth. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, President Trump $18 billion border wall, it would actually pay for itself by reducing illegal immigrant crime. That means drugs coming across the border, reducing the number of federal benefits going to illegal immigrants that don't respect our sovereignty, don't respect our laws. Also tonight, we have new bombshell information about that Clinton bought and paid for dossier. There is a new book called 'Russian Roulette.' It's written by liberal journalists, Michael Isikoff and David Corn, it's meant to smear President Trump. But instead, it is confirming very key pieces of information that we've been telling you all about. 'The Daily Caller,' they obtained a copy of this book. They were reporting that Barack Obama's 2012 campaign -- now, this is fascinating -- they actually paid Fusion GPS $3 million for oppo research on Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign, they were able to hide it -- get this -- by funneling payments to Fusion GPS through that law firm Perkins Coie, that's the same one that Hillary used. We reached out to both president Obama and his campaign. They never got back to us. This is the exact same thing that Hillary Clinton did, except she and the DNC, well, they didn't pay 3 million. They paid over $12 million for a dossier that used Russian government sources and lies and misinformation and propaganda. And 'The Daily Caller' is also reporting on another key piece of information from a book. Former British by Christopher Steele openly doubted his own dossier to his friends, and especially one of the biggest pieces of fake news from a dossier, he had no clue if it was true. It was kind of 50/50 if it's true. And, of course, I'm talking about the completely ridiculous, still never verified, fabricated story about Donald Trump and hookers at the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow urinating in the bed. So, Steele didn't think it was true but he included it anyway, and Hillary bought it. And then she gave it to the FBI. The FBI didn't do their job. They never verified it, they never corroborated it, which is not only protocol but that is what the FISA law tells them to do. And then the FBI used it to secure a FISA warrant, that same thing Christopher Steele didn't even believe in, to spy on an opposition party candidate in an election year. And then, of course, they never told the FISA judge that the Clinton campaign and the DNC pay for these unverified, salacious lies, and nobody had any clue if it was true. Wow. And 'The Daily Caller' is also highlighting how the book reveals a key source behind this Ritz-Carlton claim. Well, it turns out that it's a foreign businessman named Sergei Millian. The thing is, Sergei is telling 'The Daily Caller' that the dossier is, quote, garbage news. Well, that wasn't hard to figure out. Why didn't the FBI do it? And finally, 'The Washington times' reporting on yet another major revelation. Senior Obama State Department official Victoria Nuland actually gave the original approval for an FBI agent to meet with Christopher Steele about the fake news dossier. And that means the Obama administration was directly involved. We also reached out to Nuland for comment. Her spokesperson -- well, got back to us but never directly addressed our questions. Instead, he just directed us to old interviews that she had done on the topic. Gee, thanks very much. This new revelation is a very key piece of information. Why? Because it started the entire process of spying on a Trump campaign associate and then ultimately the Trump campaign. So, how is it possible -- think about this -- in the United States of America, the FBI never corroborated this phony dossier with Russian lies, it violated its own protocols, the FISA law itself? This is a massive abuse of power. By the way, the full scope of this is now only slowly being revealed. And it's only because a few of us are working hard to get you the truth. There is even more explosive information that, you know, is going to come out in time. So, I say to everybody out there, tick tock, stay with us. All right. Finally tonight, ranking Democratic member on the House Intel Committee, liberal Adam Schiff, well, we know he's proven to be a liar, you know, for over a year now, he's been orchestrating nothing short of a propaganda, misinformation campaign against President Trump to delegitimize him and hopefully even take him out of office. By the way, Vladimir Putin would be proud of all the work Schiff is doing. Remember, the Russians' main goal -- what do we learn? -- was to sow political discord. And guess what? That is exactly what Congressman Schiff has been doing in this country nonstop, even though he is now known the entire time, no evidence, no proof whatsoever of Russia-Trump collusion. Take a look at Congressman Schiff. This is the evolution over time on this issue. Take a look at this."

For example, just today, Democrats on the House Intel Committee announced that they're going to continue the Russia investigation on their own. And they're going to try and counter the findings from Republicans. Oh, you think you would have known in 14 months. Here with reaction, our top story tonight, FOX News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera, NRA TV contributor and former Secret Service agent, Dan Bongino. You know, Geraldo, I watch this every day. Schiff is now saying, oh, they ended the investigation early. We have a Senate investigation. We have a special counsel investigation. We have the House Intel Investigation.

And hopefully, Mueller, the special counsel, will as well. It is clear now that if there was any proof, that the president of the United States or the candidate prior to this presidency was colluding with a foreign power to rig the American election, after 14 months, for goodness sake, we would have understood and learned it. It is clear there is no proof of collusion because there was no collusion. You have spearheaded this effort. It is a fraud to continue this narrative. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. Let's say that there was a real concern that this happened, that a foreign power did surveil out and rig our election.

Well, who is Victoria Nuland? She was the chief of staff to a guy named Strobe Talbot. Well, who is Strobe Talbot? He was a high-ranking diplomat under the Bill Clinton administration. Who was Strobe Talbot's his brother-in-law? Cody Shearer, who is working with Sid Blumenthal in Libya to get information to the Clintons about Libya and also, the Blumenthal operation was the second source of information in addition to Christopher Steele that made up the dossier file which lied about Donald Trump.

Now, Haspel will become the first female director in CIA history if, in fact, she is confirmed. However, tonight, there is talk about Democrats may fight Haspel's historic nomination due to her past involvement running overseas black sites that were set up following the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed 3,000 Americans. Joining us now with more, Fox News chief national correspondent, Ed Henry. By the way, Ed will be filling in for our own Shannon Bream tonight at 11:00 Eastern. Also, with us, Fox News national strategist, former deputy assistant to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. You know, Ed, the amazing thing about this, 3,000 Americans were killed here, 3,000. If you go to Gitmo, there were three people total that were waterboarded in spite all the debate we had in the country, three. One of them was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, which because of that action, yeah, it's definitely tough, it led to the courier, and that led to bin Laden, and that led to killing bin Laden, without which he would probably still be alive today. We can't have evil exist in this world without doing something to counter it.

She was running the New York office for the CIA and was a liaison to the FBI. In the Obama years, when Osama bin Laden, as you mentioned, was killed. So, this was someone who, yes, she was involved in the black sites, the so- called black sites, where you had enhanced interrogation techniques, critics call it torture. You're right. There's already been a debate and we can expect there will be an even bigger debate in the days ahead. You have Democrats like Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, already saying they will use these confirmation hearings to ask sharp questions about the behavior post-9/11. But, by the way, there will be Republicans like John McCain, already had with tough comments tonight, saying she was involved in torture. They are going to give her a tough ride in the confirmation. But here's the bottom line. This is something I've talked to people in the White House about and they say they are spoiling for this fight.

And the thing I like about Pompeo, you're always able to have a conversation with him and he would listen. Whether you agree or disagree. I found him -- in the case of Rex Tillerson, I never talked to the guy wants. He seemed never to be available for the media. And he was at odds especially on the Iranian policy of the president. I mean, President Trump never wanted to extend that Iranian deal once, but he was fighting within his own -- in this particular case, State Department."

He is done some -- very quietly, he done some amazing things in the CIA. And I can think of no better person to clean the real swamp that is foggy- bottom in the state department. Not only does he listen to other people, my personal experience, Mike also reaches out for good counsel from people who are outside the swamp. So, Rex failed at the state department. He isolated the political appointees from the front office. He didn't return calls from our ambassadors. That it was time for him to go.

By all accounts, we haven't heard -- maybe a single Democrat really raise questions about that.

The race card, the gender card, rich versus poor, old versus young, men versus women, now these are all tactics, predictable tactics, that the left uses in order to claim the moral high ground. Now, of course, this despicable strategy is built on a foundation of lies. Now, for years, prominent elected Democrats, they have palled around with one of America's biggest, most prominent racist and anti-Semite, a guy by the name of Louis Farrakhan. And there's Hillary Clinton, as she continues to play the race and gender card and is still whining and making excuses about why she lost the election. And in the process, she is insulting women and every American who voted for Donald Trump. We'll break that down in tonight's mini monologue. All right. So, Louis Farrakhan, he purports to be a great leader, administer of the Nation of Islam. But in reality, he is a small-minded bigoted racist, who pedals hatred, and of course, conspiracy theories to anybody that will listen to him. And sadly, this includes, eight Democratic members of Congress, and even Barack Obama was pictured at an event with Farrakhan, prior to becoming president in 2005. Now, during the 2008 election, the Congressional Black Caucus, they made sure that no American saw that picture. That picture never saw the light of day. And that is according to the man who actually took the picture. Now, tonight, we're asking one obvious question. If these Democrats really cared as they say about combatting racism, pushing equality, why would they have ties to that vile human being? Here are just a few of his bigoted views. Take a look."

Caucasian means weak blooded, weak boned, stale face. That pale -- what the Indians call a pale man. There is no human being on earth that has murdered more living things than the Caucasian.

Where are the Democrats calling for Ellison, Waters and others, to explain their ties to this bigot racist and anti-Semite? By the way, spoiler alert, you are not going to hear outrage from liberals on this topic. Why? It doesn't help them politically. That's sad. And then, of course, you have Hillary Clinton, doing an appearance, in India over the weekend. Hillary made no mention of Farrakhan.
