Not only is the county ignoring the science on COVID, it's defying an executive order that was issued by the Governor Larry Hogan earlier this week. The Hogan administration shot back at this county health commissioner with a memo that came from the state health secretary today. But what are parents thinking as this political battle plays out? What are they going to do with their kids' education? Joining me now is Megan Brown, a Montgomery County private school parent. Megan, a lot of parochial schools, independent schools involved here. If your kids can't go back to school, what does that mean for your family? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

JOHN DANIEL DAVIDSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": There has been a lot of talk over the years about education reform, but our lawmakers haven't been willing to do it. One idea that's been talked about is to give vouchers to families and to parents so that they can decide for themselves how best to educate their children.

But first, \"Gunning for Your Rights\" that's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Now, I've warned you countless times that Democrats in New York are giving us a precursor of what will happen nationally if Biden wins.

Now, if Ms. James was really an unbiased official looking to stem abuse in a 501(c)(3) organization then why isn't she launching an investigation into the butcher's, the Planned Parenthood that prey on women in the inner city? I can tell you why. Planned Parenthood has pledged $45 million to elect Democrats this year, while the NRA, well, a big nothing.

Now, in that case the DOJ will be stacked with prosecutors like Ms. James. Who needs to debate issues on the merits about guns or gun ownership? When you just can take out the opposition, take them out of the game altogether.

And - I mean, there are so many things for Letitia James to investigate. For example, now Mayor de Blasio's wife can't account for $900 million in a organization that I started and Bloomberg continued, and he ruined. He called - he named Thrive New York, which really seems to be thrive somebody we don't know who. Nobody's investigating that, Laura. That's $900 million in New York City. The City Council went crazy when they found out about it. And now nobody wants to talk about it. So that could easily be investigated. The NRA is ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous, what she's doing. And is actually seeking capital punishment for whatever she claims are the arrows- -"

On the one hand, as you mentioned, they are people who are living and experience that fewer than 1 percent - One 10th of 1 percent of the people on the planet are able to.

And a friend of mine the other day was saying this is like elder abuse to put him through this. And it's actually not funny in a way. This is serious, this is our country. But then they say look at Donald Trump, he mispronounced \"Yosemite.\" But you spent all this time with Trump. Trump's cognitive abilities versus Biden's cognitive ability, what is the comparison, Gov?"

      "utterance": "I've heard Trump give a speech for an hour and 20 minutes without notes. He stands up there and he delivers. We all make some verbal blunders, but Joe is at a point where, honestly, he is well-known for plagiarism. His best shot as to plagiarize some of his own speeches from eight or 12 or 20 or 30 years ago, because he was coherent then and he isn't now. There is a great comedian named Durwood Fincher. He's hilarious, and his bit is Mr. Doubletalk. And he just talks a lot without saying anything that makes sense. He is hilariously funny. And when I hear Joe talking, I'm thinking, gosh, this is like Durwood Fincher, the comedian, except it is not a comedian, and he's not doing it to be funny. And it is something to be seriously concerned about whether or not he understands what's coming out of his mouth. And the press is letting him off the hook in a way I've never seen before. And they've got to be able to objectively ask themselves the question, is he able to communicate without notes and without a prompter. And I think the answer is no, he can't."
