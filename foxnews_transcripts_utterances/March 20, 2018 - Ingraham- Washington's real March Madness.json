      "sentences": "Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is 'THE INGRAHAM ANGLE.' There was another explosion in Austin, Texas tonight, but authorities are saying they have no reason right now to believe that the incident is related to the previous explosions that have the city on edge. We are expecting a press conference from law enforcement officials, but for now, let's go to Fox News' Casey Stegall who is live in Austin -- Casey. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "speaker": "CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Laura, good evening. Hopefully, we get some clarification at this press conference we are waiting because not only have they said that they don't believe this incident that happened at the Goodwill Store in South Austin was related to the package bombs, and that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, because it is not every day an incendiary device goes off at a store. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, either the federal authorities who came out and said that, both from the ATF and FBI, they may know something that they don't want to disclose to the public to jeopardize the investigation, but they were able to rule out right away that this didn't fit the hallmarks of the other incidents, or it is possible that this was a copycat crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Again, that is all speculation because we simply don't know. Hopefully, we can get some clarification soon. What we do know right now is that one employee at that Goodwill Store was injured. Apparently, there was this incendiary device, according to the ATF and the FBI, and it went off, injuring the employee. So, we do know that right now, and Goodwill Industries of Austin has sent out a message on social media saying that until further notice all Goodwill Stores in Austin will remain closed. There have been some local reports of that incendiary device was in a box that was right next to the donation bin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And when the employee went to check the donation bin, that is when the incendiary device went off. This, of course, Laura, on the heels of five explosions that have rocked Austin, Texas, since the beginning of this month. Then tonight the ATF also confirmed that a bomb was found inside a package at an Austin FedEx distribution center right next to the international airport here in Austin. But they found it before it went off, and they did a controlled detonation of it at that site. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So that was after a different package did explode at another FedEx distribution center. That one was outside of San Antonio and it happened earlier this morning. That was explosion number five. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Number four was Sunday night, a bomb with a triple wire was planted near a fence in an affluent Austin neighborhood, two men in their 20s driving by on bicycles tripped the wire, causing the bomb to go off. They were seriously hurt. And explosions one, two, and three happened earlier in the month, and those came in the form of packages that were left on the front doorstep, so front porches, of homes, and went off when the person touched or opened them, and two people were killed between those three blasts at homes in east Austin. And then you had number four Sunday night. Number five at the distribution center. So police say this shows them that the incidents are getting more sophisticated and they think that if it is the work of the same person or persons that they say it is unprecedented. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, a lot of unanswered questions tonight, but I can tell you this is a city on edge. Not to be trite, but it is a city on edge. People just don't know where the next call will come from. So that is the latest right here on the ground. Laura, we'll keep you posted as soon as we learn more.",

      "sentences": "Laura, three things, very important, especially in bombing cases. Number one is the crime scene forensics, being able to do good crime scenes, and thorough crime scenes, and to get the information from the crime scene out to investigators to follow up on is vital. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The idea that we had a pristine bomb that was able to be controlled and detonated is very important and could very well allow them to take a quantum leap in this case. You know, the second part of this is even more important in that, when you have the information with the crime scenes, we have information eyewitnesses, you use shoe leather. I know that it's not sexy and I know that people think when you're talking about the basics of police work, which is relationship and interviews and knocking on doors, the more you do that, the more the people who are doing that are skilled and trained in doing interviews, interviews are vital because they help people decide if they actually saw something that is important sometimes or they solicit even more from people who did see something because you are looking for the maximum amount of information you can get. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then finally, all of this is useless unless you form that team with the public. Because, as we have seen, and as Mark would say and I would tell you, and I can give you lots of specifics, case after this case, especially terrorism cases, these are prevented terrorist acts or we have had terrorists arrested and identified because the public came through after they responded to information given to them by law enforcement. I'll make one final point, then I should stop for Mark a little bit here, but -- and this is important as well. In a lot of these cases, the police themselves, law enforcement, they are the first on the scene, the first to see something suspicious, the first to stop somebody on a highway like Texas Trooper Charlie Hanger did. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is vital, and we have seen this in case after case from the Unabomber to the Olympic bomber, to 1993, the list goes on. I will stop there. Those are the things that are important and putting together a strategy to integrate all of them and to encourage people to call and help us put this together and stop this and stop it now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You use the tripwire.

So long gone are the days of the so-called regular order when appropriations were done the sensible way.

He passed that box after another employee who was told to dispose of the box. That employee took the box around the corner and, and upon looking inside of it, it had two small devices that were artillery simulators that look like some type of military ordinance or some type of memento. The employee handled one of those devices, at which time it initiated, and the employee sustained an injury. That employee was transported to the hospital, and he is doing well and he is recovering. Of course, as you can imagine, with all of the incidents that have been going on in the Austin area recently, we responded to this with our EOD team along with our federal partners from the ATF and FBI to investigate this, just as we did all of the rest of the incidents that occurred in the city as an explosive device. After our investigation on scene, we did determine that this was not an explosive device. This incident is not related to any of the other incidents that we have had here in Austin. This was an old military type ordnance that initiated in this person's hands and it did cause injury. There is no reason for us to believe that it is related to any of the other incidents that have occurred, and we are thankful that we got the response that we did. And we just want to reiterate to the community that if you see something suspicious, if you have a suspicious box, a suspicious package, that you continue to call 911. We are receiving a lot of calls about suspicious packages, and we want the community to continue to be vigilant and notify us of these packages as they come in. We will respond to every single one of these. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We are fortunate that we are being aided by our federal partners, by other DOD units around the state and around the country that have come in to help with these calls. And we want everyone to know that, if you see something, say something. We are in this together as a community. We want all of these incidents resolved and we want them solved quickly, and we can do that together as a community with your help. With that, I can open up to any other questions about this incident here on Brody Lane tonight.",

So they are holding off just like we would normally do. But I think something really important is going on, and that is that if you watch them, you get the instinct that all of this task force is really working well together. The federal, the local, the state, you don't see any differences. You see really dedicated people communicating with each other. Remember that while they were out there talking to us and while they are out there doing the job during the day, these people are working all night. People are now working on this 24/7. And we can be proud of what I think we are seeing. One more point I want to make. We have heard that several hundred breeds were developed and interviews conducted. That's interesting. But we have also heard that several hundred fellow agents are in Austin doing work there. Let me tell you something, several hundred federal agents are already trying to track down these components that came from these crime scenes. That is why they are there. And that tells us a great deal. And we have to hope and we have to pray that this is resolved a lot quicker than we might think, because I think they are doing everything right. They're doing everything they possibly can do. And I'm very proud of them.

So they are working on every little piece of these bombs, every wire, every connection, every nut, bolt, anything that is in that device they are trying to track down to who bought it, where was it bought, where was it made?

Or in 2013 when Obama broke three decades of precedent to congratulate the winner of the Iranian presidential election? Or in 2014 when Obama congratulated Turkey's President Ergodan, the same guy who said there is no such thing as moderate Islam?

I don't recall so many of these voices of concern, or any of the swamp dwellers fulminating about those congratulatory wishes. The double standard is so obvious it's pathetic.

      "utterance": "Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is 'THE INGRAHAM ANGLE.' There was another explosion in Austin, Texas tonight, but authorities are saying they have no reason right now to believe that the incident is related to the previous explosions that have the city on edge. We are expecting a press conference from law enforcement officials, but for now, let's go to Fox News' Casey Stegall who is live in Austin -- Casey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Laura, good evening. Hopefully, we get some clarification at this press conference we are waiting because not only have they said that they don't believe this incident that happened at the Goodwill Store in South Austin was related to the package bombs, and that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, because it is not every day an incendiary device goes off at a store. So, either the federal authorities who came out and said that, both from the ATF and FBI, they may know something that they don't want to disclose to the public to jeopardize the investigation, but they were able to rule out right away that this didn't fit the hallmarks of the other incidents, or it is possible that this was a copycat crime. Again, that is all speculation because we simply don't know. Hopefully, we can get some clarification soon. What we do know right now is that one employee at that Goodwill Store was injured. Apparently, there was this incendiary device, according to the ATF and the FBI, and it went off, injuring the employee. So, we do know that right now, and Goodwill Industries of Austin has sent out a message on social media saying that until further notice all Goodwill Stores in Austin will remain closed. There have been some local reports of that incendiary device was in a box that was right next to the donation bin. And when the employee went to check the donation bin, that is when the incendiary device went off. This, of course, Laura, on the heels of five explosions that have rocked Austin, Texas, since the beginning of this month. Then tonight the ATF also confirmed that a bomb was found inside a package at an Austin FedEx distribution center right next to the international airport here in Austin. But they found it before it went off, and they did a controlled detonation of it at that site. So that was after a different package did explode at another FedEx distribution center. That one was outside of San Antonio and it happened earlier this morning. That was explosion number five. Number four was Sunday night, a bomb with a triple wire was planted near a fence in an affluent Austin neighborhood, two men in their 20s driving by on bicycles tripped the wire, causing the bomb to go off. They were seriously hurt. And explosions one, two, and three happened earlier in the month, and those came in the form of packages that were left on the front doorstep, so front porches, of homes, and went off when the person touched or opened them, and two people were killed between those three blasts at homes in east Austin. And then you had number four Sunday night. Number five at the distribution center. So police say this shows them that the incidents are getting more sophisticated and they think that if it is the work of the same person or persons that they say it is unprecedented. So, a lot of unanswered questions tonight, but I can tell you this is a city on edge. Not to be trite, but it is a city on edge. People just don't know where the next call will come from. So that is the latest right here on the ground. Laura, we'll keep you posted as soon as we learn more."

Both of you, this is, like, surreal, by the moment, things are changing. We might have this news conference. But Terry, let's go to you. Your wealth of experience in tracking the Unabomber over years. Now we hear, this is going to be quick deal, we'll find them quickly. Tell us what we need to know, the top three things that law enforcement must determine to narrow down who this suspect might be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TERRY TURCHIE, FORMER FBI COUNTERTERROR AGENT",
      "utterance": "Laura, three things, very important, especially in bombing cases. Number one is the crime scene forensics, being able to do good crime scenes, and thorough crime scenes, and to get the information from the crime scene out to investigators to follow up on is vital. The idea that we had a pristine bomb that was able to be controlled and detonated is very important and could very well allow them to take a quantum leap in this case. You know, the second part of this is even more important in that, when you have the information with the crime scenes, we have information eyewitnesses, you use shoe leather. I know that it's not sexy and I know that people think when you're talking about the basics of police work, which is relationship and interviews and knocking on doors, the more you do that, the more the people who are doing that are skilled and trained in doing interviews, interviews are vital because they help people decide if they actually saw something that is important sometimes or they solicit even more from people who did see something because you are looking for the maximum amount of information you can get. Then finally, all of this is useless unless you form that team with the public. Because, as we have seen, and as Mark would say and I would tell you, and I can give you lots of specifics, case after this case, especially terrorism cases, these are prevented terrorist acts or we have had terrorists arrested and identified because the public came through after they responded to information given to them by law enforcement. I'll make one final point, then I should stop for Mark a little bit here, but -- and this is important as well. In a lot of these cases, the police themselves, law enforcement, they are the first on the scene, the first to see something suspicious, the first to stop somebody on a highway like Texas Trooper Charlie Hanger did. This is vital, and we have seen this in case after case from the Unabomber to the Olympic bomber, to 1993, the list goes on. I will stop there. Those are the things that are important and putting together a strategy to integrate all of them and to encourage people to call and help us put this together and stop this and stop it now."

Now you can look up on the internet how to put together a fairly sophisticated tripwire bomb. I mean, it could be just a firecracker, how you load the gunpowder. I watched the whole thing just before the show. So, people can learn this stuff, although this begins to seem a little more sophisticated, does it not, as time goes on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK FUHRMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, Laura, I couldn't agree with Terry and everything he said, every single word. He was spot on, in my opinion. To your question, the library has all these books, and they have had for post-Vietnam, these books have been out there on how to build bombs, how to build booby-traps."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK FUHRMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It is really not that sophisticated, but I think what is important in this case is just how sophisticated the bombs are. What are the components of the bomb, what is the trip trigger pressure, what type of ignition system is the suspect using? Another thing that really catches my eye is the fourth bombing. You use the tripwire. If I was a detective on this case at the ground level in the city, the Metropolitan Police Department, I would have to contemplate, I would have to consider, that the suspect actually watched that bombing, that he wanted to see one. And I think it was supposed to be a pedestrian, not a bicycle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "You believe that the targets were being surveilled by the bomb maker himself, and maybe there is some type of perverse thrill, you want to see if it works. Makes you feel like a big man -- I'm assuming it's a man, which might be unfair, but I'm assuming it's a man. It's a big rush for them. That could be true in this case, could it not be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURCHIE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. In fact, I agree with Mark. I think these acts when you think about a person walking into a residential neighborhood and building a comfort level which allows them to go up on a porch and placed a package, which has a bomb in it, and then turn around and walk away, or to do this tripwire, which I think Mark would agree, would take time to kind of set up and arrange, at least a lot of time when you are a bomber wanting to get out of the scene. So, these are acts designed to essentially terrorize civilians. These are all civilians that could have been affected by these bombs. What is the next logical step for this kind of personality? To stand over off to the side and watch how the bomb explodes. I think he is right on."

He might have been a serial bomber in other places, in one incidence or he might have blown up other buildings or different things out in the suburbs that nobody really took notice. Now he has escalated, and he could quite possibly be trying to figure out the correct formula, the correct method, the correct pressure device, mercury device, trigger, timer, tripwire, or whatever that would affect the most damage to a human target. Because he hasn't been incredibly effective in his explosive devices, so I would suspect that his explosive element of his bombs might be homemade.

So long gone are the days of the so-called regular order when appropriations were done the sensible way. Department by department, a lot more transparent that way with each bill being considered separately. Under that scenario, Congress and the voters who elected them have more opportunities to either strip out the waste and fund only essential priorities. It makes sense, right? For years, we have heard leaders in both parties pledged to return to regular order, yet nothing ever happens. And it is backed to these mind-numbing continuing resolutions, omnibus nightmares, and shutdown threats, and the result is usually a last-minute budget-busting cram down. Sure enough, as spring kicks off, here they go again, and it's really ugly. Democrats are still in the minority.

Now Republicans are in charge, like, well, the military needs another 300 billion and this project needs a couple $20 billion here and $30 billion here, and we turn around, and the Republicans are the party of big spending, Congressman.

It doesn't make any sense because sanctuary cities, Laura, actually make our cities safer because it allows for the undocumented community is to actually communicate and share information with police officers so that they can actually do their job.

I understand -- Jose, hold on. I understand some people cooperate with authorities. That's great. But those people shouldn't be in the country in the first place. So this idea it's safer because we have more illegal immigrants, that's lunacy. I think most people in the country, they hear this and they think California has gone cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

I'm an assistant chief of police with the Austin police department, and with me I have an assistant city manager Rey Arellano as well as assistant chief Chris McIlvain. Tonight, at approximately 7:00 p.m. the Austin police department received a call that came through Travis County. The call was upgraded to a bomb hot shot call that occurred at the Goodwill in the 9800 block of Brody Lane. APD officers responded to the scene. Upon the initial investigation, officers determined that a Goodwill employee had found a box that someone had dropped out that contained some items that that employee didn't think the Goodwill wanted to have. He passed that box after another employee who was told to dispose of the box. That employee took the box around the corner and, and upon looking inside of it, it had two small devices that were artillery simulators that look like some type of military ordinance or some type of memento. The employee handled one of those devices, at which time it initiated, and the employee sustained an injury. That employee was transported to the hospital, and he is doing well and he is recovering. Of course, as you can imagine, with all of the incidents that have been going on in the Austin area recently, we responded to this with our EOD team along with our federal partners from the ATF and FBI to investigate this, just as we did all of the rest of the incidents that occurred in the city as an explosive device. After our investigation on scene, we did determine that this was not an explosive device. This incident is not related to any of the other incidents that we have had here in Austin. This was an old military type ordnance that initiated in this person's hands and it did cause injury. There is no reason for us to believe that it is related to any of the other incidents that have occurred, and we are thankful that we got the response that we did. And we just want to reiterate to the community that if you see something suspicious, if you have a suspicious box, a suspicious package, that you continue to call 911. We are receiving a lot of calls about suspicious packages, and we want the community to continue to be vigilant and notify us of these packages as they come in. We will respond to every single one of these. We are fortunate that we are being aided by our federal partners, by other DOD units around the state and around the country that have come in to help with these calls. And we want everyone to know that, if you see something, say something. We are in this together as a community. We want all of these incidents resolved and we want them solved quickly, and we can do that together as a community with your help. With that, I can open up to any other questions about this incident here on Brody Lane tonight."

      "utterance": "All right, let's bring back Terry Turchie, former deputy assistant director of counterterrorism at the FBI, and FOX News contributor Mark Fuhrman, a retired LAPD detective. Let's unpack this. So this last device was incendiary but not explosive. Terry, did we glean anything from the official there on the status of this investigation? He seemed very reluctant to discuss any of the other devices."

      "speaker": "TERRY TURCHIE, FORMER FBI COUNTERTERRORISM AGENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he is reluctant, Laura, because they are going to want to try and give information to help the public sort this out while protecting just about everything they have. They don't want to create copycats and they want to know when they find the right person that that person hasn't been privy to information and can be a phony leader or something. So they are holding off just like we would normally do. But I think something really important is going on, and that is that if you watch them, you get the instinct that all of this task force is really working well together. The federal, the local, the state, you don't see any differences. You see really dedicated people communicating with each other. Remember that while they were out there talking to us and while they are out there doing the job during the day, these people are working all night. People are now working on this 24/7. And we can be proud of what I think we are seeing. One more point I want to make. We have heard that several hundred breeds were developed and interviews conducted. That's interesting. But we have also heard that several hundred fellow agents are in Austin doing work there. Let me tell you something, several hundred federal agents are already trying to track down these components that came from these crime scenes. That is why they are there. And that tells us a great deal. And we have to hope and we have to pray that this is resolved a lot quicker than we might think, because I think they are doing everything right. They're doing everything they possibly can do. And I'm very proud of them. I've sat there and watched bombs go off while you're trying to manage something, and on behalf of all those people, that is a hard thing to do. And I just wish them the very best."

      "utterance": "That is a great sentiment. Mark, at a time where the FBI has been under such scrutiny after Parkland and Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Mueller, there are 500 federal agents from ATF, FBI, local police, state police, working together. I think Terry makes a really great point. This is where we really see experience kick in, cooperation, and transparency with each other. So people aren't getting turf conscious, that is really important here."

      "speaker": "MARK FUHRMAN, FORMER LAPD DETECTIVE",
      "utterance": "It is. And time is not their friend in this incident. Ted Kaczynski who takes 17 years to complete all of his bombings, this guy is very accelerated and he's very active. So Terry makes some great points about the interaction of these law enforcement agencies. But let's remember, these are federal detectives assisting police detectives and police officers in uniform. These are not people that are involved with politics, bureaucrats, Washington, D.C. These are cops. They are dealing with cop issues. And I think one thing that they are very guarded about here is I think that just like a serial killer, a bomber has a signature, and his signature is how he makes his bombs and what he uses, and maybe the pride he takes and how he initiates certain trigger devices or delivery systems for packages, or however they are constructed. So they are working on every little piece of these bombs, every wire, every connection, every nut, bolt, anything that is in that device they are trying to track down to who bought it, where was it bought, where was it made? That is what they're doing right now at the same time people are knocking on doors."

Phenomenal analysis from both of you. We can't thank you enough. And we're going to keep everyone up to date with any new developments out of Austin, so keep it right here. But up next, we are going to show you how easy it is for President Trump to make Democrats lose their minds. Yes, next."

All he did was mentioned in passing that he congratulated Russian President Putin on his reelection, and they all went thermonuclear. Never mind that his main point was President Putin on Supreme Court, North Korea, Ukraine, and the nuclear arms race. The mainstream media and their allies went into a full-fledged tizzy."

      "speaker": "SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN, R-STATE",
      "utterance": "He is talking as though he is a leader of a democracy somewhere else, not giving the context of Russia. This is like congratulating Saddam Hussein when he got 98 percent of the vote in the Iraqi elections."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Topping them all, though, is Senator McCain, who admonished Trump that, quote, \"An American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.\" Wait a second, Senator McCain, you mean like when President Obama congratulated the Islamic Brotherhood's candidate on winning Egypt's presidential election in 2012? Or in 2013 when Obama broke three decades of precedent to congratulate the winner of the Iranian presidential election? Or in 2014 when Obama congratulated Turkey's President Ergodan, the same guy who said there is no such thing as moderate Islam? Or someone else Obama congratulated on winning the presidency -- Vladimir Putin in 2012? Yes, the same Putin. I don't recall so many of these voices of concern, or any of the swamp dwellers fulminating about those congratulatory wishes. The double standard is so obvious it's pathetic. The president so far has gotten North Korea to the negotiating table, squeezed trade concessions from the Chinese, and all of this has happened, tax reform, and the media and all of his enemies condemned his every move, his every utterance. It's not really surprising. He is never going to please them. But my message to the peanut gallery -- let the president deal with Putin. He just might surprise you. Not that you are going to give him any credit when he does. We'll be right back with 'The Last Bite.'"
