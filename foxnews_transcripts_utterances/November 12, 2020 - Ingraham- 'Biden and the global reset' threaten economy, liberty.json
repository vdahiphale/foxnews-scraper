This is the \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight, a victory for the Trump campaign in Pennsylvania today, an applet court tossing mail-in ballots from people who had failed to provide required ID. Newt Gingrich gets into all the details. Also, lest there be any doubt that President Trump has completely reshaped the GOP, look at this stat. Of the ten Republicans who have flipped Dem House seats, all have been women and/or minorities, two are here tonight. Has the squad hijacked the Georgia Senate race? I love the story. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is going to tell us what he sees. But first, Biden and the global reset; that is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When news broke of Pfizer's promising vaccine trials, you might've thought normal was right around the corner. After all, the vaccine will be ready for distribution by the spring, and when HHS Secretary Alex Azar, he says there'll be enough doses for every American, wow. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But your idea of normal isn't what the global elites have in mind on the other side of this pandemic. Come on, you know, they hated that old normal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They like a new normal, and they don't like that old normal where Americans enjoyed their freedoms, the freedoms we often take for granted, like the right to work, to run a business, to attend school, the right to travel, and so on. For the globalists, the impressive economic gains that we saw in Trump's first three years were something to fear; not to learn from. Because let's face it, if The America First agenda actually took root in France, so we had a France First agenda, then a Spain First agenda, and an Australian First agenda, the national sovereignty movement would expose these global elites for who they are; anti-democratic control freaks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Because for them, individual liberty must always be sacrificed for the greater global good. Thus, COVID, as horrible as it is, as tragic as it is, presents a challenge, yes, but also for them, an opportunity, for what they call the great reset. You know the line \"Never let a cris go to waste,\" that was Rahm Emanuel?

In other words, Americans under this new world will - they have to sacrifice liberty and prosperity, so that things are more fair and equitable in the rest of the world. The concept of the great reset was discussed at the World Economic Forum back in June, where they discussed how to save the global economy from crisis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But for the millions of others, businesses will close, jobs will be lost, schools remain closed, depression and suicide numbers will go up, plus other illnesses will be left untreated and undetected. But all for the greater good. The Founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, makes this great reset sound completely non-threatening though. He says the pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect and reimagine and reset our world. To accomplish this, Schwab laid out a couple of big goals. Fairer outcomes by coordination in tax regulatory trades and fiscal policy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It all may include changes to wealth taxes, the withdrawal of fossil fuel subsidies, and new rules governing intellectual property, trade and competition, transitioning of course from fossil fuels to green energy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, using policies to achieve fairer outcomes. OK. Well, all of this, this includes the wealth taxes, banning drilling, ming, new trade rules, OK, so outsourcing to China, all of this, transitioning from fossil fuels, all the jobs in our country, to green energy. Does that sound familiar? It is basically Biden's agenda. When Biden said we are going to work with our allies, what he really means is he's going to let them have veto power over our trade initiatives, our patent and trademark laws, and our energy industry. That's just a start. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what better time to do this than with the fear of COVID hanging over our heads? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Bill Gates, the WHO, World Economic Forum, Prince Charles, the IMF, big business, and big tech; they are all in big for the great reset.

Well, Ticketmaster has been working on a framework for post-pandemic fan safety that uses smartphones to verify fans' vaccination status or whether they have been tested negative for the coronavirus within 24- to 72-hour window.

      "utterance": "Alright, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight, a victory for the Trump campaign in Pennsylvania today, an applet court tossing mail-in ballots from people who had failed to provide required ID. Newt Gingrich gets into all the details. Also, lest there be any doubt that President Trump has completely reshaped the GOP, look at this stat. Of the ten Republicans who have flipped Dem House seats, all have been women and/or minorities, two are here tonight. Has the squad hijacked the Georgia Senate race? I love the story. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is going to tell us what he sees. But first, Biden and the global reset; that is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" When news broke of Pfizer's promising vaccine trials, you might've thought normal was right around the corner. After all, the vaccine will be ready for distribution by the spring, and when HHS Secretary Alex Azar, he says there'll be enough doses for every American, wow. But your idea of normal isn't what the global elites have in mind on the other side of this pandemic. Come on, you know, they hated that old normal. They like a new normal, and they don't like that old normal where Americans enjoyed their freedoms, the freedoms we often take for granted, like the right to work, to run a business, to attend school, the right to travel, and so on. For the globalists, the impressive economic gains that we saw in Trump's first three years were something to fear; not to learn from. Because let's face it, if The America First agenda actually took root in France, so we had a France First agenda, then a Spain First agenda, and an Australian First agenda, the national sovereignty movement would expose these global elites for who they are; anti-democratic control freaks. Because for them, individual liberty must always be sacrificed for the greater global good. Thus, COVID, as horrible as it is, as tragic as it is, presents a challenge, yes, but also for them, an opportunity, for what they call the great reset. You know the line \"Never let a cris go to waste,\" that was Rahm Emanuel? Well, with the coronavirus, that idea went global. And since last spring, powerful people began to use the pandemic as a way to force radical, social and economic change across the continents. In other words, Americans under this new world will - they have to sacrifice liberty and prosperity, so that things are more fair and equitable in the rest of the world. The concept of the great reset was discussed at the World Economic Forum back in June, where they discussed how to save the global economy from crisis."

The fact is, all the signs point to Joe Biden's team being fully onboard with this cynical and sick subversion of American independence and sovereignty. Strategies for fighting COVID, just like strategies for fighting poverty or climate change, should all follow the same path. No deviation among nations. So, of course, Zeke Emanuel and Michael Osterholm, Biden's coronavirus task force members, they love lockdowns. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, MEMBER OF JOE BIDEN'S COVID-19 ADVISORY BOARD: We could lock down for four to six weeks, and if we did that, we could drive the numbers down, like they've done in Asia, like they did in New Zealand and Australia. And then, we could really watch ourselves cruising into the vaccine availability in the first and second quarter of next year, bringing back the economy long before that."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Oh, OK. I love that. \"Cruising into the spring;\" these people think we are complete idiots. Lockdowns failed terribly, miserably in Europe. Huge economic calamities followed. But no big deal to the people like Osterholm and the elites in charge, because they are always going to have jobs. But for the millions of others, businesses will close, jobs will be lost, schools remain closed, depression and suicide numbers will go up, plus other illnesses will be left untreated and undetected. But all for the greater good. The Founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, makes this great reset sound completely non-threatening though. He says the pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect and reimagine and reset our world. To accomplish this, Schwab laid out a couple of big goals. Fairer outcomes by coordination in tax regulatory trades and fiscal policy. It all may include changes to wealth taxes, the withdrawal of fossil fuel subsidies, and new rules governing intellectual property, trade and competition, transitioning of course from fossil fuels to green energy. Now, using policies to achieve fairer outcomes. OK. Well, all of this, this includes the wealth taxes, banning drilling, ming, new trade rules, OK, so outsourcing to China, all of this, transitioning from fossil fuels, all the jobs in our country, to green energy. Does that sound familiar? It is basically Biden's agenda. When Biden said we are going to work with our allies, what he really means is he's going to let them have veto power over our trade initiatives, our patent and trademark laws, and our energy industry. That's just a start. And what better time to do this than with the fear of COVID hanging over our heads? Bill Gates, the WHO, World Economic Forum, Prince Charles, the IMF, big business, and big tech; they are all in big for the great reset. If it means you have to give up your individual rights for global health security, so be it. Remember, surveillance, tracking, it's all good for you."

      "utterance": "They don't want people moving around the world. But he says this is not about tracking. Again, this is just for health security. It is all for your own good. Calling them certificates or immunity passports, it kind of makes them all sound reassuring, like a security blanket. But they may be a lot closer to becoming reality than you think. In early October, the Daily Mail reported that London Heathrow Airport is testing \"digital health passports - passes\" which can hold a certified COVID-19 test status or show that someone has been vaccinated in the future. In this brave new world, you may not be able to, let's say, do much of anything without proof of vaccination. Think about it. You love, let's for instance, I don't know, watching live music. I do. Well, Ticketmaster has been working on a framework for post-pandemic fan safety that uses smartphones to verify fans' vaccination status or whether they have been tested negative for the coronavirus within 24- to 72-hour window. Now, again, just like Gates, all the reassurance from Ticketmaster says they are not going to make vaccines mandatory. But then, why do it at all? The New York State Bar Association is also considering a campaign to lobby to make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory. They will decide on Saturday if they really want to push for this. It's obvious, though, isn't it? There is going to be growing pressure across all of corporate America to force proof of vaccination status for movement, for everything. Just like no mask, no entry. No vaccination, no entry. No job, no school, no travel, no nothing. Democrat leaders across America are doing their part, too, in the great reset. Another day and another COVID-19 restriction from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. No more than ten people in your home at a time during the Thanksgiving lead up, starting this Friday. Who is going to tell Grandma Mary that she can't come to Thanksgiving dinner because you've already hit your limit? You can tell her. New York City is a shadow of its former self. Businesses closing, \"For Lease\" signs everywhere, I say it is resetting to a state of ruin. And all over the country, we are seeing a tightening of mandates, mask mandates, even as 95 percent of the country, a couple months ago, we saw in that survey say they already wear them. Plus, there are more limits on businesses and worse. Tonight, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that she was once again issuing a shutdown advisory for her city."

I'm working on a new booklet about masks, but I actually try to focus on narrower issues than what the World Economic Forum is trying to use this to do. I mean, I can't believe that people would fall for the idea that we need to remake society for an epidemic that right now, if you believe the high-end numbers that are being pushed out, has killed about 2 percent of the people who will die in the world this year. OK? It's - 1.2-1.3 million people have died from the coronavirus, which sounds like a lot of people and is a lot of people. But, you have to understand there's 8 billion people in the world and 60 million of them will die this year. So, I don't understand - and by the way, most of those people were very old and very sick. In places like Africa, this has barely touched an entire continent because those people are young - most of Africa is a relatively young continent, and they are not getting sick and dying - for the most part, in a lot of the world. This is a problem of advanced societies and advanced age, and very sick people. And the idea that we need to remake society for it, to me, it's just insane."

This isn't just the slow death rattle of the Democrat Party, but the rise of the new brand of populist that Trump built and inspired. Nowhere is that more clear than in the crop of newly elected GOP members who flipped Democrat seats this year. It's great. So far, all of the 10 GOP House candidates unseated Dems have been women and/or minorities, and in 2018, that could only be said for about 7 percent of the GOP freshman class. Joining me now is Burgess Owens, former NFL player and Utah GOP Congressional candidate, currently holds a narrow lead in that House race. Also with me is Congresswoman-elect Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, who unseated incumbent Democrat as well this election.

It is such a great time. I'll say this, I'm proud of Americans, because no matter how much propaganda, how much hate gets pushed out, we drift toward the light, and what we are seeing now - and again, 18 percent of black men are saying enough of this, we are going to vote for our future, our values and our families (inaudible)."

That is what we want to live, the American Dream, and that's why I was able win and flip a very difficult seat from somebody that thought that she was going to be there forever, but why, because I knew my community and my community wants to be part of the American family.

Well, keep in mind that these guys are clueless, they've always have been, I'm so excited by those who came later, those who had to break down the walls of segregation and all those issues we had in the past, we are now the ones because our values and our principles to pull America back to the America our founders saw us in the very beginning.

There are 7.7 million people who have lived here that do not have papers, that have been here for more than 15 years, that have American children, that have paid taxes and do not have a criminal record. Those people we need to give them some type of legality. Why? Because I know that they broke the law, but the system allowed them to be here for a long time. So now we should give them some type of legality, and that needs to be discussed in Congress.

A Pennsylvania appellate court has barred the counting votes from people who failed to provide photo I.D. before the deadline on Monday. This strikes down a decision made two days before the election by Governor Tom Wolf's administration. So what they did is give people who voted by mail more time to submit their I.D.s for verification. The court now says the Wolf administration has no authority to do this. Unfortunately for Trump, none of those ballots would have been added to the state's official tally, so he's still trailing Joe Biden by about 54,000 votes. Joining me now is Newt Gingrich, former House speaker, FOX News contributor, author of \"Trump and the American Future.\" Newt, is this a sign that Trump's legal fight might start bearing some fruit on other fronts, even if this doesn't affect the count as it stands now?"

Second, I think in Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, there are going to be a significant number of suits, many of them based on various and sundry witnesses who are now showing up, who are swearing out affidavits. And also on just pure research. The number of dead people who have been found to have voted is pretty remarkable, some of whom were like a 120 years old. And so I think you see a significant tearing back of the masks that had allowed the election to be a runaway. Now, my position is whether you are for Trump or you're for Biden, it's important for America that we get a hand recount in every single state that's contested so we actually know whether or not these were honest votes."

The fact is, under our Constitution there is a process. And that process is designed to create a sense of fairness and certainty. We are only part of the way into that process. The news media is desperate to close it down because they know that in cities as corrupt as Philadelphia and Detroit, that there are substantial problems, and there may be problems that reverse the election. But whether in the end it reverses it or not, you are not going to begin to understand what happened if you cut off the ability to explore and to count actual votes. Secretary of state of Georgia did the right thing. They are now going to do a canvas by hand, which is very important, before you get to a recount, because the real changes come when you look at, where did the votes come from? Where were they kept? How do we prove they're real? That's all before a recount. Recounts are just mechanical. Canvases give you the real chance to investigate what's been going on."

Every Democrat lost, lost to either a Republican woman, a Republican minority, a Republican veteran. And the unique thing is they didn't defeat any incumbents. This is what their problem is. AOC has taken over. Omar, Tlaib, all of them have taken over the party. And they are primarying these Democrats if they will not go along with the socialist agenda. Nancy Pelosi is very weak. Last time she ran for speaker, 15 Democrats voted against her. But the rules mean you have to have 218 votes on the floor, or you can't become speaker. Ten of those 15 are coming back, and they are not going to have a 10-seat margin. We are going to end up in a much closer margin than that, so she's going to have a hard time being speaker.
