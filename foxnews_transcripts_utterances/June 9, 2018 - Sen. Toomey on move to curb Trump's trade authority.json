A highly-anticipated report from the Justice Department's internal watchdog is reportedly expected to fault former FBI director, James Comey, for his role in the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe, citing multiple missteps by Comey and other officials at the Justice Department, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. That report, by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, was delayed again this week and is now set to be released next Thursday with Horowitz to testify Congress on June 18th.

      "utterance": "Welcome to the \"Journal: Editorial Report.\" I'm Paul Gigot. A highly-anticipated report from the Justice Department's internal watchdog is reportedly expected to fault former FBI director, James Comey, for his role in the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe, citing multiple missteps by Comey and other officials at the Justice Department, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. That report, by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, was delayed again this week and is now set to be released next Thursday with Horowitz to testify Congress on June 18th. So what's behind the delay and what should we be looking for in the final report next week? Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and columnists, Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn. So, Kim, what do you expect? What are you looking for from the I.G. report next week?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Well, from some of the reporting that's been out already, it would appear that the report is going to go very directly at Comey and other senior leadership for violating protocol, meaning their handling of some things and defying authority, and with relations, for instance, to Comey's press conference that he held clearing Hillary Clinton, which he didn't run past other senior Department of Justice attorneys, their handling of this late find of Anthony Weiner laptop, and the decision to notify publicly that they were reopening the Hillary Clinton probe. But I think these are important because they will get to the question of whether or not -- the basis of this entire FBI investigation, whether it was handled properly, is now what the special counsel is using to base his on and whether or not there are fundamental flaws from the start."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Bill, this is not -- this probe is not looking into the whole Trump campaign/Russia question. That's a separate issue. What about -- Kim focused on the parts close to the election, but really this is going to go back, we hope, to before the exoneration, that public exoneration that Comey offered, to get to some of the inconsistencies we already know about because, for example, the Peter Strzok e-mail."

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Right. Part of it was the actions that Rod Rosenstein laid out in the memo for President Trump, too, about the interventions, not just at the end of the campaign but at the beginning. Look, it seems at every level of the investigation -- let's remember, this is an investigation that the Democrats demanded --"

      "speaker": "MCGURN",

But that was because of his original sin, which was the July press conference, usurping power. So you say it doesn't have anything to do with Russian investigation. That's true. But it's the same characters, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Mr. McCabe, whose wife accepted money for her campaign in Virginia from Hillary-related people. It's going to give us a lot more detail. Let's remember, when it comes out, it's just the first step. Then Congress is going to want interview some of these FBI officials and we are told some other agents that have their own tale to tell."
    },

They provide a timeline because, anything they knew about, they blabbed to each other. It's a good timeline alongside the other developments."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Dan, what about the report this week that Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, who has been telling different sides of the story than James Comey, that he has asked for immunity in order to testify? What do you make of that? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: I make of that that Andrew McCabe feels he has significant legal liability related to the inspector general's report, and we are talking about criminal liability as well. And, you know, the thing that I am trying to focus on with this report is that Mr. Horowitz, the inspector general, said that he would try to look at whether any of these decisions were made for what he calls improper considerations, improper considerations, in other words, politics. Bill was mentioning Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who, among emails, clearly suggested that they were in a panic over the possibility of Donald Trump becoming president. So the question is, did the FBI handling the Hillary e-mail servers and going forward at the highest level go off the rails and become politicized. And that is what I'm really going to be looking for in the inspector general's report."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Kim, let's turn the subject to the Russia side of this. What do you make of House Speaker Paul Ryan joining Trey Gowdy in saying that what he seems to suggest that the FBI was not out of line in asking an informant to -- to insinuate himself with the Trump -- some Trump campaign officials. What's going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what was important about that Paul Ryan statement was the fact that he added that they still needed to see the documents, that they still had a lot of digging to do. I think what we take from that is that Paul Ryan was essentially saying that Trey Gowdy has taken Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray at their word when they say that they didn't do anything improper. And the argument being they're Trump appointees and so they should have the benefit of the doubt. But the fact that even Paul Ryan said we need to continue looking into this means that they know that they still haven't seen what they were asking for and that that might tell a different story."

And that he could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired.\" David Rivkin is a constitutional attorney who served in White House counsel's office and Justice Department in the Reagan and George H.W.

      "utterance": "Does the president have the power to pardon himself, just as a constitutional matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVKIN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Leaving aside the political wisdom of this. This is actually an easy question. The text of the constitution puts only two limitations. It has to be an offense against the United States and it cannot be used in cases of impeachment. Then Charles Pinckney introduced the proposal of the language involved, he indicates at the time it was analogous to a royal prerogative, which included at that time power to pardon any offenses against, except for impeachment. And there was a debate at the time which involved whether or not treason should be removed from the list of offenses and its most serious offense for which he can be pardoned. That debate was resolved in favor of the original text. This is one of the few constitutional issues that there's no serious doubt. The president can pardon absolutely anybody, including himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "So what about the response, then, that this means, in essence, the president is above the law because he could presumably pardon himself even if he were accused of corruption?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVKIN",
      "utterance": "I understand. But this is a classical rhetorical argument. To say the president is above the law begs the question of what the law is. The pardon power is plenary, which is to say absolute. And the check on the exercise of his power, as many other instances in the constitutional architecture, is another political response and abusive power, and that power is impeachment. But to be honest, I sort of chuckle when I hear analogies to the king, which, by the way, in this case, is appropriate. The pardon power is analogous to the royal prerogative. And by the way, the notion that nobody can be judging his own case ignores the proposition that the Supreme Court has articulated in several cases dealing with pardon. It's not a judicial power, OK?"
    },

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Well, that the -- so what you're saying is, under the Constitution, the check on his authority is political. It is that the Congress of the United States -- well, the public can obviously vote him out after one term. But also the Congress of the United States has the power to impeach him. And, of course, they define, Congress define what is are high crimes and misdemeanors."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVKIN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Again, let me emphasize, this very issue was debated in the context of excluding treason involving a number of framers and the answer was put forward by Pinckney, is that if a president -- the scenario was, if a president engages in treasonous acts, pardons his associates --"
    },

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Right."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVKIN",
      "utterance": "At this point in time, it would be a bad idea. There was an argument to be made, which actually made, as you know, Paul, a number of months ago, when the investigation was still going, I suggested that in lieu of firing Mueller, which I thought was a bad idea and still is, you can deprive him of his jurisdiction by pardoning everybody. But that was before all of the indictments that came out. At this point in time, it just would not be judicious."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

      "utterance": "-- then put it all behind us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVKIN",
      "utterance": "No, no, not entirely behind. But one caveat. We were suggesting at the time letting Congress, a forlorn hope, have Congress seriously investigate with nobody being able to take the Fifth. The whole idea was to treat it as a public policy political exercise and not an investigatory judicial exercise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Right, get to the bottom of it for the American people and tell us what happened. What about the claims in the president's lawyer's memos that came out last week about the obstruction issue and whether or not, in firing James Comey as FBI director, that could be determined to be an act of obstruction of justice. I gather you agree with the president's lawyers. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVKIN",
      "utterance": "I agree with the president's lawyers. Made the same case to you back last December. It's simple. It's not that the president can never obstruct justice. There are circumstances in which he can, like bribing a witness. But while the president is exercising core constitutional powers of his office, like firing people, hiring people, pardoning people, telling people what to do, he cannot possibly be engaged in obstruction because, to allow Congress to pass statutes that hold him accountable criminally here, in fact, would impede ability to function as a robust chief executive. It's a very simple argument."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "What if, for example, the president would fire an assistant U.S. attorney or an FBI director because he knows that those people are investigating friends of his who are corrupt and might testify against him. In that case, can he still have the right to fire them and not be obstructing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVKIN",
      "utterance": "He's right. Again, the important thing, just like with pardons, if he's doing things in a way that amounts, in fact, politically serious and damaging exercise, he can be -- he can be impeached. But let me tell you, the problem with holding the opposite argument is, you can literally hobble the president and his exercise of his core functions. And remember this, the president is in a unique position. The president's personal interest, the president's interest as the chief. How is Article III courts supposed to discern whether or not he pardons Sheriff Arpaio for a good reason or a bad reason, or he fired Comey for a good reason or bad reason."

Obviously, drivers in that state don't like it. Could this be an argument that John Cox, the Republican, could use to maybe do better than people think out there in the governor's race?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes, absolutely. At the margins out there in California people are upset about the cost of living. And, you know, I think House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, was correct that it was important to get John Cox on the ticket, may not win, probably won't win, but you're going need Republican turnout in California. And in six of those seven districts that we were just talking about, the voters, although they went for Hillary the last time, they're predominantly Republican. And they -- Democrats have nominated progressives in the districts, and it's not clear at all that voters in those six-swing districts are progressive. And so if you can drive Republican turnout, it's possible the Republicans are going to hold on to a majority of those seats."

Robert Menendez, the two-term Senator from New Jersey, only got 62 percent of the vote against a Democratic challenger, who basically had no campaign, reported spending essentially no money.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Democrats should be worried about that. It was one of the surprises of Tuesday night. This Democratic competitor to Menendez spent almost nothing. Hugin, however, running in the Republican primary spent a lot of time, or at least some, publicizing the fact that Senator Menendez had been admonished by the Senate for essentially doing the work of donors. He lobbied the Health and Human Services Department on behalf of a donor, helped get that donor's girlfriend's visa to come into the country. That does not result in a conviction. Even though he was charged, the charges were dropped, but the Senate did admonish him. And it shows that New Jersey voters are concerned about corruption.

Final preparations are being made for the historic summit as President Trump arrives in Singapore this weekend following a contentious G-7 summit in Quebec. So what does Trump want? And what should we expect from the meeting? We are back with Dan Henninger and Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board member, Mary Kissel. Mary, president says maybe a great success, maybe a moderate success. How would you define success?"

      "utterance": "One thing that we don't want, Paul, the opposite of success would be for President Trump to get sucked into talks that last for months if not years, which is what George W. Bush did. Of course, that gives Kim and the Kim regime more time to develop weapons of mass destruction. So a success in Singapore would be to get the regime to commit to complete irreversible and verifiable denuclearization. That's what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that he wanted. I think that's a long shot, and especially so since you hear President Trump starting to walk back and say, well, we might not get it now, it might take a couple of meetings --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KISSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think he does. I think it would be a real setback for the American president to leave without getting anything, although he says that he will walk away from a bad deal. He has at least made that statement. Pompeo was also very careful, too, to say that if there was no deal done or no good deal on the table, the U.S. pressure in terms of sanctions would increase. I do hope that's the case. My worry here, Paul, is that Kim will say, come on, Mr. President, let's have peace in our time, and we can have China come in to oversee denuclearization, we can do it in stages, and, hey, you can have a whole new market of exports, we can do deals here. I think there's a real risk that Trump backs away from the red lines the administration has set. Let's hope he doesn't do that."

DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, but I think the difference here, Paul, is those presidents thought there was time to negotiate. The difference with Kim Jong-Un now is that we believe, most specialists believe that they are within perhaps 24 months of being able to produce a deliverable nuclear weapon, a missile. And that is something that's time frame that Kim can use to benefit by stretching out negotiations. And I really, Paul, I would try to lower expectations for the meeting in Singapore. This is not like negotiating with the old Soviet Union, where you had a foreign policy structure. This is one individual, Kim Jong-Un, who is virtually like a character out of James Bond movie. But he is running a huge armed camp. And I think the president, our president, Trump, has to sit down and take the measure of whether this is someone that we think we can do business with."

But my test is whether he achieves his goal, actually, denukes the peninsula. And if doesn't, he might get some fanfare now but we're going to know, probably before he's re-elected, that is was a failure."

      "utterance": "Well, he wants U.S. troops off the peninsula. He wants a peace treaty. And he wants to cooperate with China so that they can achieve joint goal of pushing the United States not just out of peninsula but out of north Asia. Ultimately, the stated North Korean goal is to conquer the south under a North Korean regime. That's the whole point of the regime itself. So that's what makes me skeptical that he's going to give up nuclear weapons, which helps him achieve that goal. You basically have to undermine the whole existence of the regime. By the way, too, Paul, we have to mention, there have been a lot of concessions on the U.S. side. North Korea didn't want John Bolton involved. They're criticizing him. He's taking a backseat. Trump pulls away from the table and they send nice, big letter, and Trump says, OK, we will go back. The president will sit at a table legitimizing the regime. You know, that's a lot of good will given here on the U.S. side. Let's see what's really reciprocated here."

Tennessee Senator Bob Corker unveiled a proposal Wednesday that would require Congress to sign off on any plans to impose tariffs and other trade restrictions based on national security concerns. The measure would curtail the president's authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, a provision most recently used to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey is a cosponsor of the measure. I spoke with him earlier."

And importing the balance is not a threat to national security. By the way, our defensive needs are about 3 percent of our total consumption. So to suggest -- and furthermore, our number-one and number-two sources are Canada and Mexico. And with Canada, we have a trade surplus, even in steel, so there's just no way that I can grasp how this is a national security threat."

      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "What Congress needs to do is take this authority back. I don't think it was ever a good idea to hand it over to the administration. Of course, we have been doing that are for decades with all kinds of authorities in and out of trade space. But the fact is the president is, in my view, misusing the national security provisions as a way to promote a protectionist trade policy. I think virtually every Republican Senator disagrees with this approach. It's time that we took this authority back. And so there's an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Bill that Senator Corker and I are pursuing that would do exactly that. It would make a presidential decision to impose tariffs and use the 232 provision as the justification, such a decision would require the consent of Congress if this amendment were to pass. And I think it's a good step."

That is, if the Senate passes it, if you can do that, and then the House passes it, and that's not a guarantee. Then the president can always veto it, and then you have taken a vote and divided Republicans for no purpose. What do you think of that?"

    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",

And for me, it's such a time, and my responsibility to do what I think is right for Pennsylvania. And I think trade barriers and tariffs are a bad idea. So I think we should pursue this. I don't know where it ends. There's bipartisan support for this amendment. I don't know how many votes it gets. Maybe it gets more than two-thirds. We just don't know until we have the vote and let it play out. So that's what I think we should do."

      "speaker": "TOOMEY",

I think it's terrific and prospects are great. But one thing that could be a self-inflicting wound that could really hamper the growth that we would otherwise have would be a trade war. And, you know, up until now, the president has threatened and suggested lots of policies, but only last week, did he actually go ahead and impose these tariffs on Canada and Mexico and the E.U., our allies, our friends. One of the many ironies is we buy almost no steel from China. China is a real problem for a variety of unrelated reasons. That's what we ought to be focusing on in my view. And, yes, I think we, as Republican Senator who support trade, we ought to send the message to the president that we are going to stand up for what we believe in."

The more moderate, centrist, and the rare free-trading Democrats, if you will, might very well support it. So I think they'll be divided. And you know, we will see. Republicans might be divided as well. That's why, you know, you have to have the vote and find out where it lies."

Do you detect some grand strategy here that is going to turn out well in the end?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",

    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. They want to eliminate the investor dispute mechanism, which is really, really important. They've got these countries' specific component requirements, which defeats the purpose of NAFTA. If I thought that there were a really good constructive goal, and this was just kind of an unfortunate tactic to get to that goal, that would be -- you know, that would be a legitimate conversation to have. I don't see that with respect to Canada and Mexico."

These tariffs, they are so many more people that are using steel than there are that produce it. It's definitely having counterproductive effects in Pennsylvania."

But, you know, there's a strong view out there that say, if the commission, which it insulted his beliefs, if they remained neutral, then he may not be able or future people may not be able to defend themselves. Because there's a strong belief among liberal justices that there should be no religious exemptions for antidiscrimination laws. In other words, say the Little Sisters of the Poor and contraception, the Affordable Care Act, that sort of thing. And I think that issue is still very much in play out there among the judiciary.
