Thanks to President Trump's tax cuts, we have got an energized economy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And our businesses have one of the more competitive tax codes in the world. He's right. The president has tried to target unfairly traded steel and aluminum. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But blanket tariffs that sweep in fairly traded products can backfire. They can actually hurt American jobs and workers. That's where I think we're all urging the president, look, continue to narrow this to these unfairly targeted products. Exempt those that are fairly traded. And there are a lot of these, because we have a complicated economy. Not all steel products are interchangeable. And we want to make sure, for example, in Texas, I worry about our pipelines and that steel, fairly traded, but that could harm the very pipelines that are bringing American energy to our refineries around the world. And I worry about our Texas manufacturing plants that again are manufacturing for that same energy industry. I know the president is strongly guarding our American energy workers, wants to do right by them. We got to make sure this is done right and targeted narrowly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",
