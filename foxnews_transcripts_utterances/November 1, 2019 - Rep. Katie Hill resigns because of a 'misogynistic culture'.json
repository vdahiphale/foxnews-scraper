You can probably tell I want to run he told \"Vanity Fair\" at the time. \"I think I'd be good at it,\" he said. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, many of the national media agreed. They thought he'd be good at it, too. It turns out he wasn't. O'Rourke quit with the presidential race today after thoroughly humiliating himself, and the Democratic Party.

And we expect there will be some news made during that event. But no matter what the President says or doesn't say tonight, many in our managerial class will vehemently disapprove. They despise Donald Trump on principle. They loathe everything about him, from his mannerisms, to his NATO policy and everything in between.

Bisexual or gay women can't be controlled. They'll do crazy things, hide the children. You know, this is what we've been fighting.

It's his first public event since the House voted on impeachment. So we're certain he will have something to say about that. Go to Tupelo of course, as soon as that begins. Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It was just this past spring, believe it or not that Beto O'Rourke summed up the 2020 presidential race this way, quote, \"Like this is the fight of our lives as Americans and as humans\" end quote. You can probably tell I want to run he told \"Vanity Fair\" at the time. \"I think I'd be good at it,\" he said. Well, many of the national media agreed. They thought he'd be good at it, too. It turns out he wasn't. O'Rourke quit with the presidential race today after thoroughly humiliating himself, and the Democratic Party. We will bring in his political obituary in just a minute. But first tonight, as we just told you, the President scheduled to start speaking this hour from Mississippi. And we expect there will be some news made during that event. But no matter what the President says or doesn't say tonight, many in our managerial class will vehemently disapprove. They despise Donald Trump on principle. They loathe everything about him, from his mannerisms, to his NATO policy and everything in between. But underneath it all, what they really hate, is the fact that he's a nationalist, and even worse, he admits it."

And why are the people who run our nation so threatened by it? And by the way, if they're not nationalist themselves, what exactly are they? Rich Lowry has thought lot about all of this. He is Editor of \"National Review.\" Of course, he is also author of the new book, \"The Case for Nationalism: How it Made Us Powerful, United and Free,\" Rich Lowry joins us tonight from Washington.

Why is it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Well, because people misunderstand it, and they're very lazy about it. And they think it's tantamount to fascism or militarism, or racism, which is completely false. Nationalism, national loyalty, national feeling, they're very old. They're very natural. They're very powerful and any attempt throughout history to wipe them out by empires or totalitarian ideologies have always failed, and it is part of the mainstream of the American tradition. And this is what makes all those clips that you started with, Tucker so ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "You don't get an American Revolution without nationalism. You don't get a U.S. Constitution without nationalism. You don't get victory in the Civil War without nationalism. Nationalism is a thread that runs through Hamilton. It runs through Lincoln. It runs through TR. In other words, you know, monsters of American history."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "The whole scope of the American project, really, but you're saying that nationalism, its wellspring is deeper. It comes from human nature, from instinct. People want it everywhere -- always."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, people want to belong, and people naturally group together. And what nationalism is, the basic idea or doctrine that a distinct people united by a common culture, a common language, want to govern themselves in a distinct territory. And again, this is a very old idea. You know, read the Bible. It's a story of ancient Israel, which is basically a nation and you know, people in America, they've read the Bible, they understood that story. And Culture is also very important -- a common culture. It's extremely important to nationalism. And you know, I'm dispirited and alarmed by what we're seeing from the socialists on the other side and Elizabeth Warren with their $50 trillion healthcare plan, but more sinister and more threatening is the ongoing campaign to destroy the cultural foundations of this country, its history, its heroes, its common stories and stock of knowledge. And that is what, as conservatives, we have to be focused on like a laser pushing back us. They're coming against Thomas Jefferson. They're coming against Thanksgiving, believe it or not, eventually, as you know, holiday linked with genocide, and they want to make this argument that this nation is rotten to the core and what's most shameful, despicable, they're trying to teach our children that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "And they're succeeding. So what's interesting is that I hear people who call themselves conservatives who I think believe they are conservative argue and I'm almost quoting now that America is not a place. It's not a physical reality. America is an idea."

    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "And you argue contrary to that, and \"The Washington Post\" hated the fact you did this, that America is -- there are ideas that underpin America, but it's a place, it's a physical reality. Explain the difference."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so ideals are important. Obviously, our founding documents are important, but no one lives in an abstraction. Reality is thicker than that. Nations are thicker than that, and if we didn't have a distinct bounded nation that was powerful and united and free, our ideals would mean nothing."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So I want to contrast what you just said with the way you say the people who run our country spend their time. I want to put this on the screen because I think it's really interesting. \"Elites,\" you write, \"spend an inordinate amount of time flying into and out of international airports, attending conferences and business meetings in foreign capitals, often at the same top notch hotels interacting with Western educated elites from other countries who all speak English and the globalized argot of markets and inevitable progress.\" \"They are more truly citizens of the world and anyone who used the phrase in past centuries could have imagined.\" So you're saying that our ruling class has really changed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so the great late social scientist, Samuel Huntington pointed out that the business and technological changes in the 19th Century, they were nationalizing and created a national market over local affiliations and loyalties. What's happened in the 20th and 21st Century is these changes have created kind of a transnational loyalties over national loyalties. And that's a very bad thing, and there's just no such thing as a citizen of the world."

Guns - ban them. Seize them from law- abiding owners. Border security - tear down this wall. Cops - racist. Schools - racist. America - definitely racist. Beto O'Rourke was in effect, the unshackled id of the Democratic Party. He was what Democratic primary voters would choose if nobody else was voting. If they never had to worry ever again about winning an election, and for that reason, even though he never polled well, he always had a group of diehard fans like an indie rock band, that wasn't very good, but was considered cool. Many of those fans were crushed by Beto's failure. According to CBS's Ed O'Keefe, his network was asked not to interview O'Rourke's crestfallen volunteers. They should -- and we're quoting now, \"stop and be respectful\" because the volunteers, again a quote, \"are very vulnerable right now.\" In the end, Beto's campaign was exactly what you expected it to be. It was a constellation of shallow, fragile, dumb people talking to themselves. Howie Carr watched it from the very beginning. He is a radio host and author of \"What Really Happened?\" He joins us tonight. Howie, and I'm sorry for the nasty ad lib at the end of that script. It was hard to contain myself though because there was narcissism at the heart of this campaign like nothing I've ever seen.

So for some perspective, that means her healthcare plan will cost more per year than the entire current Federal budget -- that's just for health care. Warren says though, it won't require a single middle class tax increase and that's a good thing, if true, because the middle class is going to basically be gone if that plan passes.

She is slashing their pay, and then she is saying, oh, but they'll still be there. They'll serve you. They'll provide healthcare. No, they won't.

We saw it because she was having an affair with a 22-year-old campaign staffer. We also learned that she made suspicious payments to that staffer and allegedly had an affair with yet another staffer. Now, none of that is allowed on Capitol Hill. Nobody is judging her personal life, but you're not allowed to sleep with your staffers on Capitol Hill or in almost any workplace in America.

And here's the problem. It is that we've been arguing forever that we should be taken seriously. We want equality. We want to be in the rooms of power, and then the moment something happens, they're victims. It's somebody else's fault. It had nothing to do with what they were doing.

She presented something to her constituents, which was I think, arguably, and she had flipped a Republican seat. That is also surprising her constituents. So what I'm offended by here is this argument by even some Republicans that in fact, this is just what bisexual people do or this is what gay people do, or that this is prudishness. No, it's not. You can be a bisexual woman or a gay woman and actually operate with some level of judgment and have character and have standards. This is -- this is the stereotype. First, it was a gender stereotype of like, elect women, they're going to be so much better and not do anything bad, which of course is a lie. And then there's the sexual stereotype. Bisexual or gay women can't be controlled. They'll do crazy things, hide the children. You know, this is what we've been fighting. So don't stand up there and say that she is in trouble because she's different. She is not different on the Hill. There are judgment problems, and there are character problems, she fits in. The issue is, is that they do have new rules now. And she -- and if we want power, we've got to accept both the good which is being able to make a difference in the world and recognize that our choices matter and that we've got to be held accountable. She is not a victim. She made choices. By the way, if she is such a victim, she shouldn't resign."

And so the Democrats here need to actually articulate that nothing that they have brought forth, and nothing so far in their closed-door hearings, their whistleblowers, their anything has actually alleged any type of impeachable offense that falls within the constitutionally enumerated offenses in Article 2, Section 4 of our U.S. Constitution, they simply don't have anything."

And they're seeing that this is really being tried in the court of public opinion. I believe that the Democrats agenda here is to scare you and me from voting for a President that they have simply tried to lambaste for over the last three years to say that he is an illegitimate President and simply try to win in the court of public opinion rather than at the ballot box because they know they can't do it. I mean, Beto has stepped down on his campaign now and there are so many others that no Democrats that I'm even aware of are really excited about any of the candidates. The Democrats have thrown Biden under the bus with this whole impeachment narrative. And so they are simply trying to say to President Trump, we're going to try to fight you in the court of public opinion, rather than actually trying to challenge you at the ballot box. And that's where an impeachment should actually happen. If the American people aren't satisfied with President Trump, then they can vote against him. But the Democrats have to do that by putting up a really good candidate, not by circumventing the U.S. Constitution, and saying that, you know, we're just going to try to impeach you with a completely sham process."
