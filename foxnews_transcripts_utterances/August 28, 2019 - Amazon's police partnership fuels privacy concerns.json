So, you know, if you think you should be able to walk down the street and then if you're in Boston and suddenly the police or the feds can be able to pull up and say, oh, you were at that Planned Parenthood rally or you were at that conservative rally for Donald Trump, that's what is happening folks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And you got to understand that when you get these pictures, they are building that database, the feds.

The stuff that saved a billion lives in China maybe the things Bernie thinks has harmed our country. The less that those who scream about inequality embrace ideas that create only more inequality by replacing equal opportunity with equal outcome. You end up with two classes, the poor and the powerful, which happened in China, and seems to be happening in San Fran, L.A. and Baltimore too. Of course, China went cold communist resulting in mass murder, religious persecution, forced abortion of female babies and famine. The number of dead in China under Mao has to be counted in the tens of millions. So yes, praise is in order for China finally coming around to abandoning bad ideas. Maybe Bernie should do the same.

So what he is saying is, there should be -- there is an opportunity I think he is saying, for closer ties between the U.S. and China that we don't have to somehow demonize them as all evil and terrible. And if it's not J. Powell at the Federal Reserve, then it's, you know, the Chinese president as our enemy. I think he is trying to get out of that mind set. But I thought you are exactly right when you talked about how China has made progress. I mean, to my mind, maybe you're even giving too much credit to the Chinese government. Because I think it's after Mao, after the revolution, after the re- education camps and the torture and the murder, that then we see the Chinese people start to rise up with the opportunity to employ free market ideas like property, like investments and bringing in American companies. But to me, it's still the case and you can see it from, you know, the news we have today about Hong Kong and about the protests. You can see it in terms of no free press. You can see it and understand it in terms of repression of how they treat the Muslim minority there in China, that the Chinese government is still, to me, heavy handed and authoritarian."

And then of course, though, we've heard nothing about the Uighur concentration camps. I wonder under Bernie's administration, would he recognize Taiwan as a country? Would he -- there is so much that he has failed to address that China represents. He ignored or kind of shot down the existential threat question as well. I mean, why aren't we hearing from him his position on China's stated purpose of nuclear and trade power on their random presence on the Arctic Circle Council? You know, every five years the president of China gives a political report, right. And in 2017, President Jinping did. And 30 times he said China will be a global power. He stressed that he -- they wanted to improve their combat capability or whatever. And he also said we will never swallow the bitter fruit of downgrading our interests for a purpose of someone else's benefit. So for Bernie to go out there publicly and say they are not a threat to us or that they won't put themselves first and ignore all of the other human rights violation is again, it's such a joke to me."

Nothing like that. He just makes the statement. So, he got it wrong. Now, it's interesting, him saying that he made an error in reporting this. He is not saying that the story is wrong. He is saying he was wrong. And I -- so again, to me it comes back to social media where people have what I call confirmation bias. In other words, they take stories that they want to be true and then they say, oh, you know what, I'm going to believe this story and I'm not going to check it out because that might get in the way of my good feelings so I'm just going to report it. And to me, that ends up with egg on your face. It's just bad journalism.

So he basically said, look, because it was so reckless and because you ignored any type of verification that was out there in subsequent sources, and this rises to that level of actual malice. And this has other repercussions too, right. Look, we know the House Service Financial Committee is investigating Trump, is investigating Deutsch Bank. They are laying off 18,000 workers in the next couple of years. They are being federally investigated for other reasons too. So when we start bringing in other entities from these reckless comments and assertions, it's a ripple effect.

And that raises one question, which is well, do we want there to be a warrant because warrants requires specificity obviously of what you are asking for, or what you're seizing. And there is no such thing here, right? So does that matter? I think there is a fine line many feel between private surveillance and government surveillance. And does it matter here that the Ring, the company is the intermediary between the police and the users? Does that change everything? To me, I feel like this is -- an analogy is all of the DNA databases where essentially does someone else's consent apply to you if it's the same data.

The Supreme Court in the Jones case ruled nine to nothing that you cannot go and just place a public surveillance in -- this little thing that you put on the bottom of your car and go on to private property. So, I think it crosses that line. And what we should all be worried about is the FBI has been building a database. More than half of our country is already in it, of facial recognition. So, you know, if you think you should be able to walk down the street and then if you're in Boston and suddenly the police or the feds can be able to pull up and say, oh, you were at that Planned Parenthood rally or you were at that conservative rally for Donald Trump, that's what is happening folks. And you got to understand that when you get these pictures, they are building that database, the feds. And I don't trust the federal government.

We've had neighborhood watch programs in the past. I don't know how effective that is if you don't actually have a camera. The other thing is, compare this to what a company like Apple had done to law enforcement for a long time. Not allowing the government and the FBI to be able to access encrypted technology in order to see what was going on in order to prevent terrorist attacks. That happened after the -- was it Riverside, I think, that shooting out there. And I also like technology for convenience reasons. I do -- I kind of like the idea of being able going to the airport and a facial recognition, walk through, no problem. No taking out the shoes and all that stuff.

Dr. Drew made this amazing point, he said that a million or so illegal immigrants have come to California and they have a place to live. They aren't homeless, but these people haven't. So, what is the difference? It's the fact that they do not want to leave the streets because of the drug abuse and the mental illness because you'd have to have mental illness or a drug problem to be living on the streets. So, we need a system. We need to put a system in place where we can institutionalize people who really need help. It's not a homeless thing."

How about 76 days, five hours, 22 minutes to cross from San Francisco to Honolulu. Look at this guy. That's what he did. Antonio De La Rosa paddled away on a stand up paddle board. His voyage began June 4th. He completed 2900 miles this week, he even celebrated his 50th birthday on the water. De La Rosa said it was quite lonely except for when he saw whales and other sea life. He's the first person to cross the Pacific on a paddle board quite the achievement it could be like Roger Bannister breaking the four minute mile. Lots of people decide, hey, I can do it too, go for it."
