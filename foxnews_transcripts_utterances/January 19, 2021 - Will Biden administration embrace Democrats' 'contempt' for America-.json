But many of the soldiers and National Guard personnel that they've called in to protect them are among the tens of millions of Americans who supported President Trump. So now the Democrats are afraid of the very guards that they need - they think they need to protect them from their own people. The result of this unfounded paranoia has been several days of folly. First, they announced that the FBI would vet for 25,000 National Guard members already serving their country presumably, the left trust the FBI because they think it was part of the effort to hurt President Trump so you got to trust them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But that offended governor Abbott of Texas as indeed it should offend anyone associated with the National Guard but the vetting continues. 12 Army National Guard members were removed from inauguration duty today for extremely vague indications.",

If so it's going to be a disaster for poor old Joe who probably we would like to be popular, a successful president and who ran on a promise to bring Americans together. Good luck with that. A new NBC poll shows that 73 percent of the country, 93 percent of Republicans think the country will remain divided over the next four years. But the left doesn't care about what's good for our country, let alone for Biden.

We're spending a fortune, one that frankly we can't afford anymore, on agencies that are supposed to protect us from external threats like China. We absolutely cannot allow the Democrats to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on what in effect would become a massive domestic spying apparatus turned on the American people. Every Republican senator who attends a confirmation hearing for anyone associated with the national security establishment should demand sworn on the record testimony that our military and our Intel community will be used to fight America's enemies abroad, not Kamala Harris' enemies at home. Again the focus should be on the CCP, not the GOP. If Republican members aren't convinced that the military will be used properly and it would take a lot to convince me, well, they should demand immediate and major cuts to the budgets of the Pentagon and the Intel communities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We can use our tax money in much better ways and that's The Angle.

In fact, there has been stuff said that we have to do all these maneuvers even after everyone is vaccinated. So I'm not optimistic about the course of things. I can't tell why people say that they want to listen to the CDC, and then they don't want to listen to the CDC. I think you should as a leader make the decisions. You don't delegate the decisions to the CDC. So in that sense, that's correct. But there is a rationale for opening travel. The reason you stop travel is not because there's cases. The reason you stop travel is because you are worried about your hospitals being overcrowded. That would be a reason. If you are not worried about that, then you should open travel, because the restriction of travel is extremely harmful economically and is actually killing people because the economic losses that are disastrous and found to be killing people. These things translate into deaths.",

My next guest, Christine Frye, happens to be watching our show that night and suspected that the woman may have been her mom. So she worked with the Freedom Foundation, who sounded the alarm on these shocking examples of overcounting, to compare her mother's death certificate to Washington state's data.

Joe Biden has made clear that he puts the hopes and wishes of illegal immigrants ahead of the safety and prosperity of the American people. Well, tonight we're going to speak to an angel mom who reacts to Biden's immigration wishlist. For something that got no attention today, an American scientist admits that he only pushed back on the Wuhan home lab theory of COVID to protect Chinese scientists. Oh, Dr. Scott Atlas has something to say about that stunning development. But first, team Biden turns against America. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Now there's always been a logical inconsistency at the heart of the Left's attitude toward the United States. Now on the one hand, left wing politicians claim to be interested in helping the average American and make our country better. On the other hand they believe that America is an inherently evil country that is systemically racist and is destroying the planet. Now, it wasn't long ago that Democrats at least tried to hide their utter disdain for the country but starting with Obama, Democrats began questioning America's exceptionalism. And after four years of Trump putting America first well, the Democrats are reverting to the old Obama playbook."

I have never seen anything like it. It's disgraceful. But many of the soldiers and National Guard personnel that they've called in to protect them are among the tens of millions of Americans who supported President Trump. So now the Democrats are afraid of the very guards that they need - they think they need to protect them from their own people. The result of this unfounded paranoia has been several days of folly. First, they announced that the FBI would vet for 25,000 National Guard members already serving their country presumably, the left trust the FBI because they think it was part of the effort to hurt President Trump so you got to trust them. But that offended governor Abbott of Texas as indeed it should offend anyone associated with the National Guard but the vetting continues. 12 Army National Guard members were removed from inauguration duty today for extremely vague indications."

According to The New York Times, the DOD is accelerating efforts to root out \"far-right extremism in the ranks.\" And never mind that during four years of Democrat-led fears of a military coup, there was absolutely no evidence that the military was anything other than loyal to its constitutional duties. The Democrats are in a mood for another witch hunt and the Pentagon is happy to oblige. They'd rather help the left turn the military into a PC patrol to be used against their fellow Americans rather than defend the country from China and other external threats. Of course we know the Democrats aren't interested in standing up to China. They fear the GOP far more than they fear the CCP and so they'll happily destroy the military in hopes of finding anyone who ever sent an email they don't like. All in the name of crushing their domestic enemies and increasing their own grip on centralized power. And Joe Biden's own cabinet picks, well, they're playing right into the hysteria for their own political gain.

They're talking about targeting fellow Americans, not Al Qaeda fighters in the mountains of Afghanistan. Now these are your neighbors. Friends, family, people we grew up with who were supposed to be protected from this type of government surveillance by our constitution. Is this really the kind of administration that Joe Biden wants? If so it's going to be a disaster for poor old Joe who probably we would like to be popular, a successful president and who ran on a promise to bring Americans together. Good luck with that. A new NBC poll shows that 73 percent of the country, 93 percent of Republicans think the country will remain divided over the next four years. But the left doesn't care about what's good for our country, let alone for Biden. They don't have a very high opinion of either I think and so they'll press ahead with their purges, even if it means gutting the military in the process. Biden's plainly too weak to stop them so expect this nonsense to continue. So what should conservatives do under these circumstances? First, no governor and certainly no Republican governor should put their National Guard in a situation where their volunteers are going to be vetted by the same conspiracy-minded loons at the FBI who gave us people like Jim Comey. Second, Republicans on the hill have to look long and hard at the budget for the Pentagon and the Intel community. We're spending a fortune, one that frankly we can't afford anymore, on agencies that are supposed to protect us from external threats like China. We absolutely cannot allow the Democrats to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on what in effect would become a massive domestic spying apparatus turned on the American people. Every Republican senator who attends a confirmation hearing for anyone associated with the national security establishment should demand sworn on the record testimony that our military and our Intel community will be used to fight America's enemies abroad, not Kamala Harris' enemies at home. Again the focus should be on the CCP, not the GOP. If Republican members aren't convinced that the military will be used properly and it would take a lot to convince me, well, they should demand immediate and major cuts to the budgets of the Pentagon and the Intel communities. We can use our tax money in much better ways and that's The Angle. Joining me now is Matt Walsh, Daily Wire columnist and host of the Matt Walsh show and Dave Rubin, host of the Rubin Report, author of 'Don't Burn this Book.' Matt, it's kind of shocking.

It's especially shocking though this dichotomy or talk about how they're using the National Guard, their military occupation of Washington DC at the moment especially jarring when you consider the people that are doing this just a few months ago were insisting that even responding with just regular police officers to rioting was some sort of - some sort of Orwellian sort of dystopian infringement on liberties.

Biden's economic policy team is signaled that it will be the first administration ever to construct economic policy around issues like race, gender equality and climate change relevant around traditional indicators like GDP or deficit ratios. Dave, how much economic success can we expect from a plan that basically doesn't even take into account GDP. DAVE RUBIN, AUTHOR, \"DON'T BURN THIS BOOK\": Yes, well first Laura, with your intro in mind, I just want to go on the record that I am an extremist. I'm a radical freedom extremist that I believe in the constitution and that people should live freely within the laws of the United States. Putting that aside, yes, of course this is absolutely absurd. The people that are in charge of the economy starting tomorrow, they're basically telling us, we don't really care about math, we care about what your gender, that your sexuality and all the other immutable stuff. These policies can't work but you know, I was on your podcast a couple of days ago and we were talking about the silver lining to all of this and what I truly believe is that if you hire people at the governmental level, not based on their skill set or whether they're experts in their field. But if you hire people based on whether they're gay or trans or bi or black or green or whatever it might be, well then you will not hire the best people. Not to say that some of the best people can't be those things but that can't be the primary reason for hiring them. And we're going to see an administration that is going to hire all the wrong people for all the wrong reasons and in many ways it's the reverse. Remember that guys whose birthday we celebrated yesterday that MLK guy who didn't want his kids to be judged on the color of their skin but the content of their character, it's the reverse of what we celebrated yesterday. And it's being imported by the people who are telling us that the rest of us are bigots and racists and homophobes. Irony is clearly dead."

And you get the sense that as Muriel Bowser said, this isn't going away anytime soon. This is going to continue. It and it's even more disgraceful when you consider that the implication, what they're basically implying is that well listen, if there's rioting and they're just and they're burning down where your neighbor works, well, you know that's one thing. We can kind of deal with that. We can live with that especially as lawmakers of DC, we're fine with that but if you start smashing the windows where we work, that's a totally different deal and now we're going to militarize DC and we're going to keep the troops here indefinitely because you know the sacred hallowed grounds of the capital, we can't touch that but go head and burn down a CVS. Go ahead and attack a pawn shop, kill a retired police guy in the process, that they don't have a problem with. Nancy Pelosi was on a podcast with Hillary Clinton who apparently has a podcast now if anyone wants to listen to it and she was talking about the trauma that our lawmakers suffered during the riots.

You know what's interesting Laura no one 's ever used the word murder to describe what happened on January 6, even though that's what it is because the incoming Biden administration, they don't want to use the prosecutorial tools that append to a murder. They want to use terms like national security, insurrection, domestic terrorism because that allows them to access these exquisite authorities to use tools that we envision to go after terrorists in foreign lands than being turned against our own people.

And it all sounds innocuous, a community good, we all wanted harmony, we want to get along and suddenly you lose your right to petition the government, speak, go to church and then you're branded as an enemy of the state. I mean this is again, Congressman, this is why we do need civic education, patriotic education. That our children understand what's in front of them right now. You might not like Donald Trump but you're definitely not going to like a lot less freedom under this new administration if it keeps going this way. Final word."

It's going to be four years of nauseating gauzy coverage like that so instead of being a check on Biden and covering Biden and the Democrats, they're going to cover for Biden and the Democrats. The watch dogs, well they're just lap dogs like CNN reporter Shimon Prokupecz who tweeted this as Joe Biden spoke in DC today. \"Let the healing begin. We have needed this.\" Mmmhm, take me to a vomitorium. Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, Fox news contributor and Sarah Carter, Fox news contributor, host of The Sara Carter Show podcast. Mollie, look, if Joe Biden says it, they report it without question. When Donald Trump came in and he said look, there's a swamp in DC which we all pretty much knew but there's a swamp in DC, I'm going to drain it. It's time to put America's interests first.

What the last four years showed us is that the situation is so much worse than mere bias. It is true corruption and unaccountability for the most politically influential group in America, our corporate media, they are the ones who drive the Democratic Party. They are the ones that issue orders to the Democratic Party. They're the ones who push identity politics, destruction of our constitution, opposition to our founding principles and they've been remarkably successful. The other side of what we experienced in these last four horrific years of media malfeasance is that they cannot even pretend to cover President Biden with any sort of scrutiny at all and it's really you know the sudden shift is really alarming to go from their hysterical hatred for all things conservative to now doing profiles about Kamala Harris' tennis shoes and Joe Biden's love of ice cream.

It's pretty obvious that the media, the mainstream media or the major media outlets are definitely walking side by side with Biden in the inauguration. They feel that they are being inaugurated. It used to be a time when the media would question and be the watchdog over the government, would fight for civil liberties, would defend the voice of those who had no voice, would be their voice. And now what we are seeing is something exactly what Mollie was saying, is an exact reversal of that. But remember, if you go back to 2016, 2017, they were literally, and I'm talking about anchors on CNN, on MSNBC, news reporters I saw with my own eyes in New York City, literally crying, crying in anguish when President Trump took office. And now they're abandoning the 74 plus million people that voted for President Trump. It's like they never learned their lesson, right? They were shocked in 2016 when he won, and they didn't understand why. They live in a bubble in Washington. And now what we're seeing is they are not even doing their job. We have National Guard in Washington, D.C., 25,000, only 1,000 people are going to be attending Joe Biden's inauguration.

They want to censor any disagreement or opposing opinions, and they have a lot of power to do that. They control the media. They control big tech, and those big tech oligarchs are coming for absolute destruction. This causes national security problems. It causes domestic unrest.

According to \"The Daily Caller,\" a renowned U.S. scientist, Dr. Peter Daszak, orchestrated a statement published in the \"Lancet\" medical journal last February condemning conspiracy theories that suggest that virus doesn't have a natural origin. Now, Daszak, who reportedly has direct ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the NIH, now admits he made that statement to protect Chinese scientists from online harassment. Joining me now is Dr. Scott Atlas, former White House COVID advisor, Hoover Institution senior fellow. Dr. Atlas, each step of the way the scientific establishment, at least that based in Washington and many academic circles, have too often failed us."

And for a variety of reasons, whether it was covered up by China or covered up by people here, or simply not aggressively pursued by the press or anyone else who should have known better, we have had incomplete information. The story from the beginning, that this virus was from a market, we don't know, but it seems a little bit unlikely given the high level of coincidence, if nothing else, that the main viral laboratory of China is right there working on these viruses. So we've never had the complete story, and it doesn't surprise me that there were ulterior motives in people saying things that they really, whether the didn't know they were true or they knew they were false, it doesn't matter. They said things as if they were true."

The science says the strict lockdowns did not work. The science says that children do not have significant risk from the disease. And the science says that children are not a big time spreader of the disease to adults. The science says that schools are low risk. The science says that schools should be open. The science says protection is from people who not just have antibodies, but have T cells. These are the facts. The lockdowns are a disaster. They should be opened. The science says that people who are at risk for dying should be the priority for the vaccine, not other people. I'm so tired of that. I think the American people must be tired of this already. This is just ludicrous gibberish with nonsensical content."

Dr. Atlas, the career CDC people recommended ending travel restrictions on Europe, and the president agreed. And now Biden is saying, he will not allow that to happen. I thought Biden said he would essentially listen to whatever the CDC said, be essentially a slave to the CDC. So why would Biden go against them on this travel ban? Is that a precursor to larger lockdowns?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ATLAS",
      "utterance": "Well, I get the feeling from what has been said and by the people who are on this incoming task force, that they have no intent of lifting lockdowns, not that I have seen. In fact, there has been stuff said that we have to do all these maneuvers even after everyone is vaccinated. So I'm not optimistic about the course of things. I can't tell why people say that they want to listen to the CDC, and then they don't want to listen to the CDC. I think you should as a leader make the decisions. You don't delegate the decisions to the CDC. So in that sense, that's correct. But there is a rationale for opening travel. The reason you stop travel is not because there's cases. The reason you stop travel is because you are worried about your hospitals being overcrowded. That would be a reason. If you are not worried about that, then you should open travel, because the restriction of travel is extremely harmful economically and is actually killing people because the economic losses that are disastrous and found to be killing people. These things translate into deaths."

And a few weeks back we brought you a stunning story about states overcounting COVID deaths, now, one of which included a 99-year-old woman in Washington state who died after losing her balance and falling. My next guest, Christine Frye, happens to be watching our show that night and suspected that the woman may have been her mom. So she worked with the Freedom Foundation, who sounded the alarm on these shocking examples of overcounting, to compare her mother's death certificate to Washington state's data. And guess what, they were a perfect match. Christine Frye joins us now. Christine, thank you for joining us tonight. Your mother did have COVID, right, but she did recover.

And what an amazing woman, what an amazing life, 99 years of age, and God bless you for sharing that story.

Joining me now is Maureen Maloney. Her son Matthew was killed by an illegal immigrant 10 years ago. Maureen, incoming President Biden also wants to give amnesty to 11 million illegals, and end deportations, I guess, for everyone for 100 days. Who the heck cares about COVID?

It's probably closer to 20 million of them here in the country, you are rewarding them for breaking our laws.

But it is amazing how word carries pretty fast. So the caravans start, and the police are overwhelmed.
