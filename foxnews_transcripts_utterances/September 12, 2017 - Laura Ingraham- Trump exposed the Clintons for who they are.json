It is full of endless excuses as to why she lost the 2016 election. We will set the record straight, and we will record as Donald Trump calls her crooked Hillary.

I don't know about you watching at home, but I've literally had it up to here and beyond with Mitch McConnell.

And now McConnell is saying tax reform will have to wait until 2018? It is beyond unacceptable, and it really shows you why he has the pathetic 18 percent approval record in his home state of Kentucky.

Get out of the way. Let someone else who actually cares about keeping their promises to the American people -- let them step up. Let them start passing legislation. Now, also tonight, Hillary Clinton released her book. It's called \"What Happened.\" And by the way, it was all smiles earlier today while kicking off the first part of her book tour, signing copies right here in New York City. But tonight, Clinton should be anything but happy because this book -- and the media won't tell you -- is full of nothing but excuses, lies, and to use a phrase, fake news. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, crooked Hillary, as the president calls her, is in complete denial about why she actually lost this election. Now, let's take a list (sic) at the long list of Clinton excuses that our colleague and friend, Gregg Jarrett has put together. Look at this. Clinton has up to now given 32 reasons for why she lost. And the list grows and grows and grows, and no person, no thing is spared! Now, Clinton has blamed everyone and everything but herself and her terrible campaign for this defeat. Now, Gregg Jarrett -- he's going to join us, along with Jay Sekulow with reaction. But instead of writing a tell-all book, Clinton could have saved herself a lot of time and just take a long look in the mirror. But of course, this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about. She'll never pass up an opportunity, A, to make money, and B, cast blame on others. It's exactly what Hillary Clinton did in an interview with CBS this weekend.

The Clinton Foundation took millions and millions of dollars from countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE and others -- you know, countries that treat women, gays, lesbians, Christians and Jews horribly. Saudi Arabia -- remember? Women can't drive. They need permission to work or to travel. Marital rape in these countries in many of them is not recognized. If you're gay or lesbian, many of those countries, the punishment is death. And by the way, you're not allowed to build a church or a temple in Saudi Arabia, for example.

You may remember back in August of last year when the AP published a story with the headline, quote, \"Many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at State.\" And the report details, quote, \"More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money either personally or through companies or groups to the Clinton Foundation.\" Wow, you donate, and you get a meeting! if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, of course, the Uranium One deal. As her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton -- she was one of nine people to approve the transfer of up to 20 percent of America's uranium -- you know, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. To who? Vladimir Putin, the Russians. Wow, there is a real conspiracy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then people involved in that deal ended up kicking back as much as $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Oh, and Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. So sorry, Hillary Clinton. The media, Republicans, they're not to blame for all the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, and by the way, you and your husband are. And next, of course, Hillary's excuse for her email server scandal. In her book, \"What Happened,\" she actually attacks The New York Times -- The New York Times! -- over their coverage, blaming them.

Remember? She had secret, top secret, special access program and classified information on her server, you know, the server stored in the bathroom of a mom and pop shop.

Remember Clinton's team deleted 33,000 emails using BleachBit -- in other words, acid wash -- after being served with a congressional subpoena. Now, an aide also smashed those old mobile devices with a hammer. Can't get the emails from there. And then to top it all off, members of the Clintons' legal team -- remember? They did give the FBI Blackberries, but those Blackberries didn't have SIM cards in them, rendering them meaningless. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, there's also the fact that Clinton changed her story and lied every step of the way when it came to her use of a private email server. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this is all pathetic, and Clinton is delusional. The media won't tell you she can't come to grips with the reality she was a terrible candidate -- no message, no vision for the American people. And by the way, she didn't even bother to campaign in swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. Unbelievable.

The president, first of all, must continue to make the point that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear weapons and ICBMs are an existential threat and a clear and present danger to the American people. He needs to keep saying that. That U.N. resolution, as he said, 16th anniversary of 9/11/01, probably the best we could hope for given the veto threats from Moscow and Beijing. But the asset freezes are wholly inadequate. None of those clowns has a checking account at Wells Fargo or Bank of America. Banning $725 million in North Korean textile sales, do you have North Korean jeans? I don't. It's a drop in this bucket. If the U.N. wants to shut off funding from North Korea and their nukes and their ICBMs, call the supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei in Tehran. That's where the bankroll is coming for this thing. But you also said it correctly. The only way to pressure the chubby dwarf in Pyongyang is to continue to press President Xi in Beijing and his politburo that the U.S. is deadly serious about our last option, and our last option ought to be military action. And that's going to take more than words. It's going to take action. So here's what I suggest that the president -- go ahead.",

Number three, return the tactical nukes to the Republic of Korea that we withdrew in the 1990s. Number four, deploy another carrier strike group to the region, and more long range aircraft and air tankers to Guam and Okinawa, and get this, deploy search and rescue assets and ask to see if we can base some of our assets to China to recover air crews because there are going to be crews shot down.

It's important to understand that we learn a lot about their systems by getting the telemetry that comes back from them. So it's a very important part of the information that we have without using another \"I\" word, the information we have about what goes on. So for example, if we shoot one down coming off the pad, it's in the air, it's not going to hurt anybody on the ground, maybe OK, maybe not. Remember what the Chinese said. What the Chinese have to be convinced, Sean, is that we will take very serious military action if this doesn't stop. It's not just a matter of shooting down one or two, because he's got mobile missiles he can deploy relatively quickly, and if he has got the warheads we think he has he can deliver one on the United States in the space of about 45 minutes. That's all the warning we're going to get. So for example if we deploy the hospital ships to Pusan and to Okinawa, that would be a very clear signal the United States is deadly serious, Mr. Xi. Pay attention, you and your politburo, because you can stop this. And that's what we need to do before we pull the trigger, because I think once you pull the trigger, Sean, you're going to have a war. And it will be a very quick war. It will be unbelievable. But, quite frankly, the politburo and Xi can stop this. If we have to launch a military operation, we're going to have to use surface and undersea, air launch cruise missiles, U.S. Air Force and Navy strike aircraft. We have to decapitate the leadership, take down all their air defenses and their CQ coms, cyber-attacks, special weapons we haven't used elsewhere, and they're going to have to use carrier pigeons to communicate afterwards.",

Now, he has said for over seven years he was going to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and then when he gets the chance, he blows it. And now McConnell is saying tax reform will have to wait until 2018? It is beyond unacceptable, and it really shows you why he has the pathetic 18 percent approval record in his home state of Kentucky. Now McConnell is not leading, he's not getting the job done. So senator, if you don't want to roll up your sleeves, if you don't want to get to work on passing the agenda you promised and the president promised, then maybe it's time to call it a career. Get out of the way. Let someone else who actually cares about keeping their promises to the American people -- let them step up. Let them start passing legislation. Now, also tonight, Hillary Clinton released her book. It's called \"What Happened.\" And by the way, it was all smiles earlier today while kicking off the first part of her book tour, signing copies right here in New York City. But tonight, Clinton should be anything but happy because this book -- and the media won't tell you -- is full of nothing but excuses, lies, and to use a phrase, fake news. Now, crooked Hillary, as the president calls her, is in complete denial about why she actually lost this election. Now, let's take a list (sic) at the long list of Clinton excuses that our colleague and friend, Gregg Jarrett has put together. Look at this. Clinton has up to now given 32 reasons for why she lost. And the list grows and grows and grows, and no person, no thing is spared! Now, Clinton has blamed everyone and everything but herself and her terrible campaign for this defeat. Now, Gregg Jarrett -- he's going to join us, along with Jay Sekulow with reaction. But instead of writing a tell-all book, Clinton could have saved herself a lot of time and just take a long look in the mirror. But of course, this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about.

And that's just the one country of the many that the Clintons have taken money from, not to mention all the allegations of pay-to-play at the Clinton Foundation. You may remember back in August of last year when the AP published a story with the headline, quote, \"Many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at State.\" And the report details, quote, \"More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money either personally or through companies or groups to the Clinton Foundation.\" Wow, you donate, and you get a meeting! And then, of course, the Uranium One deal. As her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton -- she was one of nine people to approve the transfer of up to 20 percent of America's uranium -- you know, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. To who? Vladimir Putin, the Russians. Wow, there is a real conspiracy. And then people involved in that deal ended up kicking back as much as $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Oh, and Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. So sorry, Hillary Clinton. The media, Republicans, they're not to blame for all the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, and by the way, you and your husband are. And next, of course, Hillary's excuse for her email server scandal. In her book, \"What Happened,\" she actually attacks The New York Times -- The New York Times! -- over their coverage, blaming them. Listen to this."

WikiLeaks exposed The New York Times as only one of the many mainstream media outlets -- interestingly enough, except the Fox News Channel -- that was caught red-handed. They were colluding with the Clinton campaign. Now, the reason her emails became such a big story is because Clinton broke several laws. Remember? She had secret, top secret, special access program and classified information on her server, you know, the server stored in the bathroom of a mom and pop shop. The FBI also told us that it's likely that up to five foreign intelligence agencies gained access to every single classified email and every special access program email on that server. And it even gets worse. Remember Clinton's team deleted 33,000 emails using BleachBit -- in other words, acid wash -- after being served with a congressional subpoena. Now, an aide also smashed those old mobile devices with a hammer. Can't get the emails from there. And then to top it all off, members of the Clintons' legal team -- remember? They did give the FBI Blackberries, but those Blackberries didn't have SIM cards in them, rendering them meaningless. Now, there's also the fact that Clinton changed her story and lied every step of the way when it came to her use of a private email server. Now, this is all pathetic, and Clinton is delusional. The media won't tell you she can't come to grips with the reality she was a terrible candidate -- no message, no vision for the American people. And by the way, she didn't even bother to campaign in swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. Unbelievable.

Even Eleanor Roosevelt, her -- her idol, talks about how we shape our own lives. I mean, we make our own decisions. And ultimately, we're responsible until we die for those decisions and our own fate. And yet every turn, whether it's going back to, you know, 1998 and Monica Lewinsky all the way up through the Clinton scandals of the Clinton Foundation, it's never, ever, ever the Clintons' fault.

They're just not all that good, contrary to what we've heard, at politics. So maybe Mitch McConnell either rides off into the sunset, does something in Kentucky, maybe he can run a bourbon company or something down there, and leave politics to people like Donald Trump who can actually cut deals when necessary and get results for the American people because so far, you know, they've -- they've -- they've given us a bunch of goose eggs here. We've gotten -- gotten almost nothing from the Republicans. And Donald Trump's sick of it.

So what happened was there was a report from the Office of Special Counsel -- not to be confused with Robert Mueller, this is the Office of Special Counsel inside the Department of Justice -- that was investigating or is investigating James Comey's activity for exactly what you just said just moments ago, this kind of intervention in the campaign last year. And that could include being barred for up to five years from federal service, including fines and penalties. But it points to something deeper. There's also an inspector general's investigation going on right now as to James Comey, as well. In addition to that, you've got Senator Graham saying last week he smelled a rat in the fact that the declination letter, and that's what it was, regarding the whole Hillary Clinton e-mail situation was written at least two, maybe three months before they interviewed 16 witnesses, including the target. So he had already been transferring (ph) around this declination letter.

He himself took on the role as attorney general. Now, granted, Loretta Lynch was severely compromised in this, without question. But there was still a deputy attorney general and there was a process to go forward with. Here's what you have. James Comey thinks he is above the law. He thinks he's above the rules and regulation.

Bannon was on \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, and I think, yes, I think the biggest key besides incinerating this place, which it could come to, would be for China to step up considering that's their region of the world. Is China capable of finally cutting the cord there? LT. COL. OLIVER NORTH, HOST, \"WAR STORIES\": Great question, Sean, but before I go to that I want to, first of all, go on air and thank you for helping Griff Jenkins and his FOX camera team in Florida last Saturday. You responded like a U.S. marine, quick reaction force, and thank you, my friend."

      "utterance": "Back to the answer of your question. The president, first of all, must continue to make the point that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear weapons and ICBMs are an existential threat and a clear and present danger to the American people. He needs to keep saying that. That U.N. resolution, as he said, 16th anniversary of 9/11/01, probably the best we could hope for given the veto threats from Moscow and Beijing. But the asset freezes are wholly inadequate. None of those clowns has a checking account at Wells Fargo or Bank of America. Banning $725 million in North Korean textile sales, do you have North Korean jeans? I don't. It's a drop in this bucket. If the U.N. wants to shut off funding from North Korea and their nukes and their ICBMs, call the supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei in Tehran. That's where the bankroll is coming for this thing. But you also said it correctly. The only way to pressure the chubby dwarf in Pyongyang is to continue to press President Xi in Beijing and his politburo that the U.S. is deadly serious about our last option, and our last option ought to be military action. And that's going to take more than words. It's going to take action. So here's what I suggest that the president -- go ahead."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NORTH",
      "utterance": "I suggest what President Trump needs to do right now to send a clear signal to Beijing that we really are deadly serious. We keep saying it but we've got to show them. First, deliver biological and chemical protection equipment to the Republic of Korea -- clear signal. Ask Israel publicly to provide iron dome, iron beam, and David Sling systems to the Republican of Korea to deal with the North Korean artillery on the DMZ and protect Seoul. Number three, return the tactical nukes to the Republic of Korea that we withdrew in the 1990s. Number four, deploy another carrier strike group to the region, and more long range aircraft and air tankers to Guam and Okinawa, and get this, deploy search and rescue assets and ask to see if we can base some of our assets to China to recover air crews because there are going to be crews shot down. It's unlikely he'll agree, but it's a very clear signal. It may wake him up and the politburo."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Look, he's had little fear firing over Japan, and he's threatening Guam. I would argue the next time he fires a missile or even puts one on a launch pad we really don't have a choice. Don't we have to take it out to send the loudest message?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NORTH",
      "utterance": "Look, unfortunately I know a little bit too much about this to be able to talk about it on TV. I have to be very careful. It's important to understand that we learn a lot about their systems by getting the telemetry that comes back from them. So it's a very important part of the information that we have without using another \"I\" word, the information we have about what goes on. So for example, if we shoot one down coming off the pad, it's in the air, it's not going to hurt anybody on the ground, maybe OK, maybe not. Remember what the Chinese said. What the Chinese have to be convinced, Sean, is that we will take very serious military action if this doesn't stop. It's not just a matter of shooting down one or two, because he's got mobile missiles he can deploy relatively quickly, and if he has got the warheads we think he has he can deliver one on the United States in the space of about 45 minutes. That's all the warning we're going to get. So for example if we deploy the hospital ships to Pusan and to Okinawa, that would be a very clear signal the United States is deadly serious, Mr. Xi. Pay attention, you and your politburo, because you can stop this. And that's what we need to do before we pull the trigger, because I think once you pull the trigger, Sean, you're going to have a war. And it will be a very quick war. It will be unbelievable. But, quite frankly, the politburo and Xi can stop this. If we have to launch a military operation, we're going to have to use surface and undersea, air launch cruise missiles, U.S. Air Force and Navy strike aircraft. We have to decapitate the leadership, take down all their air defenses and their CQ coms, cyber-attacks, special weapons we haven't used elsewhere, and they're going to have to use carrier pigeons to communicate afterwards."

The mainstream establishment liberal media, they are out to take down President Trump. The study tracked the broadcast evening newscast from this summer, three major networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, and they found a staggering 91 percent of their coverage of the president was negative. Wow. Joining us now with reaction, conservative commentator Monica Crowley is back with us. Ninety- one percent, I don't think it can get worse."

    {
      "speaker": "MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it can, Sean. So don't temp the mainstream media to actually make it worse. If you spend five minutes watching any of the major coverage of President Trump, this study doesn't come as a surprise. And what we do know, Sean, is that over decades the mainstream media has demonstrated a really pronounced leftist bias, but what we're seeing now is so different is the level of intensity and the level of activism. The press hates and fears Donald Trump. They hate him personally. They don't like him personally. But they also hate what he represents, which is the forgotten man, economic nationalism, patriotism, enforcing laws, particularly on immigration, his personal wealth. And when you marry that, Sean, with the idea that they also fear him because they know if he succeeds then their level of influence and power is going to be diluted to a level that they cannot stand. So because they cannot tolerate him or his policies, because they fear him so much, they've got to pull out all of the stops to try to destroy him."

We go over on a regular basis the economic plan to help the people you're talking about, forgotten men and women in poverty, food stamps, out of work, can't but a house. We talk about solutions for the budget, we talk about solutions to grow the economy, create jobs, energy, secure the border, national defense, identifying enemies. When do they ever, because I don't see it, talk about how to help people or offering ideas that help people?"

      "speaker": "CROWLEY",
      "utterance": "They don't because they're not interested in that. They're interested in attacking this president and his agenda, again, Sean, because he represents something totally different. They've never had to deal with a president like this who comes out of the business world and who is, as you say, focused on those agenda items that actually are going to deliver tangible results to the American people, particularly on the economy, also on national security in terms of giving them a better life, increasing their wages, and keeping them and their families safe. That's what the president is focused on, actual, tangible, practical results. And neither party, the establishment on either side, as well as the mainstream media, they're not interested in that at all because if he actually gets this government working and gets the economy humming, then they know that their influence, again, is going to be much reduced. Therefore because he's an existential threat to them, the pile-on continues. And it's going to go through the length of his term, all eight years, Sean."

The funny thing is you had a whole lot of help from, well, Obama, Michelle, Joe Biden, Donna Brazile, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC, the FBI, 90 percent of mainstream media, every late-night TV show and the entire population of Hollywood loudmouths, and you still lost. You lost because you are as relatable as cardboard and allergic to accountability. And no, it's not because the country wasn't ready for a woman. It's because the country isn't ready for a liar or an entitled political princess. And don't start with the sexism charade again. See, she knows this book tour is bad for her own party, but she doesn't care. The most important thing to Hillary is, as always, Hillary. Sean, that's the final word."
