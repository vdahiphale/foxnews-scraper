      "sentences": "And welcome to HANNITY. This Friday night, a lot of breaking news has become on air, 9:00 on the East, 6:00 on the West Coast. We have so much ground to cover. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In just moments, we will bring you the very latest updates on coronavirus, the pandemic, facts without fear, very important. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, first, I have to address something tonight before we really get into the heart of the show. I know a lot of Americans, you are worried. You are fearful. I just went to the store. I talked to many of you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I know everyone is adjusting. Everyone is adapting. The unknown is always scary, uncertainty is scary. Despite the smears from the media mob, this program, my radio program, we've taken this virus seriously from day one. Now, I first interviewed Dr. Fauci right here on this show on January 27th. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Again, early, February 10th. I have a timeline with all of my coverage and accompanying audio and video. Look at it, hannity.com, expressing the seriousness and the concern and also my faith, belief, interest in our medical professionals, irrefutable truth of the seriousness of our reporting. And yes, I rightly will continue to criticize the mob in the media and those Democrats that are weaponizing and politicizing this virus as the next Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, impeach, impeach. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, the first known case in the U.S. was January 21st. I was talking about it with Dr. Fauci on that show January 27th. The travel ban was enacted in record time. Unprecedented. That was January 31st, 10 days after the first case in the U.S. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Democrats, yes, they were in the middle of impeachment. Biden calling the travel ban that day when the president implemented it. Hysterical xenophobia, fearmongering, and he's sticking by it. And as usual, they are hurting the country because of their pathological psychosis and hatred of Donald Trump. Well, we digress. Bigger issues tonight. Our message has never changed. Look, you want to solve any problem in life, the worst thing you can do is get panicked. We all need to stay calm, strategic, smart, act rationally, based our decisions on facts. That's why we had Dr. Anthony Fauci on this program. Let's go back in January. Remember, the first known case in our country is January 21st. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } January 27th, Fauci was on, and we had him again on in early February.

By the way, in spite of a corrupt media that hates him every second, minute, hour of every day, same with the Democratic so-called leaders. Under the president's leadership, now even some Democrats, some Republicans, American business leaders, our hospitals, our pharmaceutical industries, everybody is working together. You see the best in America I moments like this. All hands on deck. This is moving at the speed of light, we've never seen this before, and it is amazing to see the goodness, the greatness of so many American people, so many of our corporations, companies, they show the best of us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The adults in the room are separating facts from partisan politics.

Gavin Newsom and many others have been and are working hand-in-hand with President Trump, praising each other for working together to battle the virus. They all stressed the need for calm, for cooperation. Governor Cuomo, I disagree on politics, taxes, fracking, almost everything. He was on my radio program 40 minutes today praising the president, for example, on the travel ban. Take a listen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

No matter what the word police -- now that is the big thing, the media mob calling COVID-19, the Chinese or the Wuhan coronavirus.

The disease is now a worldwide pandemic because of China. That is a fact. Look at your screen, let me prove my point. The last time I checked, the media mob had no problem calling any of those diseases by their geographical location. What are we going to change the name of the Spanish flu now and German measles now? It's pretty normal to identify disease by geographic location. According to the mob, Democrats, and coincidentally the communist party of China -- that is not racist, out-of-bounds.

Nobody -- Andrew Cuomo today, I can't believe these words are flying out of my mouth -- understood that that travel ban decision, ten days after the first case arrived in the U.S., crucial. You know how -- it would be exponentially worse. Now, we've got new rules, drive up testing. Now, were getting rid of FDA regulations.

He talked about getting out in front of this, quarantining people, restricting other things, making -- putting the FDA in charge, convening the coronavirus task force, putting the vice president in charge. Everyone criticized him at the time, now there is high praise for Mike Pence's leadership on this, following the president's direction, bringing all these people together, cutting through the red tape, getting it done. It's never good enough with this president and that's the problem. The lack of respect that they show him is evident every day in that briefing room. And the questions that they ask in some ways, it's not the tough questions. He can take the tough questions.

This is Monday in New York alone. Cases were at 1,300, the death rate, the number of deaths were ten on Monday of this week to begin the week. Now, the death rate over on the U.S. is about 1.4 percent. We want to keep that down, keep pushing it down. This is what happens. Watch the cases in New York on Tuesday, they jump 1,000. On Wednesday, they jump 1,700, and late last night, we're up over 7,000 cases. That is just New York. Now, I want to move to the third moment in time here, Sean, over on this screen over here. As of 9:13 p.m. East Coast Time, we're at 19,000 cases in the U.S. And again, it's the testing in New York, testing in various places. The more we get that, the more likely we are going to see this number rise. As you go to the weekend, Sean, I want you to think about two things here. This yellow line is the number -- we've been looking at this week now, seven days straight. This yellow line is all the cases outside of China. You see where it's going? It takes a slight jog at the end there. I can't say whether that's going to last, but eventually at some point that is where it's going to go. We need to get that yellow line moving to the right. So keep an eye on that. And also this here -- worldwide cases around the world, 272,000. This is what I think is something to hang your hat on is he going to the weekend. The recovery number is about 88,000. Six hours ago, that number was at 81,000. That means that certain parts of the world are getting further away from those, and that's reflected in this total recovery number. Recovery means two negative tests in a row and that is when you make the green mark here. So, we're going to cheer for that over the weekend, Sean, and we'll see how this all works out into Saturday and Sunday, and certainly into next week.",

In just moments, we will bring you the very latest updates on coronavirus, the pandemic, facts without fear, very important. Also, first, I have to address something tonight before we really get into the heart of the show. I know a lot of Americans, you are worried. You are fearful. I just went to the store. I talked to many of you. I know everyone is adjusting. Everyone is adapting. The unknown is always scary, uncertainty is scary. Despite the smears from the media mob, this program, my radio program, we've taken this virus seriously from day one. Now, I first interviewed Dr. Fauci right here on this show on January 27th. Again, early, February 10th. I have a timeline with all of my coverage and accompanying audio and video. Look at it, hannity.com, expressing the seriousness and the concern and also my faith, belief, interest in our medical professionals, irrefutable truth of the seriousness of our reporting. And yes, I rightly will continue to criticize the mob in the media and those Democrats that are weaponizing and politicizing this virus as the next Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, impeach, impeach. Remember, the first known case in the U.S. was January 21st. I was talking about it with Dr. Fauci on that show January 27th. The travel ban was enacted in record time. Unprecedented. That was January 31st, 10 days after the first case in the U.S. Democrats, yes, they were in the middle of impeachment. Biden calling the travel ban that day when the president implemented it. Hysterical xenophobia, fearmongering, and he's sticking by it. And as usual, they are hurting the country because of their pathological psychosis and hatred of Donald Trump. Well, we digress. Bigger issues tonight. Our message has never changed. Look, you want to solve any problem in life, the worst thing you can do is get panicked. We all need to stay calm, strategic, smart, act rationally, based our decisions on facts. That's why we had Dr. Anthony Fauci on this program. Let's go back in January. Remember, the first known case in our country is January 21st. January 27th, Fauci was on, and we had him again on in early February. Watch."

Going forward, I will tell you this, travel bans will be immediate, they will be fast, and no one who enacts them. I doubt they are going to be called racist, hysterical, and xenophobic -- game-changing. Drive up testing. That is the future. It is unfolding before our eyes. Public/private partnerships. Telemedicine, face timing doctors, 24/7 on- call, that is the future unfolding before your very eyes. Public-private partnerships, that is the future. Amazing how great American business and corporations have stepped up. Eliminating outdated FDA rules when necessary. That too will be our future. What's happening now will forever change how this country and the world will deal with pandemics. Now, a brand-new poll, ABC News, 55 percent of Americans do approve of the president's handling of this crisis. By the way, in spite of a corrupt media that hates him every second, minute, hour of every day, same with the Democratic so-called leaders. Under the president's leadership, now even some Democrats, some Republicans, American business leaders, our hospitals, our pharmaceutical industries, everybody is working together. You see the best in America I moments like this. All hands on deck. This is moving at the speed of light, we've never seen this before, and it is amazing to see the goodness, the greatness of so many American people, so many of our corporations, companies, they show the best of us."

You learn a lot from them. But it's in times like these, we need to look backwards and learn from history.

Let's not lose perspective tonight. We are the land of the free, the home of the brave. These are not just words. They define who we are as Americans. Think about this, we beat back Nazism, fascism, communism, imperial Japan, more recently, radical Islamism and 9/11. We survived the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean war, the threat of nuclear holocaust during the Cold War, many, many pandemics, a depression, you name it, H1N1, 2009, that killed over a half a million people worldwide. You may not remember this, this is 2009 and ‘10, 60.8 million Americans contracted H1N1, and in one year, there are almost 13,000 Americans died. Tonight, we cannot live in a state of fear. At the end of the day, we are going to beat this virus. We have a ton of reasons to be extra hopeful tonight. Clinical trials for a vaccine are now going on. This is beyond record-breaking and dramatic accomplishments, all thanks to our medical researchers, our scientists, our doctors, nurses, and all of those medical professionals on the front line. It used to take years to break down and discover the sequence of a virus, years and years. They did it in less than two months. Treatments now are already being used. First stage trial is now happening. The announcement yesterday, this anti-malaria drug called chloroquine, it's an antiviral drug, there's another one called remdesivir, along with the transfer of plasma. Here you have patients that have fully recovered from the virus, and they have the antibodies, you remove the plasma and you give it to people that are really sick. Early indications are it is having a dramatic health effect to help people recover. How amazing is our auto industry in this country? Offering now to make ventilators. The reading, we might be short of ventilators, the call the president and the White House, we'll make them for you. We'll be able to do that. These are great Americans. How impressive. That includes Ford, and GM and Tesla. All these major companies have stepped up. We may now have coronavirus test kits available very shortly. Look at Walmart and Amazon. You know what they just announced? They are hiring thousands and thousands of new workers. The grocery stores, the big chains, spoken with the president, they have promised to be restocking those shelves as fast as is humanly possible, and I know because I was at the store tonight. The only thing that wasn't there was toilet paper. What is it about toilet paper? I don't get it. It wasn't there tonight. It's fine. But you know what I'm saying. As a country, I understand fear and uncertainty. We've got to have perspective, were going to get through this. We have the best medical researchers, science, doctors, medical professionals in the world. So we need to take a moment to set the record straight. No matter what the word police -- now that is the big thing, the media mob calling COVID-19, the Chinese or the Wuhan coronavirus. It is not wrong, it is not an accurate and it certainly is not racist. The disease originated in China. That is just a fact. The disease first rapidly spread in China. That's a fact. They lied to you. They lied to the world. As a British study pointed out this week, 95 percent of this could've been prevented had they been honest. The disease is now a worldwide pandemic because of China. That is a fact. Look at your screen, let me prove my point. The last time I checked, the media mob had no problem calling any of those diseases by their geographical location. What are we going to change the name of the Spanish flu now and German measles now? It's pretty normal to identify disease by geographic location. According to the mob, Democrats, and coincidentally the communist party of China -- that is not racist, out-of-bounds. Failed presidential candidate, racism expert Elizabeth Warren, better known as Pocahontas, even blurted out the word in Chinese in a Twitter post. Fake news CNN reported, quote, the term China virus is both inaccurate and considered stigmatizing. Yes, they said the travel ban was stigmatizing. That was dumb too. Day after day, night after night for weeks you have the mob, fake news CNN, state run conspiracy TV MSDNC, others have been using COVID-19 just to bludgeon and smear the president. It's the next Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, impeach, impeach. For them, it's repulsive, that's who they are. \"The New York Times,\" what did they say? The Trump virus. If you're feeling awful, you know who to blame. \"L.A. Times,\" CNN, \"The Washington Post,\" Trump's Katrina. Really? Other people say Trump's Chernobyl. MSDNC conspiracy TV, saying Trump is guilty of negligent homicide and that the children of Trump supporters are a threat to your children. Now, more than ever, their nonstop hysteria, their anti-Trump rage, their rampant dishonesty, it's disgusting to watch and there helping nobody. Except they think themselves, they satisfy the need -- scratch, the itch they have to bludgeon Trump. Now, this doesn't stop during the president's daily COVID-19 press conferences which are filled with one stupid, insulting, politically charged gotcha question after another. You know what? The president had it today, and he's fed up with it, because they're not telling the truth and they're still using it to try to bludgeon him, politically. And the president, well, fed up with that behavior. Here's what went down. Take a look."

Richard Burr, the chair of the intelligence committee, Dianne Feinstein, Democrat from California, Kelly Loeffler from Georgia, Republican, and also, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma. Now, there is something called the STOCK Act, the Stock Trading On Congressional Knowledge Act. It was passed in 2012, amended in 2013, and basically it says, if you get information in closed-door hearings or briefings, you can't use that to trade securities. Now, Richard Burr has already referred himself to the Ethics Committee to try to clear this up. Again, they denied wrongdoing. But the STOCK Act says is if you spent more than $1,000 on a securities trade, you have to report that within 45 days. Now, the other big story here is negotiations are continuing as we speak on the phase three coronavirus piece of legislation. They don't have an agreement yet. The Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin has spoken multiple times today with Democratic Leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mitch McConnell wants to get an agreement tonight and put that into legislative form tomorrow. Chuck Schumer said about an hour and half ago, he thinks that's going to be tough because it is such a big bill.

Senator McConnell talked to all of us, Democrats and Republicans, this morning. He wants it quick, as was just reported. He wants a bill, something that looks like a bill this evening. I've been sitting in on the tax subcommittee, if you will, run by Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley and Ron Wyden as the minority. And I want to say this, Senator Wyden said to me this evening as I read off a sheet of numbers and topics, he said, I am willing to agree with this package. That's not a final signoff but he said I'm willing to agree. And that kind of characterized most of the talks that I saw today in the other subgroups. Importantly, Sean, if I can get two quick ones out here -- emergency assistance to individuals and families, probably $3,400 for a family of four -- husband, wife, two kids -- $3,400 per family. There might be a second tranche later, but that's the beginning. Huge emphasis on small businesses, with loan guarantees and plenty of assistance money and write-offs of expenses to cover this rocky period. A payroll tax holiday for businesses. And let's not forget, too, the size of this package that we're looking at is minimally $1.4 trillion, $1.4 trillion programmatically.

This could've been a much better situation, not just for us but across the globe. It started in China and they could've done a lot more, just sharing information and being upfront and transparent and they have not done that. Let's not forget that. At the end of the day, the president has been exactly right. He has to do what's best for the United States. I think one of the smartest moves he made was banning travel from China early on. He proved that he was right. His critics attacked him for that at the time. He's never going to please so many of these people who just do not like him.

And to what you said, this is something that has been problematic since the president announced his campaign, which is no matter what he does, it's never going to be good enough. So, you know, he shut down travel from China. Well, that wasn't good enough until it was. He talked about getting out in front of this, quarantining people, restricting other things, making -- putting the FDA in charge, convening the coronavirus task force, putting the vice president in charge. Everyone criticized him at the time, now there is high praise for Mike Pence's leadership on this, following the president's direction, bringing all these people together, cutting through the red tape, getting it done. It's never good enough with this president and that's the problem. The lack of respect that they show him is evident every day in that briefing room. And the questions that they ask in some ways, it's not the tough questions. He can take the tough questions. It's the lack of decorum and respect that he deserves to be shown and frankly in some cases, the credit he deserves for making sure that we contain this virus and protect the American people."

It's like, if they would just say that travel ban was a good idea, drive up testing was a good idea, getting rid of FDA regulations is a good idea -- again, all groundbreaking. We had many pandemics. Joe Biden saying it is xenophobic hysteria and fearmongering and he still says he wouldn't have implemented it. Wow. You know, are you leaving -- are you that old, Joe? That you can't think anew? Because these things are transformative and it's saving lives down the line."

The president is doing exactly what he needs to do, which is why you see Democratic governors praise him for offering aid and giving them the tools and the resources that they need to make decisions and make them quickly. At the end of the day, I think the most important thing that we can focus on is the fact that the American people are resilient. And at no time when we've faced tough adversity have we not risen to the challenge, and I have no doubt that we will once again prevail. When we come together, work together, that is when America is out at the very best, and I think we are seeing that come through day in and day out, just watching people come together, and were going to see that more."

I have a whole timeline of how serious I've taken this, and because I call out the media mob that is trying to turn this into a political weapon against the president, I say, oh, this is the next Russia hoax, meaning their way of turning -- Hannity called the fire was a hoax. Now, I didn't. And I have all the proof on hannity.com. They lie with abandon. It's disgusting. Bill Hemmer breaks down the latest facts, figures worldwide and in the states on corona. Also, are we close to a medical breakthrough? A lot of positive indications we will -- we are on the way to that. We're doing this in record time. Treatments seem promising.

      "utterance": "Yes, more testing in New York and other parts of the country. Sean, I want to show you three moments in time. You see this graphic behind me? We made this today around 2:00 this afternoon. U.S. cases in yellow, New York cases in blue. U.S. with over 14,000, of which half were in New York, at 7,000. I'll show a second moment in time, Sean. This is Monday in New York alone. Cases were at 1,300, the death rate, the number of deaths were ten on Monday of this week to begin the week. Now, the death rate over on the U.S. is about 1.4 percent. We want to keep that down, keep pushing it down. This is what happens. Watch the cases in New York on Tuesday, they jump 1,000. On Wednesday, they jump 1,700, and late last night, we're up over 7,000 cases. That is just New York. Now, I want to move to the third moment in time here, Sean, over on this screen over here. As of 9:13 p.m. East Coast Time, we're at 19,000 cases in the U.S. And again, it's the testing in New York, testing in various places. The more we get that, the more likely we are going to see this number rise. As you go to the weekend, Sean, I want you to think about two things here. This yellow line is the number -- we've been looking at this week now, seven days straight. This yellow line is all the cases outside of China. You see where it's going? It takes a slight jog at the end there. I can't say whether that's going to last, but eventually at some point that is where it's going to go. We need to get that yellow line moving to the right. So keep an eye on that. And also this here -- worldwide cases around the world, 272,000. This is what I think is something to hang your hat on is he going to the weekend. The recovery number is about 88,000. Six hours ago, that number was at 81,000. That means that certain parts of the world are getting further away from those, and that's reflected in this total recovery number. Recovery means two negative tests in a row and that is when you make the green mark here. So, we're going to cheer for that over the weekend, Sean, and we'll see how this all works out into Saturday and Sunday, and certainly into next week."

Travel ban, 10 days after the first identification of one case in the States. Then, of course, this public, private partnership, drive up testing. Now, the FDA issues.

You know, he's opened it up for American innovation for the private sector genius and that's -- we're going to reach some benefits of this when it's all over and done with, and as you said, the numbers are going up at the death rate in mortality rate is going down. But there are lots of people who are working on medications and vaccines, and the president has made it where they can do this expeditiously and we're going to get some good stuff and we're going to get it really soon. We got a couple of good drugs in the hopper right now and I think we're going to get some good news pretty soon."

But I didn't know about it until three days ago when I first read it, then the FDA rules changed, I know a lot about it, then it seems that coupled with azithromycin is showing incredible results, as is the plasma of those people that had corona, had the antibodies fully recovered, antibodies now being transferred, ivs being sent into the veins of people who are very sick."

That one decision, Geraldo, that travel ban, to Andrew Cuomo's credit, he said, yes, bought us a lot of time. Is that the future? Is drive up testing the future?

But the president is subjecting himself to these hour and a half Wild West press conferences. You know, with gotcha. Let the president come on the stage, set the stage, introduced the panels of scientists, leave, and let the scientists field the questions.

You just said it, we have the quote. Joe Biden's plan to respond to this was plagiarized 100 percent from Donald Trump. Quick, Joe Biden says we should get private labs and testing. Trump already did it, waiving Obama era regulations to do so. Two, small business relief. Trump is already all over it. Small Business Administration belief is coming. Joe Biden wants to waive co-pays. Sorry, Joe, you missed the ball. President Trump is already involved, he missed that one too, Joe. And, finally, Joe Biden hilariously says, hey, we need to accelerate a vaccine. Did he hear Dr. Fauci the other day say this is the quickest they've ever moved on a vaccine under Trump?
