And both House and Senate conferees share the goal of being at 20 percent if we can possibly do that. And we might be able to do that. So, I am not -- I do not think it is a matter handed down to Moses to what the correct date is. I am open to that discussion. We're having that discussion. But I would point out that, in any case, the expensing provision, the provision that allows full deduction for capital expenditures, that definitely kicks in on January 1, 2018, under any scenario. So, the fact is, you might get a bigger boost of economic activity if you delayed the lower corporate rate, because then capital expenditure could be deducted against the 35 percent rate, rather than a 20 percent rate.

      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, the suspect, reports say, was inspired by the ISIS call to commit terrorist attacks during the Christmas holidays, that he was walking in that subway corridor when he saw a holiday poster and that set him off, they say, to explode his device. The suspect is identified as a 25-year-old former licensed delivery cab driver from Brooklyn, who originally came to this country from Bangladesh. His name is Akayed Ullah. He arrived in the United States seven years ago on a so-called chain immigration visa. That is the type of visa that President Trump wants to end because it allows family members to enter this country. A photo of Ullah shows him curled up and crumpled right after the bomb went off. He had suffered burns on his arms and stomach from the pipe bomb that was attached to his body through velcro and zip ties. Three passerbys also wounded. The brother of one woman say she was left temporarily deaf and dizzy. Take a look at the shocking video of the moment of the explosion. It shows the smoke and the haze. Police call the device unsophisticated and small. They say Ullah made it in the electronics score shop that he works at."

And when you're talking about detonating something that has significant power in a confined space with a lot of people present, really, in ways, the ideal target, and certainly ideal for as a terrorist target in New York City. The notion that just he came out principally injured and not too much for everybody else is really almost miraculous."

      "utterance": "Neil, there's no telling. But, here, it looks like he was not a particularly good craftsman at design. And it could be this was the first device that he built. Certainly, law enforcement will be looking for evidence that he built others and may have taken them someplace, a range or out into the woods somewhere, to detonate them. But it looks he was not a particularly good craftsman. And as I said, these devices can turn deadly on the builder. We saw that with a skilled bomb builder, Ramzi Yousef, a few decades ago, who had a fire and a detonation prematurely and injured him. These things can go off. If it's black powder as the explosive, those things are sensitive to pressure and friction. And so it looks like he was not very rehearsed. Probably did not have a lot of help. It sounds like radicalized or learned on the Internet. That is a good thing for other people that were in this subway tunnel today."

There are certainly videos that are available, although some of the tech firms are doing better and better at pulling those sorts of graphic terror- inspired videos down as soon as they are identified. But there are online magazines that are terror magazines that you can locate pieces or potentially the whole magazine. You can learn and read about hate, read about the destruction, read about the ideology. And it can be a combination of that. It can certainly be people in the neighborhood, people that are associated with him. And certainly the Internet is a feeder and a driver of these things today."

Number one, New York City, that has always been on the terrorist watch list in terms of targets. Number two, transportation hubs. We saw this happen sort of in the crosswords of the Times Square area and Port Authority, underground, a known type of target for terrorists. Number three, ISIS has lost territory and has been calling for these types of attacks. And we have seen this over the past year. And I guess also, number four, the fact that there was an online, what seems to be at least from the initial reports, an online element to this, that the individual probably was not -- at least no evidence yet -- part of a larger coordinated team, or with really high-level training, but probably came across a material online in some way or contacted with terrorists or their materials online. So, all four of those show why this is again concerning, but not surprising."

    {
      "speaker": "MALLER",
      "utterance": "Right. So, obviously, around the holiday time, we always see these sort of general strategic warnings. I believe the State Department before its current worldwide travel alert had a holiday alert out about a month or so ago. And they traditionally do this. We saw last year in Germany the Christmas market bombing. You have seen more increased perimeters down here in Washington. I just drove past the Christmas market barricaded outside, because these are areas of concern. But, again, that is a strategic warning. That's not a tactical warning in terms of specific intelligence on a specific time or a place. You have millions of people in the morning commuting in New York City. It is very difficult, unless an individual is on a watch list or unless there are signs to authorities can pick up on and lead up to an attack. But I will say that the previous guest mentioned a lot of this content, while the tech companies have taken down some of it, a lot of it remains online. And that's the next battlefield here. Our organization, Counter Extremism Project, has been trying to pressure companies to get this radicalization material off the Internet. YouTube recently took down Anwar al-Awlaki videos which have been instrumental in many of these radicalization cases. But there is still a wide range of materials out there for actors to latch on to and to instruct them and radicalize them from the comfort of their own home or on their iPhone."

Now, let me just sort of explain this for the folks at home who do not sort of follow the inside baseball terminology. Chain migration, it is a process that allows immigrants to sponsor the migration of extended family members, you know, a mom, a dad, a grandparent, cousins, et cetera. The 27-year-old in custody following today's attack is from Bangladesh, has lived in the U.S. since 2011, and according to Department of Homeland Security, you got it, benefited from the precisely type of chain migration that President Trump and several key Republican lawmakers hope to end."

I should also point this out. I think you will find this interesting, Neil, for context. About 140,000 nationals from Bangladesh have immigrated to this country between 2005 and 2015.

I heard Senator Lindsey Graham earlier this morning asking that this guy be treated as an enemy combatant. And I have got to tell you, I agree with Senator Graham. And my rationale for that agreement is simply this. When someone commits a terrorist act, where they are trying to kill us in this country, I think that the intelligence community should have the first dibs at that person to try to get all of the information that they can prior to them lawyering up and having constitutional safeguards."

So, Neil, it is sort of like a needle in the haystack. We can't get at all of these guys. The intelligence communities clearly have some of these guys on the radar screen, but it's very difficult to get at somebody who is radicalized and who wakes up some morning and says, I'm going to make a bomb, and I'm going to go out and kill Americans."

Conversely, if you elect Judge Moore, you are going to have weeks and even months of controversy right here in Washington. Does he get seated? What kind of investigations happen? And it's one of the reasons why voters are paying more attention to this election than any off-year special election that I can remember in modern times. Everybody has an opinion.

There was no shrapnel. It was a premature detonation. And he is still alive. So, we should able to get valuable information out of him as well."

What happens now, as these various terror groups, whether you deem them on the run or not, merge, change, morph into something more sinister? What?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PREGENT",
      "utterance": "Well, we don't have top ISIS leadership. We have not killed or captured top ISIS leadership. We have simply taken territory away. I recently returned from Mosul. And I'll tell you, the situation there is ripe for security backslide, meaning that ISIS will morph into the Al Qaeda model, where they recruit, intimidate, assassinate, conduct, attacks, and try to destabilize -- re-stabilize Northern Iraq and Syria. You are still seeing ISIS being able to conduct these attacks, but, again, they morph into a ISIS 2.0, where they can actually shoot down American aircraft in the future, or they go into the Al Qaeda model, which is the easiest model to survive in, where you simply have cells, you have conduct attacks, you recruit, and you plan and you become very strategic in your operations."

Now, a lot of that had to do with the fact that it was relief that this wasn't a whole lot worse, but a lot of it has to do with tax cuts. They're looking like more and more of a sure thing, and that the key Senate and House conferees meeting right now can bridge their differences. This as the president of the United States is planning an address, we're told, on Wednesday to outline what he would like to see and when he would like to see it, his final stand, his final call -- after this."

That is the same time this conference committee, made up of House members and Senate members, hashes out their differences, tries to merge a final report, and the hope is get it to the president's desk before Christmas. Senate Finance Committee member, also a member on this august panel, Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey. Senator, very good to have you."

      "utterance": "I don't think we have any choice in that matter, Neil. I think the Constitution is very clear. If he is seated, and that is properly authenticated and certified by the officials in Alabama, then I think we're obligated to seat him. And I think, at that point, it is probably going to be a matter for the Ethics Committee to investigate the charges against him."

      "utterance": "That's right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right. OK. On the tax thing, the latest wrinkle seems to be when to implement the corporate tax cuts, Senator, and whether you are open, in your case, to hiking it a little bit. I think the Senate has an implementation date of 2019, the House 2018. There is talk of raising the 20 percent maybe to 22 percent to win over some of your maybe anxious colleagues in the House and the Senate. Where do you stand?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "Well, let's go back. Both the House and the Senate have a 20 percent C-corp rate. The difference, as you correctly pointed out, is whether that takes effect on January 1 of 2018 or 12 months later. At the end of the day, we're not that far apart. And both House and Senate conferees share the goal of being at 20 percent if we can possibly do that. And we might be able to do that. So, I am not -- I do not think it is a matter handed down to Moses to what the correct date is. I am open to that discussion. We're having that discussion. But I would point out that, in any case, the expensing provision, the provision that allows full deduction for capital expenditures, that definitely kicks in on January 1, 2018, under any scenario. So, the fact is, you might get a bigger boost of economic activity if you delayed the lower corporate rate, because then capital expenditure could be deducted against the 35 percent rate, rather than a 20 percent rate. Either way, the economy is going to respond very positively to what we are doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "There had been talk as well about increasing the deduction for state and local taxes beyond the $10,000 threshold. How do you feel about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "Well, my own preference is, I think it is a bad idea to force low- tax jurisdictions to subsidize people who live in high-tax jurisdictions. And that's what happens when you allow the deductibility of state and local taxes. Having said that, we understand that there are a number of Republicans in high-tax jurisdictions that are concerned about this. So, that's an ongoing discussion about where we land on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All of this, with maybe the more time people have to examine things, you seen this Wall Street Journal report of a 100-plus percent for some entities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And then you have individuals in some of these aforementioned high-tax states who could end up paying more, making significantly more, that when people get a wind of this, that they are going to have a little case of sticker shock, and it is one of those, be careful what you wish for, you just might get it. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's very, very few people that are going to have a tax increase. The story about the 100 percent marginal rate, it's a very, very selective, unusual circumstance and it would only apply to a small amount of income. And, by the way, I hope we can fix that, because that is not a desirable feature. But, look, the basic takeaway is the vast majority of American taxpayers are going to pay less in federal taxes, and we're going to encourage a tremendous wave of new investment and business expansion. Both of those things are really good for the people that I represent."

You know, Manny Gomez, I was thinking of you, because knowing what is going on now and the concern everywhere about any problems that might pop up, people get leery. Right? They get very, very leery and they get very, very nervous."

      "speaker": "GOMEZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOMEZ",
      "utterance": "Sure. Well, the order of the day is to be alert and be vigilant. Look for things that are out of the ordinary. Look for things that you know -- we all have a sixth sense. You do not have to have some superior training to realize that something is awkward or out of the way. If you see somebody that is walking down the street with an oily jacket or wires sticking out from under his coat, then you know that that is not supposed to be the way things are. Go to your nearest police officer. Advise them of what is going on. And let them conduct a proper investigation. Unfortunately, this is the new norm. This is going to continue to happen in different ways. Last month, we saw we had a terror attack with a rented vehicle. This month, we see something within an improvised explosive device. But what we all know is that they're out to get us. New York is the capital of the world and, as such, is the capital of terrorism for any wannabe terrorist. So, we need to be vigilant, we need to be alert, and we need to help the police and act as a force multiplier, be their extra eyes and ears on the street, at our jobs, at our school, and even amongst our family. We have a responsibility to report to them anybody that is acting suspiciously that could perhaps have been radicalized, that is acting about violence, or hurting people overall, and let them do an investigation and perhaps stop the next attack."

But the issue is that these materials are -- you can find them everywhere, over the counter, and information to build a bomb similar to this one is available online. That should be banned. There should be a law in place to take down these Web sites, to take down these forms of Internet information and Internet propaganda, where young people are being inspired internationally and obviously here in the United States as well to become radicalized and to go out on the street and do these horrible attacks. There has got to be a better way that a country such of our own, which is so technically savvy, could find a way to take this propaganda off the hands of potential recruitees."

Flashing lights everywhere. Emergency vehicles everywhere. Subway service disrupted. Bus service disrupted. But, by this afternoon, into the evening commute, it's really amazing how quickly New York City has returned to normal. The streets are open. The traffic, albeit slowly, is moving as it usually would be. The subways and the buses are moving as well. There is an enhanced police presence, as there always is this time of year, but the police commissioner in this city said that the old saying, see something, say something, that really still applies."
