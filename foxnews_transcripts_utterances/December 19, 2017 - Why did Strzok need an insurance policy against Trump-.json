Then what happened two years later with the economy in tatters, Bush's numbers cratered, and Barack Obama was elected. Now back to Trump. He is a strong populous core. Of course, he wants to be popular. And he understandably gets frustrated when his message doesn't seem to be breaking through. Truth be told the president has made some missteps.

That, of course, Democrats have harped on the phony Russian collusion story for a year and this all had a cumulative effect on the public psyche. But now with the economy poised to roar in 2018. The liberals and their lap dogs in the press need a fresh narrative, freshen it up. Citing the Roy Moore loss in Alabama and Gillespie in Virginia, \"The New York Times\" and other outlets are reporting that suburban women even those who voted for Trump are turning on him.

      "sentences": "Well, I disagree with these clowns and here's why. Maybe the president is sharing his empathy in a different way. I would argue that in his first year President Trump has shown empathy for the people of this country in action if not in words at all times. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Think about his deep feeling for the working people, the middle class, Americans of faith and job creators, entrepreneurs, it's all evident in his policies. So, if ridding the suburbs of MS-13, lowering taxes and improving school choice isn't showing empathy for the middle class, then what it is? It's the massive deregulation and trade policies that are spurring job creation and driving the economy isn't showing empathy for the worker? Then what is it? I'll say it is driving black unemployment to an all-time low and laboring to get drugs off the streets isn't showing empathy to the African-American community? Then what is it? To President Trump I say the following. You've accomplished so much this year, but you are not going to ever get the press on your side. They are not going to give you credit. But I'll tell you this, more voters can and will be on your side with maybe just a few tweaks, a few modest changes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Perhaps the time has come to put aside a few of the Twitter battles. I like the tweets but not all of them. Now, it's time to humanize the agenda that you've been fighting for. You see, your predecessors, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, were masterful, they could turn on the machine, they could bear hug at the drop of a hat. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } While they were often all emotion, they were at the same time often no action. I would say it's possible to do both. I was thinking today about that incredible event that you held, Mr. President, in August of 2016 with angel families who had lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens. It's an important reminder of how policy and empathy can align and when you listen and teach, nobody does it better. And if that's not empathy, what is it? Then when Hurricane Harvey struck Houston and you visited the shelter housing flood victims. That was powerful. If that's not what empathy, what is? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I like seeing you out among the people. I like seeing you with children, the elderly, factory workers, volunteers. You can be really charming and warm in person. It's time to let more Americans see that. My radio listeners today offered their advice what you should do before the midterms. One suggested a twice monthly fireside chat where you explain important policies to voters and introduce them to the people who will be impacted positively by those policies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think it's a good idea and great politics as well and I also like the fact that you deliver your message directly in that scenario with or without the media's coverage of it. I would say it's time to govern all the people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } To take your agenda to the inner city, to suburbia, to the churches and the areas of the country that have been somewhat or really unreceptive to the populous conservative message. It is hard to be a national party, isn't it, when every presidential election cycle we write off California and New York right off the bat. And there is no reason the Democrats should have a monopoly on the coast. That's absurd. Just go and try there. Give it an effort and at times just your presence, just showing up and listening can be the most powerful action of all. And I say if that isn't empathy and a winning strategy, what is? And that's the ANGLE. Joining us now for reaction here in Washington is Byron York, \"Washington Examiner,\" chief political correspondent. With me here in the studio is Congressman Sean Duffy, Republican from Wisconsin and two Democratic strategists, Joe Trippi and Scott Bolden. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Gentlemen, it's great to see all of you. All right. Trippi, let's start with you. Where am I going wrong here? You heard the ANGLE, President Trump not where he needs to be in poll numbers. Polls say 32, some say 38, 35, but it is not where he wants to be obviously. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you think that President Trump can bring his numbers up, don't make any cracks, they can't get any lower, they can. If he can bring his numbers up next year with some of these initiatives, going to the people, selling this message.",

This is something that he sees as having worked for him and I think his big challenge next year is to get Republican voters and some independents to judge him on the substance of what he has done rather than the style which does turn off some voters and there certainly is something called Trump fatigue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It actually exists out there.

So I'm very proud to be an American and I'm so grateful for our military men and women that don't get the credit they need, and I'm so grateful. That reminds me, because you mentioned my book, I really appreciate that. Dan Rooney, I had the pleasure of getting to know him over the last year and his family. And he has served our country and he was coming back from a tour in Iraq. And the pilot came over the loudspeaker and said please take you seats, stay in your seats while we remove a casket off this plane. He looked out the window. There was a flag-draped casket. He wheeled over to a family, and a young woman was there with her son, and he thought, who is going to teach that little boy to play baseball? Who is going to put him through college? And he decided he was going to be the one. Since then his organization has raised millions of dollars to put kids through college. And Laura, he came on our show and he surprised me and he said, Ainsley, because you are from South Carolina and because you've given money to folds of honor, I presented him with a check because of our viewers who are amazing that bought the book. And he said because you gave us $50,000, 10 kids are going to go to college. He went down the list. He said I picked out kids on the list. We have a long list of people that want this college money because they've lost their parents who served our great country. And he went down the list and found people from South Carolina, my home state, and put together a video. So God bless him.",

Remember when bush's popularity began to take a nose-dive in 2005 because of the Iraq war and his response to Hurricane Katrina? That was brutal. Back then W dismissed the reports of his low standing with the public. He didn't fret much or do much about it. Then you remember the Democrats went on to win the House, the Senate, and 36 governorships across America. Then what happened two years later with the economy in tatters, Bush's numbers cratered, and Barack Obama was elected. Now back to Trump. He is a strong populous core. Of course, he wants to be popular. And he understandably gets frustrated when his message doesn't seem to be breaking through. Truth be told the president has made some missteps. He is not perfect and of course, the media pounced on them. The bungled travel ban, firing of Jim Comey, and the decision probably to get involved in that Alabama Senate race at all. That, of course, Democrats have harped on the phony Russian collusion story for a year and this all had a cumulative effect on the public psyche. But now with the economy poised to roar in 2018. The liberals and their lap dogs in the press need a fresh narrative, freshen it up. Citing the Roy Moore loss in Alabama and Gillespie in Virginia, \"The New York Times\" and other outlets are reporting that suburban women even those who voted for Trump are turning on him. Well, they are supposed to be, I guess, put off by his brashness, bluntness, tweet storms and now say the CNN Trump bashers, his lack of empathy."

      "utterance": "Well, I disagree with these clowns and here's why. Maybe the president is sharing his empathy in a different way. I would argue that in his first year President Trump has shown empathy for the people of this country in action if not in words at all times. Think about his deep feeling for the working people, the middle class, Americans of faith and job creators, entrepreneurs, it's all evident in his policies. So, if ridding the suburbs of MS-13, lowering taxes and improving school choice isn't showing empathy for the middle class, then what it is? It's the massive deregulation and trade policies that are spurring job creation and driving the economy isn't showing empathy for the worker? Then what is it? I'll say it is driving black unemployment to an all-time low and laboring to get drugs off the streets isn't showing empathy to the African-American community? Then what is it? To President Trump I say the following. You've accomplished so much this year, but you are not going to ever get the press on your side. They are not going to give you credit. But I'll tell you this, more voters can and will be on your side with maybe just a few tweaks, a few modest changes. Perhaps the time has come to put aside a few of the Twitter battles. I like the tweets but not all of them. Now, it's time to humanize the agenda that you've been fighting for. You see, your predecessors, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, were masterful, they could turn on the machine, they could bear hug at the drop of a hat. While they were often all emotion, they were at the same time often no action. I would say it's possible to do both. I was thinking today about that incredible event that you held, Mr. President, in August of 2016 with angel families who had lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens. It's an important reminder of how policy and empathy can align and when you listen and teach, nobody does it better. And if that's not empathy, what is it? Then when Hurricane Harvey struck Houston and you visited the shelter housing flood victims. That was powerful. If that's not what empathy, what is? I like seeing you out among the people. I like seeing you with children, the elderly, factory workers, volunteers. You can be really charming and warm in person. It's time to let more Americans see that. My radio listeners today offered their advice what you should do before the midterms. One suggested a twice monthly fireside chat where you explain important policies to voters and introduce them to the people who will be impacted positively by those policies. I think it's a good idea and great politics as well and I also like the fact that you deliver your message directly in that scenario with or without the media's coverage of it. I would say it's time to govern all the people. To take your agenda to the inner city, to suburbia, to the churches and the areas of the country that have been somewhat or really unreceptive to the populous conservative message. It is hard to be a national party, isn't it, when every presidential election cycle we write off California and New York right off the bat. And there is no reason the Democrats should have a monopoly on the coast. That's absurd. Just go and try there. Give it an effort and at times just your presence, just showing up and listening can be the most powerful action of all. And I say if that isn't empathy and a winning strategy, what is? And that's the ANGLE. Joining us now for reaction here in Washington is Byron York, \"Washington Examiner,\" chief political correspondent. With me here in the studio is Congressman Sean Duffy, Republican from Wisconsin and two Democratic strategists, Joe Trippi and Scott Bolden. Gentlemen, it's great to see all of you. All right. Trippi, let's start with you. Where am I going wrong here? You heard the ANGLE, President Trump not where he needs to be in poll numbers. Polls say 32, some say 38, 35, but it is not where he wants to be obviously. Do you think that President Trump can bring his numbers up, don't make any cracks, they can't get any lower, they can. If he can bring his numbers up next year with some of these initiatives, going to the people, selling this message."

When someone hits him, he hits back, and it has worked for him usually. In the long run, it has usually worked for him and he was derided for doing this in the campaign by a lot of people, probably, Joe at times you and Scott sometimes you and it worked. All these naysayers in the media told me the polls were going to destroy him. He was destroying himself. In the end Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, et cetera, turned out because they thought the country was going down the tubes. Can he turn those numbers around given the current landscape? BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, a couple of things. We have heard these complaints throughout the campaign and presidency and a lot of Republicans, who admire his sheer political talent that unique talent that he has, and they always say, gee, you know, if he could only smooth off a few of those rough edges and not do some of those tweets. And when this is brought up with the president he will basically say and how many of you have been elected president? This is something that he sees as having worked for him and I think his big challenge next year is to get Republican voters and some independents to judge him on the substance of what he has done rather than the style which does turn off some voters and there certainly is something called Trump fatigue. It actually exists out there. But I think you're likely to see, especially with the situation in Congress, everybody will be running for office.

Mueller has nothing to do with the things that McCabe did before Mueller came onto the scene. If you talk about the insurance text -- the insurance policy text from Strzok, what possible innocent explanation is there? He says we can't take the risk that Trump will be elected.

So, unless he was worried about his handling of the Clinton email investigation, I'm talking about Strzok now, he had nothing to worry about. It's a preposterous explanation. The most innocent explanation is we can't take the risk that he is going to get elected and not let us investigate him so let's get this investigation started now.

There was some confusion on that. The government will not have to pay for the procedures, however, but the ruling stymies the Trump administration's efforts to reverse Obama's policy which allows abortions for illegal alien minors in custody. This is a crazy world we live in. What could possibly go wrong? We're not going to become an abortion magnet or anything. Joining us now from Boston in trial attorney Rachel Self who specializes in criminal defense and immigration law. All right, now, I'm trying to understand this from a different perspective.

She was at about 10 weeks at that time. And another one of the women was even less further along than that. What happens is when these -- and they're not women, they're girls. But when they flee their country and come here, they get examined upon their entry to the United States for basic medical care and needs. And that's because it has been discovered that almost 80 percent of them on their journey here wind up victims of sexual violence. And so there are studies that show that. And so the refugee -- these actually aren't part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement custodies because in the 80s with the Flores settlement they became part of the Health and Human Services -- well, no, it's the Health and Human Services."

I know a lot of people think the government should pay for it. Is that our responsibility? And if so, under what principle is it our responsibility? I'm not talking for American citizens.

So I'm very proud to be an American and I'm so grateful for our military men and women that don't get the credit they need, and I'm so grateful. That reminds me, because you mentioned my book, I really appreciate that. Dan Rooney, I had the pleasure of getting to know him over the last year and his family. And he has served our country and he was coming back from a tour in Iraq. And the pilot came over the loudspeaker and said please take you seats, stay in your seats while we remove a casket off this plane. He looked out the window. There was a flag-draped casket. He wheeled over to a family, and a young woman was there with her son, and he thought, who is going to teach that little boy to play baseball? Who is going to put him through college? And he decided he was going to be the one. Since then his organization has raised millions of dollars to put kids through college. And Laura, he came on our show and he surprised me and he said, Ainsley, because you are from South Carolina and because you've given money to folds of honor, I presented him with a check because of our viewers who are amazing that bought the book. And he said because you gave us $50,000, 10 kids are going to go to college. He went down the list. He said I picked out kids on the list. We have a long list of people that want this college money because they've lost their parents who served our great country. And he went down the list and found people from South Carolina, my home state, and put together a video. So God bless him."

Now that the president has finally shown up there, will anyone know who the heck he is? Look at this. This looks nothing like Donald Trump. Was the sculptor out of town when they were making this animatronic figure? You have got the open coat and the long tie. You can't see it, but the tie goes below the belt. I just don't see Trump at all in this. So I ask the question, who does this look like? Some on the Internet say it looks like a bloated Jon Voight. Jon Voight is never going to speak to me again. Or maybe I thought today an aged Lloyd Bridges. Look at that. I'm right. Or maybe does it look like Alec Baldwin kind of? Alec Baldwin's impersonation of Trump is the worst. I'm sorry. I don't like it. This is very cruel. I reject this at Christmas time especially, that it looks like Hillary Clinton."

      "utterance": "That is just -- I completely reject that. Well, let me know what you think on Facebook or on Twitter @IngrahamAngle. You know I think they should get the guy who does the wax figures for the wax museum. Why can't that guy or gal do the animatronics because it looks really good. That looks like Trump. Whatever the case, Disney should be ashamed. Or it might be their own way of protesting. Having to include Trump in their attraction at all probably drives them crazy. But do not go anywhere. I want you to hit me on Facebook and Twitter about those three, four options."

So make sure to get something, maybe get a gift for someone who's been naughty and nice just for the heck of it. My kids, I say they are not going to get anything, but they are getting. You've got to give them something. Maybe win the naught people over by giving them a copy of my book, \"Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump.\" You'll love it. It's a great read, great gift, stocking stuffer, and all that jazz. Reach me @IngrahamAngle on Twitter and on Facebook. Remember to vote for who the animatronic Trump really looks like.
