The company says that for months since March. China Iran -- China-Iran, excuse me, as well as Russia have been targeting both the Trump and the Biden campaigns, as well as hundreds of people and organizations and groups that work with those campaigns.

Microsoft didn't disclose the total number of attacks that have occurred but claimed there were thousands of targets between March and June, including both candidates, campaign staff, campaign consultants, U.S. and Europe policy groups, as well as think tanks.

The first is who did what, when. And I think that the president has a very good argument here for saying that he did a lot of the things right. Obviously, no response is going to be perfect. It's a pandemic. It is sort of amusing in Washington to watch people attack the president for not being presidential, and then when he tries to act presidential and try to calm people down and not create hysterics, he then gets killed for that. I do understand why the president doesn't walk out and say oh, my gosh, we have got a pandemic. Everything is on fire. The second thing -- and then, of course, don't forget, at that time what was going on in Congress was you had Democrats shutting down an entire branch of the federal government to pursue impeachment of the president even though they knew it wasn't going to go anywhere. And I think that is actually a pretty good argument the president can make going into the election. The second thing is, where do we go from here.

Barack Obama, who was an enthusiastic participant in filibusters as a senator, now has called it a remnant of Jim Crow. But I guess it's a good remnant for now because the Democrats are using it to thwart Republicans. I think the Democrats have made a calculation here, which is the media by and large is on their side. They want Donald Trump to lose. And any outrageous behavior or indefensible behavior from the Democratic Party will be barely covered or swept under the rug. This was every single Senate Democrat announcing to the country, if people are paying attention, they refuse to even get onto a bill, which means they wouldn't even debate or amend a bill on coronavirus relief. That doesn't mean they have to vote for or against it. They even have another chance to block it down the line.

China Iran -- China-Iran, excuse me, as well as Russia have been targeting both the Trump and the Biden campaigns, as well as hundreds of people and organizations and groups that work with those campaigns. Now, the company claims they're finding makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election. Microsoft believes the Russian military backpacking group called Fancy Bear now infamous for attacks on the DNC and Clinton campaigns back in 2016 is more capable than ever and it started using what's known as brute force cyber attacks. They say Chinese hackers targeted Biden's campaign and at least one former Trump administration official while Iran focus more exclusively on the Trump campaign. Microsoft didn't disclose the total number of attacks that have occurred but claimed there were thousands of targets between March and June, including both candidates, campaign staff, campaign consultants, U.S. and Europe policy groups, as well as think tanks. Now, key senators like Ben Sasse say it's well known that China prefers Biden to win in 2020 while Russia prefers a second term for President Trump. An official from the office of the director of National Intelligence tells Fox News this evening, they welcome Microsoft's assistance and will continue partnering with them to combat foreign efforts. The revelations come at a sensitive moment amid an investigation prompted by a whistleblower complaint which claims the Trump administration is suppressing intelligence about Russian election interference, something the White House denied to Bret Baier just last night."

All medical experts say so and we know that Joe Biden would not have done that. He called it hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering. And what you have now with the -- in the wake of the excerpts from the Bob Woodward book is that, I think what's happening, what's got everybody all excited is that's all packaged up and it says Bob Woodward's name on the cover.

President Trump is just calling attention to what in fact has actually happened. And the fact that Joe Biden has been too weak to call out the fact that these Antifa thugs are aligned with his campaign and with the anti-police wing of the Democrat Party. Joe Biden's too weak to stand up to them because they're in control of his party, they're in control of his campaign and he doesn't dare speak out against them.

      "speaker": "JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS",
      "utterance": "I think one of the things that undercuts the president's argument when he talks about wanting to be a calming figure is that there's very little evidence over the last few years that Trump has wanted to be a calming figure. If you even look at where he wants to push this campaign, talking about law and order, talking about crime, he's actually trying to instill fear. He's actually trying to make people scared. And so it runs counter to a lot of what we've just seen from him publicly over the last couple of years. I do think more broadly the president does not want to be talking about the pandemic during the next eight weeks. He wants to be talking about that as though it's something in the past. The Biden campaign would really like to fight out this campaign squarely on this question of do you believe that president handled this in the right way or not, and they believe that the Woodward book has given them an opening to push that conversation and that campaign line forward."

I actually think that the president actually doesn't mind talking about the pandemic because basically I think the election, voters are going to have two takeaways regarding the pandemic going into the election. The first is who did what, when. And I think that the president has a very good argument here for saying that he did a lot of the things right. Obviously, no response is going to be perfect. It's a pandemic. It is sort of amusing in Washington to watch people attack the president for not being presidential, and then when he tries to act presidential and try to calm people down and not create hysterics, he then gets killed for that. I do understand why the president doesn't walk out and say oh, my gosh, we have got a pandemic. Everything is on fire. The second thing -- and then, of course, don't forget, at that time what was going on in Congress was you had Democrats shutting down an entire branch of the federal government to pursue impeachment of the president even though they knew it wasn't going to go anywhere. And I think that is actually a pretty good argument the president can make going into the election. The second thing is, where do we go from here. And you have Vice President Biden talking about having a federal mandate requiring facemasks and wanting to shut down the economy again and hand everything over to scientists. That's one option. And then you have the president's option, which is something very different. And voters will decide."

The Senate, the Republicans call a targeted bill, Democrats call a skinny basketball. Either way it went down to a filibuster that many Democrats actually oppose, the filibuster. But it went down to a filibuster, Democrats blocking it. How does that play politically now that this bill, it seems like there's not a negotiation happening?"

      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, first of all, Bret, to one of your earlier interview, I want to assure that I'm not reading from a teleprompter during this interview. I can't answer that question if you were to ask it to me directly. To your question here about the filibuster, I think it is rich, as you point out, Democrats in the Senate are openly discussing getting rid of the filibuster should they win back power. Barack Obama, who was an enthusiastic participant in filibusters as a senator, now has called it a remnant of Jim Crow. But I guess it's a good remnant for now because the Democrats are using it to thwart Republicans. I think the Democrats have made a calculation here, which is the media by and large is on their side. They want Donald Trump to lose. And any outrageous behavior or indefensible behavior from the Democratic Party will be barely covered or swept under the rug. This was every single Senate Democrat announcing to the country, if people are paying attention, they refuse to even get onto a bill, which means they wouldn't even debate or amend a bill on coronavirus relief. That doesn't mean they have to vote for or against it. They even have another chance to block it down the line. This was just a full-blown piece of obstruction to not even discuss this very important issue. And Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer came out and declared victory and sort of high-fiving over this failure. I think there are a lot of hurting Americans that might not be thrilled with that."
