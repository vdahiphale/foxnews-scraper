      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Happy Father's Day to all. And welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo. Today: Biden's big blunder. Why did the leader of the free world give a former KGB spy, Vladimir Putin, a list of the most vulnerable spots in America, begging him not to hack them? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The former director of national intelligence this morning, John Ratcliffe, on how the view of America has changed in just five short months. Russia, China and Iran in Joe Biden's America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then, social media and corporate dominance once again lets us down massively, the censorship that may have cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Senator Ron Johnson and Dr. Pierre Kory on lifesaving treatments that were censored and attacked early in the pandemic. Who is making money on this cover-up? And when will the lies from big media stop? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus: a wave of gunshots and crime across the country. The bad policies that are resulting in very bad outcomes. Former Police Chief of Detroit James Craig and Bill White, who's trying to separate his community of Buckhead away from the Atlanta violence, on the movement to defund the police, open borders and put prisoners back on our streets. All right here, right now, on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And first this morning, the potentially deadly impact of censorship and media cover-ups, as evidence mounts that big tech and corporate media have silenced truthful facts about COVID, to the detriment of the American people. My first guests this morning were studying and questioning potential treatments for COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. And despite evidence of safety and efficacy of early treatment from at least one drug that's been on the market for treating other sicknesses, any mention of either ivermectin or, to a lesser extent, hydroxychloroquine was met with attacks and takedowns by political operatives and some media. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Such mentions or posts were censored by social media. This week, the Department of Health and Human Services reported it will spend more than $3 billion on developing and manufacturing antiviral treatments to treat COVID-19. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In fact, Anthony Fauci was quoted as saying pills taken at home to treat COVID would be a powerful tool in our effort to prevent death from COVID. But, to date, more than 600,000 Americans have already died in the last year. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson was among the first to question why certain medicines were being ignored or criticized to treat COVID-19. He joins me right now, along with Dr. Pierre Kory, an infectious disease specialist whose testimony before Senator Johnson's committee was censored by Google's YouTube. Both men made the case that early treatment of COVID, even for those with mild symptoms, prevents later hospitalizations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, why weren't we doing it?

Media arrogance, social media censorship happened. That clip, that testimony from Dr. Kory, powerful testimony, was viewed by eight million Americans, who weren't satisfied with the NIH guidelines that basically do nothing. They wanted early treatment. It was pulled by YouTube. But we all know that Dr. Fauci, he's not a modest man. You know, if you question what he did, apparently, you're questioning science itself. But you can look at how he stage-managed the COVID crisis and call it anywhere close to a success; 600,000 people died, trillions of dollars of economic devastation. He ignored early treatment. He probably helped sabotage the use of some of these things. And, Maria, you have to understand that Dr. Fauci, people in the health industries, the media, the social media, they will never admit they were wrong on this, because, if they do, they're going to have to admit that literally hundreds of hundreds of people didn't have to lose their lives, but for their censorship, their arrogance, and Dr. Fauci's mismanagement. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And they were talking about big opportunities with an information hub. Let's look at the timeline of what Facebook did after these e-mails went back and forth between the two of them. Facebook decides to start an information hub, all things about COVID. But they censor certain important information, as we have been telling you. And then, when these e-mails are released where Fauci admits to modest collaboration with the Wuhan Lab of Virology, all of a sudden, the Facebook -- the Facebook policies change and they say, oh, OK, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 was manmade or manufactured from naturally.

I could make an argument that the first five months of the Biden administration have been the best of Vladimir Putin's political life. Just from an economic standpoint, folks know that Vladimir Putin was 3-0 when it comes to pipelines. Joe Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline. That was a win for Putin. Criminal networks in Russia shut down one of our major pipelines, the Colonial Pipeline. That was a win for Putin. And, of course, Joe Biden responded by giving Vladimir Putin the one thing that he wanted most, which was the Nord Stream II pipeline, the ability to finish that, and, by doing so, to control the flow of energy into Western Europe. So it had already been a great year for Vladimir Putin before he ever got to Geneva. But then Joe Biden gave him a political win. He invited the Russian dictator who governs a country with an economy -- a small, dwindling economy the size of the state of Texas, to sit down with him. And, as a result of that, Vladimir Putin was on the world stage with equal billing with the leader of the free world, and he made no concessions. He made no concessions about cyberattacks. He made no concessions about political dissidents. He made no concessions about Russian interference in Ukraine or Belarus. And that's a political win for Vladimir Putin back home that he could not possibly have dreamed about.",

All right here, right now, on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And first this morning, the potentially deadly impact of censorship and media cover-ups, as evidence mounts that big tech and corporate media have silenced truthful facts about COVID, to the detriment of the American people. My first guests this morning were studying and questioning potential treatments for COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. And despite evidence of safety and efficacy of early treatment from at least one drug that's been on the market for treating other sicknesses, any mention of either ivermectin or, to a lesser extent, hydroxychloroquine was met with attacks and takedowns by political operatives and some media. Such mentions or posts were censored by social media. This week, the Department of Health and Human Services reported it will spend more than $3 billion on developing and manufacturing antiviral treatments to treat COVID-19. In fact, Anthony Fauci was quoted as saying pills taken at home to treat COVID would be a powerful tool in our effort to prevent death from COVID. But, to date, more than 600,000 Americans have already died in the last year. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson was among the first to question why certain medicines were being ignored or criticized to treat COVID-19. He joins me right now, along with Dr. Pierre Kory, an infectious disease specialist whose testimony before Senator Johnson's committee was censored by Google's YouTube. Both men made the case that early treatment of COVID, even for those with mild symptoms, prevents later hospitalizations. So, why weren't we doing it?

But you can look at how he stage-managed the COVID crisis and call it anywhere close to a success; 600,000 people died, trillions of dollars of economic devastation. He ignored early treatment. He probably helped sabotage the use of some of these things. And, Maria, you have to understand that Dr. Fauci, people in the health industries, the media, the social media, they will never admit they were wrong on this, because, if they do, they're going to have to admit that literally hundreds of hundreds of people didn't have to lose their lives, but for their censorship, their arrogance, and Dr. Fauci's mismanagement."

We're getting reports from all over the world from Mexico that put it into their public health policy that huge numbers of patients are avoiding hospitalization and death in Argentina and in certain states in India. We know it's working. It's working around the world. And nobody in the United States is hearing about it."

But now Fauci says he's looking at a drug that's going to be a patented drug made by Merck. Aren't the underlying chemicals the same? So now they're going to have that on patent, so that they can make a huge profit on it?"

And so you see all of this money being thrown at pharmaceutical companies to develop new therapies, when we already have existing repurposed drugs that are highly effective. They will never develop a drug that is more effective than ivermectin. I find it absurd. Our government just gave -- committed over $4 billion in two different areas this week to try to find an oral antiviral early treatment therapy. We have it now. We can save so many lives. This is a treatable disease. We have identified that drug. And it needs to be systematically deployed throughout the -- throughout the health care system."

They pulled that off. And, by the way Maria, if it weren't for FOX Nation, if you had to rely on YouTube, this segment right here would be censored immediately on YouTube. Think of that. The other thing that Dr. Fauci and the media is ignoring right now is the early warning signals of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. We have close to 5,000 deaths, over 1,700 within days zero, one and two of getting vaccinated. We have thousands of people with permanent disabilities, 20,000 hospitalizations. And that, quite honestly, compares to less than 200 deaths per year through the entire 30-year history of the VAERS system with other vaccines. They're not paying attention.

We are talking with Dr. Pierre Kory and Senator Ron Johnson this morning about the censorship by corporate dominance in social media and their obvious belief that Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter, they are the arbiters of truth. I don't know when they started to believe they were the arbiters of truth. Many of the leadership are political operatives, by the way. Senator, let's talk about what went on with Fauci and Facebook during the pandemic, when we have these e-mails from Dr. Fauci talking with Mark Zuckerberg. And they were talking about big opportunities with an information hub. Let's look at the timeline of what Facebook did after these e-mails went back and forth between the two of them. Facebook decides to start an information hub, all things about COVID. But they censor certain important information, as we have been telling you. And then, when these e-mails are released where Fauci admits to modest collaboration with the Wuhan Lab of Virology, all of a sudden, the Facebook -- the Facebook policies change and they say, oh, OK, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 was manmade or manufactured from naturally. Your thoughts on what has taken place here in terms of the censorship?"

The fact of the matter is, hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives because of the politicization of COVID. And I would personally much rather put my faith in doctors like Dr. Kory, Dr. McCullough, Dr. Fareed that also testified before my committee, these doctors that have the courage and compassion to actually treat patients. And my plea to Americans is, go on other social media sites. This information isn't 100 percent suppressed. If you get COVID, seek a doctor that will actually treat your disease, because there is treatment for it. But, no, Maria, the lies being told, the false narratives across the board in instance after instance is affecting our politics. The media got their guy elected. And now they're not going to admit that they have been wrong. And it's going to continue to cost people's lives."

These are actually the biggest lies, the Russia hoax based on a made-up dossier to try to take down Trump, an impeachment of Trump with absolutely no crimes attached to it. The Hunter Biden laptop and all of his business deals and the money that he received from everybody from the former Moscow mayor's wife to the Chinese companies tied to the Chinese Communist Party. The origins of COVID-19, a lab leak, and the treatment. And then, of course, there's the armed insurrection. Armed insurrection is what Nancy Pelosi keeps calling January 6, Senator.

Lori Lightfoot talks about what's dangerous. The cops are dangerous? No, she's dangerous. What's happening is, people who live in the most vulnerable communities, and Chicago, South and West Chicago, vulnerable communities, who speaks for them? Who's protecting them?

And we pretty much foresaw what was about to happen, because they had done away with cash bail, no bail. If you get arrested, you're just processed and go right back on the street.

And I want to thank Governor Kemp for putting $5 million into state police resources to come into Atlanta to do her job. She's asleep at the switch. No one's answering the 911 calls. And we're vilifying our beautiful men and women in the police department. It is literally insane, Maria. And I have read the resignation letters since I was on your show. And I can't thank you enough. You are staying on this issue. And you're helping us.

Kamala Harris on the campaign trail said that she wants to go no cash bail at all for the whole country, not just some of these big cities. Look what it's already done to New York.

What will work, support the men and women who serve with dignity, courageously every single day. And it's just not happening. So let's talk about qualified immunity. The City Council in New York did what? Ended qualified immunity. So, is there a surprise that NYPD officers are leaving in large numbers?

I could make an argument that the first five months of the Biden administration have been the best of Vladimir Putin's political life. Just from an economic standpoint, folks know that Vladimir Putin was 3-0 when it comes to pipelines. Joe Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline. That was a win for Putin. Criminal networks in Russia shut down one of our major pipelines, the Colonial Pipeline. That was a win for Putin. And, of course, Joe Biden responded by giving Vladimir Putin the one thing that he wanted most, which was the Nord Stream II pipeline, the ability to finish that, and, by doing so, to control the flow of energy into Western Europe. So it had already been a great year for Vladimir Putin before he ever got to Geneva. But then Joe Biden gave him a political win. He invited the Russian dictator who governs a country with an economy -- a small, dwindling economy the size of the state of Texas, to sit down with him. And, as a result of that, Vladimir Putin was on the world stage with equal billing with the leader of the free world, and he made no concessions. He made no concessions about cyberattacks. He made no concessions about political dissidents. He made no concessions about Russian interference in Ukraine or Belarus. And that's a political win for Vladimir Putin back home that he could not possibly have dreamed about."

He -- Vladimir Putin got something that the American people haven't gotten. He's had for hours with Joe Biden and an ability to conduct really a physical and mental assessment, evaluation and differential diagnosis. And why that's important, Maria, as intelligence professionals, when it comes to foreign leaders, whether it's videos or pictures, I mean, we look at every tick, every tremor, every bobble. Is his hand shaking. Is that a spot on his neck? Did he just slur his words? Because that's important. You want to know the abilities or capabilities or limitations of foreign leaders. And, in this case, Vladimir Putin, as you said, a former KGB spy, a seasoned intelligence officer, had four hours directly with Joe Biden, Joe Biden, someone who we all know fell up a flight of stairs for no apparent reason twice, someone who couldn't remember the name of his own secretary of defense, couldn't remember the name of the Pentagon, and someone who has uttered more incomprehensible words and sentences than any American would care to admit.

So, as you know, Maria, for good or for bad, Donald Trump ran his staff. He never said, I'm only going to call on reporters that they let me or my staff gets upset when I call on reporters. That never happened."

I talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off-limits to attack, period, by cyber or any other means. And I gave them a list, if I'm not mistaken -- I don't have it in front of me -- 16 specific entities, 16 defined as critical infrastructure under U.S. policy, from the energy sector to our water systems. So, we agreed to task experts in both our -- both our countries to work on specific understandings about what's off-limits and to follow up on specific cases that originate in other countries in their -- either of our countries."

      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think anyone can. I mean, it's bizarre. It's absurd. To hand him that kind of list is essentially to hand him a target list, to give your adversary, whatever you do, don't attack these. These are where we're most vulnerable, so stay away from that. I mean, that's how Vladimir Putin would look at that. I don't know who's coming up with the strategies. But if you're going to give Vladimir Putin a list, it should have been a list of our targets. It should have been, hey, if we suffer another major cyberattack, we're coming after one of these, or, even better, shut down the lights in the Kremlin before you go to the summit, so that Vladimir Putin knows you mean business and that when you say, don't cross these red lines, or there will be consequences, he knows that you're serious about that."

It was you who told us on this program several months ago that the Chinese Communist Party was doing gene editing on their soldiers to engineer them stronger, just as gain of function research and the potential making of a bioweapon was taking place in Wuhan. Yet Biden still won't call out China and won't call China an adversary. He keeps calling China a competitor. More with John Ratcliffe -- when we come right back."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. I am back with former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe assessing Joe Biden's foreign policy. Director, I want to point your attention to the G7 statement out of the G7 meeting this last week. The G7 members called challenge -- called China a challenge. And they're harder on Russia than they are on China. Your reaction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "I'm not surprised. Those G7 countries are heavily reliant on China at this point in time. Italy, France, Germany, even Great Britain have taken, collectively, hundreds of billions of dollars in direct Chinese investment over the last few years. And, for instance, Germany, from an export standpoint with regard to automobiles, sends -- sends more Mercedes and BMWs to China than they do any other country in the world. So they're not going to be tough on a country that they're reliant and dependent upon. And so, when members of the club, as they now refer to themselves, are soft on China, I'm not surprised. I'm disappointed that the United States would want to be part of that club and agreed to language that is soft on China, when, Maria, as you are starting to see some of the intelligence that I have seen as the director of national intelligence that tells us that China not only wants to supplant the United States as the world's superpower, but that they're a proximate cause of four million deaths over the past four years from the Wuhan virus. And the language from every country in the world ought to be tough on China."

We're not allowed to say Wuhan virus. It's just not appropriate, according to Joe Biden, on federal land. And he continues to call China a competitor. He never says he's an adversary. In fact, even during the campaign trail, he said, oh, please, China's really going to take us over? Not really. And then, a few weeks ago, he actually admitted it. Look at Joe Biden over the last couple of years. Watch this."

I have spent more time with President Xi of China than any world leader has for 24 hours of private meetings with him with just an interpreter, 17,000 miles traveling between China and here. He firmly believes that China, before the year 3035 (sic) is going to own America, because autocracies can make quick decisions. But America is unique. Of all the nations in the world, we're the only nation organized based on an idea."

What should be the accountability that you would like to see as a result of the CCP allowing this deadly virus to escape its borders? And why hasn't Biden brought up the origins of COVID with Xi Jinping, now six months into his term?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Yes, as you know, Maria, after the election, I wrote an op-ed calling China our number one national security threat and talked about, as the person who has seen more intelligence than anyone in the country for the past year, just how clear it is that they are not just an adversary, but someone that wants to supplant us as the world's superpower. And my hope was that, as we shared that intelligence with the incoming Biden folks, that they wouldn't just have tough rhetoric on China, that they would have tough actions. And, clearly, that's not been the case. So, case in point, to your -- to the point about COVID, Joe Biden put out a 200-page strategic plan on COVID-19, or the Wuhan virus. There is zero words, not a single word in there about the origins of COVID-19, or the Wuhan virus. And from Joe Biden, to Antony Blinken, to CIA Director Bill Burns, maybe it's because they have all had interactions with China, business dealings with China, or their family has, but, again, it's been empty rhetoric on a country that, again, let me tell you, as someone that has seen all of the intelligence, is a proximate cause of not just four million deaths last year from this virus, but 600,000 American deaths."

And, John, we were talking about the dangerous nature of communist China and why Joe Biden has been so soft on China. I wonder if it is any -- has anything to do with the conflict of interests that are obvious, all the money that Hunter Biden, his son, has taken. We have a graphic here to say -- to show some of the deals that we know about. He was paid $5 million from the Chinese oil companies CEFC. Of course, he created a $1 billion investment fund with the state-owned Bank of China. We also have the Russia deals, receiving the $3.5 million check from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow. And, of course, the elephant in the room is that e-mail that we all know about when he was putting together this Chinese company. The e-mail said, 10 percent held by H for the big guy. The big guy, we are assuming, is Joe Biden. Do you believe that this president is soft on China because he's afraid of what they have on him and because of all of the entanglements his family has in communist China, where they were paid?"

As you know, it was on this program, while I was the director of national intelligence, when Hunter Biden's laptop first surfaced, where I said, no, it's not Russian disinformation, as Adam Schiff says. The laptop is his and the e-mails are real. And, in addition to the disturbing e-mails about Hunter Biden's personal conduct are the equally disturbing e-mails that you're referencing that talk about financial ties to China, to Chinese companies that are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party..."
