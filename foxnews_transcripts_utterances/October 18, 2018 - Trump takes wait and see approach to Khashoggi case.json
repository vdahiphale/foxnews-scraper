      "utterance": "Sure. There are three facts in play here. Number one, this is a horrific crime that can't get swept under the rug. There are going to be consequences. Even the president would want to impose consequences. Congress is going to insist on some consequences. Number two, we need Saudi Arabia, not so much for oil because of the fracking revolution we are much more energy independent than we were a few years ago, but we need them to contain Iran. There is no other country in the region that can be a counterweight to Iran. And three, MBS isn't going anywhere. This is a monarchy, not a democracy. He is the son of the king. He has spent the last couple of years consolidating power and eliminating opponents. I love Lindsey Graham, but the idea that someone else is going to replace MBS is wrong. So with that set of facts, what's going to happen here is they are going to come up with a lie that this is some rogue element and we are going to accept the lie in some way, shape, or form. And the question is, what is the price for accepting the lie, where there is going to be some sign from MBS recognizing, showing us that he knows he made a mistake, that he knows he's made his country a pariah, and that he's going to take steps to make sure this doesn't happen again, releasing political prisoners, taking some steps to show that he's learned his lesson and this is not going to go forward."

But the president, and again we've seen this, Democrat administrations and Republican administrations, presidents don't like to mess with this tiger because of -- and you are right. There have been -- we are far more energy independent today that we were on 9/11. But there are still the other local political ramifications. And then the business interests that Donald Trump mentions at the outset."

      "speaker": "SWAN",
      "utterance": "It's a very different animal, and I think it took them a while to realize that. I think there was at least initially it didn't dawn on them that this was something quite different. I'm told by a source with knowledge of the meeting that Mike Pompeo told MBS in very direct language that there isn't some endless timeline here. They need to get this investigation done pretty quickly."

This is both a horrific crime and also amateur. It's amateur hour. He's a discount Vladimir Putin. And there has to be consequences for this. There are going to have to be consequences, but we also cannot lose our relationship with Saudi Arabia because the number one challenge we have in the Middle East is Iran and countering Iran, not getting on Saudi Arabia."
