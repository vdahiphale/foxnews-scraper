      "sentences": "Let's face it, the reason Kirsten Gillibrand has suddenly found sense is that she is positioning herself for a 2020 presidential bid. She wants to run for higher office. And it's interesting by the way how she mentioned Lewenski but conveniently forgot about all the other women who accused Bill Clinton. Juanita Broderick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and yes, there were many others. When Gillibrand was running for office in 2006, whom did she call to help her raise money? Bill Clinton, of course. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And she, like many Democratic women before her, had no problem at all turning a deaf ear to the complaints of sexual harassment that had dogged Clinton for decades. And you know why? Because, let's face it, he was an uber fundraiser. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He was fantastic at it. But, with sex pigs now being called to account for their misdeeds in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, well, Democrats have suddenly discovered a moral conscience. And now they even see their former heroes with new eyes. Bill Clinton wasn't a degenerate when he appeared at every Democratic convention since he left office. And I guess, he wasn't a bad degenerate sexual harasser when he was feted in New York at the Clinton Foundation galas. He wasn't a sex pig last month when he campaigned for Phil Murphy in New Jersey. But now that his wife has lost the presidency and Bill is under new scrutiny, he is suddenly a leper to the party that enabled him for decades. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Sell it somewhere else. None of us believe it. The truth is you have to question how seriously these Democratic women take sexual harassment. These are some of the same women who held a pep rally for Bill Clinton in 1998 after his impeachment. I love that photo. A Mount Olympus female Democrats were in attendance, Feinstein, Pelosi, Boxer, McColski (ph), all of them standing and clapping like a bunch of seals for Bill Clinton. The only thing was the fish. Now this new-found courage among Gillibrand and the rest is a little more than political expediency. The Democratic Party knows what we all know the Clinton brand is over. It's damaged. The Clintons have outlived their usefulness and the usefulness of the party is nil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, it's safe to throw them under the bus. Safe to look away. Safe to say that he should have been canned when he was found out about Lewenski. So, enough with all the glowing praise of Gillibrand for her brave stand and the Democratic truth tellers who are now coming around to acknowledging Bill's past. They were opportunists then and they are opportunists now. And that's the Angle. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now from Van Buren, Arkansas is Juanita Broaddrick, who accuses Bill Clinton of raping her in a hotel room in 1978, and from Little Rock, Arkansas, Paula Jones, who sued Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. He settled with her for $850,000. Paula and Juanita, it is great to see both of you. I'm just delighted that both of you are here and Paula, I want to start with you.

So, they are both aberrations from the degree of the Republican Party, the party has always traditionally been at least in the modern area for less government, more freedom, you know, federalism, all those issues that animate Republican centered on the personal freedom, dignity, and right.

The truth of the matter is whatever may have happened in someone's life, hopefully by the time they get into public life they change and they basically hold a higher standard, which I think -- there's no charges that Roy Moore has ever done anything the last 35 years when he has been happily married, raised kids, been a very significant leader, and obviously the people of that state have an opportunity to pick someone who will represent their viewpoints. Bill Clinton hid the whole time and never stopped misbehaving. Monica Lewinski was late in his term, but he had always been a womanizer and he continued to be a womanizer immediately after he became president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think the difference between a Ronald Reagan who always held the office in the highest esteem and always basically felt the country was so important and that he had to be a model for the country and was, I think to a certain extent there is no comparison whatsoever.",

But, let's face it, the golden state has changed a lot over the past three decades. And a lot of that change, frankly, has been for the worse, and a lot of it has been caused by disastrous liberal policies. Taxes have gone up and up. Regulations have stifled small business creation. Illegal immigration has exploded here. Jerry Brown called California a sanctuary state. Electricity prices are climbing because of stupid government mandates. The mandatory $15 minimum wage is hurting low income workers because more retailers are now moving to automation to save the money. And we have seen a major squeeze on California's middle class as the number of working poor is growing. California's public pension systems are about $200 billion in the red. Oh, and while homelessness nationwide is declining, it's up here by three percent. By the way, sheltering and caring for the homeless cost taxpayers an estimated $80,000 per person per year. In fact, it's so bad that some of the major cities like San Francisco, Sacramento, and right here in the Los Angeles area now have what they call permanent tent cities or encampments.

      "utterance": "Let's face it, the reason Kirsten Gillibrand has suddenly found sense is that she is positioning herself for a 2020 presidential bid. She wants to run for higher office. And it's interesting by the way how she mentioned Lewenski but conveniently forgot about all the other women who accused Bill Clinton. Juanita Broderick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and yes, there were many others. When Gillibrand was running for office in 2006, whom did she call to help her raise money? Bill Clinton, of course. And she, like many Democratic women before her, had no problem at all turning a deaf ear to the complaints of sexual harassment that had dogged Clinton for decades. And you know why? Because, let's face it, he was an uber fundraiser. He was fantastic at it. But, with sex pigs now being called to account for their misdeeds in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, well, Democrats have suddenly discovered a moral conscience. And now they even see their former heroes with new eyes. Bill Clinton wasn't a degenerate when he appeared at every Democratic convention since he left office. And I guess, he wasn't a bad degenerate sexual harasser when he was feted in New York at the Clinton Foundation galas. He wasn't a sex pig last month when he campaigned for Phil Murphy in New Jersey. But now that his wife has lost the presidency and Bill is under new scrutiny, he is suddenly a leper to the party that enabled him for decades. Sell it somewhere else. None of us believe it. The truth is you have to question how seriously these Democratic women take sexual harassment. These are some of the same women who held a pep rally for Bill Clinton in 1998 after his impeachment. I love that photo. A Mount Olympus female Democrats were in attendance, Feinstein, Pelosi, Boxer, McColski (ph), all of them standing and clapping like a bunch of seals for Bill Clinton. The only thing was the fish. Now this new-found courage among Gillibrand and the rest is a little more than political expediency. The Democratic Party knows what we all know the Clinton brand is over. It's damaged. The Clintons have outlived their usefulness and the usefulness of the party is nil. So, it's safe to throw them under the bus. Safe to look away. Safe to say that he should have been canned when he was found out about Lewenski. So, enough with all the glowing praise of Gillibrand for her brave stand and the Democratic truth tellers who are now coming around to acknowledging Bill's past. They were opportunists then and they are opportunists now. And that's the Angle. Joining us now from Van Buren, Arkansas is Juanita Broaddrick, who accuses Bill Clinton of raping her in a hotel room in 1978, and from Little Rock, Arkansas, Paula Jones, who sued Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. He settled with her for $850,000. Paula and Juanita, it is great to see both of you. I'm just delighted that both of you are here and Paula, I want to start with you. What went through your mind when you heard Kirsten Gillibrand today and basically, Mica Brezinsky on MSNBC both saying that Bill Clinton should have resigned after the Lewenski affair."

This is what Josh Barrow of Business Insider titled his piece today, \"The Clintons held the Democratic Party hostage for two decades.\" Going on to write inside, \"The core problem is that the Democrats decided the Clintons were their people and then reasoned backward to their principles.\" So, I have a question. Is it fair to argue that the GOP treated the Bushes the same way? And that President Trump has wrestled the party back to its Reagan roots? Joining us now from Washington is Ronald Reagan biographer extraordinaire, Craig Shirley, and from Austin, Texas, Mark Updegrove, he is the author of the new book, \"The Last Republicans Inside the Extraordinary Relationship Between George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.\" It's great to see both of you. Let's start with you, Craig, on this question of the legacy of the Bushes and the -- obviously the Bushes didn't have their sexual scandals other than, I guess, the groping from the wheelchair rumor that we're hearing now. But they didn't have their sexual scandals, but nevertheless there is clearly a break that has happened for the most part from the Bushes to the current Republican Party. Talk about that."
    },

      "speaker": "CRAIG SHIRLEY, RONALD REAGAN BIOGRAPHER",
      "utterance": "The Bushes were always, Laura, an aberration to some degree. Look, George H.W. Bush was only president because he was Ronald Reagan's vice president for two terms. And in fact, a New York Times poll in 1988 after he beat Michael Dukakis said a majority of Americans voted for him because they saw him as a continuation of the Reagan legacy. Obviously, he didn't continue that and he pursued basically big government Republicanism as did his son George W. Bush. So, they are both aberrations from the degree of the Republican Party, the party has always traditionally been at least in the modern area for less government, more freedom, you know, federalism, all those issues that animate Republican centered on the personal freedom, dignity, and right. So, it was kind of a natural exorcism that had to happen because they both ended up perceived as failed presidencies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And, Mark, George W. Bush, whom I like very much personally, he left office with an abysmal approval rating. It was in the mid 20's by most accounts. The nation had turned against pretty much both wars in the Middle East. We had the mass economic collapse. He tried to push through immigration amnesty that went down in flames. Harriet Myers, his Supreme Court had to pull that back. We lost the House, the Senate and the presidency to Barack H. Obama. In your book, you kind of make this argument that the Bushes are the real Republicans, and they are worried that Trump will be the last Republican because he is not really Republican. I find that analysis curious given the carnage post-Bush to the Republican Party. MARK UPDEGROVE, AUTHOR, \"THE LAST REPUBLICANS\": Well, I want to make clear that when I called them the last Republicans that's really a type of establishment Republicanism that the Republican electorate clearly rejected in the 2016 campaign cycle, to the surprise of everybody. I think to a large extent the Republican Party wanted to protect the establishment in the beginning of the cycle. They resisted the candidacy of Donald Trump. He won the nomination fair and square and went on to win the presidency. So, there is no disputing that, but it is the end of a kind of Republicanism where America was more engaged in the world."

I mean, he has been around and he wants to engage with the rest of the world. He just doesn't want us to be involved in endless wars which in part helped elect Barack Obama. The idea he is some isolationist, that's ridiculous. That is a Bush line that he is an isolationist, he is a protectionist, he is a nativist. Those old tropes aren't working anymore, Mark.

He was -- he started out as -- became enlightenment believing the man was more important than the state. And that statement about the state's creating the federal government, that's right out of the federalist papers. It's right out of Madison which he avidly read. He was an American conservative.

Ed, I wish you were here. Kelly, I wish you were here. It's so beautiful. I know, but I hopped into Air Force One. Come on, Rollins, how many cigars did he smoke in that Air Force One back there? ED ROLLINS, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR REAGAN-BUSH 84: I rode on that plane every place he went domestically for about five years.

In a way it's not a laughing matter, but when I hear people talking about disgracing the Senate, I think of Ted Kennedy. I mean, this is the guy that basically killed a woman, and they are talking about disgracing the Senate? It's really kind of incredible, isn't it, that now they are worried about disgracing the Senate."

Mika Brzezinski apparently called Bill Clinton a predator today. How many times has Bill Clinton been on \"Morning Joe\"?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROLLINS",
      "utterance": "None of them called him a predator, none of them basically raised the issues of the two women that were on before. The bottom line is Hillary Clinton went on \"60 Minutes\" and talked about Gennifer Flowers, called her a liar, told it was totally untrue. That had been an affair that had gone on for 12 years which he later admitted. I mean, he basically didn't stop. The truth of the matter is whatever may have happened in someone's life, hopefully by the time they get into public life they change and they basically hold a higher standard, which I think -- there's no charges that Roy Moore has ever done anything the last 35 years when he has been happily married, raised kids, been a very significant leader, and obviously the people of that state have an opportunity to pick someone who will represent their viewpoints. Bill Clinton hid the whole time and never stopped misbehaving. Monica Lewinski was late in his term, but he had always been a womanizer and he continued to be a womanizer immediately after he became president. And I think the difference between a Ronald Reagan who always held the office in the highest esteem and always basically felt the country was so important and that he had to be a model for the country and was, I think to a certain extent there is no comparison whatsoever."

I really think there is not really a lot the GOP can do because the only thing they are suggesting is a write- in campaign for someone like, say, Luther Strange. People are even talking about Jeff Sessions. But it's clear that that will hand Doug Jones the victory. And it's a tough situation. Of course I'm sure Roy Moore wished these allegations had come out sooner, but they are coming out now. And there is not a lot, I think, the GOP can do. I kind of wonder, Ed made a great point. These allegations, almost all are from about 40 years ago. I wonder, what if he had come out and said, hey, I did this stuff 40 years ago, it was wrong. Since then I have gotten married. I'm a religious man and I no longer act that way. What would people be saying then if he had come out and basically apologized? I think it would be a lot different."

      "speaker": "ROLLINS",
      "utterance": "No. I think he just moves on. I think the governor today put it very appropriately. She believes the women -- not disbelieve the women, but she basically said Roy Moore is the one who is going to be good for the state. If he gets elected he's going to go there and he's going to vote for Supreme Court justices that basically make a difference. Federal judges, he is basically going to be a pro-life candidate which is very important in an evangelical state, and he will represent the values of the state much better than certainly Bill Clinton's U.S. attorney."

And California seems to have it all. I first came here 30 years ago as a college student and thought, wow, people actually live like this? This is paradise. But, let's face it, the golden state has changed a lot over the past three decades. And a lot of that change, frankly, has been for the worse, and a lot of it has been caused by disastrous liberal policies. Taxes have gone up and up. Regulations have stifled small business creation. Illegal immigration has exploded here. Jerry Brown called California a sanctuary state. Electricity prices are climbing because of stupid government mandates. The mandatory $15 minimum wage is hurting low income workers because more retailers are now moving to automation to save the money. And we have seen a major squeeze on California's middle class as the number of working poor is growing. California's public pension systems are about $200 billion in the red. Oh, and while homelessness nationwide is declining, it's up here by three percent. By the way, sheltering and caring for the homeless cost taxpayers an estimated $80,000 per person per year. In fact, it's so bad that some of the major cities like San Francisco, Sacramento, and right here in the Los Angeles area now have what they call permanent tent cities or encampments. It's all the homeless. Like this one that popped up not far from some of the wealthiest zip codes in the country."

Of course, the sanctuary status, high taxation, crippling environmental regulations -- liberalism has ruined a once idyllic state in many ways. There is exodus out of California, and while the population continues to reelect wave after wave of liberal leaders that only compound the state's crisis. Joining us now with reaction from Los Angeles is Shirley Husar who is the CEO of urban game changers an urban community activist group along with Clay Cane, a Democratic activist. Clay and Shirley, great to see both of you. Clay, let's start with you, why is this working, Democratic policies in Los Angeles? Just focus on L.A. for a moment.

But I think it really minimizes the story to just look at just Democrats. When you look back at this, this goes back to the early 1980s. It's a very complicated issue. You have drug addiction that was never dealt with. To say that oh, this is just a Democratic issue would be like blaming a state like Mississippi, which is the poorest state in the country on Republican or Republicans because it's a red state. I think it's unfair to do, and it minimizes the true horror people go through who are homeless. I can relate to this."

They come here. They try to get jobs. Sometimes they can't find jobs, and they don't have any sponsors or families to live with, and so they live among the homeless. That is also a big problem for the state of California. And you have spent an enormous amount of time in these permanent encampments."

They have personally instructed the police officers not to enforce law, to allow the illegal immigrants to do so much to cause so much damage and the homelessness. We have money in this state. We are talking about this state -- you can't compare this to Mississippi. Come on, Clay, let's get real. California, at one point we were the fifth largest economy in the world. We are still in the top 10. You have a state in the top 10 of the economy."

We have Legionnaires' disease that just happened over at Disneyland. We just had San Diego that spent $2 million towards sanitation of the homelessness. The homelessness in California is disruptive because of the illegal immigration and the misappropriation of movement of money within the state. Democrats have failed this state and they continue to fail this state. They are destructive with their governmental programs that filtrate within their pockets that have killed our economy."

So it's not just Democrats. I mean, that was somebody that you actually worked for. And there has been no documentation, no proof that anybody is homeless because of undocumented workers. I wasn't homeless because of undocumented workers. I was homeless because of rents were too high. My mother didn't have access to good healthcare. My mother didn't have access to good education. It was not for undocumented workers. And for you to say that is scapegoating. And you know there is no one who is homeless because of an undocumented worker. That is ridiculous."
