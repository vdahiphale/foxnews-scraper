That's how it worked up they are. And honestly you can't blame them.

Because tonight, the Mexican government -- you just saw it on the tape -- appears to be losing its war with the Sinaloa Cartel. Recently, the government of Mexico captured a man called Ovidio Guzman Lopez. He is the son of imprisoned drug lord, El Chapo. In response to his capture, the Sinaloa Cartel unleashed so much violence -- again, the tape showed it -- that the Mexican government caved and released El Chapo's son. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, that's shocking by American standards, but in Mexico, it's routine. Last year, the country of Mexico recorded 33,000 murders. That's almost double the number of murders we recorded here in this country. But Mexico has one third as many people as we do. To put it in some perspective. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This year, they may break their own murder record.

They claim to fear the resurgence of ISIS. Some of the people we played a tape of earlier will tell you ISIS is very scary. They're a massive threat along with Iran, but they don't seem to care at all about the Sinaloa Cartel, right on our southern border. Now ISIS is awful, of course, and in theory, they might kill Americans in terror attacks. But the Sinaloa Cartel is currently right now killing thousands of Americans every year. How? What's the single biggest smuggler of fentanyl into the United States? Did you know that? Probably not. Because nobody talks about it. It's completely ignored in Washington. And that says everything about the priorities of both parties. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Today, Mitch McConnell released an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" denouncing the decision to withdraw troops from Syria. We can never leave Syria. It would be a quote, \"grave mistake\" to leave Syria, Mitch McConnell tells us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But for two years, when the Republican Party had complete control over Congress and the White House, McConnell and the rest of his party, the Republican leadership did nothing to secure our border, our actual border. If only the Kurds were battling a fentanyl epidemic, maybe then Washington would care about the real international crisis hurting Americans. Maybe then, Mitt Romney would consider the crisis in Mexico worthy of his attention. We invited Romney on the show tonight to talk about it, he declined, of course, he declined. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Derek Maltz is a former head of the D.E.A.

Just today, Hillary accused Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of being one of those agents working for Vladimir Putin. Gabbard immediately hit back with a devastating response. Congresswoman Gabbard will join us in just a few minutes. But for most people in Washington, the biggest issue remains Syria, a country that paradoxically very few of them could find on a map.

The poem on the Statue of Liberty commands us -- commands us -- to maintain Syrian territorial integrity. In fact, it's so important we must send troops there immediately to secure that border. This week, an overwhelming majority of both parties, Republican and Democrat, voted to condemn the withdrawal of American troops in Northern Syria.

We share nearly 2,000 miles of border with Mexico. So you'd think our leaders would pay attention to what's going on there? They don't. If they did, though, they'd be worried. Because tonight, the Mexican government -- you just saw it on the tape -- appears to be losing its war with the Sinaloa Cartel. Recently, the government of Mexico captured a man called Ovidio Guzman Lopez. He is the son of imprisoned drug lord, El Chapo. In response to his capture, the Sinaloa Cartel unleashed so much violence -- again, the tape showed it -- that the Mexican government caved and released El Chapo's son. Now, that's shocking by American standards, but in Mexico, it's routine. Last year, the country of Mexico recorded 33,000 murders. That's almost double the number of murders we recorded here in this country. But Mexico has one third as many people as we do. To put it in some perspective. This year, they may break their own murder record. You never know any of this by watching American media. Mostly, our press does not cover Mexico, except in the most caricature terms. Our leaders wring their hands about the Syrian-Turkish border but ignore a failed state right next to Texas, Arizona and California. They claim to fear the resurgence of ISIS. Some of the people we played a tape of earlier will tell you ISIS is very scary. They're a massive threat along with Iran, but they don't seem to care at all about the Sinaloa Cartel, right on our southern border. Now ISIS is awful, of course, and in theory, they might kill Americans in terror attacks. But the Sinaloa Cartel is currently right now killing thousands of Americans every year. How? What's the single biggest smuggler of fentanyl into the United States? Did you know that? Probably not. Because nobody talks about it. It's completely ignored in Washington. And that says everything about the priorities of both parties. Today, Mitch McConnell released an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" denouncing the decision to withdraw troops from Syria. We can never leave Syria. It would be a quote, \"grave mistake\" to leave Syria, Mitch McConnell tells us. But for two years, when the Republican Party had complete control over Congress and the White House, McConnell and the rest of his party, the Republican leadership did nothing to secure our border, our actual border. If only the Kurds were battling a fentanyl epidemic, maybe then Washington would care about the real international crisis hurting Americans. Maybe then, Mitt Romney would consider the crisis in Mexico worthy of his attention. We invited Romney on the show tonight to talk about it, he declined, of course, he declined. Derek Maltz is a former head of the D.E.A. Special Operations Division. He joins us tonight. Derek, thanks so much for coming on."

Mitch McConnell should worry more about America and the safety and security of our people. Look what's happening to 32,000 people last year who died from fentanyl and a video is one of the guys pushing that poison into America. That's what matters. Okay. That's the priority, but they can't focus. They don't know how to focus when we have this problem on our border and the poor people in Texas, Arizona, California, but it's all over America, Tucker. These cartels are a multibillion dollar enterprise and they are taking over that country and shame on the Mexican government. And by the way, Tucker, where was SEMAR? SEMAR is the Mexican elite Navy force stepped took down Chapo and killed a lot of high value targets. They were on the bench, it is so dangerous out there they had this bad operation. They didn't plan it properly. They didn't coordinate properly. The U.S. agencies really didn't coordinate properly. It's a total mess and it's an embarrassment to the country."

Again, if you look at just the drug crisis alone, 68,000 people died in America last year. That's more than all these different wars and all these conflicts, and we're not doing anything about it. We're not taking a sense of urgency. We don't have a really good strategy. We're not educating the kids about the dangers of these chemicals coming from China, by the way. What people are not talking about, Tucker is the Chinese organized crime and the Mexican cartels have formed an alliance that we've never seen in our entire history of this country. And China is not a big fan of America, right? They are a communist country. They are looking to destroy this country, but yet we're sleeping and worried about troops coming out of Syria.

In fact, I looked carefully at this footage, and I was shocked to see some of these mercenaries working for the drug cartels carrying squad automatic weapons. This is weaponry you would only find in the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps. They completely outgun the opposition. So there's no question that this is a very powerful force. This force reaches into the United States. They have tentacles that reach into the communities in Los Angeles and Chicago, in Baltimore, in Phoenix, Arizona. The kind of violence we're seeing right now in Mexico could inevitably explode in this country unless we close and secure the border and begin to rebuild the rule of law in the United States. Now, why is no one interested? Well, the Chamber of Commerce isn't lobbying very hard and no one is making any money from defending the United States.

Keep in mind this is the very same Nick Merrill who warned Ronan Farrow not to expose Harvey Weinstein's sex crimes. So consider that for context.

And because I'm calling for an end to this new Cold War and nuclear arms race, that I am a Russian asset and that I am a traitor to the nation that I love. And Not only are they saying that about me, they are basically saying -- sending this message out to every veteran in this country, every Service Member, every American, anyone watching at home who was fighting for peace and who was calling for an end to these regime change wars, this new Cold War and arms race, they are saying that you are also a Russian asset and that you are also a traitor to this country.

Thousands of my brothers and sisters in uniform were killed in Iraq, a war that she championed. Their blood is on her hands. I am calling for an end to these regime change wars.

It's because I'm standing up and speaking out strongly against the Hillary Clinton legacy - the warmongering legacy of waging these regimes change wars, continuing to escalate these tensions between the United States, nuclear armed countries like Russia and China, this nuclear arms race bringing more profits to the military industrial complex. As President, I will end these counterproductive policies. These regime change wars, this new Cold War and arms race and redirect our taxpayer dollars back towards serving the needs of our people right here at home.

Or supporting me and my candidacy, the leadership that I seek to bring as a Democrat to take our Democratic Party, so it is a party of by and for the people, a party that's fighting for peace, fighting for the people, fighting to protect our planet, and to lead our country forward, to bring people together around our unifying principles and freedoms and who we are as Americans."

And then I looked at her approval numbers, and she isn't even at 40 percent in the RealClearPolitics Index and polls, and look if you were to teach a class, right, and you're putting together your syllabus, a journalism class on media bias, I would put that side-by-side comparison day one, minute one to get my students' attention, because that just says it all. And look, we've seen this movie before and I think you may remember this, also, I think it was in 2012. A \"Daily Caller\" reporter is in the Rose Garden and he interrupted President Obama to ask a question, and he was called a heckler and a hack. And now you see journalists interrupting the President on a routine basis whenever he is with world leaders or at the Rose Garden screaming questions at him and they're called heroic and seekers of truth.

And I remember the 2016 election, this is a great poll that came out and this basically encapsulates it all. It was, according to Suffolk University and \"USA Today,\" right before the election by nearly a ten to one margin, respondents said the media was rooting for Hillary Clinton. In other words, this is very apparent to people at home in terms of who is taking sides in these sort of situations.

So, one, they became friends when they were both in power. Two, Trudeau obviously thinks that your former President has a lot of sway in Canada. I think most Canadians are looking at this and saying, as you said in your outline, you know, this guy, our Prime Minister, running for reelection, not only has countless breaches of ethics against him, had the blackface pictures, he doesn't know how many. He has a reporter who accused him and he agreed it was sexual harassment, so he is in serious trouble. Why have Obama do it? And more importantly, why would Obama do it?
