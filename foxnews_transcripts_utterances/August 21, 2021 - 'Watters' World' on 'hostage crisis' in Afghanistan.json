Biden has done a good job of it. He hid when he was in the Senate. He hid his VP. He hid during the campaign because of COVID. But when he became President, he wasn't able to hide anymore, and look what happened. First he killed vaccine confidence with the J&J pause, look at the chart. Falls right off a cliff. Then he killed the border, and now Afghanistan. We saw it coming. The guy botched the Iraq withdrawal, led ISIS takeover. His administration stranded Americans in Benghazi, remember that, left them for dead. Now, Joe Biden has stranded thousands of Americans in a warzone behind enemy lines, and the only way out is the airport, which is surrounded by the enemy, an enemy that's committing atrocities on live TV for the whole world to see. In July, the President claimed this wouldn't happen.",

      "sentences": "Wrong. Nearly 20 people have been killed by Taliban coming to the airport. The President has lost touch with reality. He gave a hard withdrawal date, September 11th, and he pulled out the troops before he pulled out Americans, Afghan partners, and all of our military gear. It is a massive mistake. And the minute he set a hard date in April with no conditions, the Taliban advance began. The next thing Biden did could cost him this presidency. Biden was briefed on the Taliban advance. He was warned the Afghan Army was deserting. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports in July, quote: \"The administration had been warned by its own officials on the ground that the Taliban's advance was imminent, and Afghanistan's military may be unable to stop it.\" \"An internal State Department memo last month warned top agencies officials of the potential collapse of Kabul, rapid territorial gains by the Taliban and subsequent collapse of the Afghan security forces and actually offered recommendations on ways to mitigate the crisis and speed up the evacuation,\" unquote. \"The New York Times,\" quote, \"Intelligence warned of Afghan military collapse despite Biden's assurances.\" Classified assessments by American spy agencies over the summer painted an increasingly grim picture of the prospect of a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, and warned of the rapid collapse of the Afghan military, even as President Biden and his advisors said publicly that that was unlikely to happen as quickly, according to all these people. So, Biden was briefed on the collapse of the Afghan Army and a quick Taliban takeover, and he did nothing about it. In fact, he went on TV and lied to us saying the Afghan Army could hold and a quick Taliban takeover was unlikely. He pulled air support, he pulled ground support, and watch the Afghan Army get bribed and surrender. Now, we're stuck with the Taliban as our travel agents. \"Hey, Muhammad, can you get me to the airport? Oh, that'll be 20K. Okay.\" So the question is this, did the Commander-in-Chief lie to the American people, strand thousands of Americans behind enemy lines, and abandoned billions of dollars of lethal military equipment, just to get a political photo op to pull out on the 20th anniversary of 9/11? Republicans, when they take back the House, they're going to have to decide, is this an impeachable offense? This Afghan hostage crisis is going to dominate the news cycle until every single American is safely evacuated. This was the man that was supposed to be an experienced Washington guy. He knew how to pull the levers of power, listen to his Intel people, hug our alliances, and in one single weekend, it's all shattered. Who's going to trust Joe now? Oh, Joe is going to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in America? He just armed the Taliban. Oh, Joe, you're going to ask for billions for the Green New Deal? Really? How did the billions work out training that Afghan Army? Let's take a look at the Afghan Army training. What a colossal waste of money. Last couple months, we heard about the threat from MAGA grandmas, remember? The threat of white supremacy here? No. We missed the real threats. Pay attention. Imagine having 20 years to plan for something and screwing it up this badly? The Pentagon priorities are shot. Biden and the State Department lost. Iran continues to nuke up, Russia may move on Ukraine, and China just held sole exercises near Taiwan. When are we going to get that lab leak report anyway? Are they just going to bury that, too? The president just asked OPEC to increase oil production because of these high gas prices here. OPEC said no, Joe. The President just asked Putin for Central Asian basing rights to keep an eye on the Taliban, Putin said, no, Joe. During the ABC interview, Biden couldn't remember where his late son served and forgot we still had forces in Syria. He thinks his Afghan exit couldn't have gone any better. Something is not right with this President. He didn't speak to a single NATO ally when he was bungling the withdrawal. Our allies are furious. The President isn't feared or respected. Democrats here at home, silent, they won't defend him. The Biden presidency is teetering on the brink of collapse. A prolonged hostage crisis in Afghanistan will bleed them dry. If U.S. soldiers take casualties defending the airport, or if the Taliban kills an American civilian, it's over for Joe Biden. This is a fluid situation with serious consequences for this administration and for the homeland. And as always, WATTERS' WORLD will bring you the truth. Joining me now, host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" and author of the new book \"The Long Slide,\" Tucker Carlson and we'll get to the book in a second, but Tucker, I think it's clear we're watching the slow collapse of the Biden presidency. He cannot function as a Commander-in-Chief, but we're also witnessing I believe the collapse of the smart set that after 20 years, very well-groomed politicians and diplomats, what have they given us besides humiliation, a hostage crisis, and a bill for about a trillion dollars?",

I mean, these are the products of a very specific system in place since the Second World War to find the smartest people in America and bring them up through these various institutions, and put them in charge of everything. It's what we used to call the meritocracy, and they have all the merit badges and they went to Princeton, and they were McKinsey consultants. The National Security Adviser was a Rhodes Scholar. You know, if they were writers, they would get the Pulitzer Prize with \"The New York Times\" bestseller list, like they've done everything that the system asked. They've collected all these merit badges, and they're horrible, like they have no idea what they're doing, and the results prove it.

Biden has done a good job of it. He hid when he was in the Senate. He hid his VP. He hid during the campaign because of COVID. But when he became President, he wasn't able to hide anymore, and look what happened. First he killed vaccine confidence with the J&J pause, look at the chart. Falls right off a cliff. Then he killed the border, and now Afghanistan. We saw it coming. The guy botched the Iraq withdrawal, led ISIS takeover. His administration stranded Americans in Benghazi, remember that, left them for dead. Now, Joe Biden has stranded thousands of Americans in a warzone behind enemy lines, and the only way out is the airport, which is surrounded by the enemy, an enemy that's committing atrocities on live TV for the whole world to see. In July, the President claimed this wouldn't happen."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Wrong. Nearly 20 people have been killed by Taliban coming to the airport. The President has lost touch with reality. He gave a hard withdrawal date, September 11th, and he pulled out the troops before he pulled out Americans, Afghan partners, and all of our military gear. It is a massive mistake. And the minute he set a hard date in April with no conditions, the Taliban advance began. The next thing Biden did could cost him this presidency. Biden was briefed on the Taliban advance. He was warned the Afghan Army was deserting. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports in July, quote: \"The administration had been warned by its own officials on the ground that the Taliban's advance was imminent, and Afghanistan's military may be unable to stop it.\" \"An internal State Department memo last month warned top agencies officials of the potential collapse of Kabul, rapid territorial gains by the Taliban and subsequent collapse of the Afghan security forces and actually offered recommendations on ways to mitigate the crisis and speed up the evacuation,\" unquote. \"The New York Times,\" quote, \"Intelligence warned of Afghan military collapse despite Biden's assurances.\" Classified assessments by American spy agencies over the summer painted an increasingly grim picture of the prospect of a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, and warned of the rapid collapse of the Afghan military, even as President Biden and his advisors said publicly that that was unlikely to happen as quickly, according to all these people. So, Biden was briefed on the collapse of the Afghan Army and a quick Taliban takeover, and he did nothing about it. In fact, he went on TV and lied to us saying the Afghan Army could hold and a quick Taliban takeover was unlikely. He pulled air support, he pulled ground support, and watch the Afghan Army get bribed and surrender. Now, we're stuck with the Taliban as our travel agents. \"Hey, Muhammad, can you get me to the airport? Oh, that'll be 20K. Okay.\" So the question is this, did the Commander-in-Chief lie to the American people, strand thousands of Americans behind enemy lines, and abandoned billions of dollars of lethal military equipment, just to get a political photo op to pull out on the 20th anniversary of 9/11? Republicans, when they take back the House, they're going to have to decide, is this an impeachable offense? This Afghan hostage crisis is going to dominate the news cycle until every single American is safely evacuated. This was the man that was supposed to be an experienced Washington guy. He knew how to pull the levers of power, listen to his Intel people, hug our alliances, and in one single weekend, it's all shattered. Who's going to trust Joe now? Oh, Joe is going to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in America? He just armed the Taliban. Oh, Joe, you're going to ask for billions for the Green New Deal? Really? How did the billions work out training that Afghan Army? Let's take a look at the Afghan Army training. What a colossal waste of money. Last couple months, we heard about the threat from MAGA grandmas, remember? The threat of white supremacy here? No. We missed the real threats. Pay attention. Imagine having 20 years to plan for something and screwing it up this badly? The Pentagon priorities are shot. Biden and the State Department lost. Iran continues to nuke up, Russia may move on Ukraine, and China just held sole exercises near Taiwan. When are we going to get that lab leak report anyway? Are they just going to bury that, too? The president just asked OPEC to increase oil production because of these high gas prices here. OPEC said no, Joe. The President just asked Putin for Central Asian basing rights to keep an eye on the Taliban, Putin said, no, Joe. During the ABC interview, Biden couldn't remember where his late son served and forgot we still had forces in Syria. He thinks his Afghan exit couldn't have gone any better. Something is not right with this President. He didn't speak to a single NATO ally when he was bungling the withdrawal. Our allies are furious. The President isn't feared or respected. Democrats here at home, silent, they won't defend him. The Biden presidency is teetering on the brink of collapse. A prolonged hostage crisis in Afghanistan will bleed them dry. If U.S. soldiers take casualties defending the airport, or if the Taliban kills an American civilian, it's over for Joe Biden. This is a fluid situation with serious consequences for this administration and for the homeland. And as always, WATTERS' WORLD will bring you the truth. Joining me now, host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" and author of the new book \"The Long Slide,\" Tucker Carlson and we'll get to the book in a second, but Tucker, I think it's clear we're watching the slow collapse of the Biden presidency. He cannot function as a Commander-in-Chief, but we're also witnessing I believe the collapse of the smart set that after 20 years, very well-groomed politicians and diplomats, what have they given us besides humiliation, a hostage crisis, and a bill for about a trillion dollars?"

It's not just that they are self- righteous buffoons, obviously, that's true, too. It is, they are not competent, and the sad and scary thing to think about is these really are the best we produce. I mean, these are the products of a very specific system in place since the Second World War to find the smartest people in America and bring them up through these various institutions, and put them in charge of everything. It's what we used to call the meritocracy, and they have all the merit badges and they went to Princeton, and they were McKinsey consultants. The National Security Adviser was a Rhodes Scholar. You know, if they were writers, they would get the Pulitzer Prize with \"The New York Times\" bestseller list, like they've done everything that the system asked. They've collected all these merit badges, and they're horrible, like they have no idea what they're doing, and the results prove it.

I had the best time ever, really enjoyed Sharpton's company very much. Hard to imagine any of this now. \"Esquire\" would never print a story by me, I could never go anywhere with Al Sharpton. Al Sharpton probably will never talk to me now. But that was a time in America where people's politics weren't the most important thing about them. You could talk to them about other things and appreciate people as people. You know, not everything was ideological, and that's kind of what we've lost. I realized this in reading these pieces through again, that I couldn't write most of them now, just because the people I covered wouldn't talk to me now because politics are all that matters.

Catch me in Long Beach Island, New Jersey on August 31st. I'll sign your book. Take a picture. You get tickets at the LBI book swap. I might even let you touch me. That's all for tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" is next and remember, I'm Watters and this is my world.
