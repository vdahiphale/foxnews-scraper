At least five people have died. That number may go up dramatically as we get details. Now that same storm is headed up the East Coast of the United States. We're monitoring its progress and we'll keep you updated throughout the hour, of course. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first tonight, tragedies have a way of revealing who people really are. The decent ones rise to the moment, hard as it is. They bring clarity and comfort and solutions. The low ones, by contrast, see sadness as a business opportunity. They're happy to leverage the suffering of others, in order to increase their own power. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Ghouls goals like that thrive in the aftermath of mass shootings like the one we've recently seen in El Paso, Dayton and now Odessa, Texas. Beto O'Rourke, for example, wasted not a single moment for rushing onto a television set and sneering at other people's prayers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

For just 30 bucks, you can buy a \"This is so F'ed up\" t-shirt direct from Beto's campaign. The shirt actually spells out the word, so all your 19-year-old buddies in Brooklyn will know you're as cool as Beto is, wear your Wayfarers when you wear it. Don't forget not to shave. But Beto is not stopping there with t-shirts and profanity. He has got ideas on how to stop mass shootings. They begin in end with banning guns. Will it work? Well, we don't have to guess, we know the answer, because we've tried it before under Bill Clinton. Remember, the assault weapons ban that was in place for 10 years? It had precisely zero effect on rates of violence in this country. It's not an opinion. It's not a defense to the Second Amendment. It's a fact. It's been studied extensively, including by the Clinton administration. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Beto hasn't read those studies though.

So this is something we've been talking about for quite some time. Assess the specifics before we get to the general.

Last year, you'll remember when a jury failed to convict the illegal immigrant, Jose Garcia-Zarate of murder or even manslaughter for shooting her to death on a pier in San Francisco. Now Federal judges are doing their part to inflict even more pain on Steinle's family and to make a mockery of our laws. Just on Friday, a California appeals court threw out Garcia-Zarate's only conviction that was for being a felon in possession illegally of a firearm. Now, he is a felon, and he was carrying a firearm. Nobody disputes that. Instead, the court found a legal technicality throughout the conviction. So for now, Garcia-Zarate is still in Federal custody on criminal charges, but that charge has been thrown out. We've learned a lot about the priorities of the ruling class in this case. Jose Garcia-Zarate was deported from this country five separate times. He was a convicted felon. He had been arrested multiple times on drug charges, including just months before he murdered Kate Steinle. And when those charges were dropped, he was simply released. Instead of being kicked out of the country, again, deported five times. So Kate Steinle's death never should have happened. We knew that. But it did happen because powerful people in this country won't tolerate even dangerous criminals being kept out of this country. They are so extreme and they've become this way. They weren't always this way, but they've become so extreme on the left that not only are they unwilling to stop a murderer, they're unwilling to punish him after he has been caught. That can't continue. Meanwhile, in a related story back here to the nation's capital, authorities in Montgomery County, Maryland, right outside the D.C. line, have arrested yet another illegal immigrant for another violent sex crime against another child. Emilio Carrasco-Hernandez is an illegal arrival from the country of Honduras. According to police, he sexually assaulted his 15-year-old stepdaughter. Carrasco-Hernandez is the seventh illegal immigrant arrested for a sex crime in Montgomery County, just since July 25th. Vince Coglianese has followed these stories closer than maybe anyone else in the region. He is a D.C. radio host with WMAL Radio and he joins us tonight. Vince, thanks a lot for coming on.",

Deport all illegal immigrants?\" And my response to him was really simple, if you don't like the laws of this country, work to change them, but in the meantime, enforce them and that's not what they're doing in Montgomery County. And in fact, in late July, he passed an Executive Order codifying -- well, he was already heading in this direction in that county -- saying, if you're a county official, you are not allowed to inquire about immigration status. You are not allowed to allow Federal agents into jails in Montgomery County. The Feds have to stand outside and catch these guys, when they're coming out of the jail. Actually, it makes it a more unsafe environment to have this -- to have somebody ejected into the public and then caught by the Feds, rather than a peaceful prisoner transfer. The Feds have probable cause to make these arrests. They're issuing detainers because they've already done the research into establishing this is somebody we believe to be illegally in the country. Montgomery County is saying, \"We're not going to work with you.\" I'll tell you, we have one story that I was so stunned by. I was talking to one source that said inside of these jails, they've gotten calls from Feds who say, \"That guy is MS-13, do not release him.\" And then they release them.

      "sentences": "Purdue Pharma is the company that makes OxyContin, the powerful opioid painkiller and basically just OxyContin. When the company released that drug, they claimed that it would be less addictive than other opioid medications. That was a lie. At some point, Purdue Pharma knew it was a lie, but they kept telling it and multitudes died as a result. OxyContin turns out to be terrifyingly addictive, it has helped drive a drug epidemic in this country that has killed more Americans than any conflict since the Second World War. We now know that Purdue Pharma understood exactly what they were doing. Recent legal filings have exposed internal communications within the company, and they showed that the company's sales staff were pressured to sell as many pills as they could without regard to the risk. Physicians were urged to prescribe the highest possible doses of the drug in order to maximize profits. When evidence emerged that people are becoming junkies as a result, Purdue Pharma responded by shaming the patients they had hooked on their drug. They called them \"degenerate criminals\" essentially or refusing to take any responsibility at all for the human carnage they caused. It's hard to imagine an uglier story. Throughout all of it, we should note, Purdue Pharma's owners, the Sackler family grew spectacularly rich -- looking back, repulsively rich. Earlier this year, the Sacklers were estimated to have more than $12 billion in the bank. Thanks to the opioid epidemic, the Sackler family is now one of the 20 richest families in this country. In the last three years, Purdue Pharma has faced a wave of lawsuits from the people and places devastated by its pills. Now, apparently the company has made a settlement offer. To resolve all of these outstanding lawsuits, Purdue Pharma is willing to pay $12 billion, $3 billion of that would come from the Sackler family, which would then give up control of Purdue Pharma. It sounds like a lot of money, but let's put it into some perspective. The massive tobacco settlement of 1998 totaled about $206 billion. But no one would defend cigarette smoking. Over time, it will kill you. But Marlboros don't cut down young people in their prime. Smoking doesn't turn teenagers into zombies. It hasn't destroyed entire towns throughout the Midwest and New England. The Sacklers are hoping to get off with just six percent of what the tobacco companies paid more than 20 years ago. That feels wrong. But it's easy to see why the Sacklers are for it. According to Bloomberg, the Sacklers would retain at least a billion and a half dollars after the settlement. Is that justice? No, it's not. But unfortunately, it's a now familiar pattern in American life. A ruling class gets incredibly rich by wrecking our country, in this case by killing many thousands of young people. They get caught doing it, details emerge, everyone in Washington, New York and Los Angeles spends a week pretending to be horrified and concerned, and then nothing happens. Not a single one of the perpetrators ever goes to jail. Nobody is ever really punished, we've seen it again and again, including in the financial crisis of 2008. In the end, and in this case, they take their blood money and they had the St. Bart's for Thanksgiving, and they laugh. They get away with it every single time. For once, it will be nice if people like the Sackler got what they deserve. It might make the rest of us a little less cynical. Well, you may not have heard her name before, but until a few days ago, Madeleine Westerhout was the personal assistant to President Trump. By all accounts, she worked hard and did well at her job. It's hard to find anyone in Washington who doesn't like her. And yet now, she is unemployed and humiliated. How did that happen? Well, she made the mistake of eating dinner with a \"Washington Post\" reporter called Phil Rucker. At the meal, Westerhout made a couple of caddy remarks about the President's daughters. That's unwise, but it's hardly without precedent. That sort of thing can happen at dinners where wine is served. What is stunning -- what is really unusual is what happened next. The meal was explicitly off-the-record and for journalists, that is a bright line. That's the brightest of all lines. Information journalists learn in off- the-record conversations absolutely cannot be shared. It's one of the few unbreakable rules of the business. Everybody in the business knows that. But because Madeleine Westerhout worked for Donald Trump, Phil Rucker of \"The Washington Post\" decided to break that rule -- casually break it. According to multiple sources, Phil Rucker decided to burn Westerhout and shared her remarks with others. Westerhout was immediately fired, and as we said, humiliated. Her life completely derailed. Rucker, meanwhile, returned to Washington, the hero. In fact, he was happily yapping away on MSNBC this afternoon. His bosses at \"The Washington Post\" issued a statement telling the rest of us what a great guy he is. Joe Concha writes about media for \"The Hill.\" He joins us tonight.

At least five people have died. That number may go up dramatically as we get details. Now that same storm is headed up the East Coast of the United States. We're monitoring its progress and we'll keep you updated throughout the hour, of course. But first tonight, tragedies have a way of revealing who people really are. The decent ones rise to the moment, hard as it is. They bring clarity and comfort and solutions. The low ones, by contrast, see sadness as a business opportunity. They're happy to leverage the suffering of others, in order to increase their own power. Ghouls goals like that thrive in the aftermath of mass shootings like the one we've recently seen in El Paso, Dayton and now Odessa, Texas. Beto O'Rourke, for example, wasted not a single moment for rushing onto a television set and sneering at other people's prayers."

If you're someone who finds that hip and appealing, well, you're in luck tonight. For just 30 bucks, you can buy a \"This is so F'ed up\" t-shirt direct from Beto's campaign. The shirt actually spells out the word, so all your 19-year-old buddies in Brooklyn will know you're as cool as Beto is, wear your Wayfarers when you wear it. Don't forget not to shave. But Beto is not stopping there with t-shirts and profanity. He has got ideas on how to stop mass shootings. They begin in end with banning guns. Will it work? Well, we don't have to guess, we know the answer, because we've tried it before under Bill Clinton. Remember, the assault weapons ban that was in place for 10 years? It had precisely zero effect on rates of violence in this country. It's not an opinion. It's not a defense to the Second Amendment. It's a fact. It's been studied extensively, including by the Clinton administration. Beto hasn't read those studies though. He is not interested in what they say. He is going to confiscate firearms from tens of millions of law- abiding Americans, whether it works or not, and he doesn't care what you think about it."

Americans didn't buy their guns from the government in the first place. They are not buying them back. This is gun confiscation. It's nothing but that. It's an attempt to eliminate a constitutional right that a ruling class finds inconvenient. It won't reduce gun violence. In fact, sending armed authorities door-to-door to seize people's lawfully owned weapons is itself a surefire recipe for causing violence. So if you cared about America, and the people who live here, you would not suggest that. But they don't hesitate. Bill de Blasio has endorsed forcible gun seizures, so has Elizabeth Warren. Over the weekend in Iowa, Joe Biden proposed banning not simply so-called assault weapons, but apparently every firearm capable of firing more than one round."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, mindless. That's the perfect word for what you just heard. Serious people don't talk like that. Mass shootings ought to be an alarm that awaken the rest of us to the emergency -- the real emergency -- unfolding at the center of our culture. Why is this happening? How did nihilism and violence and rage and loneliness become regular features of American life? Something is fundamentally wrong. What is it? And critically, is materialism, enough to fix it? Those are the metaphysical questions we ought to be thinking about deeply, seriously and debating every time some lunatic shoots up a public place, but that's not what we get. Instead, we get mediocrities like Beto and Elizabeth Warren screaming at rural America about how they're the problem and they need to give up their ancient rights or else. We deserve much better than that. We need much more than that. Ryan Cleckner is a firearms attorney and former Army Ranger and he joins us tonight. Ryan, thanks a lot for coming on. So this is something we've been talking about for quite some time. Assess the specifics before we get to the general. Joe Biden has said in the clip we just played, that any magazine that holds more than a single round, ought to be banned, and it's crazy not to. RYAN I'm hoping this is just another Joe Biden gaffe that he just has no idea what he is talking about. Because I don't know of a single magazine, Tucker, that doesn't hold more than one round of ammunition. If he means what he says, and he actually knows what he is talking about, then you're right, he is talking about banning every single gun out there that accepts the magazine."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

What would it look like for the government to take them away?"

I'm glad you said \"Take them away\" because Beto O'Rourke is saying he is going to buy them back like the government owned them in the first place, they have some right to buy them back. But what I hear when he says that is, \"I'm going to come door-to-door and take your guns from you, and I'm going to bring my guns because if you don't want to give them up, I'm going to use my guns to force them from you.\" We're talking mass scale police door-to-door. We're talking insane amounts of money. And you already said it. The assault weapon ban we had under the Clinton era not only did nothing to curb gun violence, we actually peaked. Our worst violence we had peaked during the middle of the Clinton assault weapons ban. This is going to do nothing to stop crime overall. It's going to do nothing to stop violence overall. I mean, look at Chicago, Tucker. We had more people shot in Chicago than we did in the horrible tragedy of Odessa. But yet we're not hearing everyone talk about that. Is it because people expect that there? Is it because people know that Chicago, \"Oh, that's just Chicago.\" Why should we care about people to live there, too? Why shouldn't we realize that none of those shootings had anything to do with a so-called, quote unquote, \"assault weapon\"? It's just sad."

I hope they're realizing that this is polling well and this is an emotional way for them to target people's heart strings, and that they can get talked about and here you and I are talking about them. I really hope that their ignorance is only going this far that they think it's popular.

I have to press you a little bit because it's not -- and Beta O'Rourke, obviously, is a footnote and a completely mediocre, irrelevant character. But it's not simply Beto. That's the tape that we played. Elizabeth Warren, who seems likely to be the nominee of the Democratic Party, much more likely than Joe Biden, in my opinion has also called for gun confiscation. So this is -- what you're calling for a Civil War. What you're calling for is an incitement to violence. It is something that I wouldn't want to live here when that happen, would you? I am serious."

I think that's a legitimate debate, but I don't think what you're saying is insane. What Elizabeth Warren is saying is that these kinds of firearms are now illegal. Anyone who possesses one is now a felon and we're taking them away."

Walmart said that they are no longer going to sell ammunition for handguns. No longer going to sell ammunition for assault rifles, and no longer going to allow people to carry guns openly in their stores. In the face of government inaction, businesses actually rising to the occasion, saying, you know what, we don't want to be part of this problem."

They ought to be ashamed of themselves, that company. But does it strike you as was interesting that the response from the ruling class is not to think through why this is happening, but to attack rural America, there's no -- there's no violent crime in most places where everyone owns a gun.

North Carolina mandatory evacuation of all barrier islands along the North Carolina coast and in South Carolina, they already reverse the flow on I-26 from Charleston all the way to Columbia. So every lane heading westbound, so that people can evacuate the coast of South Carolina, the Storm Dorian obviously doing its worst damage down in the Bahamas where it first hit is a Category 5 with 180 mile plus hour winds and 220 plus mile per hour gusts. And we've seen now aerial footage from the Bahamas -- excuse me -- which is just devastated. I mean that the destructive force of the storm cannot be underestimated, certainly, down there. It wiped out entire communities, buried many homes and businesses underwater. They are still suffering down there. We know that the Coast Guard made some runs down there today with the MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter. They were able to make some medical evacuations, help out the Bahamian forces who are trying now to get in there and get people, but we still are hearing five confirmed dead and are hoping that that number doesn't get any higher. Tucker, the State of Florida again, is -- there are many mandatory evacuations here. They've done a lot of preps here. They closed a lot of airports. There are 1,800 plus flights canceled today alone and 650 more tomorrow. So there's a lot happening down here and the weather is getting worse.

That's a gaffe. However, Tucker, the stuff you see with him more recently, for example, not remembering that when he met with the students from Parkland High School, that he wasn't still in office. He'd been out of office for more than a year when that happened. The fact that he misremembered that, that's not a gaff. That's the kind of memory problems that people his age and indeed my age have all the time.

I mean, this is the generation that was supposed to understand all of this. The fact of the matter is, is that Gillibrand was the problem. These candidates are the problem, not the average Democratic voter, not the average American. These elitists, these hypocrites, they are the issues. The journalists -- I use that word lightly -- at \"The New York Times\" they think they own it all and they know it all. They don't know anything. The fact of the matter is, she lost for the same reason she withdrew for the same reasons men withdraw. It's because they're bad candidates, they have a bad message. And especially in today's era, Tucker, that we are able with so much coverage, to be able to assess people very quickly. And we know who's being genuine and we know who isn't. And speaking of your conversation with Brit, one of the greatest strengths of Donald Trump is that he is himself. You know, he is not trying to be somebody else. And he was himself from the start of the campaigning in the primary season to the very end -- to this day. It is one person of all these campaigners who didn't shift when it went from primaries to a general to being the President. He is just himself. And that is a unique framework. So when you see someone like Gillibrand, it's a little shocking. Remember, she was supposed to be the likable Hillary Clinton. And I think that what we've learned here is that no iteration of Hillary Clinton is acceptable. And it comes down also to this story, kind of an insult that if we think we can be President and I believe a woman can be and will be a fabulous President that we need to be taken seriously. But we will only be taken seriously when we take ourselves seriously and hold ourselves accountable. And as is Hillary, and are many of these liberal women have been raised in an environment where they have no repercussions to their behavior. They don't have to take anything seriously. Everything is the politics of victimhood, and they think they're going to shame you into elevating them. They're learning that the American people are far ahead of them when it comes to what's the right move for the country. And at this point, they're not it."

Last year, you'll remember when a jury failed to convict the illegal immigrant, Jose Garcia-Zarate of murder or even manslaughter for shooting her to death on a pier in San Francisco. Now Federal judges are doing their part to inflict even more pain on Steinle's family and to make a mockery of our laws. Just on Friday, a California appeals court threw out Garcia-Zarate's only conviction that was for being a felon in possession illegally of a firearm. Now, he is a felon, and he was carrying a firearm. Nobody disputes that. Instead, the court found a legal technicality throughout the conviction. So for now, Garcia-Zarate is still in Federal custody on criminal charges, but that charge has been thrown out. We've learned a lot about the priorities of the ruling class in this case. Jose Garcia-Zarate was deported from this country five separate times. He was a convicted felon. He had been arrested multiple times on drug charges, including just months before he murdered Kate Steinle. And when those charges were dropped, he was simply released. Instead of being kicked out of the country, again, deported five times. So Kate Steinle's death never should have happened. We knew that. But it did happen because powerful people in this country won't tolerate even dangerous criminals being kept out of this country. They are so extreme and they've become this way. They weren't always this way, but they've become so extreme on the left that not only are they unwilling to stop a murderer, they're unwilling to punish him after he has been caught. That can't continue. Meanwhile, in a related story back here to the nation's capital, authorities in Montgomery County, Maryland, right outside the D.C. line, have arrested yet another illegal immigrant for another violent sex crime against another child. Emilio Carrasco-Hernandez is an illegal arrival from the country of Honduras. According to police, he sexually assaulted his 15-year-old stepdaughter. Carrasco-Hernandez is the seventh illegal immigrant arrested for a sex crime in Montgomery County, just since July 25th. Vince Coglianese has followed these stories closer than maybe anyone else in the region. He is a D.C. radio host with WMAL Radio and he joins us tonight. Vince, thanks a lot for coming on."

So he does this and now he has raped a 15-year-old girl, and we talk about seven as the number you've brought up since July 25th. That's the number of people who have been arrested on rape or sexual abuse charges. The majority of these cases -- sexual rape or abuse of a minor -- these are children who are being hurt in almost all of these cases. The reason why we're all of a sudden finding out about this concentration of stories is not that this is a new phenomenon. It's that rank and file police officers and prosecutors in Montgomery County are furious at their own leadership for allowing this problem to continue to fester as long as it has. These stories haven't been public before because they've been trying to deal with them. But now they're done dealing with them. Montgomery County leadership led by Marc Elrich, who is the County Executive. He is the top elected official in the county have made it so that Montgomery County, Maryland specifically, is a place where illegal immigration is protected at all costs, even at the expense of the community.

Deport all illegal immigrants?\" And my response to him was really simple, if you don't like the laws of this country, work to change them, but in the meantime, enforce them and that's not what they're doing in Montgomery County. And in fact, in late July, he passed an Executive Order codifying -- well, he was already heading in this direction in that county -- saying, if you're a county official, you are not allowed to inquire about immigration status. You are not allowed to allow Federal agents into jails in Montgomery County. The Feds have to stand outside and catch these guys, when they're coming out of the jail. Actually, it makes it a more unsafe environment to have this -- to have somebody ejected into the public and then caught by the Feds, rather than a peaceful prisoner transfer. The Feds have probable cause to make these arrests. They're issuing detainers because they've already done the research into establishing this is somebody we believe to be illegally in the country. Montgomery County is saying, \"We're not going to work with you.\" I'll tell you, we have one story that I was so stunned by. I was talking to one source that said inside of these jails, they've gotten calls from Feds who say, \"That guy is MS-13, do not release him.\" And then they release them. They don't have an address on file and he looks at these jailers in the face, he will smile and then walk right out the door."

When the company released that drug, they claimed that it would be less addictive than other opioid medications. That was a lie. At some point, Purdue Pharma knew it was a lie, but they kept telling it and multitudes died as a result. OxyContin turns out to be terrifyingly addictive, it has helped drive a drug epidemic in this country that has killed more Americans than any conflict since the Second World War. We now know that Purdue Pharma understood exactly what they were doing. Recent legal filings have exposed internal communications within the company, and they showed that the company's sales staff were pressured to sell as many pills as they could without regard to the risk. Physicians were urged to prescribe the highest possible doses of the drug in order to maximize profits. When evidence emerged that people are becoming junkies as a result, Purdue Pharma responded by shaming the patients they had hooked on their drug. They called them \"degenerate criminals\" essentially or refusing to take any responsibility at all for the human carnage they caused. It's hard to imagine an uglier story. Throughout all of it, we should note, Purdue Pharma's owners, the Sackler family grew spectacularly rich -- looking back, repulsively rich. Earlier this year, the Sacklers were estimated to have more than $12 billion in the bank. Thanks to the opioid epidemic, the Sackler family is now one of the 20 richest families in this country. In the last three years, Purdue Pharma has faced a wave of lawsuits from the people and places devastated by its pills. Now, apparently the company has made a settlement offer. To resolve all of these outstanding lawsuits, Purdue Pharma is willing to pay $12 billion, $3 billion of that would come from the Sackler family, which would then give up control of Purdue Pharma. It sounds like a lot of money, but let's put it into some perspective. The massive tobacco settlement of 1998 totaled about $206 billion. But no one would defend cigarette smoking. Over time, it will kill you. But Marlboros don't cut down young people in their prime. Smoking doesn't turn teenagers into zombies. It hasn't destroyed entire towns throughout the Midwest and New England. The Sacklers are hoping to get off with just six percent of what the tobacco companies paid more than 20 years ago. That feels wrong. But it's easy to see why the Sacklers are for it. According to Bloomberg, the Sacklers would retain at least a billion and a half dollars after the settlement. Is that justice? No, it's not. But unfortunately, it's a now familiar pattern in American life. A ruling class gets incredibly rich by wrecking our country, in this case by killing many thousands of young people. They get caught doing it, details emerge, everyone in Washington, New York and Los Angeles spends a week pretending to be horrified and concerned, and then nothing happens. Not a single one of the perpetrators ever goes to jail. Nobody is ever really punished, we've seen it again and again, including in the financial crisis of 2008. In the end, and in this case, they take their blood money and they had the St. Bart's for Thanksgiving, and they laugh. They get away with it every single time. For once, it will be nice if people like the Sackler got what they deserve. It might make the rest of us a little less cynical. Well, you may not have heard her name before, but until a few days ago, Madeleine Westerhout was the personal assistant to President Trump. By all accounts, she worked hard and did well at her job. It's hard to find anyone in Washington who doesn't like her. And yet now, she is unemployed and humiliated. How did that happen? Well, she made the mistake of eating dinner with a \"Washington Post\" reporter called Phil Rucker. At the meal, Westerhout made a couple of caddy remarks about the President's daughters. That's unwise, but it's hardly without precedent. That sort of thing can happen at dinners where wine is served. What is stunning -- what is really unusual is what happened next. The meal was explicitly off-the-record and for journalists, that is a bright line. That's the brightest of all lines. Information journalists learn in off- the-record conversations absolutely cannot be shared. It's one of the few unbreakable rules of the business. Everybody in the business knows that. But because Madeleine Westerhout worked for Donald Trump, Phil Rucker of \"The Washington Post\" decided to break that rule -- casually break it. According to multiple sources, Phil Rucker decided to burn Westerhout and shared her remarks with others. Westerhout was immediately fired, and as we said, humiliated. Her life completely derailed. Rucker, meanwhile, returned to Washington, the hero. In fact, he was happily yapping away on MSNBC this afternoon. His bosses at \"The Washington Post\" issued a statement telling the rest of us what a great guy he is. Joe Concha writes about media for \"The Hill.\" He joins us tonight. So Joe, has something changed in the past couple of weeks? Is off-the-record no longer a category that journalists have to observe?"

      "utterance": "As you mentioned, Tucker, that is a commandment -- a commandment that should never be broken. It's like Vegas, \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.\" When you have an off-the-record conversation with a reporter, it is understood as long as the parties established beforehand that this is an off-the-record conversation that it's not going to be mentioned. It's not going to be published. It's not going to be talked about in any capacity. It's like seeing your psychiatrist almost or a priest or in confession. It's not supposed to get out. And in this case, there was also some other reporters there as well. Reporters from Bloomberg and Reuters and \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and then Phil Rucker, who you mentioned from \"The Washington Post.\" It can't be confirmed however, that Rucker actually burned this source here in Madeleine Westerhout, but that's what a lot of sources are reporting right now. But again, I can't confirm that, and I'm not going to do that here. Go ahead --"

I'm satisfied with their knowledge of it. So I believe that happened and I'm willing to say so explicitly. But we called over to \"Washington Post\" as we always do, and asked the subject of the segment, you know, for a statement. Did this happen? And \"The Washington Post\" refused to respond to our questions that issued this absurd little statement about how much they like Phil Rucker. But I just want you to confirm for us that this is a really important question. This is not a small thing, if you're a journalist, right? The question of whether you broken an off-the-record agreement."

Clearly, you should know that given the acrimony between the press and the administration, and given the fact that there's complete mistrust between the press and the administration and vice versa, the last thing you do is go out to dinner, get over served. It's like sodium pentothal at that point, and you start talking, thinking that you could actually trust the people that you're with, because in this case, it's a means to an end. No one cares that Madeleine Westerhout was burned here by somebody, they only care about the message, which was embarrassing to the President. So, I think that's what we're talking about here."

Everyone has to be political all the time because of creeps like Phil Rucker, and organizations like \"The Washington Post,\" which are pure political organs designed to affect political outcomes. They don't care about individuals. They don't care about the rules. They just care about power, and I really think there should be -- I mean, you just said it, it's a fire able offense to break this rule. Do you think there's any chance that Phil Rucker will be fired from \"The Washington Post\"?"

      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "No, of course not. Because they would have issued a statement right now talking about it. But obviously, they're backing them. And look, why would you burn this source if they're openly talking like this? The only thing I could think of is that it was a promise for more access by leaking this out from somebody else within the administration, by letting people know that you had this information and that the source said that."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

In fact, the one thing you can be certain de Blasio is doing, resting. According to new report of 'The New York Post,\" for the entire month of May, Bill de Blasio spent a total of -- drumroll, please -- seven hours at work running New York City at City Hall. Not seven hours per day, seven hours total. Seth Barron lives in New York City where he is an Associate Editor at \"City Journal.\" He joins us tonight. That's not -- I mean, look, I'm not as hip as I used to be. I'm not sort of current with what is considered hard work, I guess.

This is a guy who is reported to take naps during the middle of the day. You know, his campaign has been a disaster from the beginning when he went to Trump Tower and made some absurd announcement and people were parading behind him with \"Worst Mayor\" ever signs.
