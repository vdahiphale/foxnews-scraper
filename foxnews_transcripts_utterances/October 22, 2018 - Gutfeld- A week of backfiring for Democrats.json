Like 0.09. If your IQ was 0.09, you would be granite. If they gave her a breathalyzer, she would be over the legal limit of stupid. As a wise man once said, when it comes to Cherokee, she has more in common with the jeep. Maybe she could be their spokesman. The slogan, \"Unlike me this Cherokee is not fully [bleep],\" so, think about what she pulled off. One law school directory listed her as Native American for nine years. Harvard had her as Native American until 2004. She was called the Harvard Law's first woman of color. And then there was the cookbook, \"Powwow Chow,\" recipes from five Indian tribes.

So, we spent a long time being lectured by left-wing a-holes about what not to wear on Halloween. Better not wear a sombrero, amigo. Hands off the head dress. Cultural appropriation is so evil.

It's true. That's more Indian than she is. Meaning, I am Native American. I know what I'm going as for Halloween. So, could this be the end of identity politics?

This week, the judge ruled in favor of Donald Trump in Stormy's defamation case against him and ordered that he she pay Trump's legal fees.

You don't even need to frack them. Here's a week's worth right here. First up is Liz Warren, otherwise known as chief spreading bull. After years of being accused of lying of her Native American background, she decides to take a DNA test, creating a video around laughable results."

      "utterance": "Wow. That looked totally natural. If she got any stiffer, I would check for the toe tag. Talk about a paleface. It's telling that they chose some Stanford academic to finesse these terrible results, they just knew they were about to paint a turd orange and call it Sherbet because when the results arrived, it amounted to something between nearly zero and nearly zero. Like 0.09. If your IQ was 0.09, you would be granite. If they gave her a breathalyzer, she would be over the legal limit of stupid. As a wise man once said, when it comes to Cherokee, she has more in common with the jeep. Maybe she could be their spokesman. The slogan, \"Unlike me this Cherokee is not fully [bleep],\" so, think about what she pulled off. One law school directory listed her as Native American for nine years. Harvard had her as Native American until 2004. She was called the Harvard Law's first woman of color. And then there was the cookbook, \"Powwow Chow,\" recipes from five Indian tribes. She listed herself as Cherokee. Yes and I am Bjorn from Abba. Actually, I did some research to find out who has more Native American blood than her, here they are -- Bjorn from Abba, Agnetha from Abba, Anni- Frid from Abba, and the other guy from Abba. Hard to believe. I actually did even more research to find out who has more Native American blood than her, Flipper, my office stapler, this helmet. So, we spent a long time being lectured by left-wing a-holes about what not to wear on Halloween. Better not wear a sombrero, amigo. Hands off the head dress. Cultural appropriation is so evil. But by all means, says our leading libs, they totally claim ownership of an entire culture and exploit it for political purposes. Seriously, hasn't Warren committed the biggest cultural appropriations sin ever. She stole who they are. Now, I can talk, because I am 2 percent Native American. It's true. That's more Indian than she is. Meaning, I am Native American. I know what I'm going as for Halloween. So, could this be the end of identity politics? If DNA tests reveal that you contain the same amount of oppressed ancestry that Liz has, then you are oppressed, too. If everyone is a minority, then nobody is, except me. As you know, I did do my own DNA test on \"The Five\" and then I made a video."

So I decided to take a DNA test. The results were fascinating. It turns out, I am 40.8 percent British and Irish; 9 percent Iberian, 2 percent Native American, and 20 percent minotaur, and 20 percent giant sequoia. Yes, one of my granddad had a thing for trees. I'm also 30 percent centaur, which explains why it's hard to get jeans that fit. There's also a bit of sea serpent in there, about 90 percent. At this point, I know what you're thinking that adds up to more than 100 percent. Well, it's 212.3 percent to be exact. How can that be? Well, I will tell you. It's because I am the Zlarg, the gargantuan double beasts that feasts on the souls of the dead. I am a being of infinite manifestations. Fueled by a hell bent search for human sufferings.

The dome dope had been using various victims to attract the spotlight for himself, but when he finally finds the spotlight, this happens. This week, the judge ruled in favor of Donald Trump in Stormy's defamation case against him and ordered that he she pay Trump's legal fees. This was the judge's way of telling Stormy that her lawyer is giving lawyers a bad name. Think about that. She is a porn star and her lawyer is so bad, suddenly her career looks respectable. She used to get paid to screw people, Avenatti just screwed her and she has to pay him. He is to lawyers what Liz Warren is to Indians, an embarrassment. So it's really been a week of backfiring. Everything blew up in their faces. The DNA test exposes Warren as 0.0 Indian, the judge exposes Avenatti as 100 percent bozo. Meanwhile, the US regains its spot as the number one competitive economy in the world and US job openings hits a record 7.1 million exceeding the number of unemployed Americans. Pretty soon, you're going to need a DNA test to prove you're an unemployed American. That's pretty good for Trump, but it may not be good enough for Liz Warren and Avenatti. There may be seven million job openings, but we still have at least two more idiots than we need. Let's welcome tonight guest.

The President said they could come in November before the critical midterm election. In December, the President signed a historic tax overhaul which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. It also temporarily reduced taxes for most individuals. The President says this tax cut would only apply to middle income earners. He made comments to reporters while campaigning in Nevada. Overseas, a measles outbreak is raging across Europe. There have been 41,000 cases and 40 deaths this year. That's according to the World Health Organization. Experts blame the spike on parents not vaccinating their children and doctors cautioned that the same thing could happen here the US soon. I'm Anita Vogel. Now back to \"The Greg Gutfeld Show.\""
