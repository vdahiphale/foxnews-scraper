So, you have that that image today, which we're going to put up of the president standing before the people whose businesses are burned out. It looks like he's standing in the middle of Beirut. But as Salena Zito writes, this is unbelievably happening in Kenosha, Wisconsin. It's also true that according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, the president is down there by 3.5."

It's not about politics for this president. It's about the American people. Donald Trump cares about their safety and security. 90 days, this has been going on, Martha. Death, destruction, looting, rioting, assaults on innocent Americans. The Democrats had a convention for four days, said nothing about it. Democrat convention, Democrat controlled cities, not a word. Joe Biden called them peaceful protests again this weekend. And then that politics started to shift. Turns out the American people don't like it when their cities are set ablaze by rioters and protesters and looters and all the like. And what happened? Biden had to come out and say there was a little violence sprinkled in with all the mostly peaceful protesters. And then the media jumped right in with them and said, yes, not only is there violence, it's Donald Trump's fault. Who do they think they're kidding? You're playing video right now--"

And to hear him talk right now, I mean, who does he think he's fooling, for that matter? He hasn't said a word about this for this entire time period, 90 days, three months this has been going on. He pops up out of the hidey hole every once in a while, to say, let's defund the police and blame the police, calling them the instigators of some of this violence. And what did they think was going to happen? Democrats now for years, Maxine Waters, saying if you see someone in the administration get in their face, tell them they're not welcome here, cause a scene. You had Kamala Harris, the vice-presidential nominee, the pick by Joe Biden, saying this is not going to stop. It shouldn't stop. It should keep going. They want the chaos. They are rooting for chaos because they think it falls back on the president. But again, this vice presidential, this Vice President Joe Biden is completely oblivious to where the American people are on this. They want safety, security. They demand it. The government is supposed to provide safety and security for those who can't provide it themselves. And by the way, when you're talking about these cities, the president has offered help at every turn to try and squash this violence--"

Of course, this country has challenges, but what's unique about America is that we get through them together. We come out stronger. After all, all of the issues we face. The president is not only the consoler in chief, which you saw today in Wisconsin, but he also understands the American people deserve law and order. They deserve safety and security.

And we don't know. We're waiting for the investigation. But the president sort of opened up the door to that, to being supportive to him. Was that a mistake?

The problem is these Democrat mayors, Democrat governors have said, don't do your job. You can't use non-lethal means; you can't use lethal means. And the police are standing down.

He's one of the best physicians on the planet say that this is absolutely ludicrous. For someone in the media to make such a dangerous, ridiculous, irresponsible claim and see no ramification at all. No fallout from CNN. Joe Lockhart, what a despicable human being to try and float this out there. A rumor about the president's health. You see him every single day. He's out for hours at a time. Joe Biden is sitting down in a basement somewhere, pops up every so often to say a couple of words here and there, takes no questions. If anyone has an issue, it's obviously Joe Biden because he won't face the music with the media.

We do, however, believe as the rule, schools must be open for in-person learning as an option for the families who want it or who need it, your child, your school, your way.

Today, he's turned his back on the kids that we're talking about and he's turned his face in favor of the teacher's union and what they have to say and what they have to demand. And it's really shameful. Parents are demanding more choices today as their schools across the country are not serving them and the needs of their students. And we're seeing parents forming learning pods, micro schools, doing home schooling, trying to access schools for which they have to pay tuition in small faith- based schools and other things, other schools. And so, the demand for school choice and giving parents the control about their - for their kids' future is continuing to grow. And it's a really important point in time."

New York City, they've just delayed the opening for 10 days to prevent a strike. I don't know what 10 more days is going to do in terms of the education of the kids here in New York City or them getting what they want, the teachers, but they're going to get 10 more days.

And that can certainly be applied to getting kids back to school. It's an excuse for the most part.

We put this up yesterday, but it really struck me in the Wall Street Journal editorial and a teacher in Philadelphia said that he tweeted out his concern that conservative parents listening in are my chief concern to his lessons. Here's what the president had to say about something that is kind of a new idea. I mean, in a way, he's coining it patriotic education. Here's what he said."

So, Joe Biden lays into President Trump for unrest in America, calling for peace, but he doesn't mention Black Lives Matter or ANTIFA who are largely responsible for the violence that we have seen on the streets so far.

The Wall Street Journal editorial board today writes this. Surely Mr. Biden knows that the protests and riots this Memorial Day are overwhelmingly led by Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA. Mr. Biden didn't mention those groups in his prepared remarks, and he never used the words Left-wing to describe those who are burning businesses and attacking police precincts.

      "speaker": "DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, I was struck by the fact that he blamed this, I didn't point any blame at Black Lives Matter, at Antifa, any of these Left-wing groups. They claim that these are Right-wing groups doing it. Are these Right-wing groups burning the American flag? Maybe the American Legion doing so. We've seen churches attack. We've seen statues of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ decapitated. Is that the focus of the family doing this? This is absolute sort of bizarre. I mean, it's one thing for him not to speak up over these last three months, but then finally to speak up as he has yesterday, and then turn around and blame it on President Trump and his supporters. I think it's astonishing. And one of the things he completely forgot to mention is how President Trump repeatedly has said things that are designed to try to soothe the situation and calm people down. For example, May 30th, just after these riots started, he said in Cape Canaveral, I quote, the memory of George Floyd being dishonored by rioters, looters, and anarchists. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos is the mission at hand. And he's repeatedly said things like this, trying to lower the temperature and get people to be unified. Unfortunately, most of the media don't cover this. They do cover, of course, the riots on the other side will claim that they're peaceful or mostly peaceful, even though so many of these incidents end up with graffiti, broken windows, burned buildings. And just a couple of nights ago in Portland, with the Trump supporter being shot dead in the streets by Antifa activist, by the way."

So then why would it be difficult to talk about these groups? It ought to be natural for someone who portrays himself that way to be able to say, I am not the radical formers of Black Lives Matter and I am not Antifa, and these people are burning down buildings and ruining people's lives and they need to stop. Why not just say it? JUAN WILLIAMS, “THE FIVE” CO-HOST: Well, first of all, he did say that looting, rioting, setting buildings on fire is wrong and it's a crime, and the people who do it ought to be not only arrested, but prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. He said that quite plainly. But I think that what you're saying is curious to me, because I read in the newspaper today that the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that it's like 90 percent, 90 percent, Martha, of the incidence of crime and the rioting, the violence are responsibility of Right-wing militia groups in this country.

And now, there's some pushback on that idea.

The rioters also set fires two bundles of newspapers, they threw them into the ground floor of a residential building, in the act, they torched a minority owned business called Pearl District Dental.

We obviously don't prosecute ideology or groups, but we certainly prosecute and certainly investigate criminal activity. And, Martha, part of this is following the money. So, what does that mean? That means examining the financial transactions related to this coordinated criminal activity. For instance, some of the materials that have been used in these riots, how are they purchased? Where is this money coming from? Who is behind that? And working our way up. And the Department of Justice is aggressively pursuing all of the avenues with respect to these investigations."

We've charge 76 individuals. More charges are coming this week. This is part of 300 arrests, over 300 arrests nationally, over 300 defendants charged, as well, and so the Department of Justice, the FBI, ATF, and all of our components are committed to aggressively pursuing, investigating --"

We have a number of arson investigations, particularly in Kenosha, and so that's something that we look at. But again, the materials, and you show these videos on your show, Martha, as have other networks as well, we've seen some of these materials that have been used in these riots, and it's not just that a pallet of bricks magically appear on a street corner, right? Somebody has had to purchase those."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "A lot of questions out there about who is behind it, exactly. Before I let you go, the FBI came out today with sort of new guidelines in terms of FISA applications and the like. And, you know, tightening the ability to surveil American citizens, members of campaigns. Any thoughts on that, that guidance, and does that in any way indicate that the Durham report is going to be close behind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUPEC",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, a couple thoughts on that. So in addition to the inspector general's review, in addition to the 40 plus reforms that Director Wray has already enacted and is implementing, in addition to John Durham's investigation, the attorney general determined it was necessary to implement additional reforms at the FBI to make sure that what happened to President Trump and his campaign never happens again. This includes the creation of an audit office within the FBI, and what that office will be doing is conducting oversight of national security activities, FISA applications, and the like. The inspector general will be reviewing the activities of that office after eight months to make sure it's properly functioning. And in addition, on the FISA piece of things, if the FBI seeks a FISA warrant on an elected official on member of a campaign or a candidate, they will need to get permission from the attorney general to do so."

That includes my next guest, 98-year-old Pearl Harbor and Battle of Midway survivor Jack Holder, who wrote to the commemoration committee saying this. Many remaining vets like me traverse our nation from New York to Pearl Harbor to meet with young people, telling our stories, promoting the importance of resilience and optimism, courage and commitment in the face of challenge and loss. We want our message and experience about the challenges we faced back then to help remind everyone today that an adversary like COVID-19 will ultimately be no match for our spirit to fight and win. Jack Holder joins me now. Sir, thank you so much for all of your service to the country and for joining me today, it's great to speak with you.

And when I fill in for our master, I heard a terrible explosion, we run outside. And seen the first bomb that fell on Pearl Harbor. Several of our aircraft were on fire. We've seen aircraft in the sky with the rising sun and say, you know, we knew immediately what had happened. And so many people have asked me what my thoughts were at that time, and I guess the thoughts were so many and it's hard to relate, but surprise, anger, everything else, but I've seen the devastation that I'll never forget, Martha."

I've seen a gentleman sliding from the ship with burning oil and water. Some of them died in the water, some of them died on (Inaudible), and some of them died on the beach. I've been (Inaudible) machine gun feet, along my shipmates for three days and nights, and on the fourth day, we were allowed to return to our barracks. All of the lockers had been broken open to retrieve white clothing for bandages, and at that time, we were each given a postcard with two inscriptions. The first said - excuse me -- I've been wounded, and the second said I'm OK, don't worry. And believe it or not, my mother received this card 11 days later. Everything turned back to normal after that, we've been to (Inaudible) over all around Hawaii and the surrounding islands. I was in the second aircraft to spot the Japanese fleet coming to Midway, and I actually (Inaudible) recorded the report. August 3 or July the 2nd, I was in Guadalcanal from 48 over Guadalcanal and the Solomon Islands. In early 1943, I received orders to travel to San Diego, supposedly to help commission a new (Inaudible) and return to the South Pacific. When I reached San Diego, my orders had been changed. I started training in the beach (Inaudible) liberators."

Were you concerned about going there, or did you want to go?"
