Conor Lamb was the guy who was considered like, you would think he was the perfect candidate. Straight out of central casting for a moderate Democrat in a state like Pennsylvania where he could appeal to the working class and he could also rub elbows with the tech guys that want to build more companies and in Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh and he just could never get any traction.

So, he really cares about that issue and I hope he pins John Fetterman down on this because with inflation where it's at and you know, taxes, a tax hike on the horizon, you compound that with Medicare for all, we cannot afford that. The healthcare industry cannot afford that. So yes, I do think it's going to be very tough. I thought the Madison Cawthorn thing was interesting because he had been polling ahead. And I thought that perhaps the former president's endorsement of him last minute might help. But he so far lost only by a couple percentage points. And you're absolutely right.

He does remind me a lot of you, Tyrus. And I believe that he will cross over. It's not just progressives. It's cool. He is a very cool guy. I like him a lot. I endorse if I could endorse Dr. Oz, a long-time friend of mine. Wife Liza, wonderful people. They are great on TV. But more than that, they are very good people. And I was very, very disturbed by how he was slimed by Dave McCormick. Dave McCormick was also a very attractive guy. He's a G.I., a self-made multimillionaire. He is a bronze star. You know, award of a bronze star. But going up with Mehmet Oz, a lot of it was Muslim hate. You know, for family born in, you know, his parents were from Turkey. Oz served in the Turkish army.

When I was a kid, election day was a day. One day. You go to vote. You go to vote. Most people went in person to vote, you know, older or disabled people and now I am probably a number among them got absentee ballots, mail-in ballots very rare though as a percentage.

They'll get indicted for just trying to protect themselves. You know how this play. They are not going to go in the FBI and infiltrate the radical left wing pro-choice movement and concoct stings like they did against the Gretchen kidnappers. I guess they weren't kidnappers. That was a sole set up. So, it looks like if you are running a Supreme Court justice into hiding, that's a return to normalcy. That is restoring the institution to this country because that's what they said they were going to do. But you are going to see that, because I think it's a very emotional issue, abortion. And a lot of people don't understand it. There are women who are past their prime who can't even get pregnant but you will see them out there, screaming at the top of their lungs almost resorting to violence because it's just, it's a religious tenet to these people. And we have to understand that. I would stay away from these people all summer if you hear about a protest in your city, I wouldn't engage. I'd go to the beach. Even on a social level, if it' not your friend or your family, don't involve yourself with a very, you know, turbulent conversation about it. It's really not worth it. I would give advice to these protesters if this does the way we think it is. There is a Democratic process. You can go, you can petition, you can run for office if you want to.

I'm not saying it wasn't meritorious but, so he is no longer there. But I think the Pennsylvania race is something that is just so interesting. One on the Republican side, if I could comment on the Democrats real quick. So, John Fetterman, also the cat ran away with the spoon in that one. he just destroyed Conor Lamb. Conor Lamb was the guy who was considered like, you would think he was the perfect candidate. Straight out of central casting for a moderate Democrat in a state like Pennsylvania where he could appeal to the working class and he could also rub elbows with the tech guys that want to build more companies and in Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh and he just could never get any traction. Why? So, John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor he ends up in the hospital. Gets a stroke. This guy, though, absolutely destroyed Conor Lamb.

On the Republican side of things, I would say that there's only one candidate, presidential candidate that has one Pennsylvania since 1909 -- 1988. And that was Donald Trump. And he ran a race that was different. It was wild. People are following it. The -- he created this amazing base of support. And any Republican who is not him has to run a near perfect race. Mitch McConnell today said he believes that whoever wins in Pennsylvania that they feel very strongly that they can win in Pennsylvania.

And I think that John Fetterman probably doesn't want to go up against Mehmet Oz because not only he is a battle tested in a really tough primary, he's got name recognition. And if you are talking about socialized medicine who better to dissect what the government has done to ruin healthcare in this country than a doctor who has enriched himself in the free market not only in medicine but in entertainment as well. So, he really cares about that issue and I hope he pins John Fetterman down on this because with inflation where it's at and you know, taxes, a tax hike on the horizon, you compound that with Medicare for all, we cannot afford that. The healthcare industry cannot afford that. So yes, I do think it's going to be very tough. I thought the Madison Cawthorn thing was interesting because he had been polling ahead. And I thought that perhaps the former president's endorsement of him last minute might help. But he so far lost only by a couple percentage points. And you're absolutely right. There has to be something there. It has to be substantive. There has to be policy behind the person.

He had a couple of misses here and there. We discuss Cawthorn and some others. But I must say, a couple of quick points. Number one, John Fetterman is enormously charismatic. He does remind me a lot of you, Tyrus. And I believe that he will cross over. It's not just progressives. It's cool. He is a very cool guy. I like him a lot. I endorse if I could endorse Dr. Oz, a long-time friend of mine. Wife Liza, wonderful people. They are great on TV. But more than that, they are very good people. And I was very, very disturbed by how he was slimed by Dave McCormick. Dave McCormick was also a very attractive guy. He's a G.I., a self-made multimillionaire. He is a bronze star. You know, award of a bronze star. But going up with Mehmet Oz, a lot of it was Muslim hate. You know, for family born in, you know, his parents were from Turkey. Oz served in the Turkish army. You know, I really found that extremely distasteful. I felt very bad that he had to endure -- endure those attacks, very unfair attacks. But I want to say one other thing about elections. When I was a kid, election day was a day. One day. You go to vote. You go to vote. Most people went in person to vote, you know, older or disabled people and now I am probably a number among them got absentee ballots, mail-in ballots very rare though as a percentage. But everybody showed up. And that night, you could gather around the TV and you knew who won because the absentee ballots, the military ballots, the provisional ballots, all these ballots were -- like Florida does now after the disaster of the hanging chad, now you get the account. You keep the running tally of the people who vote early. And election day, you do it, not this torture. It makes people lose late in the system. I --"

So, this is not going to have the same effect as they did before where you are going to see people on TV going, it's a mostly peaceful protest. Americans are sick of this. Now they are going to see it being standing outside the Supreme Court justices' house and doing these things is only going to inspire more and more Americans to vote right. Because they are going to see this is going down. And you've seen what happened before. You've seen this course, and now the best thing you're telling us is look out, it's coming. But again, where is the plan? What are you doing? National Guard? What are you doing to protect our justices? Nothing you're talking about. It's like they ae going to make a web site of where you can report somebody protesting on somebody's house. That's probably what we're looking for. So, again, it's a bad -- it's a missed point."

They'll get indicted for just trying to protect themselves. You know how this play. They are not going to go in the FBI and infiltrate the radical left wing pro-choice movement and concoct stings like they did against the Gretchen kidnappers. I guess they weren't kidnappers. That was a sole set up. So, it looks like if you are running a Supreme Court justice into hiding, that's a return to normalcy. That is restoring the institution to this country because that's what they said they were going to do. But you are going to see that, because I think it's a very emotional issue, abortion. And a lot of people don't understand it. There are women who are past their prime who can't even get pregnant but you will see them out there, screaming at the top of their lungs almost resorting to violence because it's just, it's a religious tenet to these people. And we have to understand that. I would stay away from these people all summer if you hear about a protest in your city, I wouldn't engage. I'd go to the beach. Even on a social level, if it' not your friend or your family, don't involve yourself with a very, you know, turbulent conversation about it. It's really not worth it. I would give advice to these protesters if this does the way we think it is. There is a Democratic process. You can go, you can petition, you can run for office if you want to. And you know what, if that doesn't work out in your state, you can move states. That's the great part about this republic. You can move states and live a totally different lifestyle if it doesn't work out for you in the state you are living in right now."

And a video appears to show dozens of abandoned orders that were never picked up and had to be thrown out. Customers waited for hours, and some never got their food. All right, speed round here.

You got people moving things around. It's like a beehive. And that's just for the customers outside. Maybe you get a dozen takeout or delivery orders.
