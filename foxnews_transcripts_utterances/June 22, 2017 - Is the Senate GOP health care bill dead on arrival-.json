But for the most part, this leaves the structure of ObamaCare in place. It really is ObamaCare-lite. And I think the most telling thing that we saw today was Mitch McConnell basically just dropped this thing like it was road kill. He said, it is your problem now. You guys figure out what you want to do with it. He didn't -- there was no messaging from Senate leadership about this is a great bill. This is a great way forward. He said, my work is done and walked away. And I think that tells you something. He is setting it up for negotiation. I think that's right, but his heart is clearly not in it as a grand ideological matter."

      "utterance": "It's an imperfect bill that comes out as an imperfect process. But when you think about what the option really is, you have a bill that gets rid of the individual mandate, gets right of the employer mandate, that phases out Medicaid expansion, cuts taxes. And -- a lot depends on what happens in the future, but builds a case for getting rid of ObamaCare structurally over the long term. If your option is that or nothing, that's actually not the worst option that you have. At the same time, it's a bill that does a little bit more in reaching out to the moderates than the House bill did in that it does phase these things out a little bit more gently, provides some money up front. So the best way to understand Mitch McConnell, I think, is that he picks the most conservative, politically plausible position. And that's what this bill might be."

But I think Mitch McConnell's goal here is to check the box, hopefully we can kick this over back to the House. It's not our problem. It will die over there. But he's not investing in it passionately as a philosophical issue."

      "utterance": "No, but they've known that all along. It mirrors the House bill enough. The House bill is very unpopular. And the real fear among Republicans is that they set this up as a partisan process they have a very narrow, restrictive procedural trick they are going to use to get reconciliation to have a partisan vote. The problem is they are afraid in the next few days that President Trump is going to take in the criticism and have one of his reactions and call it mean again and heartless. And that's a real risk to them putting it all on the line. And he's playing nice and quiet for now. But he called it a negotiation, saying he always likes to say that is not over yet and things may change. But there's a real concern among Republicans that they've stuck their neck on the line for this. It is imperfect. They're going to take a lot of heat. They own the outcome and the president might turn on them."

Bill Cassidy of Louisiana is one of them because he thinks that what it does is it addresses one of the biggest influencing factors on the House bill at the 11th hour. That's when Jimmy Kimmel came out and told the story of his brand-new baby and the heart condition, saying we all need to have coverage for preexisting conditions. Here is what Bill Cassidy said a little while ago."

      "utterance": "This is actually a whole problem that we have with how we talk about health insurance, which is people are very good at telling heartbreaking stories about one side of the equation, and the media is really bad about telling the other side of the equation. A lot of people have suffered under ObamaCare. Yes, some people have been helped by it. Some people have had their premiums go to places where they can't afford to get insurance for their families. They have been penalized with these really regressive taxes and fines for not buying insurance that they don't want. And so there are all sorts of stories that should be told in this. We should be thinking also about how -- I read something today were someone was saying that half of all babies are born on Medicaid. That's an assumption that that's a good thing. Is that really a good thing or should be thinking more about how to lower health care costs so that people can pay for their own health insurance?"
