But consent, which is at the core of so many sexual assault cases, has proven time and again to be very hard to define legally. And that's led to some colleges and legal organizations taking another look at what's called affirmative consent. The American Bar Association, which among other things sets academic standards for law schools, is among those organizations supporting a legal redefinition of consent. Its resolution being debated this week would call on legislatures and courts to, quote, \"define consent in sexual assault cases as the assent of a person who is competent to give consent to engage in a specific act,\" and, quote, \"to reject any acquirement that sexual assault victims have a legal burden of verbal or physical resistance.\" Now, that echoes a California law which summed up the approach as yes means yes, and New York's enough is enough law. The law's supporters say are vital to protect victims particularly in cases where a potential victim might be drunk or unconscious as a result of drugs taken knowingly or not, and therefore unable to resist or to give consent. Critics, among them, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, say affirmative consent laws are dangerous because they take away the presumption of innocence. The NACDL saying any such law, quote, \"shifts the burden of proof by requiring an accused person to prove affirmative consent to each sexual act rather than requiring the prosecution to prove lack of consent.\" And adding of the American Bar Association proposal, quote, \"The resolution assumes guilt in the absence of any evidence regarding consent.\" Now, it's important to remember, Tammy, these laws are aimed squarely at colleges, and according to the website AffirmativeConsent.com, only 40 of 513 colleges they studied have actually introduced affirmative consent policies.

I think this is almost in a sense a sinister make-work act for lawyers, because what is certain to come out of this law if it is passed is the various states is that there is going to be constitutional litigation, because what they are doing is illegal. Universities and colleges that have these types of burden shifting premises that violate the rights of men accused are being sued. There is a class action lawsuit class action lawsuit going on right now challenging that Title IX burden shifting that occurred throughout the Obama administration that is still the law in many states.

You look at these mass shooters - very rarely did you see a positive productive relationship with a father figure. You also see dark recesses of the internet harboring and fuming this type of hate. And rather than deal with those things, it's just easier for the political left to scapegoat the President, to defame to demoralize, to delegitimize those who are actually trying to come up with solutions. I think you've seen a President eager to comfort those in pain and also open-minded about what solutions anyone would have that would reduce the frequency of this violence. But if we've seen anything from the shooting at the Republican baseball practice to the Elizabeth Warren, Antifa supporter in Dayton, to the you know the person that claimed to have a very right- wing hateful ideology in El Paso. The extreme elements of violence do not have monogamy with anyone political agenda, and I'm grateful we have a president who's willing to call out hate and who's trying to pave the way to a really a more accepting country."

They're thrilled to see the first lady, it's because they have been consistent of all the people and when we're dealing with tragedies like this and the dynamics that we're facing. The president's approach has been about safety for everyone, including the migrants, right? Of course the American people. When you're doing things for the right reasons it benefits everyone. And yet now we have this kind of - certainly, it's a hatred. But you're there - you're - we had an attempted assassination of 23 Republicans, not so long ago seriously almost fatally injuring Steve Scalise. We're in this heightened time and it seems like there's an alternate reality. Most Americans - and I think you would agree, don't believe what it is they're hearing in this rhetoric.

I've got to say it's Marianne Williamson who actually came forward and said, there's no direct connection between the President and these acts of violence. I mean, she believes there's a direct connection between how the moon and stars align in our mood. So she - even she couldn't find a direct connection.

Of course, we know Peter Strzok is suing. Now McCabe is suing. He says they got rid of him because he wouldn't pledge allegiance to Trump.

Through the great work of Bill Barr and Senator Lindsey Graham, we're going to make sure that the FBI and the intelligence community aren't used to shape public opinion, but return to their mission of investigating the facts and then doing so in a dispassionate way."

As many as 600 agents were involved in six different cities all around Jackson, Mississippi. They were targeting chicken processing plants where immigrant labor has been strong for decades. They were targeting illegal immigrant labor this time around, though. The timing has been challenged. Some say it was a mistake to carry out the raid at the very time that President Trump was traveling to El Paso to mourn the 22 people killed there - killed by a shooter who has been accused of targeting Hispanics deliberately. ICE officials say there is no connection between the raid and the shooting, that this raid had been in the works for months that took a great deal of planning to get all those agents into Mississippi. The raid itself was carried out by agents forming a perimeter around the different plants and then checking for proof of residency. Those workers without the proper proof were zip-tied, put in buses and taken to a military airport hangar for processing. Some of those were arrested, some were deported and some were released. The latest numbers though from the U.S. Attorney's Office says that of the 680 detainees, 300 have been released, many of them on humanitarian grounds. They say they believe that as of Wednesday night, all the children and parents were reunited. Tammy, back to you."

His supporters didn't say it. He was showing a video what other people were saying about him, that they wanted him dead.

      "utterance": "Good evening, Tammy. It seems simple when you first ask the question, did someone consent to sexual activity or not. But consent, which is at the core of so many sexual assault cases, has proven time and again to be very hard to define legally. And that's led to some colleges and legal organizations taking another look at what's called affirmative consent. The American Bar Association, which among other things sets academic standards for law schools, is among those organizations supporting a legal redefinition of consent. Its resolution being debated this week would call on legislatures and courts to, quote, \"define consent in sexual assault cases as the assent of a person who is competent to give consent to engage in a specific act,\" and, quote, \"to reject any acquirement that sexual assault victims have a legal burden of verbal or physical resistance.\" Now, that echoes a California law which summed up the approach as yes means yes, and New York's enough is enough law. The law's supporters say are vital to protect victims particularly in cases where a potential victim might be drunk or unconscious as a result of drugs taken knowingly or not, and therefore unable to resist or to give consent. Critics, among them, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, say affirmative consent laws are dangerous because they take away the presumption of innocence. The NACDL saying any such law, quote, \"shifts the burden of proof by requiring an accused person to prove affirmative consent to each sexual act rather than requiring the prosecution to prove lack of consent.\" And adding of the American Bar Association proposal, quote, \"The resolution assumes guilt in the absence of any evidence regarding consent.\" Now, it's important to remember, Tammy, these laws are aimed squarely at colleges, and according to the website AffirmativeConsent.com, only 40 of 513 colleges they studied have actually introduced affirmative consent policies. Tammy?"

We are supposed to be happy that only 40 colleges are doing this. Clearly this is just the beginning. But this is one of those things where Americans couldn't imagine that this would occur. It also, and I have identified as a feminist most of my adult life. You are a professional woman in a field that has not always been open to women. We both know as American women that we are in charge of our lives. This kind of law also places a burden in a way on a woman, presuming that she's an infant in a certain sense. What is your take in general of the impact of this on women, and on everyone's civil rights?"

Basically, you're asking men to prove the impossible. So basically, you're asking men to prove the impossible. Now it's actually already been the case that many schools have put the burden on men in many ways by not allowing the confrontation of witnesses, by not allowing evidentiary burdens to be appropriate the way they are in criminal court, and many other presumptions to make it very Orwellian to be a man in these proceedings."

So we wanted a shift to have women be taken seriously. We have had these conversations. And yet we have just wanted a fair access to due process and to the legal system. This has moved so far to this presumption that the accuser, and we saw this in the Kavanaugh case, the presumption that the accuser was telling the truth, expecting the accused to prove a negative. And I don't see this being moved at all. I don't see this as staying only within these cases. It would be in other cases as well, other fields."

So this is part of a trend that's happening in America. So even before this dumb law by the ABA, which is an organization that I actually spoke at their conference earlier today, but I militantly have never belonged to the ABA because they do this type of thing. I actually have a theory here, Tammy. I think this is almost in a sense a sinister make-work act for lawyers, because what is certain to come out of this law if it is passed is the various states is that there is going to be constitutional litigation, because what they are doing is illegal. Universities and colleges that have these types of burden shifting premises that violate the rights of men accused are being sued. There is a class action lawsuit class action lawsuit going on right now challenging that Title IX burden shifting that occurred throughout the Obama administration that is still the law in many states. And so I participated in these Title IX proceedings. Men are railroaded, boys are railroaded, careers are destroyed. And are women better off for that? I don't think so."

I took my wife, and my wife said if she gets political, I'm going out to get a drink. My wife never left the bar, Tammy, the whole two hours. I'm serious, never left the bar. So it's sad. It's sad to watch this. But if you're going to do a protest song, be clever about it. This wasn't. Since we are speaking on retreads, Tammy, this week we also saw series of reboots that is breathtaking even by Hollywood standards. It's not just that they are out of ideas.

And stay right here because more fabulous television and important news coming up with Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team, take it from here.
