This time for how it obtained emails from the Trump transition team. It's raising serious legal questions. A lawyer for the Trump transition team is saying the documents were acquired improperly while Mueller's investigators are claiming they did nothing wrong. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Gregg Jarrett and Alan Dershowitz are here with their expert legal analysis.

      "sentences": "Yes. Judge Jeanine, a horrible and tragic day here in Western Washington. As the Washington State patrol has confirmed three fatalities, but the Associated Press is reporting six, at least six, and the discrepancy could be that three have been pulled from the wreckage, but there could be three bodies still inside some of those cars. You can see behind me dangling off of a trestle here about 50 miles South of Seattle over a I-five. That train derailed at about 7:40 this morning at the height of rush hour traffic. Speed might be a factor. They will definitely going to look at the speed of the train. There were multiple reports that this train was traveling upwards of 80 miles an hour, about a quarter mile away from where it went off the tracks and where it went off the tracks, there is a very sharp curve. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, when investigators get here a little bit later tonight, they will be looking at a number of things but including the speed. There were 77 people on the train and five crew members. Thirteen of the 14 train parts, the cars in the engines came off the tracks, many of them came on the highway down below. Five cars and two semi-trailers were hit by train parts and train pieces as they were coming down off that trestle and there were injuries, but no fatalities among people on the ground. But again, the job right now -- they have a lot of heavy machinery here. They are trying to stabilize those railcars that are still dangling off that trestle to try to shore up enough to be able to get inside and retrieve the final victims of this horrible train accident that happened this morning. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And again, this was something that -- this was an inaugural run of this train route from Seattle down to Portland. They had this high-speed rail line and the whole idea was to shave about 15 minutes off of the run from Seattle to Portland and there were many people who were upset about this and they warned about something like this happening. So, that will all be part of the investigation as we look forward. Jeanine, back to you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Democrats are trying to pour gasoline on this fire by spreading rumors that the President may try to fire Robert Mueller and the President insists that is not true, though his allies outside the White House are trying to undermine the Special Counsel's credibility.

Trump for America Incorporated Counsel Kory Langhofer declaring that career government workers, potentially hostile to the President, quote, \"Unlawfully produced transition private materials, including privileged communications to the Special Counsel's office.\" Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Special Counsel pushed back, quote, \"When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owners consent or appropriate criminal process.\" But Alan Dershowitz a long time Democrat says, this was a close legal call, so it was foolish for Mueller to fail to make this airtight by seeking an easily obtainable warrant. Dershowitz adding, Mueller should have immediately disclosed to the public he had in fact removed FBI agent Peter Strzok from the case because of anti-Trump text messages rather than waiting a couple of months.

This time for how it obtained emails from the Trump transition team. It's raising serious legal questions. A lawyer for the Trump transition team is saying the documents were acquired improperly while Mueller's investigators are claiming they did nothing wrong. Gregg Jarrett and Alan Dershowitz are here with their expert legal analysis. And President Trump delivers a major national security speech on putting America first. Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton reacts. But first, a high-speed train derailment in the State of Washington. Investigators are on the scene. Joining us now with the latest details is Dan Springer. Dan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes. Judge Jeanine, a horrible and tragic day here in Western Washington. As the Washington State patrol has confirmed three fatalities, but the Associated Press is reporting six, at least six, and the discrepancy could be that three have been pulled from the wreckage, but there could be three bodies still inside some of those cars. You can see behind me dangling off of a trestle here about 50 miles South of Seattle over a I-five. That train derailed at about 7:40 this morning at the height of rush hour traffic. Speed might be a factor. They will definitely going to look at the speed of the train. There were multiple reports that this train was traveling upwards of 80 miles an hour, about a quarter mile away from where it went off the tracks and where it went off the tracks, there is a very sharp curve. So, when investigators get here a little bit later tonight, they will be looking at a number of things but including the speed. There were 77 people on the train and five crew members. Thirteen of the 14 train parts, the cars in the engines came off the tracks, many of them came on the highway down below. Five cars and two semi-trailers were hit by train parts and train pieces as they were coming down off that trestle and there were injuries, but no fatalities among people on the ground. But again, the job right now -- they have a lot of heavy machinery here. They are trying to stabilize those railcars that are still dangling off that trestle to try to shore up enough to be able to get inside and retrieve the final victims of this horrible train accident that happened this morning. And again, this was something that -- this was an inaugural run of this train route from Seattle down to Portland. They had this high-speed rail line and the whole idea was to shave about 15 minutes off of the run from Seattle to Portland and there were many people who were upset about this and they warned about something like this happening. So, that will all be part of the investigation as we look forward. Jeanine, back to you."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. Dan, thanks so much. And this weekend, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team came under fire over how they obtained emails from the Trump transition team. Joining us now live from the White House is Ed Henry. Ed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Judge, good to see you. Democrats are trying to pour gasoline on this fire by spreading rumors that the President may try to fire Robert Mueller and the President insists that is not true, though his allies outside the White House are trying to undermine the Special Counsel's credibility. In fact a lawyer for the President's transition to power is trying to make the case Mueller himself tainted the probe by obtaining tens of thousands of emails from the time period between the election and the inaugural. Mueller did this not by issuing a subpoena that would be known to the Trump legal team, but instead went directly to the general services administration which helps manage bureaucratic functions, including the transition. Trump for America Incorporated Counsel Kory Langhofer declaring that career government workers, potentially hostile to the President, quote, \"Unlawfully produced transition private materials, including privileged communications to the Special Counsel's office.\" Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Special Counsel pushed back, quote, \"When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owners consent or appropriate criminal process.\" But Alan Dershowitz a long time Democrat says, this was a close legal call, so it was foolish for Mueller to fail to make this airtight by seeking an easily obtainable warrant. Dershowitz adding, Mueller should have immediately disclosed to the public he had in fact removed FBI agent Peter Strzok from the case because of anti-Trump text messages rather than waiting a couple of months. Here's Dershowitz."

      "utterance": "I think he has a credibility problem. He should have been more careful about who he hired. He has been conducting a sloppy investigation and that's a typical of him.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Now, another Democrat, Mark Penn who advised former President Bill Clinton has just conducted a poll for The Hill Newspaper that found 54 percent of the public believes that Mueller has conflicts of interest in this investigation. Sixty three percent of the public said the FBI is withholding key information about not just the Trump, but the Hillary Clinton investigations as well. Judge?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, Ed, thanks so much. And also tonight, The Wall Street Journal has a stunning new report about the text message between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI Lawyer Lisa Page. That's been getting a lot of attention. In a text from August, 2016, Strzok wrote, \"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office, that there's no way he gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before your 40.\" Fox News couldn't confirm, but believes the Andy reference in that text was referring to Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. And tonight, The Wall Street Journal is reporting, quote, \"An FBI agent's reference to an insurance policy in a much debated text message was meant to convey that the bureau needed to aggressively investigate allegations of collusion between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia, according to people familiar with his account.\" And joining us now with reaction is Fox News contributor, former Congressman Jason Chaffetz. Fox News contributor and former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. All right. Gregg, I am going to start with you first. Because, you know, Mueller is getting these records from the presidential transition team. I'm not sure that everybody understands how wrong this is. And you're going to tell us the legal aspect, but this is not government property."

    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "For several reasons these are private documents. First and foremost, the transition team is organized as a private nonprofit. And the chief records officer of the United States sent a letter to the GSA and all other agencies saying, remember these are private documents. They are nongovernment employees, therefore nongovernment property."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "So that means legally that Mueller just can't walk into the GSA and hand over these records from a custodian. Because the GSA doesn't own the records. The Trump transition team does and they are private. He has to get either a warrant from a judge or a subpoena from a grand jury. He got neither one of them, even the GSA admits they handed it over just based on the letter. Now, under the law that is excluded as evidence under the exclusionary rule, which you know. And if they also receive privileged documents which the transition team lawyer argues, those lawyers including Mueller can be disqualified and removed from the case."

      "utterance": "As I understand the law, and I defer to my colleague here, that when there is imminent harm that can be done, you can go into court and get an emergency restraining order.

And you know what, if it was a Democrat president and a Republican Department of Justice, you know, come on, if the tables were turned, everybody in Washington, D.C., would be yelling and screaming. But it's not, it's Donald Trump so they leave it alone and they let it keep going."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "I mean, the deep state is alive and well. Look, you get a letter from Director Mueller telling me to turn over those documents. You are not an attorney. They should have gotten some legal advice. Basically all GSA does is turn on the lights, provide some office space, give you a couple of I.D. badges and some computers to turn on and say, here, here are some office space that you don't have to go try to rent and figure this out during the critical time, but they didn't have the right to turn them over, they didn't have possession of them. It wasn't theirs to turn over."

      "utterance": "All right. But Greg, now you've got these lawyers on this Mueller team and they know that they are in possession of privileged information. They know it. They know the players, they know their jobs. So, shouldn't those lawyers be brought up before, you know, some grievance committee because they didn't notify the person. Look, we've got this stuff that is privileged, you have a right to at least argue that we don't have it."
    },

      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Every lawyer at DOJ knows that when you get a huge cache of documents, you have to set up what is called the tainted teams to make sure, a third-party team could go through the documents, segregate the privileged material from the legitimate material and make sure that the lawyers on the case don't ever see those privileged documents. And now according to the transition team lawyer, the folks at the Special Counsel's office admitted last Friday in a phone conversation, we didn't set up the taint team."
    },

Look, this bothers me too. I'm a Democrat, I'm not a Republican, but I want a fair, transparent investigation and I would also, as I've said here on this program, like Hillary Clinton investigated too. We have a lot to investigate and we need to get as much credibility as we can in Mueller's investigation."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

It was outrageous, but there was really nothing there. It seems that this really is winding down. And don't you think that the President now has some leverage on Mueller? Because he can bring them up on ethical charges without a doubt to me."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHOEN",

I really do believe that it is time for Attorney General Sessions to go. I don't think he's up for the job. Every time I see him he looked like he is some prisoner and the whole reason we have a special prosecutor is because we have an Attorney General who can't do his job. And we have deep-seated systemic problems within the Department of Justice. We need a real leader there that is going to take control and root out this Deep State and what they're doing, the tentacles that they have and until that happens, I think this is going to continue on. I really do."

Coming up, constitutional law Professor Alan Dershowitz says, Attorney General Jeff Sessions should un-recuse himself, that's interesting, in the Russia investigation. He joins us next.

Then I heard the same thing from baseball player who said when he protested a ball or a strike, he would get the next call. I think that's the tactic that is being used here. You continuously attack Mueller. You bring up every possible issue whether it be conflict of interest, hiring the wrong people, failing to get a warrant for the emails, using the dossier to get the national security warrant and Mueller, who is so concerned about his integrity and his reputation may very well be inclined to lean over backwards to show his fairness and to make a close call in favor of Trump rather than against Trump.

To counter Iran and block its path to a nuclear weapon, I sanctioned the Islamic revolutionary guard corps for its support of terrorism and I declined to certify the Iran deal to congress. We have dealt ISIS one devastating defeat after another. The coalition to defeat ISIS has now recaptured almost 100 percent of the land held by these terrorist in Iraq and Syria. Our campaign on maximum pressure on the North Korean regime has resulted in the toughest ever sanctions. We have united our allies in an unprecedented effort to isolate North Korea. For the first time ever American strategy now includes a serious plan to defend our homeland. It calls for the construction of a wall on our southern border ending chain migration and the horrible visa and lottery programs. In addition, our strategy calls for us to confront, discredit and defeat radical Islamic terrorism and ideology. And to prevent it from spreading into the United States. America will lead again.

That strategy document is informed first and foremost, we began with his campaign speeches. We continued with his major foreign policy addresses of 2017 and of course all of his actions in 2017 to change the course of American foreign policy. So he wanted to both talk to the American people about strategy or at least the new strategy document. As I say it's a strategy that has already had been in operation for this year. And to give a report card to say to them this is what I've been doing. This is what we've accomplished. This is the path that we are taking going forward."

A lot of the reason why that campaign accelerated so quickly this year was a fundamental change in strategy including loosening various rules that had micromanaging decisions being made here at the White House as opposed to devolved down to commanders in the field to make the decisions that they best so fit. So we have seen a really rapid degradation of ISIS capabilities in the Middle East. And almost the destruction of the physical caliphate. He said nearly 100 percent. I said almost. We don't want to say we are all the way there yet, but certainly we are miles ahead of where we work when this administration came into office. That is very important, because while it will be difficult to fully eradicate ISIS as a group, when they don't control territory, population centers and resources, their ability to project power and threaten us at home or at our installations overseas is reduced dramatically."

I want to talk about the latest story that it appears that the Obama administration in their efforts to get this Iran deal past basically a passed on Hezbollah and let them off the hook.

Look, Hezbollah has been an Iranian directed terrorist group even and its constituent parts before Hezbollah itself came together. The bombing of the marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 was in Iran-directed operation. This is the A-team of international terrorism and Obama appeased it, because he didn't want to do anything that might offend the Ayatollahs in Tehran. This is just the piece of the record. There is so much that Obama gave away to get that deal that when the full record is laid out Americans will be appalled."

They put their lives at stake, they've got undercover people. All kinds of information and assets out there that they are trying to protect and the Obama administration is delaying or rejecting their efforts and the worst part of it is that you know 60,000 Americans die every year of drug overdoses. And while these people are bringing in cocaine into the United States, the President of the United States is saying just ignore it. Let it pass."

This is, as you are pointing out very graphically, sacrificing key American interests in order to make the Iranians happier to come to this deal. There wasn't anything Obama wasn't prepared to give away and he came very close to giving away the entire story, this deal was made in heaven for the Iranians. Obama was happy to solve it, because fundamentally he didn't think that they were the problem. He thought once he could show that America didn't have a hostile intent that the ayatollahs would join the civilized world and everything would be happy. Since they signed the deal in December of 2015 that has not happened. His premises were wrong, his negotiation was bad. This deal is terrible and I hope the next demonstration of the American first strategy that we see is the President rejecting the deal in its entirety."

I mean, he laid-back for everybody. But there's got to be Americans out there whose kids died at about that time from overdoses, we have to be infuriated. Talk about blood on the President's hands. I mean this is a lot, it's a lot clearer here. But I want to talk about someone else now. I'm going to ask that they put the sound on Clapper.

And he calls and says thank you in this guy Clapper criticizes the President. Here's my take on this. Do you remember when the Russians told the FBI about the brothers in the Boston bombing? They said it once and the FBI didn't listen. And then they called them again and the FBI said they didn't give us specific information. It got to give the Russians credit. They listened to the CIA and they stopped the attack on the church."

I hope that is something the Justice Department is looking into. But to come back to General Clapper, I'm not holding my breath. To come back to General Clapper. He just accuse the President of treason essentially. He saying that he is a wedding Russian agent. If he is got evidence for that I would like to hear it. This paranoia really is causing enormous negative consequences for our Democratic institutions and to go back to your earlier discussion about the independent counsel, unless there is evidence of collusion of which we have seen none so far, I really think there's got to be a way to draw this investigation on that score to an end. And relate to narrow Mueller's -- the dimension of Mueller's probe. It is a real danger in this independent counsel's. They are out of control, they are not supervised. It's dangerous."

And you can follow me on twitter @JudgeJeanine. I will be back for Sean on Wednesday night filling in for him. We hope you will join us then as well. Have a great night.
