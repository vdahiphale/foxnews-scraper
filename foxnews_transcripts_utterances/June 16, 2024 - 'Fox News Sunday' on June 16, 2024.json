There's a piece in foreign affairs and it cites the numerous testimony he's given over the last few months. They say under this headline: The terrorism warning lights are blinking red again. They say it echoes of the run-up to 9/11. It's not difficult to imagine a person or even a group with the intent to do harm slipping across the border and carrying out a large massacre. Wray himself says he is hard-pressed to think of a time in his career where there have been more national security issues at a higher level than they are right now. You serve on Intel.

I mean, remember, the perpetrators of 9/11 pulled off the most spectacular terrorist attack against the United States from inside the United States, on student visas. So, yes, the fact that there are lots of people who -- who are here on an undocumented basis is a threat and the FBI director is right about that, and the FBI director and the chiefs of all of the intelligence community are very, very focused. Underlying this, of course, is the conflict in Israel and Gaza which has sort of activated radical Islamic terrorists. They more than ever before would like to undertake an attack in a spectacular way. The other thing going on, of course, is that over time we have gradually shifted our attention to China and, of course, to Russia. And, you know, to some extent, it's a little bit of a zero-sum game. If you're really focused on China, which I think is appropriate, if you're really focused on supporting the Ukrainians, which is appropriate, inevitably, there is a little bit less -- fewer resources devoted to count -- the counterterrorism mission.",

A federal source tells FOX that these eight men were, quote, fully vetted at the border. The acting director of ICE says right now it's common for people to be there and we don't have full information on them. So I think the question after DHS, also, their inspector general report out just a few days ago says the vetting process is not what it needs to be at the border. Instead of absolutely just saying we're not going to let these folks into the country, we may have questions, we don't know everything about them, I think the question most Americans have is why were they not deported, detained and we can talk about the overflowing detention facilities. But why is the answer to just release them into the United States?",

The issue was that when their identities were determined, we did not have derogatory information on them. Now, that's sort of a, you know, an inevitable aspect of you never have perfect information, right? Well, over time, an American should be very proud of the caliber of the work that their law enforcement and intelligence did, over time, it became evident that these individuals actually had connections and were communicating in ways that were concerning. And so, of course, all of a sudden, eyes on to those individuals and so, again, it's, you know, no vetting system is perfect and the problem is not with the vetting, it's with the fact that your database is never complete no matter how good you are. Now Americans should take some comfort in the fact that the moment these guys started communicating and doing suspect things, we were all over them. Now, it doesn't mean that we don't need to double down on this stuff, but the fact is -- and, by the way, I should mention, Shannon, you know, there's always a tension between arrest the guys immediately which is, of course, the safest thing to do, versus let's surveil them and see who else they're talking to. Do they have connections? Can they point us to other people that we should be looking after? And I think have -- being familiar with the case, I think they made the right decision to watch, to learn, to listen to figure out who they else they were talking to, and then when the moment was right, to make those -- to make those arrests.",

But you mentioned, there are worries and Director Wray has mentioned this, too, that October 7th, that attack would inspire other people to do things within this country. Right now, we're watching to see if a ceasefire comes together there, but at the same time, we're learning from reporting at \"The Wall Street Journal\" that they have text from Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, saying things about the necessary deaths of civilians to benefit Hamas from a -- some texting earlier this year. They say this: Sinwar in a message urged his comrades in Hamas's political leadership outside Gaza not to make concessions. High civilian casualties would create worldwide pressure on Israel, he said. Again, other communications saying that he sees these deaths as necessary sacrifices to benefit Hamas. How can we expect Israel to negotiate with Hamas knowing those things?",

Think about the hundreds of miles of tunnels that are very, very hard to access in Gaza, not a single civilian, not a single person in Gaza has access to those tunnels. And so, again, we've known for a very long time that Hamas uses civilians as human shields and, frankly, you know, I'm not surprised about Sinwar's point of view. I think he understands that when peace comes, over time, maybe not immediately, but Hamas will never again be allowed by anyone, Israel or the rest of the world, to run Gaza. So that's a huge impediment to his doing a deal, but no surprise that he would deliberately seek to create a humanitarian catastrophe. Now, look at the end of the day, we saw eight Israeli soldiers die yesterday. This is a war that is taking a huge toll on both sides and, you know, it's always a good idea to maintain negotiations to try to stop that kind of violence. So, you know, how you negotiate is a very complicated thing. There's a reason we haven't seen a deal agreed to yet. But, you know, Bill Burns of the -- of the CIA, and others are working very, very hard to try to get to a situation where Hamas is out of the picture, and where there are just a lot fewer Israelis and Palestinians dying. Okay, I want to talk about foreign policy more broadly because the president obviously has been in the world stage this week, bringing together a bilateral deal, 10-year security guarantees for Ukraine. I talked to at least one senator who thinks it looks an awful lot like a treaty something that they should be, you know, having the privilege and the duty to put through a two-thirds vote here on Capitol Hill. That's not happening. It looks like it was structured maybe to go around that. But I want to talk about overall how the president -- president is doing. We have conflicts around the world. Americans, in part, elected President Biden on the reassurance that he would restore us to norms, to calm. But here's what political -- excuse me, Democratic pollster and strategist Doug Schoen writes: Ultimately, when Americans go to the ballot box in November, one question they will ask themselves is whether or not the world is safer than it was four years ago. Right now, the polls make it clear that no, Americans don't feel that the world is safer, nor do they trust the current administration to make it safe. \"Politico\" quotes Ian Bremmer over at the Eurasia Group: If this election is at all about foreign policy, Biden's going to lose. You know, this is something that's going to come up in the debate less than two weeks from now. How should President Biden answer which you can imagine are going to be claims by President Trump, that there are new wars started under his administration, that he's not managing the world stage well.",

But look, if you want to sort of overlay the very complicated situation in the world with sort of partisan talking points, you could say, gosh, yeah, there are more wars globally than there were four years ago. Well, I don't know that it's President Biden's fault that Putin decided to attack Ukraine.

You know, the excitement that night at our event in North Dakota when he beat Hillary Clinton was -- it was electric. And, of course, serving underneath him for four years as a governor was fantastic. It was like a breeze at your back. And then we had to serve under Joe Biden, and that's been like having a gale force wind in your face. But during the time that Biden's been in office, I had a great relationship, the First Lady and I, with the White House and with the President during the time as a governor and a president and gained a ton of respect. Cabinet visits to North Dakota, record number 19 Cabinet visits. The President was in North Dakota three times. The Vice President was there. So a great relationship.

Their numbers show that more and more people think that Russia is winning that war. Essentially, those numbers have changed. And far fewer feel like Ukraine is actually winning the war.

Eight points since November and 12 points since last summer. Only two in ten think Ukraine is currently winning, which is down 15 points in the last six months. It opens the president up to these arguments that he does too little, too late, so often in what's happening in Ukraine. You know, looking at the -- at the Reagan's you pulled, the thing that struck me was that Democrats, in this poll, had more allegiance to Reagan's principles on foreign policy than Republicans did. When you talk about greater engagement in the world, including in Ukraine, about two-thirds of Democrats supported that idea, just under half of Republicans did. So it's politically a changed world.

I want to start there because FBI Director Christopher Wray has -- he's issued numerous warnings in recent months and years about the porous border that we have and that is a national security interest, an issue. There's a piece in foreign affairs and it cites the numerous testimony he's given over the last few months."

      "speaker": "They say under this headline",
      "utterance": "The terrorism warning lights are blinking red again. They say it echoes of the run-up to 9/11. It's not difficult to imagine a person or even a group with the intent to do harm slipping across the border and carrying out a large massacre. Wray himself says he is hard-pressed to think of a time in his career where there have been more national security issues at a higher level than they are right now. You serve on Intel. How worried are you about potentially millions of people in this country that we really don't know their full story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HIMES",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, it's not just that, Shannon, right? I mean, remember, the perpetrators of 9/11 pulled off the most spectacular terrorist attack against the United States from inside the United States, on student visas. So, yes, the fact that there are lots of people who -- who are here on an undocumented basis is a threat and the FBI director is right about that, and the FBI director and the chiefs of all of the intelligence community are very, very focused. Underlying this, of course, is the conflict in Israel and Gaza which has sort of activated radical Islamic terrorists. They more than ever before would like to undertake an attack in a spectacular way. The other thing going on, of course, is that over time we have gradually shifted our attention to China and, of course, to Russia. And, you know, to some extent, it's a little bit of a zero-sum game. If you're really focused on China, which I think is appropriate, if you're really focused on supporting the Ukrainians, which is appropriate, inevitably, there is a little bit less -- fewer resources devoted to count -- the counterterrorism mission."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Okay, and I want to get to all those things because of your unique position obviously on that particular committee, but before we leave the border, let's talk about this. A federal source tells FOX that these eight men were, quote, fully vetted at the border. The acting director of ICE says right now it's common for people to be there and we don't have full information on them. So I think the question after DHS, also, their inspector general report out just a few days ago says the vetting process is not what it needs to be at the border. Instead of absolutely just saying we're not going to let these folks into the country, we may have questions, we don't know everything about them, I think the question most Americans have is why were they not deported, detained and we can talk about the overflowing detention facilities. But why is the answer to just release them into the United States?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HIMES",
      "utterance": "Well, Shannon, remember and I think you put your finger on it here, the issue was not that they came across the border, although that that is an issue -- that is an issue, and the issue is not fundamentally with the vetting process per se. The issue was that when their identities were determined, we did not have derogatory information on them. Now, that's sort of a, you know, an inevitable aspect of you never have perfect information, right? Well, over time, an American should be very proud of the caliber of the work that their law enforcement and intelligence did, over time, it became evident that these individuals actually had connections and were communicating in ways that were concerning. And so, of course, all of a sudden, eyes on to those individuals and so, again, it's, you know, no vetting system is perfect and the problem is not with the vetting, it's with the fact that your database is never complete no matter how good you are. Now Americans should take some comfort in the fact that the moment these guys started communicating and doing suspect things, we were all over them. Now, it doesn't mean that we don't need to double down on this stuff, but the fact is -- and, by the way, I should mention, Shannon, you know, there's always a tension between arrest the guys immediately which is, of course, the safest thing to do, versus let's surveil them and see who else they're talking to. Do they have connections? Can they point us to other people that we should be looking after? And I think have -- being familiar with the case, I think they made the right decision to watch, to learn, to listen to figure out who they else they were talking to, and then when the moment was right, to make those -- to make those arrests."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think a lot of people have questions about what, quote, fully vetted means if these are the folks who are ending up here and who knows how many else. But you mentioned, there are worries and Director Wray has mentioned this, too, that October 7th, that attack would inspire other people to do things within this country. Right now, we're watching to see if a ceasefire comes together there, but at the same time, we're learning from reporting at \"The Wall Street Journal\" that they have text from Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, saying things about the necessary deaths of civilians to benefit Hamas from a -- some texting earlier this year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "They say this",
      "utterance": "Sinwar in a message urged his comrades in Hamas's political leadership outside Gaza not to make concessions. High civilian casualties would create worldwide pressure on Israel, he said. Again, other communications saying that he sees these deaths as necessary sacrifices to benefit Hamas. How can we expect Israel to negotiate with Hamas knowing those things?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HIMES",
      "utterance": "Yeah. No surprise, right? We have long known that Sinwar and Hamas in particular are just, you know, disgusting human beings. Think about the hundreds of miles of tunnels that are very, very hard to access in Gaza, not a single civilian, not a single person in Gaza has access to those tunnels. And so, again, we've known for a very long time that Hamas uses civilians as human shields and, frankly, you know, I'm not surprised about Sinwar's point of view. I think he understands that when peace comes, over time, maybe not immediately, but Hamas will never again be allowed by anyone, Israel or the rest of the world, to run Gaza. So that's a huge impediment to his doing a deal, but no surprise that he would deliberately seek to create a humanitarian catastrophe. Now, look at the end of the day, we saw eight Israeli soldiers die yesterday. This is a war that is taking a huge toll on both sides and, you know, it's always a good idea to maintain negotiations to try to stop that kind of violence. So, you know, how you negotiate is a very complicated thing. There's a reason we haven't seen a deal agreed to yet. But, you know, Bill Burns of the -- of the CIA, and others are working very, very hard to try to get to a situation where Hamas is out of the picture, and where there are just a lot fewer Israelis and Palestinians dying. Okay, I want to talk about foreign policy more broadly because the president obviously has been in the world stage this week, bringing together a bilateral deal, 10-year security guarantees for Ukraine. I talked to at least one senator who thinks it looks an awful lot like a treaty something that they should be, you know, having the privilege and the duty to put through a two-thirds vote here on Capitol Hill. That's not happening. It looks like it was structured maybe to go around that. But I want to talk about overall how the president -- president is doing. We have conflicts around the world. Americans, in part, elected President Biden on the reassurance that he would restore us to norms, to calm."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But here's what political -- excuse me, Democratic pollster and strategist Doug Schoen writes",
      "utterance": "Ultimately, when Americans go to the ballot box in November, one question they will ask themselves is whether or not the world is safer than it was four years ago. Right now, the polls make it clear that no, Americans don't feel that the world is safer, nor do they trust the current administration to make it safe. \"Politico\" quotes Ian Bremmer over at the Eurasia Group: If this election is at all about foreign policy, Biden's going to lose. You know, this is something that's going to come up in the debate less than two weeks from now. How should President Biden answer which you can imagine are going to be claims by President Trump, that there are new wars started under his administration, that he's not managing the world stage well."

    {
      "speaker": "HIMES",
      "utterance": "Well, first, Shannon, as a political matter, I think in 250 years of United States history, foreign policy has never been all that much of a -- of an influencer of American vote -- Americans votes, for better or for worse. But look, if you want to sort of overlay the very complicated situation in the world with sort of partisan talking points, you could say, gosh, yeah, there are more wars globally than there were four years ago. Well, I don't know that it's President Biden's fault that Putin decided to attack Ukraine. I don't think it's President Biden's fault that Hamas decided to perpetrate an appalling terrorist attack on Israel. And, in fact --"

He and I were both business guys running for the first time. I'd never met President Trump when I endorsed him, but I was excited about a business person being in the White House. And, of course, when he won that November same night, we won first time running for public office. You know, the excitement that night at our event in North Dakota when he beat Hillary Clinton was -- it was electric. And, of course, serving underneath him for four years as a governor was fantastic. It was like a breeze at your back. And then we had to serve under Joe Biden, and that's been like having a gale force wind in your face. But during the time that Biden's been in office, I had a great relationship, the First Lady and I, with the White House and with the President during the time as a governor and a president and gained a ton of respect. Cabinet visits to North Dakota, record number 19 Cabinet visits. The President was in North Dakota three times. The Vice President was there. So a great relationship.

He's nothing like he's portrayed in the press. And so if you asked me that same question today, I'd be like, absolutely, I would do business with him. Because think about how successful he's been, whether it's a -- whatever it is, I mean, whether it's in TV, real estate, politics, all the things that he's done, the guy knows how to get it done. And I think every American should be, I don't know, we should be grateful that we've got someone who's willing, with that kind of talent from the private sector that's willing to put himself back into the presidential race again."

He's talked a lot about things he would like to do, and you echo this, too, deregulation and other things. But when it comes to his overall economic plan, there are some questions. Critics say things like mass deportation is going to up the cost of labor, that new tariffs on imported goods will raise prices, and that domestic suppliers may then try to match those prices, raising the prices overall. \"Punchbowl\" said on Friday that when President Trump was here meeting with lawmakers, they said that he, quote, \"loves tariffs,\" and even floated replacing the income tax with the revenue from tariffs. But Michael Strain over at the \"American Enterprise Institute,\" not a liberal-leaning group, says, \"I think we can say with a lot of confidence that President Trump's trade policies and immigration policies would result in price spikes.\" You know that's the last thing Americans want right now.

I mean, we've got the largest economy in the world, all kinds of countries around the world, and it's not just China, but France and others. They put tariffs on American products going their way, and it's pretty simple for President Trump. If you're going to tariff our stuff, we're going to tariff yours. And I think that he's then negotiating on behalf of American workers and American companies when he does that. And I think it's also, again, he understands how to use power. You know, diplomatic, informational, our economic -- economic power is sometimes more powerful than military power. He knows how to wield that, and he's going to be able to drive solutions that benefit America and benefit American workers."

They say that he and others have witnessed you taking a sharp tack to the right on energy issues, echoing the oil industry's attacks on the Biden administration after entering your second term in office and getting ready for a presidential run.

But of course, that's not -- none of those phrases are accurate. In North Dakota, we've been pro-energy all along, but we've been pro- innovation, not pro-regulation. I think that drives some people on the left crazy, because they want to regulate the U.S. energy business out of business. And of course, that's fundamental to both our economy and to national security. When you drive American energy supply down, you drive price up. That hurts every American. It's the core piece of inflation, because energy is embedded in everything. But the worst part about the Biden energy policy is, I don't know if it was written by China, Iran, Russia, Venezuela. They're the countries that are all benefiting, our adversaries. We're in two proxy wars. We're in a war with Iran and we're in a war with Russia, and they are literally funding those wars with Biden's energy policy."

For Iran to have their production way up, and places like North Dakota have production down. And then they're bragging about that, like, oh, look at our production is up. It should be much higher. It's at the levels it's at in spite of the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration. And when the Biden administration does stuff like put a quote, \"Put pause on LNG exports,\" the only party that night was in the Kremlin. I mean, they had to have been celebrating. They had to have been like, oh, it worked. We're writing -- we continue to write the energy policy in the Biden administration for Russia. You know, he approved the Nord Stream 2. Trump canceled it. Trump was tough on Russia. And he understood that we could not have all of Western Europe, all our allies dependent on Russian energy, and of course, this whole war for Russia's being funded by his oil prices. We turned Russia into China's discount gas station. The whole thing is a disaster. Hurts the economy, hurts national security. And in North Dakota, we can produce low carbon fuels in North Dakota. If you want to have low carbon intensity fuels, let's do it with innovation. The subsidies around EV cars, that's Team China. Low carbon liquid fuels is Team USA. We're already doing it in North Dakota."

Most Republicans, few Democrats, have been very critical of what the President's doing. He had this recent executive order. He made people, it seems like, mad on the left and the right. We understand there's more coming. Now, many of the executive actions President Trump took during his time were discarded by the Biden administration when he showed up. It's easier to do that than it is to overcome something obviously passed legislatively. The White House says this has got to be solved by Congress. President Trump was in the White House and had the House and the Senate, and this didn't get solved. So, what would a Trump administration, maybe a Trump-Burgum administration do to actually solve concrete problems at the border?"

Effectively, what the Biden administration has done with their lack of support for law enforcement at the border is the same thing that the Blue Cities have done. They've defunded the police. I've had an opportunity to be down on the border, more than Biden, more than Harris. We've had North Dakota troops down there, National Guard troops supporting the efforts to keep our country secure almost entirely during the Biden administration. And when you're down there and seeking the ground truth and you see the challenge we have here, I mean, just my last trip down there, you know, huge increase in people coming from China, people from 140 countries. The number -- we've just seen this week where ISIS members in the United States, I mean, the possibility of a 9/11 type terror attack happening in our country has gone up dramatically, and I think the American people are ready to get behind a president who says we're going to make sure we can't have national security unless we have border security, and we can make that happen on day one.

I mean, and while he was in France, he spoke about democracy a couple times. He had a chance to visit with the veterans who helped win the war, the World War II, 80 years ago. And that gave him a chance to say, look, these are the stakes. This is who I am. But there's no question that there's concern in Europe about what's going to happen in the U.S. election, and that Joe Biden can't necessarily assure them that the assurances or that the promises that he makes now is commander-in-chief, and that the principles or the policies that he's putting in place will still be there if he's not -- if he's not elected in November."

      "utterance": "Yes. And one of those things was this 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukraine, which as I mentioned earlier, had at least one senator say to me, that feels like a treaty. That feels like something we should be approving here, but it doesn't have the same teeth. And so if President Trump is re-elected and he doesn't like it, that may go away. I want to put this up from Ronald Reagan Institute's summer survey on Ukraine and how people think that we're doing. Their numbers show that more and more people think that Russia is winning that war. Essentially, those numbers have changed. And far fewer feel like Ukraine is actually winning the war. We'll put that up when we get that. But in the meantime, Susan, I mean, it kind of highlights that it's you see here, \"Four in ten now say Russia is winning up. Eight points since November and 12 points since last summer. Only two in ten think Ukraine is currently winning, which is down 15 points in the last six months. It opens the president up to these arguments that he does too little, too late, so often in what's happening in Ukraine. You know, looking at the -- at the Reagan's you pulled, the thing that struck me was that Democrats, in this poll, had more allegiance to Reagan's principles on foreign policy than Republicans did. When you talk about greater engagement in the world, including in Ukraine, about two-thirds of Democrats supported that idea, just under half of Republicans did. So it's politically a changed world. You know, I don't think that President Biden would have chosen to be staking part of his presidency on a war between Russia and Ukraine, but those are the cards that he's been dealt this year."

More than half of Americans, 56 percent do not believe the U.S. has a clear strategy for managing its relationship with China. Well, only about a quarter, 27 percent think it does. Those numbers haven't shifted since 2022.

So the sentiment here is very clear. And the U.S., not only in terms of President Biden, but congressional delegations that have visited, have said explicitly that Taiwan is important to the United States. And I think what you've seen from the Biden administration is a creation of an alliance with the Japanese, the South Koreans, even to Australia, and saying, we will potentially stay in militarily against China. I think that's why the Chinese, for a while, were so upset. They weren't talking to our military. So I don't think it's the case that we're weaker. I think it's the case that China, especially with their economic problems right now, is in a little bit of tumult."

      "utterance": "-- for people. And I don't think we're going to have any of that this time. We'll talk about pressure for retirement on the justices in just a second. But first, I want to get to the recordings this week of the Chief Justice and -- of Justice Alito and his wife. Peggy Noonan writing in the \"Wall Street Journal,\" an opinion piece says, \"There was something quite inhuman in what the left-wing activists did. She acted out admiration to perform a reputational harm. She presented herself falsely to inflict damage that the content she produced was disseminated by honest grown-up journalists is to their discredit.\" Kevin."

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "It's such a Washington thing to do, to go into - and I would - I would hopefully criticize someone on my side of the political aisle the same way. It really is inhumane. And the other thing I would connect this too, Shannon, is, and this actually is a poetical motivation for many Senate right voters, is we still don't have any real understanding of who leaked the draft decision last year. We really have had no justice for the people who have gone out to the homes, the private residences of members of the court. This is the kind of thing that's got to come to an end in America. Whether we're liberal or conservative or somewhere in the middle, this is not how this country should be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, the woman who got these recordings, Lauren Windsor, she had a ticket. She was rightfully there. D.C. is a one-party consent city where essentially you can record somebody else. So, there was nothing criminal or illegal here. And she thinks the outrage over this is misplaced. Here's what she said."

    {
      "speaker": "LAUREN WINDSOR, LIBERAL ACTIVIST, SECRETLY RECORDED SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO",
      "utterance": "I wish that they were more shocked about the ethics breaches at the Supreme Court than some lies that I told them in order to elicit truths that serve the - the greater public good."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So, Susan, she said she was doing an important job as a journalist and we should be more upset about what was said than the way she got the comments. SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": You know, she was acting as a journalist would act. Journalists do not lie about who they are and misrepresent themselves the way she did. She was acting as an activist, as she has a right to do that. I am not dismayed or all wrought up about Mrs. Alito's views. And it seems to me she's a person who's entitled to have her views and express them. I do think this feeds into the general deterioration of trust in the Supreme Court. The sense that the Supreme Court is somehow above politics, we are through with that. We now see - I think many Americans, most Americas now see the court as just another political player in Washington. And that could have some real devastating consequences as controversial decisions come forward probably in the next few weeks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And I think there are members of the court who will express, privately and maybe some publicly as well, that they feel these attempts will - will undermine the court. And that could be a problem if this country, at some point, needs to rely on the court to hold things together in a real crisis. Senator Dick Durbin, though, who - a Democrat, obviously, and he chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, \"the ethics crisis at the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, is unacceptable. I tis unsustainable. And it is unworthy of the highest court in the land.\" Juan, you know, he's pushing legislation again to try - to do summing about that. But even he said he wasn't comfortable with the way that this tape came about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. And I think everybody on this panel has said it's, you know, it's a little discomforting to know people come and try to perpetrate a fraud to get your opinions. Look, the fact is, from the Democrat's point of view, you can't get the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to come to Capitol Hill and talk about this credibility crisis for the court, which is very real. Even this week we saw more financial disclosures about money going to Justice Thomas."

But looking forward, Shannon, I thank you look at this week, you look at the cases that remain right now, specifically, most importantly, the immunity case. What will Alito and Thomas say? How can the American people say, oh, yes, we trust what these two men are saying as impartial and adherent to the law and not to their political associations. You know, it's the same thing with the guns issue that's coming up. The guns case. This is about whether people who have been convicted of domestic violence are allowed to have guns. Well, my God, you know, look at what happened on the abortion case. Now you're going to give guns potentially to people who -"

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, let me finish with one other thought on the bump stocks case that happened this week. They said, oh, yes, you can have basically a machine gun that's used in mass murder. You think, what is going on with this court!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. OK. Let me just clarify a couple of things. First of all, they said that under the statutory language that these bump stocks didn't qualify as a machine gun. That if Congress wants to clarify that they, they can. It's up to Congress, not to them, to legislate from the bench. And on the abortion pill case this week, 9-0. They left that case alone. They left the access there. Does that not give you confidence that these men and women can be impartial when it comes to tough issues?"
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "utterance": "Right, it was."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "It had nothing to do - it did not help us to have a better understanding of how, you know, does government have a role in a woman's right to have a choice about contraception or abortion. It did not. This is about standing. Those people didn't have any standings to bring the case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "But if they weren't fair and honest brokers, couldn't a couple of those justices have said, in a dissenter, or somewhere else to say, like, no, we should have taken this case. This pro-life doctors did have standing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "speaker": "BREAM",

      "utterance": "Well, I think that people will say too, no one's below the law. I think that they're going to split the baby somewhere. I don't know, sitting through the arguments, it seems like they're not going to give either side complete and total immunity for anything you could ever do in the presidency and no coverage whatsoever."

Up next, former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison joins us to talk about his new book chronicling his time in office and opens up about how his faith guided him through some very dark times."

The 260-year-old official ceremony celebrates the monarch's birthday each summer, no matter when their actual birthday falls on the calendar. I keep forgetting he's king now! All right, former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison's out with a new book detailing his toughest challenges while in office. In \"Plans for Your Good: A Prime Minister's Testimony of God's Faithfulness,\" Morrison gets real about seeking help for his mental health and how his faith steadied him then and does now.

And I deliberately didn't want to do that because politics wasn't my life, my faith is, and my family is. I just wanted to share how God sustained me over this period of my life. And not just then but throughout the course of my life and - and to share some lessons from that and hopefully some encouragement for those who - who have a faith of their own but perhaps have questions about it. And hopefully that will be the result."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",

Whatever walk of life we're in, and we have a faith, then I - I believe we are sustained. We are encouraged. And it all these things and the challenges that come our way, I mean, your faith is personal. It's intended to be personal. And - and that, I think, is the real - the real advantage, the real benefit and blessing of - of talking about it in this way."

And during - in the wake of the Great Depression and when we had two prime ministers who died in office it was that serious. And so this was a pretty challenging time. When you're in the middle of it, you're very focused. You are solving the problems. You are making the decisions. And there is an adrenaline and a momentum which takes you from one to the other. But once the music stops, and you sit down and you start reflecting on this, I mean I think the emotional impact and a lot of the other things that was occurring at the time do wash over you. And that's an important part of your reflection."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "And I thought it was important to read what you said about this, that you ran hard at the challenges. You said what impacted you \"was the combination of pure physical exhaustion with the unrelenting and callous brutality of politics and media attacks. As a politician, I know this goes with the territory. That's not a complaint or even an accusation. It's just reality.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORRISON",
      "utterance": "Yes. When we're going through all that and we're getting to that final point, you know, that wasn't the challenge, it was the pile-on that would occur in the normal realm of politics. And politics now has become very personal. It's not about who's got the better ideas to run the country often. It's - it gets down to a personality slinging (ph) match. And pretty much now anything goes on that front. Once upon a time there used to be some guardrails for some civility in that. In the social media age, I mean I'm sure, you know, you - you struggles with that as a journalist, many journalists I know. You've got to balance the - the clicks with the - with the content. And - and the integrity challenges you have amongst that. I mean it's difficult for you guys as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, and the way that you talked about this, it did feel so raw and so brutal. And I wonder if you think now that this kind of thing will keep good people or people of faith or wherever they're coming from, from considering, you know, serving their country in some way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORRISON",
      "utterance": "Well, I hope - I hope it doesn't. But I think you've got to be open about it. But you've got to really, I think, be committed to that - that life of service. It does cost a lot. But, you know, I don't regret it for a second. I had - I had the opportunity to serve my country and to do some incredible things on behalf of my country. And I'm pleased about that opportunity. But it comes with working in a pretty brutal environment. So, my encouragement to particularly tell Christians, but not just Christians, but men, blokes as we call them in Australia is, you know, it's - there's nothing wrong with managing your health. Managing your physical health is as important as managing your mental health."
