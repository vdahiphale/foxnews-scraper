      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Thanks for being with us. What a busy news night. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" The FBI investigation is over. The results are in. The Senate's findings have been totally confirmed and Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an overwhelmingly qualified candidate for the United States Supreme Court. Now, he is backed by a long and extra ordinary track record. He is admired by his colleagues, well-liked by the community, loved by his family and friends, until 17 days ago. And the FBI inquiry showed once again that the allegations against him have zero corroboration. None. Instead, the claims are refuted, denied, by everyone who was interviewed. Now, the Democratic witch hunt is officially over. Their delay tactics have hit a dead end, but the crybaby smear merchants on the left -- they're still grandstanding. They're resistance holding protest on Capitol Hill. Senate Democrats bashing the FBI tonight in their investigation. Democrats across America -- well, they are extreme they worried because their shameful attempts to ruin a man's life for political gains have now been exposed. And we are just 33 days away from the important midterm elections, and what do we see in the polling tonight? Republican candidates are now surging. Truth, justice, common sense, it might prevail after all. Judge Kavanaugh is once again coming to his own defense and a brand-new op- ed just released. Now, sit tight, buckle up. It's time for our breaking news, busy news night, opening monologue.",

According to Senator Jeff Flake, a swing vote, the FBI's report revealed zero new evidence against Kavanaugh. Senator Collins of Maine, another crucial swing vote, praised the investigation for being very thorough. Here is bottom line. If both Flake and Collins vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh, he will be a Supreme Court justice. And today, at a very fiery press conference, Senate Republicans had this to say about the impending vote and this horrific process. Take a look. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R—K.Y., MAJORITY LEADER: What we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, R—IOWA, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: This is the 87th day -- that is three weeks longer than the average of the last three or four nominees to the Supreme Court. So, don't tell me we haven't spent enough time. What I have been dealing with since July 10th, the downhill slope that Schumer has put us on is really dealing with a demolition derby. They just about destroyed a good person, to be on the Supreme Court. SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R—TEXAS: A vote against Judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be a vote for abusing the confirmation process and a good person. And it will be a vote for the shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign. This is a search and destroy mission.

      "sentences": "Every one of these Democrats were against Judge Kavanaugh or anyone president Trump would have nominated to the court. On this program, while we have exposed the few, the few, top echelon, in the FBI that did abuse their power, we have always made a point almost on a nightly basis to stand up for the rank-and-file FBI agents, field agents, you know, the ones that risked their lives, like other law enforcement, for us, every single day. Including those that conducted the supplemental background check. The FBI acted in a fair, independent manner. Some on the left don't like the results. The calls for a more thorough investigation is beyond absurd. What is the FBI supposed to do? We don't have a location to investigate, no date to investigate. There's no physical evidence. There's no forensic evidence. And we don't even know the day of the week. And every single person that Professor Ford listed to corroborate her story denied any knowledge of her claims. And the one eyewitness that she listed, totally refuted her claim. Even her longtime friend had no idea what she was talking about. They all refuted her claims under penalty of perjury, now twice. The other allegations against Kavanaugh, they are even more shaky. The second accuser making decades-old claims that Kavanaugh had exposed himself as a freshman in college at a party. Well, she wasn't even sure that Kavanaugh was the perpetrator. Even \"The New York Times\" wouldn't publish her claims, and they searched far and wide for evidence to corroborate her story. They found nothing, except that she had been making calls to other Yale classmates at the time saying, I'm not sure it is him, do you remember? And the third accuser making systematic, drugging, gang rape allegation against teenage girls and her story has changed many times in about a week. She is facing serious credibility issues, and of course, represented by Michael Avenatti, you know, lawyer of the year. None of these allegations have dates, locations, witnesses, evidence, corroboration, of any kind, of any of these claims. So do Democrats really expect to be FBI to magically find decades-old evidence proving that Kavanaugh was an evil sexual predator, systemic gang rapist, somebody that drugged teenage girls. They really believe that the American people would suspend all decency, all common sense and a belief that a man with an impeccable 40-year track record was really secretly a monster in his youth and did this almost on a weekly basis? In reality, this has always been about politics and power. A delay tactic, a transparent attempt to literally ruin a man's life, destroy his family. Because they lost an election and they want the power. This has become a national disgrace. And in some cases, these political tactics worked. Democratic senator from North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp, by the way, now down 11 in the latest poll, claimed to be an independent voice for the people of North Dakota. Tonight, we know she is nothing more than a shill for Schumer and the Democratic Party. Now, I guess she assumed she is not getting reelected, so she is trashing the will of her own constituents in voting no. Then you got John Donnelly, Indiana, also a \"no\" vote. By the way, he's up for reelection in 33 days. By the way, Indiana voters, you can send him a message and get out and vote. We are seeing the Democratic Party play -- literally, their playbook roll out in full force. Everything that we have chronicled on a regular basis on the show, we now begin our 23rd year on the FOX News Channel, 30 in radio. There's now a big crescendo into one of the most despicable displays in anything we have ever witnessed. And I warned you, they are going to try and bork Kavanaugh or whoever the president picked, and then bring back the Clarence Thomas tactics. The smear machine of the left is in full gear. They know no bounds. And some on the left are actually claiming, well, OK, our allegations didn't work, let's go after Judge Kavanaugh's temperament. That might be disqualifying. They're saying he was just too aggressive when defending himself against false allegations of drugging and gang raping teenage girls. Ask yourself this question. OK, how would you react if you were falsely accused of rape? Of drugging teenage girls, happened on an every weekend basis, gang raping them, boys lining up in the halls? How would you react? What is the appropriate reaction? How would you react if senators were on national TV calling you evil, comparing you to Bill Cosby, suggesting that you're guilty of serious crimes you never committed? Far left retired Justice John Paul Stevens weighing in: Oh, this should disqualify him from becoming a justice. This is the same radical former Supreme Court justice that doesn't believe in the Constitution. He once demanded the Second Amendment be repealed, and wrote that the election of George W. Bush violated our Constitution. And just moments ago, Judge Kavanaugh, in an op-ed just will released with \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he eloquently defended himself on the eve of what will be a historic vote. This is a tipping point for this country. He talked about these ridiculous allegations. He wrote, quote: After all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded, I was subjected to wrongful, sometimes vicious, allegations. My time in high school and college, more than 30 years ago, has been ridiculously distorted. My wife, my daughters have faced vile and violent threats. And against that backdrop, I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family, my good name, my lifetime of public service. My hearing testimony was forceful and passionate. That is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegations against me. He continued: Yes, I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. Well, I know that my tone was sharp, I said a few things I should not have said. He did apologize once in the hearings. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, a husband, a dad, and I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all, my two daughters. Sadly, this kind of common sense and logic and decency from Judge Kavanaugh, it means nothing to the left. How would you respond? By the way, it means nothing to their cohorts, their friends, in the mainstream media. You got all the people on the left whining, crying, complaining, those that believe in guilt by accusation -- just doing what they do best today, feigning outrage. By the way, when did any of these people on the Judiciary Committee, the snowflakes on the floor of the Senate being taken out all day, did they ever protested Bill Clinton like this? Did they ever stand up for Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones? Oh, that's right, Dianne Feinstein, who recommended Debra Katz -- well, Debra Katz didn't believe in Paula Jones. It was only ten or 12 minutes. So, you have a lot of hypocrisy, feigned, selective moral outrage. And today, you have far left protesters erupting all over Capitol Hill. And as you can imagine, emotions were running high. Logic was running very low. Even sent our own Griff Jenkins down to the middle of all of this in the middle of the mob, asking these people what they thought about due process, the presumption of innocence, the rule of law. The answers will stun you, take a look.",

It's sad, it's shocking, and it's frankly beyond chilling. Coming up, we are going to have a lot more of Griff, including his full interview with Senator Elizabeth Warren. Today, she led this horde of demonstrators demanding that Kavanaugh's life and reputation continue to be destroyed without these fundamental beliefs that we as Americans should all share regardless of political orientation. You have to have some corroboration. There's got to be some evidence, some presumption of innocence. The only good news tonight is the left -- well, they officially have been officially exposed to the American people. See those protesters? You are looking at the modern radical left Democratic Party, and the media, the party of double standards. The party of smears, lies, character assassinations, family bludgeoning with no plans to offer the hardworking, law-abiding, taxpaying citizens, you, the American who make this country the single greatest, best, last great hope for man on this earth. Look what they do. The people, that's not the people of this country. That is one party, though sadly, that has abandoned any sense of fundamental decency, fairness, and common sense. Now, thankfully, you, the American people, it has now awoken a lot of people in this country. Look at this Rasmussen poll on President Trump, it's his highest approval rating ever. According to an NPR poll of all places, remember the Democratic enthusiasm, blue wave edge that they had? It's totally evaporated. Today, at this hour, we are seeing the chaos, the mayhem, the madness, the insanity. You got the leaders of the Democratic Party, full on assault on the integrity of the FBI. They have so convinced their party activists about guilt upon accusation, that that's fine in America. No due process is fine in America. No presumption of innocence is fine. How does that work for you and your family in your life? Slander, smear, character assassination, that's one party in America today. Great job, Dianne Feinstein, Chuckie Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters. Do you want them in power in 33 days? Now, the American people, now that the people that they're leading causing pandemonium in our nation's capital because their so-called leaders convinced them that guilt by accusation is okay. That defining someone as a rapist, a gang rapist, a drugger of teenage girls without cooperation in America is okay? Well, those are the tactics of today's radical Democratic Party. This is why, for years, I had pointed this out on the show. This happens every two and four years, and now with every Supreme Court appointment, nearly everyone. They disseminated salacious lies about President Trump before and after the election. They advanced a bizarre conspiracy theories that one candidate actually paid for. Hookers urinating in beds, they talk about it as if its truth. They disseminated as propaganda before elections. They do it to start up a witch hunt investigation and conspiracy. They call people racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, that Republicans, conservatives want dirty air and water. We drink the water and breathe the air. They want children to die. Well, if you're only going to raise Medicare 7 percent a year, that means you want to throw your own grandmother off the cliff. We hear it every two and four years. And when these vile accusations of drugging, gang raping teenage girls without evidence, that's not to be believed by the FBI, these are the consequences? That's the reaction? Is this the party you want in power? You want to elect these people and 33 days? Look at your screen. High drama tonight with these four senators. They appear to hold the keys to the Kavanaugh vote. Are they going to give into this in new America of guilt by accusation, lying, smearing, slander, character bludgeoning? Of the last 17 days. Forget the last 40 years of this man's life. No corroboration. Are they going to give into this? Has any of this had any impact on those four senators? Do they believe in the presumption of innocence? That's their question tonight. Do they believe in due process, the rule of law? Do they have common sense and decency? Do they believe that you've got to have some corroboration? Do they believe in our great Constitution? Or are they going to reward forever the slanderous tactics of the hard left that only want power? Here with reaction, Fox News investigative reporter Sara Carter, the author of \"The Deep State: How an Army of Bureaucrats Protected Obama and Working to Destroy the Trump Agenda,\" Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz. Sara, let's begin with you. You saw this unfold today, it has been building, it looks like it comes down to three Republicans -- Murkowski, Collins, and Flake. And may be Joe Manchin, a Democrat, but I don't think he'll vote for Kavanaugh unless the Republicans have the vote already.",

The Senate's findings have been totally confirmed and Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an overwhelmingly qualified candidate for the United States Supreme Court. Now, he is backed by a long and extra ordinary track record. He is admired by his colleagues, well-liked by the community, loved by his family and friends, until 17 days ago. And the FBI inquiry showed once again that the allegations against him have zero corroboration. None. Instead, the claims are refuted, denied, by everyone who was interviewed. Now, the Democratic witch hunt is officially over. Their delay tactics have hit a dead end, but the crybaby smear merchants on the left -- they're still grandstanding. They're resistance holding protest on Capitol Hill. Senate Democrats bashing the FBI tonight in their investigation. Democrats across America -- well, they are extreme they worried because their shameful attempts to ruin a man's life for political gains have now been exposed. And we are just 33 days away from the important midterm elections, and what do we see in the polling tonight? Republican candidates are now surging. Truth, justice, common sense, it might prevail after all. Judge Kavanaugh is once again coming to his own defense and a brand-new op- ed just released. Now, sit tight, buckle up.

According to Senator Jeff Flake, a swing vote, the FBI's report revealed zero new evidence against Kavanaugh. Senator Collins of Maine, another crucial swing vote, praised the investigation for being very thorough. Here is bottom line. If both Flake and Collins vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh, he will be a Supreme Court justice. And today, at a very fiery press conference, Senate Republicans had this to say about the impending vote and this horrific process. Take a look. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R—K.Y., MAJORITY LEADER: What we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, R—IOWA, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: This is the 87th day -- that is three weeks longer than the average of the last three or four nominees to the Supreme Court. So, don't tell me we haven't spent enough time. What I have been dealing with since July 10th, the downhill slope that Schumer has put us on is really dealing with a demolition derby. They just about destroyed a good person, to be on the Supreme Court. SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R—TEXAS: A vote against Judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be a vote for abusing the confirmation process and a good person. And it will be a vote for the shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign. This is a search and destroy mission. This is not a search for the truth."

Senate Democrats who all demanded an FBI investigation to be done quickly with limited scope, just last week, they're now trashing that very same FBI investigation. New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, he called it a B.S. investigation on Twitter. Naturally, the whining continued when there's a television camera in front of these -- well, publicity hungry Democrats. Take a look. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D—N.Y., MAJORITY LEADER: We Democrats had many fears that this would be an all too limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting the facts. Having received a thorough briefing a few minutes ago, our fears have been realized. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D—CONN.: This set of interviews is, at best, most charitably, woefully incomplete.

      "utterance": "Every one of these Democrats were against Judge Kavanaugh or anyone president Trump would have nominated to the court. On this program, while we have exposed the few, the few, top echelon, in the FBI that did abuse their power, we have always made a point almost on a nightly basis to stand up for the rank-and-file FBI agents, field agents, you know, the ones that risked their lives, like other law enforcement, for us, every single day. Including those that conducted the supplemental background check. The FBI acted in a fair, independent manner. Some on the left don't like the results. The calls for a more thorough investigation is beyond absurd. What is the FBI supposed to do? We don't have a location to investigate, no date to investigate. There's no physical evidence. There's no forensic evidence. And we don't even know the day of the week. And every single person that Professor Ford listed to corroborate her story denied any knowledge of her claims. And the one eyewitness that she listed, totally refuted her claim. Even her longtime friend had no idea what she was talking about. They all refuted her claims under penalty of perjury, now twice. The other allegations against Kavanaugh, they are even more shaky. The second accuser making decades-old claims that Kavanaugh had exposed himself as a freshman in college at a party. Well, she wasn't even sure that Kavanaugh was the perpetrator. Even \"The New York Times\" wouldn't publish her claims, and they searched far and wide for evidence to corroborate her story. They found nothing, except that she had been making calls to other Yale classmates at the time saying, I'm not sure it is him, do you remember? And the third accuser making systematic, drugging, gang rape allegation against teenage girls and her story has changed many times in about a week. She is facing serious credibility issues, and of course, represented by Michael Avenatti, you know, lawyer of the year. None of these allegations have dates, locations, witnesses, evidence, corroboration, of any kind, of any of these claims. So do Democrats really expect to be FBI to magically find decades-old evidence proving that Kavanaugh was an evil sexual predator, systemic gang rapist, somebody that drugged teenage girls. They really believe that the American people would suspend all decency, all common sense and a belief that a man with an impeccable 40-year track record was really secretly a monster in his youth and did this almost on a weekly basis? In reality, this has always been about politics and power. A delay tactic, a transparent attempt to literally ruin a man's life, destroy his family. Because they lost an election and they want the power. This has become a national disgrace. And in some cases, these political tactics worked. Democratic senator from North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp, by the way, now down 11 in the latest poll, claimed to be an independent voice for the people of North Dakota. Tonight, we know she is nothing more than a shill for Schumer and the Democratic Party. Now, I guess she assumed she is not getting reelected, so she is trashing the will of her own constituents in voting no. Then you got John Donnelly, Indiana, also a \"no\" vote. By the way, he's up for reelection in 33 days. By the way, Indiana voters, you can send him a message and get out and vote. We are seeing the Democratic Party play -- literally, their playbook roll out in full force. Everything that we have chronicled on a regular basis on the show, we now begin our 23rd year on the FOX News Channel, 30 in radio. There's now a big crescendo into one of the most despicable displays in anything we have ever witnessed. And I warned you, they are going to try and bork Kavanaugh or whoever the president picked, and then bring back the Clarence Thomas tactics. The smear machine of the left is in full gear. They know no bounds. And some on the left are actually claiming, well, OK, our allegations didn't work, let's go after Judge Kavanaugh's temperament. That might be disqualifying. They're saying he was just too aggressive when defending himself against false allegations of drugging and gang raping teenage girls. Ask yourself this question. OK, how would you react if you were falsely accused of rape? Of drugging teenage girls, happened on an every weekend basis, gang raping them, boys lining up in the halls? How would you react? What is the appropriate reaction? How would you react if senators were on national TV calling you evil, comparing you to Bill Cosby, suggesting that you're guilty of serious crimes you never committed?"

You got all the people on the left whining, crying, complaining, those that believe in guilt by accusation -- just doing what they do best today, feigning outrage.

Did they ever stand up for Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones? Oh, that's right, Dianne Feinstein, who recommended Debra Katz -- well, Debra Katz didn't believe in Paula Jones. It was only ten or 12 minutes. So, you have a lot of hypocrisy, feigned, selective moral outrage. And today, you have far left protesters erupting all over Capitol Hill.

Today, she led this horde of demonstrators demanding that Kavanaugh's life and reputation continue to be destroyed without these fundamental beliefs that we as Americans should all share regardless of political orientation. You have to have some corroboration. There's got to be some evidence, some presumption of innocence. The only good news tonight is the left -- well, they officially have been officially exposed to the American people. See those protesters?

Now, thankfully, you, the American people, it has now awoken a lot of people in this country. Look at this Rasmussen poll on President Trump, it's his highest approval rating ever. According to an NPR poll of all places, remember the Democratic enthusiasm, blue wave edge that they had? It's totally evaporated. Today, at this hour, we are seeing the chaos, the mayhem, the madness, the insanity. You got the leaders of the Democratic Party, full on assault on the integrity of the FBI. They have so convinced their party activists about guilt upon accusation, that that's fine in America. No due process is fine in America. No presumption of innocence is fine. How does that work for you and your family in your life? Slander, smear, character assassination, that's one party in America today. Great job, Dianne Feinstein, Chuckie Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters. Do you want them in power in 33 days? Now, the American people, now that the people that they're leading causing pandemonium in our nation's capital because their so-called leaders convinced them that guilt by accusation is okay. That defining someone as a rapist, a gang rapist, a drugger of teenage girls without cooperation in America is okay? Well, those are the tactics of today's radical Democratic Party. This is why, for years, I had pointed this out on the show. This happens every two and four years, and now with every Supreme Court appointment, nearly everyone. They disseminated salacious lies about President Trump before and after the election. They advanced a bizarre conspiracy theories that one candidate actually paid for. Hookers urinating in beds, they talk about it as if its truth. They disseminated as propaganda before elections. They do it to start up a witch hunt investigation and conspiracy. They call people racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, that Republicans, conservatives want dirty air and water. We drink the water and breathe the air. They want children to die. Well, if you're only going to raise Medicare 7 percent a year, that means you want to throw your own grandmother off the cliff. We hear it every two and four years. And when these vile accusations of drugging, gang raping teenage girls without evidence, that's not to be believed by the FBI, these are the consequences? That's the reaction? Is this the party you want in power? You want to elect these people and 33 days? Look at your screen. High drama tonight with these four senators. They appear to hold the keys to the Kavanaugh vote. Are they going to give into this in new America of guilt by accusation, lying, smearing, slander, character bludgeoning? Of the last 17 days. Forget the last 40 years of this man's life. No corroboration. Are they going to give into this? Has any of this had any impact on those four senators? Do they believe in the presumption of innocence? That's their question tonight. Do they believe in due process, the rule of law? Do they have common sense and decency? Do they believe that you've got to have some corroboration? Do they believe in our great Constitution? Or are they going to reward forever the slanderous tactics of the hard left that only want power? Here with reaction, Fox News investigative reporter Sara Carter, the author of \"The Deep State: How an Army of Bureaucrats Protected Obama and Working to Destroy the Trump Agenda,\" Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz. Sara, let's begin with you. You saw this unfold today, it has been building, it looks like it comes down to three Republicans -- Murkowski, Collins, and Flake. And may be Joe Manchin, a Democrat, but I don't think he'll vote for Kavanaugh unless the Republicans have the vote already."

And some of them believe that Susan Collins may vote to pass confirmation for Kavanaugh, as well as Manchin. Manchin is up there. I think one of the interesting things about Manchin is he is in West Virginia. West Virginia where there's a lot of support for President Trump. He is sometimes called a Trump Democrat. So, I think that's what they are going to see here. Look, Sean, what we are hearing today, what we have seen over this last week, the op-ed that was written by Kavanaugh, I can't believe he didn't go further.

It is delineated in the newspaper as opinion. But on the news side, so many and so many organizations, they don't abide by that rule anymore. They are out there -- and, you now, its' undercutting the journalism industry, which already is one of the least trusted industries out there.

And that an accuser should never even be question, much less doubted. They attacked, at every turn, you know, Kavanaugh's temperament, they attacked his yearbook. They attacked his denial.

If there is no corroboration -- on any case, and just the opposite, the Professor Ford she identified an eyewitness to the alleged crime what she was talking. The eyewitness says it didn't happen. Why do so many people from the beginning, they said, we believe her. Well, there is no presumptive innocence there. There is no due process. They made up their mind without hearing anything.

You know, Sean, talking about the press, most of the mainstream press has been biased to the left for decades, we've known that. But what's different in the Trump era is the level and intensity of their advocacy and activism. So all of the facts that you just laid out there about Dr. Ford's testimony, the lack of corroboration and on substantiation, very little of that has been reported in the mainstream press because now the press is an active and proactive member of the left. And the left is at war for the future of the country. They are at war with a Constitution, free market economics, individual liberty.

I heard you're hanging out with my buddy, Michael (Inaudible) Mike. I love the guy, one of my best friends. When the president spoke on this issue Kavanaugh tonight, the reaction, from what I could hear, was one of the loudest of the night. Was that your perception?"

      "utterance": "Absolutely right, Sean. You know, people in Minnesota understand that there is a terrible double standard that the Democrats are foisting upon on the country right now. On the one hand, they are going after Judge Kavanaugh, who is a good man base on -- and they are doing it base on unsubstantiated allegations. On the other hand, we've got the deputy chair of the DNC, Keith Ellison, my opponent running for attorney general of the State of Minnesota, and there are credible allegations against him by two women, two women. We've got medical records, as well as a witness."

You know, in 33 days Minnesotans are going to go to the polls they are going to retire Keith Ellison from politics. It will be a great thing for the nation.

Should they be rewarded for what they have done? This has been a national disgrace where you don't have the presumption of innocence. All right. Thanks for being with us. We'll be back tomorrow night with some more answers. There's going to be a lot. Laura is next. We'll see you tomorrow. Laura?"
