Third, you need the ballistic missiles that will deliver them. The problem is that the Obama administration looked only at the fissile element. So technically speaking, you can say that, yes, it's a frozen program. They are not increasing the amount of enriched uranium.

Of course Obama and Kerry caved on that, never did. We are not allowed to inspect. We allow the Iranians to inspect themselves on Parchin, which was a joke. So yes, they are developing a nuclear weapon. It's a violation of the spirit of the agreement because of the way they look at it.

      "utterance": "The legal argument is sound. And it was clear from his tweets that he intends to, sort of, hasten the deadline and create this emergency about Congress making an effort after all the failure of repeal and replace effort by Republicans to come in and come up with something. It will be a repair job. It is not going to be an entirely new law. It's not going to be a repeal. There are bipartisan plans. The problem solvers caucus in the House came up with on in August. It was the basis for the bipartisan talks between Senator Alexander and Senator Murray. They have been ongoing. We don't know that the president has been so involved so much, but he's clearly calling on Congress to act. I think there are people who will be ready to step up. It will be hard for some Republicans to take part in this, thinking that it looks like they are saving Obamacare. They are not really happy with the fact that he did this and in some districts, swing districts, there are a lot of constituents that receive these CSR payments that help them afford very expensive coverage. It will very tough for them politically if something doesn't happen very soon."

This is the Senate minority leader's statement today, \"Republicans have been doing everything they can for the last 10 months to inject instability into our health care system and to force collapse through sabotage. Last night the president acted. The American people are the ones who will be hurt. Unless our Republican colleagues act the American people will know exactly where to place the blame when their premiums shoot up and when millions lose coverage.\" Matt."

      "utterance": "OK, Chuck and Nancy, the ball is in your court. You've watched Republicans try to figure out what their version of health care reform looks like. The Democrats were into #resistance, fight everything at all costs. Now the president is saying to them, taunting them a bit on Twitter, let's deal. You want to get the CSR payments done? I'm willing to talk. I think what you see is a White House and a president who is no longer going to take the word of congressional leadership that we'll get this all in one big package and we'll jam it through with Republican votes. On these key issues, he's going to take it step by step, he's going to get what he can, get what he can get done with the Republicans but also work with the Democrats. And you know what, that is lasting. The good side of that is this becomes law and maybe Congress starts to work."

And a court said last year that these payments were illegal because Congress had not authorized them. So here you have Trump reducing corporate welfare and upholding the rule of law, and he's being attacked for it."

Donald Trump is calling their bluff and saying, guess what, when it comes to immigration, when it comes to these type of appropriations, guess what, guys? The constitution says you have to act."

      "utterance": "Yes. That was the example is that if the president said don't give me the funds for the wall, I'll just do it by pen and phone, that probably wouldn't go over too well on Capitol Hill. I promised you'd hear from Charles Krauthammer. Our friend out colleague is still recovering after surgery and we miss his voice, especially on days like this. We miss his voice a lot. But back in April, we discussed the Iran nuclear deal and how Iran was in compliance technically. That is what the Europeans are saying today. Here's what Charles had to say about that."

      "speaker": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "There's no contradiction whatsoever in our position. You need three things to develop a usable nuclear weapon. Number one, you need the fissile material. Number two, you have to weaponize it. You have to make it explode. And that's what was revealed today, they've been working on this assiduously. Third, you need the ballistic missiles that will deliver them. The problem is that the Obama administration looked only at the fissile element. So technically speaking, you can say that, yes, it's a frozen program. They are not increasing the amount of enriched uranium. But what the Iranians are doing, and this is so obvious a child can see it, is that the program of the fissile material is frozen, they are working rapidly on the weaponization, which is the other part you need, and of course on the ballistic missiles, which we can see. The weaponization is in a military facility called Parchin. It was supposed to be investigated under the Obama administration and before the signing of the agreement to make sure it hadn't been used in the past for weaponization. Of course Obama and Kerry caved on that, never did. We are not allowed to inspect. We allow the Iranians to inspect themselves on Parchin, which was a joke. So yes, they are developing a nuclear weapon. It's a violation of the spirit of the agreement because of the way they look at it. In half a decade, they will be able to resume the fissile material, the enriching uranium, they will have it weaponized, and they will have the missiles."

A.B., this deal today was the president saying I don't want to recertify this every 90 days. Congress, if you want to act, act. But he also threatened if they don't change it substantially, that he will pull the U.S. out of the Iran deal."

      "speaker": "STODDARD",
      "utterance": "Right. So once again, the onus is completely on the Congress. And as I've said before, I don't have a lot of faith in the Congress doing anything in 60 days. But there are members like Senator Cotton and Senator Corker who are going to try to strengthen this deal. They've been speaking to the secretary of state about it, and they want to make it -- they want to place greater restrictions on. And they are watching the ICBM testing, the things that the Iranian regime is doing that violates the spirit but not per se the letter of the law. That is just going to be a really hard sell. It's really hard right now for them to do all of the things they have to do, the budget deadlines. We have 30 legislative days left in the rest of this fall. And the huge --"
