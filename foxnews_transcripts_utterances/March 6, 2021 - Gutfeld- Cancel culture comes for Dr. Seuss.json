Yes, Tuesday was his birthday, which coincided with National Read across America Day, but the doc was nowhere to be found. Yes, just a few years after our first black President read Dr. Seuss to kids on this very day, the new old white guy completely strikes the author from the event -- cancelled -- because some of his books contain racist imagery. Fair enough. But you just canceled the whole guy because of that? The dude sold 600 million books. True, he is not a real doctor, but who is? But he wrote \"Cat in the Hat.\" True. It's the only one of his books that I read, so I decided to do some investigating. I mean, just how bad could these books be? Well, it turns out pretty bad. First, \"Horton Hears a Great Lecture on White Supremacy.\" I had no idea. I had no idea. What about any others? \"Green Eggs and Hitler.\" How did this get published? One more please. \"If I Ran the Zoo, we'd only have Polar Bears because they're White.\" Well, that is offensive to everyone. OK, I kid. To any CNN media reporters who are watching this, much like your stories, those weren't real. But times are bad. We're turning into a police state. We're now the police. It's not the government banning books, removing movies from streaming services or getting people fired for old tweets. It's us, private citizens feeling the euphoric power of punishing the past. Big Brother isn't a bureaucrat, but some dip [bleep] at \"The Washington Post.\" So Seuss is gone, and others will surely follow. But at least last week, Godzilla returned. I wonder, what does he want you to know?",

It was pushed by \"The Washington Post,\" \"U.S.A. Today,\" \"Salon\" and even TMZ. Yes, TMZ. I guess celebrity dog-nappings just aren't getting the clicks. Of course, after the story faded, you find out that the Nazi stage was created by Design Foundry, a company that's worked for Biden and MSNBC and whose political donations have almost entirely gone to Democrats.

First of all, he talked about his intent the entire time. But intent doesn't matter. He should know because he requires all of us in the state, these employees to take this New York sexual harassment training. So we all know the law frontwards and backwards. His intent doesn't matter. It is how it's perceived. And I think there were a million things in his statement, and in the questions that were immediately proven wrong. You know, he said he wasn't on notice. There's ticking the boxes. But I think what's more telling right now is that sort of deafening silence that we hear on the national level by people in his own party that haven't quite come out with that same vitriol they did to past situations like this without credible allegations like now Justice Kavanaugh, where are they now? I mean, it would be nice if the pendulum stays in the middle, which is given all voices, an amplification and a platform to speak. All investigations, transparency, and the thoroughness.

Yes, Tuesday was his birthday, which coincided with National Read across America Day, but the doc was nowhere to be found. Yes, just a few years after our first black President read Dr. Seuss to kids on this very day, the new old white guy completely strikes the author from the event -- cancelled -- because some of his books contain racist imagery. Fair enough. But you just canceled the whole guy because of that? The dude sold 600 million books. True, he is not a real doctor, but who is? But he wrote \"Cat in the Hat.\" True. It's the only one of his books that I read, so I decided to do some investigating. I mean, just how bad could these books be? Well, it turns out pretty bad. First, \"Horton Hears a Great Lecture on White Supremacy.\" I had no idea. I had no idea. What about any others? \"Green Eggs and Hitler.\" How did this get published? One more please. \"If I Ran the Zoo, we'd only have Polar Bears because they're White.\" Well, that is offensive to everyone. OK, I kid. To any CNN media reporters who are watching this, much like your stories, those weren't real. But times are bad. We're turning into a police state. We're now the police. It's not the government banning books, removing movies from streaming services or getting people fired for old tweets. It's us, private citizens feeling the euphoric power of punishing the past. Big Brother isn't a bureaucrat, but some dip [bleep] at \"The Washington Post.\" So Seuss is gone, and others will surely follow. But at least last week, Godzilla returned. I wonder, what does he want you to know?"

More research is needed as to why the kitefin shark is able to illuminate itself.

It was pushed by \"The Washington Post,\" \"U.S.A. Today,\" \"Salon\" and even TMZ. Yes, TMZ. I guess celebrity dog-nappings just aren't getting the clicks. Of course, after the story faded, you find out that the Nazi stage was created by Design Foundry, a company that's worked for Biden and MSNBC and whose political donations have almost entirely gone to Democrats.

Cuomo is also mired in nursing home scandal and facing growing pressure to resign. And poet, Amanda Gorman says she was racially profiled and tailed by a security guard during a walk home because she looked, quote \"suspicious.\" The 22-year-old, the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history tweeted, \"One day you're called an icon, the next day a threat.\" Gorman says the guard left after she showed her door keys and entered her apartment.

My piece of legal advice for everyone here and watching is if your attorney is telling you not to speak, don't. He dug himself into a deeper hole a million times over there. First of all, he talked about his intent the entire time. But intent doesn't matter. He should know because he requires all of us in the state, these employees to take this New York sexual harassment training. So we all know the law frontwards and backwards. His intent doesn't matter. It is how it's perceived. And I think there were a million things in his statement, and in the questions that were immediately proven wrong. You know, he said he wasn't on notice. There's ticking the boxes. But I think what's more telling right now is that sort of deafening silence that we hear on the national level by people in his own party that haven't quite come out with that same vitriol they did to past situations like this without credible allegations like now Justice Kavanaugh, where are they now? I mean, it would be nice if the pendulum stays in the middle, which is given all voices, an amplification and a platform to speak. All investigations, transparency, and the thoroughness. And then we all wait for that conclusion. But here, based on what we know thus far, he is toast.

What she knew from the jump was off, was not right, and all the ridicule that she took and was attacked, and just do the weather. And now we're looking at the horrors of it, and it was -- it's not just the Governor. It was his team. It was -- everybody was involved in this process. The effort it took to hide numbers, opposed to saying at the time when he had America's ear, when he could have said, this is the death toll that we're having in our nursing homes, and we need to do something. What we're doing is not working. He would have gotten a second Emmy. You know, and now, this is -- I mean, the way I look at it is, it is like he was indifferent to homicide.

There's a lot of toys that are gender specific and they haven't solved the problem of changing those toys and making them gender neutral like they should.

But you're all saying that this shouldn't be happening because there's so much going on in California right now, which I agree with, but I also feel like it shouldn't be happening ever. I read this this bill, okay. I read this bill. This is a sentence of the bill. \"Item 3: Toys means all products designed or intended by the manufacturer to be used by children when they play.\" If you were writing this in a government document ever, you have gone too far.

Remember there's threats of criminal misdemeanors if you address seniors by the wrong gender pronoun, in retirement home so I'm not surprised by this because there is the answer to everything out there is a legislative reason why you're more choke held why you're more crippled from actually succeeding as an entrepreneur or a small business owner there.

I hope you'll consider reimbursing me. Thanks.\" He then shared a link to his Venmo account so she could send him the money. The post went viral, as the kids say, but a few said he kind of had a point, Alexx made it clear that you would not be paying him anything in a follow up tweet. The weirdest aspect of this story.
