After weeks of slow escalation and without a single vote from the Congress, the United States came within minutes of war with Iran. In response to the destruction of an unmanned drone, American forces nearly launched an airstrike on Iranian targets. According to some reports, our planes were literally in the air. But in the end, it didn't happen. The President pulled back. This morning, he explained why. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And in this case, it would be horrible. The hangover from an Iraq war with last years. Iran is not Syria or Iraq. It's a big, rich, sophisticated country with an ancient culture and a cohesive population. In some ways, it's an impressive place, not at all like the chintzy prefab capitals of the Arab world like Riyadh or Dubai. We could beat Iran, but it would not be easy. It would cost trillions of dollars, many thousands of Americans likely would die. China would love it. They'd be the only winners in that conflict. Donald Trump was elected President precisely to keep us out of disasters like war with Iran. So how did we get so close to starting one? Simple. The neocons still wield enormous power in Washington. They don't care what the cost of war with Iran is. They certainly don't care what the effect on Trump's political fortunes might be.

The only thing missing from that tone and the nature of this was then a discussion about crop circles, and how hieroglyphics in Egypt and the pyramids were really communications to the outer space people. Look, it's pathetic. It's obviously a group of people who are embarrassed as they should be, not just because of this video, but because they did tell people for years that this was going to be the case. And it wasn't just about collusion, it was that the President of the United States was a Russian spy. But what do you expect from people who make a living by living in make believe? And this is it. Now, the other thing, of course, the next video that could follow would be all of them talking about that the government still has not arrested the Corleone family, even though we've had three movies exposing what it is they've done, and then in just a few days ago -- it's true and you know it. Just a few days ago, we had a number of senators actually briefed on UFOs that we know that there was some briefing about some of the Navy sightings of lights that they can't explain. And yet decades ago, we knew about Darth Vader and Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, and we did nothing then at that point, either. This is the same trajectory. They're telling people, just look at the movie, read the book, and you'll believe it, too. But it's also insulting, Tucker, because they're behaving as though the American people or even their own constituency, other liberals, either are too lazy to read or read it and didn't understand it properly, or have just given up that they are the only ones who truly understand what the dynamic is. So look, there's a lot of rehab for people in Hollywood who escape reality using drugs and alcohol. There now needs to be one to get them out of this pathological fixation on Donald Trump. They need to admit they were wrong and accept it, which is what most Americans do, and move on.",

The White House has announced that on Sunday, this Sunday, it will begin launching immigration raids in 10 U.S. cities. The intent of the raids is to detain and eventually deport thousands of people who have ignored existing deportation orders. It's a straightforward effort to enforce the law, which is what the government is designed to do. Except in Chicago, where the new mayor, Lori Lightfoot has announced that Chicago Police are now prohibited from assisting Federal immigration authorities in any way. The city has even cut off I.C.E.'s access to their police databases. In the City of Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the LAPD has also announced it will not assist I.C.E. in any way. By the way, the Feds assist those cities all the time when they need help. In San Francisco, of course, Mayor London Breed issued an even more absurd statement, it accuses the Federal government of quote, \" ... targeting innocent immigrant families with secret raids that are designed to inflict as much fear and pain as possible,\" end quote. Consider that sentence. Everything in it is a lie. The people being targeted already have had their day in court, they lost. They were ordered to leave the country. They've refused. Removing them is the same as restoring the basic rule of law. Mayors like London Breed don't want that, maintaining the country's new servant class at all cost is more important to them. But think of what we're degrading in the process something important. We want to tell you about a new government official on the scene. This is someone who is in charge of controlling migration into his country. He has made a lot of promises, almost 400,000 people have entered this country just in the past three months. To fix this problem, he says he plans to deport 2,500 people every single day. He says he is going to block all illegal crossings over the river on his country's southern border. He points out that illegal immigrants routinely get better treatment than the poor people in his own country. And when he is attacked for saying all of this, he's got a simple response, his nation is like a home he says and his job is to preserve that home's wellbeing for the people who actually live in it. If activists are so upset about deporting illegal aliens, he says, why don't they accept 50 of them to crash indefinitely in their own homes? So who is this man? No, it's not the new acting DHS Secretary. It's not even our President. No. This person is called Francisco Garduno. He is the new head of the National Institute of Migration in another country. Can you guess the country? Mexico. Good for him. Well, for years, America's tech monopolies have had their growth subsidized by the Federal government by you and the rest of the taxpayers in this country, all thanks to Section 230 of something called the Communications Decency Act. The law protects tech companies for being sued for defamation and fraud on the grounds that they simply provide an online platform for users that anyone can use. But that's a lie. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube aren't open platforms, they are censors. They're happy to ban and silence anyone they dislike usually on political ground. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri wants to change that. He has a new bill that will take away tech companies lawsuit immunity if they carry out any politically motivated censorship. We recently spoke with Senator Hawley about that bill. Here is what he said.",

After weeks of slow escalation and without a single vote from the Congress, the United States came within minutes of war with Iran. In response to the destruction of an unmanned drone, American forces nearly launched an airstrike on Iranian targets. According to some reports, our planes were literally in the air. But in the end, it didn't happen. The President pulled back. This morning, he explained why."

I said, \"You know what, they shot down an unmanned drone plane,\" whatever you want to call it. \"And here we are sitting with 150 dead people.\" That would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said, \"Go ahead.\" And I didn't like it.

The whole thing in the end offended his sense of decency. He said it seemed disproportionate, and it was. Moreover, airstrikes would have led to a wider conflict with Iran. That of course was the entire point of it. Policymakers in Washington crave a war with Iran. Last night was supposed to be the first domino. At the last minute the president toward their plans. For that, he is being vilified. Watch CNN's 36-year-old national security analyst attack the President for not killing enough people yesterday."

In fact, last night was a high point in the Trump presidency, bombing Iran would have ended his political career in a minute. There'd be no chance of reelection after that. Ill-advised wars are like doing cocaine, the initial rush rises your poll numbers, but the crash is inevitable. And in this case, it would be horrible. The hangover from an Iraq war with last years. Iran is not Syria or Iraq. It's a big, rich, sophisticated country with an ancient culture and a cohesive population. In some ways, it's an impressive place, not at all like the chintzy prefab capitals of the Arab world like Riyadh or Dubai. We could beat Iran, but it would not be easy. It would cost trillions of dollars, many thousands of Americans likely would die. China would love it. They'd be the only winners in that conflict. Donald Trump was elected President precisely to keep us out of disasters like war with Iran. So how did we get so close to starting one? Simple. The neocons still wield enormous power in Washington. They don't care what the cost of war with Iran is. They certainly don't care what the effect on Trump's political fortunes might be. They despise Donald Trump. Now, one of their key allies is the National Security adviser of the United States. John Bolton is an old friend of Bill Kristol's. Together they helped plan the Iraq war. When Bolton made it to the White House, the neocons cheered. Left-wing \"New York Times\" columnist Brett Stevens took a break from attacking Donald Trump to celebrate his hiring. Stevens assured MSNBC viewers that John Bolton was a great choice because he would push the President toward war. BRETT STEVENS, COLUMNIST, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": He is not the sort of caricature-ish hawk that he has been made out to be in some corners of the press. I think someone like Bolton is going to restrain the isolationist impulses that have been really at the heart of Trump's foreign policy thinking."

That wasn't a disaster either. According to John Bolton, it was a raging success. We killed hundreds of thousands of people, lost thousands of our own troops spend more than a trillion dollars all to eliminate a WMD threat that despite John Bolton's assurances never existed in the first place. Bolton is glad we did all of that. Really happy about it. That's demented. Normal people don't talk like that. There's nothing normal about John Bolton.

His life really is Washington in a nutshell, blunder into obvious catastrophes again and again, refuse to admit blame, and then demand more of the same. That's the John Bolton life cycle. In between administration jobs, there are always cushy think tank posts, paid speaking gigs, cable news contracts. War maybe disaster for America, but for John Bolton and his fellow neocons, it is always good business.

      "utterance": "Well, I try to be kind of careful about getting into people's minds. But I think that the tape that you show from Bolton and many, many others indicate that at least John Bolton and there's evidence looking at it. The same is true of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that these gentlemen really do want to get America into a war with Iran, they really do want to change that regime."

Why wouldn't it just be easier for him to say, \"I think we should overthrow Iran, we're doing it.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, Tucker, our history is replete with instances in which Presidents and people around the Presidents wanting to get us into wars but they couldn't say so because the American people weren't anxious to get into wars. So you can look at what happened with regard to the Mexican War with James Polk getting us into World War I with Woodrow Wilson, World War II with Franklin Roosevelt, Vietnam, and the Iraq War, all of which had lies, misrepresentations and maneuverings that were designed to get us into that war without saying so."

      "speaker": "MERRY",

So there was a conflict that he had to somehow do something about and he did everything he could including actions that I would consider to be unconstitutional and impeachable to get us into that war. I think that the same thing took place with regard to Iraq. I don't think the American people were intent on not going into that war, but we ginned up that war by suggesting that there were weapons of mass destruction and collusion between Iraq and the terrorists of 9/11, true in both instances."

      "speaker": "MERRY",
      "utterance": "Lying sometimes, not always lying, sometimes it's manipulations. But yes, we do have a history of that. America's war-making history indicates that there's been significant instances of that kind of maneuvering, manipulation, and in some instances lying -- Vietnam is a great example -- to get us into wars that the American people weren't clamoring for."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to tell you, I can't figure it out. I mean, I know John Bolton, I don't know him personally, but I know his work for many, many years, and it's clear that he believes that America as a unipolar power on the globe, at this time, should be bullying other nations and deciding what other regions should be doing with regard to factors that are of interest to America, in his mind. And so he wants America to basically determine the regimes all around and it has to be regimes that he likes and that he thinks America should like, and that's his modus operandi for a very long time as you pointed out."

So Glenn, the reaction to the President not going to war last night has been really striking, very little celebration about it in certain quarters, outright attacks. You saw -- we just played tape of CNN's National Security analyst attacking the President for it. Liz Cheney, congresswoman from Wyoming attacked the President. Others did, too. What about Washington makes war the first resort for both parties every time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENN GREENWALD, COFOUNDER, THE INTERCEPT",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, there's an obvious answer, which is it is exciting, so it drives media ratings, it makes people buy newspapers. Adam Smith, in \"The Wealth of Nations\" in 1776, wrote about how when a country becomes an empire, the people in the capital never get any risk for more. So Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol and David Frum and the people who cheer war are never put at risk, but they get excitement and purpose from it. They get kind of a feeling of power. Ben Shapiro on Twitter today said, \"Let's show Iran that we can match them.\" That's something that people say when they go through life feeling inadequate, and without any kind of purpose or strength, so it gives people strength. And then there's also this much deeper issue that after the Iraq War, almost nobody other than Judy Miller, the single scapegoat, there was no accountability for the people who lied to the country into the war. So you look at someone like Jeffrey Goldberg, who for \"The New Yorker\" was writing award-winning articles, claiming that Saddam Hussein was in an alliance with Al Qaeda making people believe that Iraq did 9/11, is he out of journalism because of that? No, he has been promoted. He's the editor- in-chief of \"The Atlantic.\" You turn on MSNBC, there's Bill Kristol. You open up \"The New York Times,\" there's Brett Stevens, Marc Thiessen in \"The Washington Post\" and they're all embedded in Washington culture, the think tanks especially, and they only become important and enlivened when the U.S. is at war. They get all kinds of psychological, economic and political benefits from it at everybody else's expense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "If you claim that there was a direct connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, 9/11 and Saddam, it is clearly untrue. How in the world could you stay in journalism? I mean, do you know -- how could Jeff Goldberg go on to run one of the most famous magazines in English?"

    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "The amazing thing is, Tucker, the more you promote war, even if you get it wrong, the more you're going to prosper. That is the sickness, the pathology of the DC media and political class. Jeffrey Goldberg's articles won a national magazine award for creating a grotesque conspiracy that resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of people. Not only should he not be in journalism, he should be out of decent society. And yet, when it came time to compete for whether he was going to stay at \"The New Yorker\" or go to \"The Atlantic,\" the owner of \"The Atlantic\" gave him and his children, rare exotic horses to lure him away from \"The New Yorker,\" and he now runs one of the most important magazines in the world. You see that all throughout the media, the same people who not just lied about Iraq, but who cheered all kinds of wars in Muslim countries, prosper from it, they get promoted, they continually get treated as the voices of authority and that's why this continuously goes on."

So now a special prosecutor will examine the entire Smollett case and can bring those same charges or even new criminal charges against the actor, and the special prosecutor will also probe Kim Foxx's office for malfeasance or corruption.

I respectfully disagree with the court's conclusion that in the absence of any conflict, the appointment of a special prosecutor is required.\" Kim Foxx can appeal.

In this case, Booker and other Democrats are jumping on former Vice President Joe Biden, as you said for comments he made this week about working in the Senate with segregationists like James Eastland and others, when in fact, the full context of what Biden was saying was that he didn't agree with those segregationists. To the contrary, Biden made clear he disagreed vehemently, and in fact, fought the southern senators and beat them on issues like voting rights by passing legislation that the segregationists wanted to block. What particularly irked Booker is that, Biden said one of the senators never called Biden quote unquote \"boy\" that he called him \"son.\" Booker said that was offensive to him as an African-American. Biden insists he was just trying to make the point. He has a record which shows he can be civil with people he disagrees with. Now Booker has a record of jumping to conclusions, like, as you mentioned, in the Jussie Smollett case where at the beginning before all the facts were in, he tweeted, \"The vicious attack on actor, Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern day lynching. I'm glad he's safe.\" Booker is now all over Biden for the use of that word \"boy.\" Watch this."

It spent two years telling us it would, millions and millions of taxpayer dollars spent, thousands of hours of investigation and in the end, no evidence of collusion. So if you bought in a hundred percent to the idea that the Mueller report is going to vindicate all of your dreams, how do you respond? Well, denial works. Some are pretending it never even happened. Out in Hollywood, a bunch of celebrities are fully in denial. They say the report actually did expose collusion and you could discover it too, if you just read all 448 pages slowly. Watch."

The only thing missing from that tone and the nature of this was then a discussion about crop circles, and how hieroglyphics in Egypt and the pyramids were really communications to the outer space people. Look, it's pathetic. It's obviously a group of people who are embarrassed as they should be, not just because of this video, but because they did tell people for years that this was going to be the case. And it wasn't just about collusion, it was that the President of the United States was a Russian spy. But what do you expect from people who make a living by living in make believe? And this is it. Now, the other thing, of course, the next video that could follow would be all of them talking about that the government still has not arrested the Corleone family, even though we've had three movies exposing what it is they've done, and then in just a few days ago -- it's true and you know it. Just a few days ago, we had a number of senators actually briefed on UFOs that we know that there was some briefing about some of the Navy sightings of lights that they can't explain. And yet decades ago, we knew about Darth Vader and Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, and we did nothing then at that point, either. This is the same trajectory. They're telling people, just look at the movie, read the book, and you'll believe it, too. But it's also insulting, Tucker, because they're behaving as though the American people or even their own constituency, other liberals, either are too lazy to read or read it and didn't understand it properly, or have just given up that they are the only ones who truly understand what the dynamic is. So look, there's a lot of rehab for people in Hollywood who escape reality using drugs and alcohol. There now needs to be one to get them out of this pathological fixation on Donald Trump. They need to admit they were wrong and accept it, which is what most Americans do, and move on."

We rejected their advice. We didn't take them seriously. And we still aren't. So for them, it's never about other people for these individuals, because the narcissism is too much. For them, it's about their own sense of seriousness their own relevance, which of course considering that no one is taking them seriously, it gets battered every single day.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Mayors across the country are putting the local police and open defiance of American Immigration Law. The White House has announced that on Sunday, this Sunday, it will begin launching immigration raids in 10 U.S. cities. The intent of the raids is to detain and eventually deport thousands of people who have ignored existing deportation orders. It's a straightforward effort to enforce the law, which is what the government is designed to do. Except in Chicago, where the new mayor, Lori Lightfoot has announced that Chicago Police are now prohibited from assisting Federal immigration authorities in any way. The city has even cut off I.C.E.'s access to their police databases. In the City of Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the LAPD has also announced it will not assist I.C.E. in any way. By the way, the Feds assist those cities all the time when they need help. In San Francisco, of course, Mayor London Breed issued an even more absurd statement, it accuses the Federal government of quote, \" ... targeting innocent immigrant families with secret raids that are designed to inflict as much fear and pain as possible,\" end quote. Consider that sentence. Everything in it is a lie. The people being targeted already have had their day in court, they lost. They were ordered to leave the country. They've refused. Removing them is the same as restoring the basic rule of law. Mayors like London Breed don't want that, maintaining the country's new servant class at all cost is more important to them. But think of what we're degrading in the process something important. We want to tell you about a new government official on the scene. This is someone who is in charge of controlling migration into his country. He has made a lot of promises, almost 400,000 people have entered this country just in the past three months. To fix this problem, he says he plans to deport 2,500 people every single day. He says he is going to block all illegal crossings over the river on his country's southern border. He points out that illegal immigrants routinely get better treatment than the poor people in his own country. And when he is attacked for saying all of this, he's got a simple response, his nation is like a home he says and his job is to preserve that home's wellbeing for the people who actually live in it. If activists are so upset about deporting illegal aliens, he says, why don't they accept 50 of them to crash indefinitely in their own homes? So who is this man? No, it's not the new acting DHS Secretary. It's not even our President. No. This person is called Francisco Garduno. He is the new head of the National Institute of Migration in another country. Can you guess the country? Mexico. Good for him. Well, for years, America's tech monopolies have had their growth subsidized by the Federal government by you and the rest of the taxpayers in this country, all thanks to Section 230 of something called the Communications Decency Act. The law protects tech companies for being sued for defamation and fraud on the grounds that they simply provide an online platform for users that anyone can use. But that's a lie. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube aren't open platforms, they are censors. They're happy to ban and silence anyone they dislike usually on political ground. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri wants to change that. He has a new bill that will take away tech companies lawsuit immunity if they carry out any politically motivated censorship. We recently spoke with Senator Hawley about that bill. Here is what he said."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    {
      "speaker": "SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, it's very simple. Big Tech has gotten these giveaways from government, this sweetheart deal from government where they can't be held accountable. They can't be sued. I mean, if Twitter decides, Tucker, to take away your platform, they take away all your social media, what can you do about it? Currently, nothing. So what my bill says is, look, if they're going to have this special immunity that nobody else gets, by the way, they should not discriminate on the basis of speech. They ought to embrace the same First Amendment values that everybody else embraces, and so no discrimination on the basis of your political views. If they want to discriminate, they shouldn't get the special deals from government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That seems completely fair. What would be the argument against it? Why -- first of all, why is it taking you -- you just got to the United States Senate about 20 minutes ago? Why is it taking you to do this? And how many people are on your side? And who specifically is against you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",

I mean, this is going to be the end of all of our great innovation.\" That's just not true at all. And let's remember, these are the same people who last year said, \"We can't possibly stop sex trafficking online,\" because that was going to break the internet, because that was going to be somehow infringe on these companies rights. I mean, it's just ridiculous. All that we're saying is if you want to get special deals from government, if you want to be treated differently, you know what? Quit discriminating against conservatives and libertarians. It's a common sense thing. And I hope they'll be bipartisan support for it."

All my bill says is submit to an audit, an outside independent audit, prove that you're not discriminating on the basis of speech, and you can keep your special immunities. But if you are discriminating, or if you won't open your books, you're going to get treated like everybody else, same standard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So you said a second ago that that these companies are discriminated against -- conservatives and libertarians -- and of course, it's true. Libertarians, whoever would argue against what you're trying to do, and I think they're arguing, well, if you don't like it, start your own Google."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "Right. And the problem with that is, is that when you have a monopoly as Google really does, I mean, good luck with that. I mean, companies have the right to start up. Google buys them. Google suppresses them, engages in anti-competitive conduct. You know, some people say, \"Oh, this is for speech. My approach is forcing the companies to engage in speech.\" That's just nonsense. This isn't for speech at all. It is stopping discrimination against speech by these companies. I don't want the companies to speak in any particular way. My point is just this -- stop discriminating against conservatives. Stop suppressing other viewpoints that you don't agree with. I mean, it's just as simple as that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But unless I'm missing something, what your bill would do would just remove the special protections that they have that for example, I do not enjoy as a broadcaster. Fox News is a news company. We don't enjoy it, we could be sued. If we defame somebody, if we commit fraud. We could be sued. We don't have this immunity. And all your bill would do is just put them into my category."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. I mean, that's exactly right. I mean, to be clear, these big tech companies -- Facebook and Google and YouTube and Twitter -- they have a deal that nobody else has, no media company has this deal. No other publisher has this deal. They have this special carve out, this special handout from government. And if they want to keep it, my view is they should quit discriminating. On the other hand, if they want to discriminate against conservatives, if they want to push a liberal agenda, that's fine, but you shouldn't get -- they shouldn't get these special deals that nobody else gets."

People began contacting National Weather Service and they replied on Twitter this way, quote, \"We honestly have no explanation for the floating objects over Kansas City.\" Ha. So some outlets reported that the object were balloons released earlier this week by DARPA. That's the research arm of the Defense Department. And yet, DARPA, at least so far is not officially taking responsibility for the balloons. So as of tonight, they are probably or possibly balloons, but maybe they're not. It would nice if someone clarified that. We'll keep you posted.

You know, Tucker, you and I don't agree on everything in politics, but I have to tell you, you have my respect on this one. You've been consistent on this from the start, and I think you've nailed this. It's a drone it's a serious matter. Iran is obviously not a friend to the United States. But as you know, I think you know, Nassim Taleb describes in his book you know, \"Skin in the Game,\" it's very easy to make these decisions about human lives when it's not, you know, your butt on the line. I understand they are serious decisions. But the way some of these people in D.C. just casually throw around war like it's a trip to McDonald's is candidly embarrassing for people with such high IQs or who believe they have such high IQs.

I'm a conservative on a lot of his conservative issues. You know, I'm not a news guy. I'm an opinion guy. I don't think that's a secret. But listen, Tucker, energy matters and this rally in Orlando was a monster. And I mean that in a good way, not a bad way. I mean, I ran for office. You know how hard it is to turn out 20,000 people? I live in Florida, Tucker, I know, you know that. It's 94 degrees here on Christmas. It's the greatest State in the Union. I love it. But you wake up Christmas morning, and you can roast marshmallows on the sidewalk. You had 20,000 people sitting in Orlando, in the pouring rain in 90 degrees, waiting to see this guy. The President clearly has tapped into something here that the American public needs and wants. And honestly, Tucker, the energy hasn't waned one bit. He packed that entire stadium. And listen, one quick thing on this, again. Crowds are not necessarily dispositive. It doesn't mean he is going to win -- you know, I don't want to get hyperbolic on either end.
