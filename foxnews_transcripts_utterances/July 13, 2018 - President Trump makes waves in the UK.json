In the 1970's, music was plagued by soft rock and progressive rock. Things like Air Supply, and Genesis, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Just really boring ponders music. Pop a song to a 15 minute drum solos. Then in 1976, the Ramones, the Ramones from New York, Queens. Queen went to England and played, and what happened? Destroyed that whole scene, and all these punk bands started, the Clash, the Daman, the Sex Pistols. Thousands of new band happened. Sound familiar? Donald Trump is the Ramones of politics. What he's done is what punk did to music, Trump is doing to the entire political scene. He's a brutal, blunt, game-changing, but he's elementally true. You may not like punk rock but the messages in the songs were truth. They were 3 minutes, 2 minutes of truth. That's what you're seeing. This is the first punk-rock president.",

So it's something important, especially at a time, you know, when we're all talking about Russia aggression and we're looking at putting sanctions on Russia, sort of undercuts that narrative and that objective if they're funneling money to Russia through the pipeline. But we wouldn't be talking about it if he didn't say it that way. Or you look at immigration, all you have to do is look at the Paris attackers, the ease that they're able to get around Europe, go back to Syria, come back, hiding in places like Mozambique which are the epiphany of a failure of integration of immigration policy and lack of assimilation.

And when we see this on television, people enjoy the spectacle of it, they like the red and the colors, and she's in the blue and the president's trying to walk like this, and it's just very formal, and it shows how the president was respected. I know the president personally enjoys that kind of pomp and circumstance. He enjoys the respect them rolling out the red carpet. But it really solidified the special relationship. Today, you also saw the image of him holding Theresa May's hand. And then they had tea with the queen. And he probably gave him a big boost of adrenaline at the end of this. At the end of it, when you look at it, the European countries did make commitments to boost their defense spending.

I mean, he actually is as a phenomenon, wherever he goes, has a greater impact than anything there. So he is the number one story in England. He's the biggest thing in England. He's bigger than Big Ben. I want to make a metaphor and analogy if I may to my friends in England, I live there, I'm an Anglo file, I love the music. In the 1970's, music was plagued by soft rock and progressive rock. Things like Air Supply, and Genesis, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Just really boring ponders music. Pop a song to a 15 minute drum solos. Then in 1976, the Ramones, the Ramones from New York, Queens. Queen went to England and played, and what happened? Destroyed that whole scene, and all these punk bands started, the Clash, the Daman, the Sex Pistols. Thousands of new band happened. Sound familiar? Donald Trump is the Ramones of politics. What he's done is what punk did to music, Trump is doing to the entire political scene. He's a brutal, blunt, game-changing, but he's elementally true. You may not like punk rock but the messages in the songs were truth. They were 3 minutes, 2 minutes of truth. That's what you're seeing. This is the first punk-rock president."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "I will, because I was actually thinking of something similar, because everyone focuses on the way President Trump says things, but the way he says it makes you focus on what he's saying. For instance, if President Trump hadn't said that Germany was held captive by Russia, we wouldn't be talking about something like the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is important because it does, in fact, give Russia leverage over Germany and other European nations. So it's something important, especially at a time, you know, when we're all talking about Russia aggression and we're looking at putting sanctions on Russia, sort of undercuts that narrative and that objective if they're funneling money to Russia through the pipeline. But we wouldn't be talking about it if he didn't say it that way. Or you look at immigration, all you have to do is look at the Paris attackers, the ease that they're able to get around Europe, go back to Syria, come back, hiding in places like Mozambique which are the epiphany of a failure of integration of immigration policy and lack of assimilation. So, I mean, he says these things at the face that seems outlandish, but would we be talking about the substance if he didn't say it that way?"

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Exactly. I remember when President Obama said that, you know, if you guys do Brexit, you know, we're going to get in the back of the line on the trade. He's done the opposite and he's reached his arm across the Atlantic and offered an olive branch there. I thought meeting the queen was the bigger thing today, just the visual that was pumped into the world. And when we see this on television, people enjoy the spectacle of it, they like the red and the colors, and she's in the blue and the president's trying to walk like this, and it's just very formal, and it shows how the president was respected. I know the president personally enjoys that kind of pomp and circumstance. He enjoys the respect them rolling out the red carpet. But it really solidified the special relationship. Today, you also saw the image of him holding Theresa May's hand. And then they had tea with the queen. And he probably gave him a big boost of adrenaline at the end of this. At the end of it, when you look at it, the European countries did make commitments to boost their defense spending. And NATO is invigorated, I believe, and more focused on the task at hand, and on confronting Russia. So, I think at the end of the day, the trip to Europe was positive. And we've had great economic news this week, Strzok humiliated himself."

She says, \"If anyone does not believe in God, look at me.\" Also, kudos to the Democratic candidate, who largely stayed off the campaign trail. That was a class act, and it's good to know that there are some classy people in politics."
