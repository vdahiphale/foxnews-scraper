Imagine if anybody could see your paycheck and how weird that would be. That's what we're doing with kids now. They can see their own footprint. They can see how much they matter. A kid - a 13-year old in Nebraska can see what a 13-year-old in New York is doing and he has better stuff and more stuff. The perceived obscurity turns into feelings of worthlessness and then the feelings of worthlessness can contribute to rises in mental illness, embracing cult behavior to join certain things and I would say the spectacles of violence.

The people who have different positions. So, to me, it's like unintended consequences.

Two allegations, one treated like Watergate, the other, water under the bridge. You think Hunter would become the huntee, making 50 grand a month for having the right dad. Nope, the media's brave firemen put that story out as soon as they saw smoke. Of course, the media will say, you can't compare what Hunter did to what Trump did, and they're right. Corruption is actually worse than talking about it, you jack asses. And you just know the press is already working overtime to dismiss this story about Schiff getting the whistleblower claim first. How will they preserve their fervors fantasy? Maybe Adam can write it for them? So now you've got an angry president happily cultivated by a small group of semi- illiterate working in one marginal pseudo profession, all hoping to throw a country into crisis in an era where everybody has jobs and peaceful times, and why?

So, a member of his team contacted the whistleblower before the guy made his complaint. He directed the whistleblower to make the complaint. Then, he directed the whistleblower to go get a lawyer, and the lawyer happened to be a Schumer-Clinton lawyer. And the lawyer helped him write the complaint. And then, he hides the fact that he had a contact with the whistleblower from the rest of the House Intelligence Committee. He goes on television, on MSNBC, and says I have not had any contact with the whistleblower. And then, he goes on the House hearing and he says, makes up a fabricated quote about the President of the United States. This scandal is over. There's no crime. There's no cover up. They've created this scandal out of thin air. And now they're panicking because it's all falling apart. Now, permission to make two analogies --"

So, if Biden can go over there, potentially commit a crime, Trump can't know about it, right? So, if Juan Williams goes to Ukraine, commits a crime, and then runs for president, Trump can't find out about it. That's illegal, all right? Permission to make the second analogy. This is about the quid pro quo situation, OK? So, Trump already threatened to cut off foreign aid to Central America unless they stop the caravans from coming. Now, stopping the caravans would helped his reelection campaign. That's one of his big policies. Was that a campaign finance violation because he threaten to withhold aid to a Central American country? If they didn't do it he said on the border? It's the exact same thing. These aren't crimes.

And it -- you know, it comes as a shock because it reminds you of your immortality.

But if you work in a company, you've got to contend with human resources, which are filled with people who came from college who are all woke but no talents.

Used to be that achievement would get you exposure, but now exposure is the achievement in itself. Your social footprint matters more than what you do with your family. It's people you don't know that matter. So, I think the worst thing about it is, we've created a new class system where everybody can visually measure themselves. Imagine if anybody could see your paycheck and how weird that would be. That's what we're doing with kids now. They can see their own footprint. They can see how much they matter. A kid - a 13-year old in Nebraska can see what a 13-year-old in New York is doing and he has better stuff and more stuff. The perceived obscurity turns into feelings of worthlessness and then the feelings of worthlessness can contribute to rises in mental illness, embracing cult behavior to join certain things and I would say the spectacles of violence. I think mass shootings have a lot to do with the feelings of worthlessness which are borne out of social media. But that's - I don't have any proof."

And a lot of people don't see that on social media. You can see rich fancy people with very nice sports cars or on the nicest vacations, but deep down maybe they're crying inside. Maybe they have some nasty disease they're living their last days on Earth. Maybe they're having a hard time at home. Maybe they're drug addicts.

Increasing levels of isolation, increasing or decreasing your attention, your ability to focus to join in a conversation and increasing the rate at which we're in smaller and smaller groups of people of like mind rather than having to discuss things with people as we do here on “The Five” on good days. The people who have different positions. So, to me, it's like unintended consequences. I think sometimes when we talk about this, I think you and I talked about this was to some extent, it's a little bit like saying, well, you know one time people smoked a lot of cigarettes and they don't understand the consequence."

My mom is still out of the country managing to keep tabs on the show, somehow, I think there's a conspiracy afoot. Are you guys ready? All right. Sweetheart, I know that what is taking place politically is unsettling. We get that even in Peru, but we have actually heard from dearly loved and deeply respected people in the states that you are behaving as if unhinged. I mom texted you before leaving to please tone it down and stop screaming. And that was last week. Please honey, be careful and rein in your tone and language. If others are communicated the unhinged message to us when we are out of the country tis something for you to weigh and think about, don't make me worry abroad, please."

My show One Smart Person, and Greg Gutfeld, the smart person is Kimberley Strassel from The Wall Street Journal. We talk a lot about this latest Ukrainian stuff. It's a great conversation. Please check it out. Now it is time for this. I hate these people. Yes, I haven't hated people in a long time, but I'm telling you I really hate the people at the gym. I hate the people so much; I could barely contain it any longer. You're sitting on an exercise machine and you're just like this. I mean I don't give a damn if you're on the phone, on the stair climber. I could give a crap, but when you're sitting on something and somebody is waiting for it and you were on the phone, you are an absolute loser and you do not deserve to be in a gym. You deserve to be on the street where you belong. You make me sick to my stomach. It's almost as bad as people who bring in their trainer into the gym taking a few spots. But this is wrong, and nobody has the guts to call it out. Well, I am. I hate you. All right. Sorry. Dana?"

And he had this big smile on his face, and he is eager - we are eagerly waiting to hear from him. He is going to be 94 soon, but never been to the beach."
