Plus, Speaker Pelosi has a new nickname for Senate Majority Leader, well Mitch McConnell, the Grim Reaper. Tonight, Mitch McConnell tells me exclusively why he might be embracing that new nickname. And also, tonight a can't miss debate on a radical group pushing something called Drag Queens' Storytime at children's libraries. Plus, Ed Henry brings us a report.

The migrants are being sent to Fort Sill Army Base in Oklahoma because the Trump administration wants to provide emergency shelter for kids while they are detained.

Now apparently, we're to believe that President Trump said what he said in order to what invite on camera foreign governments to help him win re- election. Again, all in plain sight. Now, I'm not saying that the President shouldn't have - maybe handled the question slightly differently. Maybe he should have. But let's not be foolish over the Democrats supposed concern now about foreign interference in America's business. Now first off, it was Hillary Clinton's campaign itself that paid for that phony Russian dossier hawked by former British MI6 Officer, Christopher Steele. Now this was all filtered through this sleazy oppo research firm which is Fusion GPS run by the ever-shady Glenn Simpson. Now you all have real lives I know, so you may have forgotten that Nellie Ohr, the wife of DOJ's Bruce Ohr worked at Fusion and met with Trump dossier author and former British spy, Christopher Steele, the day before the FBI launched Trump Russia investigation. So, where was let's say Congressman Nadler's outrage about any of this."

Now, I would argue that Donald Trump has always been very open about his desire to play hardball politics to win. You saw that on camera. But the Clinton team was always in concealment mode. They were aided and abetted by an Obama DOJ and deep state that was desperate to see to it that Trump was defeated. And then after he won that he was removed from office. So, all the feigned outrage from Democrats over foreign interference, it also made me think of something else. When was the last time you heard Democrats complain about what the Chinese have been up to here in America?"

Now does that look a little more pervasive than all the claims of Russian interference and meddling from some Facebook hackers and in basements in Russia. You bet it does. And that report doesn't even address massive efforts by the Chinese to steal our very sensitive intellectual property or infiltrate America's premier research universities. The Democrats demand retaliation or hold endless hearings after China stole all those personnel files from the Office of Personnel Management. This all shows us that the Democrats aren't really worried about foreign countries meddling in our affairs. They just saw this yesterday as a convenient way to resurrect the moribund Mueller investigation and maybe even push their leadership to take up impeachment hearings once and for all. And maybe in an odd way. this kind of ill-advised interview with Stephanopoulos will end up forcing the Democrats into the corner that Nancy Pelosi hope to avoid, wasting the nation's time with needless politically motivated impeachment hearings during an election year. And that's THE ANGLE. Like I said at the top of the show, we're going to dig into three distinct elements of this debate. The first one we're tackling is the FBI's perspective.

It's just ridiculous. I mean he spoke to Stephanopoulos as he speaks to anyone who ask him a question. And he said, well, I'd look at it.

It is not illegal per se simply to have a conversation with someone about the election, about even dirt on someone relating to an election. They haven't built a politician; it won't accept dirt in an election cycle. INGRAHAM: And also, it could be just gossip.

Robert, the focus now is on the section of the U.S. code that reads, it shall be unlawful for a foreign national directly or indirectly to make a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value in connection with a federal state or local election. So, is what President Trump what he was entertaining in that clip that we played. Would that be a trigger of this statute?"

I mean this was an issue that was addressed by none other than Bob Mueller himself in connection with the June 9, 2016 meeting in Trump Tower involving Trump Junior. And the question of whether or not the offer of dirt with regard to Hillary Clinton would constitute an illegal campaign contribution or foreign contribution. And the issue about whether or not opposition research would be sufficient to trigger a felony violation of that statute and the answer is emphatically, no. And you don't have to take my word for that. That's Bob Mueller essentially saying it's in the report. Go look. It's pages 183 to 188 in the first volume of Bob Mueller's report. End of story."

      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "I agree with you, Laura. I mean I don't see that at all - look, opposition research remembers if you're going to try to make the argument that opposition research can be considered an in-kind campaign contribution, be careful what you ask for. There are significant First Amendment issues because remember that campaign finance laws would apply not just to foreign campaign contributions, but any campaign contribution and the notion that you would allow a contribution to be considered and in kind contribution as a result of the fact that it's opposition research seems to me especially if it's all its reporting is factually accurate information then from whatever source whether it's foreign or otherwise. The notion that that would constitute an illegal campaign contribution has some significant implications, not the least of which is that it may well be a violation of the First Amendment. So, I'd be careful about jumping to that conclusion."

He's never afraid of talking to them. In fact, he speaks to them almost every day and then they complain that they don't have press briefings. But the fact is they get the President himself something they didn't get under the eight years of President Obama. They ought to be grateful for that. Instead they whine."

And I think one thing she's looking forward to do, to doing is to be able to set the record straight about what a remarkable person he is, how well he has treated her, how much in command and control he is and so much of the things that are said about him by the press just untrue. And she's been there firsthand to witness it.

Things that would turn us into a country we would never been sending it over to America. They're on the way to doing some additional things. In addition, the ones I've already done, the Green New Deal, Medicare for All and by the way, you may have mentioned this on your show, but they plan to make the District of Columbia State that given two new Democratic senators. Puerto Rico state get two more new Democratic senators and as a former Supreme Court clerk yourself. You've surely noticed today plan to expand the Supreme Court.

Just a handful of minor stories. This administration did a terrific job of working with state and local officials to make sure. We had an honest election in 2018 with minimal to no interference, where is the applause for that. I'm open to considering legislation. But it has to be directed in a way that doesn't undermine state and local control of elections. The Democrats, Laura would like to nationalize everything.

We found out yesterday by dark money groups who won't - names we won't know are not going to be revealed. And this comes as Ron Klain, a former Obama and Clinton aide warns, quote, \"The next decade could feature a radical right Supreme Court that would not only narrow past gains but also erect barriers to prevent progressive political action.\" So which is it?

With regard to the nominees, not only did the president make two great Supreme Court nominees in Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, but we are making an important difference for the country that will last for a very long time.

That alone should not only be setting off alarms, but people should be demanding this to be canceled even before it starts. We're not talking about diversity. We are talking about deviance. We're talking about perverse and destructive lifestyles being animated or advertised to children as if it's normal. You can just look at the website itself."

But it has found many fans, with chapters in areas outside traditional liberal cities, outposts now in Milwaukee, New Orleans, Mobile, Alabama, and San Marcos, Texas.\" So this all began in San Francisco. This isn't some organic, just a local person who decides I want to help the kids. This is to a lot of people organized as an attempt to advance a particular agenda or viewpoint or understanding, and beginning itself in San Francisco."

They are upset about it because, and your guest I think articulated that perfectly, that they are disgusted by certain people in society, by the LGBT community, by drag queens, who, by the way, are not always a part of the LGBT community. And they feel that their children will be contaminated if they come into contact with these people. I think that is not a mainstream view. I don't think even many conservatives I don't think agree with that anymore. I think that really is --"

If you read the stories that are coming out about these events and you listen to the individuals who are actually reading the stories who speak for themselves, they are saying we were looking for a way to give back to the community. We are entertainers, we dance, we sang, we make merriment in various establishments, but we were looking for a way to give back. And they wanted to pour into the children of their communities. These events are voluntary. Nobody's children are being forced to go and sit in front of a drag queen and listen to a storybook. They're going there because they want to give back to their community, and I think in the United States of America anyone should be able to do that."

We wanted to have a really good conversation. We appreciate it. And President Trump, by the way, is hosting, this is a really great event, beneficiaries of his criminal justice reform law at the White House today.

Joining me now is Leo Terrell, civil rights attorney, and Pastor Mark Burns, CEO of the NOW television network and South Carolina Congressional candidate. Pastor Burns, let's start with you. Is this just an issue of these specific candidates being unpopular with about a third of African- American voters, or is Trump making some gains in the African-American community?"

I believe that the black vote in this election is truly up for grabs because, again, black Americans have been hearing what the Democrats have been saying but doing no action. But now they are seeing, they are seeing President Trump actually doing things. This is unheard of. You mean to tell me that President Donald Trump, the racist President Donald Trump, is now helping inmates when they get out of jail to stay out of jail by making sure that they get a second chance at life. It is not an accident that this is Donald Trump's first chance at helping minorities and people who have been forgotten by giving them a second chance at a real life. This is an unprecedented opportunity, and I believe the black vote is up for grabs."

Yes, because that same poll, which I read, Pastor and Laura, said that 75 percent of African- American support Joe Biden. So, they like a candidate, they just don't like Booker and Kamala Harris. African-Americans have said we want Joe Biden. And secondly, regarding the Pastor's comments, a first step of releasing these individuals, how about a job? You know why? Because these employers will still ask you, have you been convicted of a felony? Yes. You won't get the job. So President Trump needs a first step, he needs a second step. He needs a second step, Laura."

This sounds very similar to months and months ago when the mainstream media was railing against the president for allegedly putting migrant children in cages, except they were using as evidence photos from 2014 when Barack Obama was president. Fast forward to this week when some of the media were back at it, blaring headlines that because of the soaring numbers of families trying to claim asylum, the president is sending migrant kids to an army base once used as a Japanese internment camp. The full context, though, is far different than that. The migrants are being sent to Fort Sill Army Base in Oklahoma because the Trump administration wants to provide emergency shelter for kids while they are detained. A good idea to use an army base where there's food, beds, bathrooms, such a good idea that in fact Barack Obama used this facility for migrants back in 2014. The media did not attack him or highlight that connection to internment camps, just the opposite of the freak out now. Watch."
