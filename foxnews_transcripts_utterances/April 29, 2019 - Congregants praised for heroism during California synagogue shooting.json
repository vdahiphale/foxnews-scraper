And it's great about those heroic stories because they drown out the scum, right? It's like when you hear about this stuff it reduces the desire to commit a crime because instead of hearing about the scum who did it, you hear about the people who share the risk. We've talked about -- think like 93. If everybody rushes, you share the risk but the shooter loses. I want to just point out a fact here, prior to the New Zealand massacre the killer posted a manifesto in his links to 8chan. A month later this perp posted his open letter and try to live stream on 8chan. So you cannot tell me this is not a copycat. This has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with the desire for infamy and fame. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is an equation to copycat crimes. Spectacle multiplied by incentive equals bloodbath. Because violence is on the decline that means the media focuses pretty heavily on -- intensely on what crime is there. So these things -- they might be local, they might not be local, but they become intensified. There's less to cover, so you need to devout more coverage to an act. You multiply that by the incentive, the incentive for the spectacle, and then you get copycat killings. So what we need is we need to shrink the media footprint. You know I'm a broken record on this, especially since this one was designed with the media in mind because it publishes its manifesto. It's a copycat. They try to outdo each other. You try to outdo the previous guy, but luckily, people shared the risk and went after him. So I do -- I really do think that -- like it's idiotic to sit here and try to make links to -- you know, we could easily link this to the New York Times cartoon, but we won't because we know that's ludicrous, right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We know -- the New York City -- the New York Times' anti-Semitic cartoon did not cause this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We are living in the most prosperous era ever huge declines in poverty crime and also death that's due to war. We cannot worry about triggers in safe spaces, because we've never had it this good. It could be we're spiritually weak, everybody wants to be strong emotionally, intellectually, economically, but when you keep asking yourself what's the point, even when things are great, you got problems. But we know good news doesn't sell and the media is in the business to make money, so they convinced us to ignore what we see and focus on what they feel - unfairness, anger, outrage pain. To them catastrophe is king, as we hurtle towards some environmental, social, political Armageddon. The media makes the jam and social media spreads it.

And so you have the off-duty border patrol agent. And it was very interesting to me to listen to the rabbi talking about asking him in the past, if you're going to be here, please bring your weapon because we'll never know when we'll need it. After the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, this -- the synagogue there in Poway, California, did an active shooter drill. And it does bring up this -- something that we've talked about, whether it's schools or churches, it's this soft target, and what are we going to do? Because, yes, the FBI has 5 minutes notice. We can't really do anything in 5 minutes. The shooter was not well organized. He didn't -- or well trained. He didn't exactly know what he's doing. He had hate in his heart, and he wanted to commit murder. So he knew that. Thankfully, he didn't know how to use his weapon as well. And also -- then you also have somebody who bravely and courageously fought in Iraq for us and was able to take him down. But I think that we do have to think about a couple of things in addition to -- I know what Greg's thought also in the media, but it is this decision for soft targets, do you take that next step to go ahead and arm yourself because the police aren't always going to be able to get there, and you're not always going to have the benefit of having a former veteran in attendance, or an off-duty border patrol agent who was there in order to take him down."

      "utterance": "Yeah. I didn't see any of that. I wish I hadn't because, basically, that does nothing to help anyone. To your point, there were a lot of heroic stories. And it's great about those heroic stories because they drown out the scum, right? It's like when you hear about this stuff it reduces the desire to commit a crime because instead of hearing about the scum who did it, you hear about the people who share the risk. We've talked about -- think like 93. If everybody rushes, you share the risk but the shooter loses. I want to just point out a fact here, prior to the New Zealand massacre the killer posted a manifesto in his links to 8chan. A month later this perp posted his open letter and try to live stream on 8chan. So you cannot tell me this is not a copycat. This has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with the desire for infamy and fame. There is an equation to copycat crimes. Spectacle multiplied by incentive equals bloodbath. Because violence is on the decline that means the media focuses pretty heavily on -- intensely on what crime is there. So these things -- they might be local, they might not be local, but they become intensified. There's less to cover, so you need to devout more coverage to an act. You multiply that by the incentive, the incentive for the spectacle, and then you get copycat killings. So what we need is we need to shrink the media footprint. You know I'm a broken record on this, especially since this one was designed with the media in mind because it publishes its manifesto. It's a copycat. They try to outdo each other. You try to outdo the previous guy, but luckily, people shared the risk and went after him. So I do -- I really do think that -- like it's idiotic to sit here and try to make links to -- you know, we could easily link this to the New York Times cartoon, but we won't because we know that's ludicrous, right? We know -- the New York City -- the New York Times' anti-Semitic cartoon did not cause this."

And that level of sacrifice, that something that happens in the moment. You don't contemplate that.  She didn't have any thought. To her, that was a life or death decision, and it was a very easy one for her to make. And that to me is so incredibly profound because, you know, it's impossible to put yourself in that situation, but it's tragic, and it's really beautiful to see that someone would sacrifice themselves in order to protect what she sees as the most sacred thing in that temple. And, you know, also, Oscar Stewart, he was someone who also re-enlisted in the military after 9/11. He'd been in the navy, and then in 2001, enlisted in the army in order to defend his country. And he end up having the wherewithal to know that if he were within 5 feet of that shooter with a rifle, that he wouldn't be able to get to anyone else. And those are two phenomenal stories."

What we've got now according to the FBI, according to the anti-defamation league, it's a tremendous spike, not only in racists activities but anti- Semitic activity, typically directed against houses of worship. The FBI statistics show that 37 percent jump in the last year in anti-Semitic attacks. And to me, you know, I just say, I don't know who's to blame. I'm not going to point fingers, especially not at President Trump. But I will say this that you have a situation where lots of people who are on 8chan and all these other things identify with Trump, and do think that they have been unleashed by this political environment. Over the weekend in Washington, in Politics and Pros, a well-known bookstore, you had white nationalist just rush in to try to shut down a guy who's talking about a book. The book is called Dying of Whiteness, politics of racial resentment killing America's heartland. To me, this is just so painful that we are in 2019 in a place like that, and we can talk about, you know, what happened in Pittsburgh. We can talk about New Zealand. All these things are related.

And we see that now because President Obama won't even endorse, you know, his supposed good friend, his loyal VP who served him proudly for eight years. So I think it's an interesting dynamic there.

Who's going to cement my legacy in there?  He didn't think about Joe who'd been with him for eight long years. And that's pretty significant. I just saw that rally. That rally was weak. There was not a lot of people there. The people behind him looked bored. He looked like he was trying to counteract the Sleepy Joe narrative that have been forming. He was stumbling all over his lines, couldn't read the prompter well. He was stepping on things. He just did not look polished. He looked extremely rusty. And a lot of the people back in hair and makeup said they thought that he had fillers in and Botox, you know. I didn't say that, but a lot of people in hair and makeup said it. And they know. They look at faces all day long. I will say this, though, about Joe. He cannot get a crowd. Are people going to drive miles and miles to listen to Joe Biden? No. Are people going to get Joe Biden tattoos on their backs like they did with Donald Trump and Barack Obama? No. He doesn't get ratings. He doesn't sell books.

And I think -- it could be, and the history books might show us in the future if President Obama ever talks about it what he was thinking in terms of trying, perhaps, saw his friend, now might not be the time because you're not in a place where you can be able to carry a campaign off. I also think that for Obama that he has only one chance to be either a kingmaker or a peacemaker, and why would he do that now? They have a long way to go in this primary. We could actually see a contested convention because of the way the new rules are. And so he could be the person that comes in and says this is my person, or he could say, OK, between the two of you, we're going to work this out. And he only has one chance to do that. He shouldn't do it now."

It sounds so fake because Trump is just talking like a guy in a cab talking to you. And whether you like him or not, you can't listen to politicians anymore because he's destroyed that whole idea. Alyssa Milano gave the worst advice. She said all the Democratic candidates should play nice with each other. No criticisms, OK. You know what that's like? That's like a friend telling you before you travel to some kind of tropical jungle, don't get the inoculations. You won't need them.

But that nugget speaks to a larger possible culprit. Could it be the media are playing a role too? We are living in the most prosperous era ever huge declines in poverty crime and also death that's due to war. We cannot worry about triggers in safe spaces, because we've never had it this good. It could be we're spiritually weak, everybody wants to be strong emotionally, intellectually, economically, but when you keep asking yourself what's the point, even when things are great, you got problems. But we know good news doesn't sell and the media is in the business to make money, so they convinced us to ignore what we see and focus on what they feel - unfairness, anger, outrage pain. To them catastrophe is king, as we hurtle towards some environmental, social, political Armageddon. The media makes the jam and social media spreads it. The difference between concrete evidence and contrary psychological spin has never been so vast and it's making us ill. So the next time you're feeling really bad, ask yourself this, is it coming from inside you or from that damn Airport TV? In life, you can't just turn off things that truly make you sick.

There's many, many passages about turning over your worries to God. You don't have to worry about anything. I got you. Like that's OK. And so if you grow up in that and you can kind of remember it as an adult, you have to relearn the lesson over and over again, which is why you keep going to church and Bible studies and all that.
