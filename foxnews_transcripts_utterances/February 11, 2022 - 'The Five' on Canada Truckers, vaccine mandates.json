Joe Biden looking to crush the trucker protests in Canada before it spreads here. The president telling Justin Trudeau to get tough and cracked down on the freedom convoy. And White House officials are urging Canadian leaders to use their federal powers to break up the protests. It looks like they got the message. Ontario, declaring a state of emergency, and is demanding the truckers go home now. And Justin Trudeau issuing this direct threat.",

You know, when Justin Trudeau said everything is on the table, didn't he just suggest a willingness to go to war? Because they are saying that Americans are involved, so did he just basically say let's go, America? I find that very odd. Look, we saw this coming. When this first started, we, that it was going to be called an insurrection on 16 wheels, this is the same demonization that the media did with Trump voters, with parents at school board meetings. Everybody becomes a Nazi because they can't argue with them. The first thing they do is they try the blanket smear. I mean, do you really think these are the type of people that are going to mess with the Super Bowl? These are the people who watch the Super Bowl. And it's disgusting that our White House is putting them on par with terrorists. I can't even name a Canadian terrorist. I can name a lot of terrorists from other countries. But I can't do it. But they didn't even do that with antifa. Or antifa. You know, two dozen people died in the George Floyd riots. They didn't get their panties in a bunch over that. But now they're doing it. Basically, nobody has -- nobody has broken a law, except honking. And then you got a C -- a bona fide CNN analyst threatening actual violence, basically trying to initiate violence by saying slash their tires, drain their gas tanks, blah, blah, blah. Imagine if they did that. That would actually initiate violence. That is an actual CN analyst trying to start something. Imagine if I said that about BLM-ers. Man. But the thing is, Canadian truckers, easy target, there's no thumbs up emoji for them. You know? But then she backtracked and said she was trying to talk about peaceful protests. No, she is an advocate for attacking a peaceful protest. CNN, again, wrong side of history, wrong side on everything. It's amazing.",

He might have been able to stop some of this, but right now, they are now starting a protest on foot in Jericho, they're calling it the Jericho protest, they're protesting around parliament. And the truth is that, they are going to continue, because the world supports them.

Because they are saying that Americans are involved, so did he just basically say let's go, America? I find that very odd. Look, we saw this coming. When this first started, we, that it was going to be called an insurrection on 16 wheels, this is the same demonization that the media did with Trump voters, with parents at school board meetings. Everybody becomes a Nazi because they can't argue with them. The first thing they do is they try the blanket smear. I mean, do you really think these are the type of people that are going to mess with the Super Bowl? These are the people who watch the Super Bowl. And it's disgusting that our White House is putting them on par with terrorists. I can't even name a Canadian terrorist. I can name a lot of terrorists from other countries. But I can't do it. But they didn't even do that with antifa. Or antifa. You know, two dozen people died in the George Floyd riots. They didn't get their panties in a bunch over that. But now they're doing it. Basically, nobody has -- nobody has broken a law, except honking. And then you got a C -- a bona fide CNN analyst threatening actual violence, basically trying to initiate violence by saying slash their tires, drain their gas tanks, blah, blah, blah. Imagine if they did that. That would actually initiate violence. That is an actual CN analyst trying to start something. Imagine if I said that about BLM-ers. Man. But the thing is, Canadian truckers, easy target, there's no thumbs up emoji for them. You know? But then she backtracked and said she was trying to talk about peaceful protests.

He might have been able to stop some of this, but right now, they are now starting a protest on foot in Jericho, they're calling it the Jericho protest, they're protesting around parliament. And the truth is that, they are going to continue, because the world supports them. And when Trudeau was talking about foreign money, he's talking about money from the United States, money from all over the world.

Right now, when you have your money in the bank, you are losing 7 percent every year. This Federal Reserve and this man in the White House running fiscal policy is -- they are promoting gambling. The only way that you can keep up with inflation with your money is by taking on downside risk of 20, 30, 40, or 50 percent."

The vice president will be headed to Germany next week to rally allies against Russia. This is for real, Judge.

That should be impeachment? But the issue of the Ukraine is very interesting. Because I spoke to someone today and he said to me. Look, he said the Russians have about 120,000 troops on the borders, they've got about 100,000 in Belarus doing training. He says, but the Russian economy is so bad that the thought of them actually invading and actually staying there doesn't make sense, because they can't afford to keep the troops there. Plus, since they already have access to the water in the Eastern Ukraine, they're already there, they really don't have to go in there. If they go into Kiev, the Ukrainians are tough fighters, and they're going to give them a real run for their money. So, I'm not so sure it's imminent."

I just imagine what would happen if Trump were President right now and how the mind would be covering this. Trump has allowed Vlad to gobble up Ukraine in exchange for his help for beating Hillary Clinton in the election. Donald Trump vacationing in, you know, three-day weekend at Camp David while Americans are left stranded there, as NATO crumbles while Trump golfs.

There's so much that we could have done. Why -- Nord Stream 2, why wait for that? That's number one. Number two, I said this a year ago, or over a year ago, on this very show. Biden dismantling our energy economy and destroying our strength on the world stage where we were the swing producer, we controlled world prices, we had the most excess production capacity, we were the number one energy producer in the world. Biden destroyed that and handed power control and wealth to Russia and Iran, nations that want to wipe us off the planet. You saw today oils at $94 a barrel. Then he turns around and starts begging OPEC to pump more oil in August. So, not only did we enrich Russia, Russia is in a much better economic place now because oil is at a seven-year, eight-year high.
