In an interview today with Business Insider, Donna Brazile expressed regret for telling her ex-friends in the Democratic Party to go to hell on George Stephanopoulos' show last weekend, but she also did offer words of praise, as you say for an unlikely figure. Now, unless you've been living under a rock for the past 10 days, you already know that in her memoir hacks, Brazile claims the Democratic National Committee secretly rigged last year primary process to favor Hillary Clinton in exchange for Clinton's help in retiring the party's $15 million bank debt. That along with other untoward recollections in Brazile's book prompted an open letter from nearly 100 former Clinton campaign staffers, including Mrs. Clinton personal aide, Huma Abedin, communication director, Jane Palmieri, campaign manager, Robby Mook, and campaign chairman, John Podesta. All of whom called Brazile's account troubling and puzzling. It really did cause me to pause and say are these really my friends or are they just imposters, Brazile responds to business insider. Adding, how many of those people who signed that letter got paid last year? I didn't. How many of those people had to get cameras installed in their home? How many of those people had to go home at night driving a different route because somebody was following? I did. In an appearance before an audience of nearly 300 people in San Francisco's commonwealth club last night, Brazile said my Democratic friends are mad at me. So what? No gumbo for them. Nor will Brazile's gumbo-less friends likely be pleased that her praise for the man who defeated Hillary Clinton. Let's give Donald Trump some credit, Brazile's told the audience. I know you're all going to boo me. He cracked a blue wall. He saw everyday what we saw. He saw Hillary's campaign flying over Michigan and Wisconsin. Last week, Brazile, a long time CNN commentator, explained why she agreed to come on Fox News to promote her book, which she did in an appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight, two nights ago. I was part of CNN for well over 14 years of my life, Brazile told business insider. I'm excited to go and see what it's like to be in a Fox studio. I wonder if they're going to put, you know, some special lipstick on. Now, obviously, Martha, you would be in a better position than me to confirm whether Fox News possesses and applies some kind of special lipstick.

The difference here is Bergdahl is not a prisoner of war. He was not a prisoner of war. He's now an admitted deserter. So he made the decision to walk off that base.

I've run five successful campaign or five campaigns, statewide campaigns, three in the county. This has never been brought up. They're bringing it up because it's political, it's a direct attack on this campaign, and it involves a 14-year-old which I never would've had any contact with. This is a completely manufactured story meant to defraud this campaign. And they're losing. They're 11 points behind. They don't like my acknowledgment that there's a God and that we've refused to debate them because of their very liberal stance on transgenderism, and transgenders in military and bathrooms; they're desperate.

They're going to keep a close eye on public opinion. Will there be more accusers coming out, continuing the drumbeat? And also, one of the things that Roy Moore said in that interview with Sean Hannity was that he never even met the woman making the most serious allegation about him involving molestation when she was 14 and he was 32. He said, I never met her. If there's additional evidence that comes out disproving that claim, I really do think he's finished. And Martha, one other point. Listening to that interview with Sean who asked some really tough questions, he said, did you ever date anyone in their teens when you were that age? And to my ears, Roy Moore did not say no. He sort of hedged and said that would not be normal behavior for me. It was not a clear -- if I'm asked, have you ever been on a date as a 32- year-old with a high school student, the answer is definitely not, and I did not hear that."

It has been a slap in the face to every person who has ever been sexually harassed, and almost a knuckle sandwich to anyone who's mustered enough strength to come out and say, you know what, this is what has happened to me. But let us be clear, if Moore wins the election in December, he will be the greatest thorn in the side of the GOP and the greatest guest to the Democrats. And for some people who are saying that this was politically motivated, there have been some rumblings that one of the accusers was actually a sign language interpreter for the Clinton campaign. Well, another one of the accusers is actually a lifelong Republican and voted for Trump in 2016. So, let's not make this political. Let us make sure that these allegations are actually factual. And if so, then Moore does need to step aside because this is not going to look good for him, it's not going to look good for his party.

Are the people that they told contemporaneously that corroborated those conversations, are they credible or are these denials -- some of them had or some of the emphatic by Roy Moore more credible? That's what voters have to decide for themselves. I know where I come down. I do think that these women -- I don't know if he's guilty or not, I don't know if he did these things or not. At least to me, these are credible serious allegations just like I have believed that they were serious credible allegations against Bill Clinton on the other side of the aisle.

He's not been there all day since his arraignment yesterday. He's under a restraining order which requires him to keep a distance of 1,000 feet away from Senator Paul at all times. His attorney told me today that he's gone away because he doesn't want to unintentionally violate that restraining order. His lawyer also told me today, these things, that this was a regrettable incident -- stemming from a long-standing dispute over property in an unkept lawn. He said that Paul was aware of the presence of Boucher at the time of the attack happened -- that's contrary to some of the reporting we've seen.

A state trooper told us today that these charges of misdemeanor, simple assault, could very well be elevated later this weekend or perhaps next week. They could be elevated to a more serious felony charge when the medical records are delivered from the hospital where he was treated to the attorney's -- the State Attorney's Office. And there's also a very good chance of federal criminal charges being filed against Boucher. The attorney for Boucher told me that earlier this week, he met with the U.S. Capitol Police and also field agent for the local office of the FBI. Martha, back to you."

He claims that he came at him from behind. He was mowing the lawn with head phones in to, you know, protect his ears, and he got, basically, blind-sided from the back and knocked down and broken six ribs.

And Martha, the other weird element of this story is this is a sitting, high-profile U.S. Senator who ran for president, who was violently assaulted on his property.

And then, we hear the grumbling of the individuals saying that once he saw, you know, Paul on the floor, he, you know, the conversation was, you know, there was some argument over lawn issues. But then, they're saying that that was not the case. But I do think the American people deserve an answer.

Probably strange, because on his way over to this region from Hawaii on his way to Japan, the president said he was likely going to meet with Putin, was looking forward to enlisting his support on North Korea. Also, wanted to talk to him about the way forward in Syria now that Raqqa has fallen. But the other day, and forgive me if I can't remember exactly what day it was, in Beijing, the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson came out and said they only will have a meeting with Putin if there's enough that they've agreed on that they can talk about. And apparently at that point, and still, they haven't agreed that there's enough for them to talk about, which leaves the Russians feeling a little puzzled about this whole thing.

The Russians, I think, were hopeful that there could be close relations. Things have gotten chilly at the end of the Obama administration. But, of course, the Russian investigation comes forward. And the Russians, I think it's -- you know, it's the third rail, I think. I know that the Trump team is frustrated by the fact that they're hobbled by public perception on the Russian relationship. You know, the people I know from Russia, and I know a few are very confused by all of this. I think that also was borne out in the foreign minister's comments today."

We listened to President Obama say that you know, there was no reason to think of them as the number one enemy, the global enemy. And now, that has completely changed in the course of this whole story that we follow so closely. But Michael Starr Hopkins, Kim Strassel basically, says, look, it's all about nothing, it's all based on a dossier that is not legitimate.

In the dossier, they talk about Paul Manafort having real estate dealings and laundering money that's turned out to be true. Papadopoulos being on the National Security Council, also having ties to the Kremlin, that's turned out to be true. So, I think that this is part of the investigation and we should let the facts bore out. But I think what is true is that, so far, we've seen campaign members be indicted, members of the oval office now under investigation and the optics for the president are really tough, especially going into now, what's going to be the 2018 election."

But there's a lot of revelations today about Michael Flynn suggesting that he entered into some agreement with the Turkish government to bring back someone that they wanted extradited from the United States. And they accused him -- and this is all leaked. That's what I find very interesting about this. So, in the middle of the investigation, and these stories are getting leaked left and right to newspapers. I mean, what do you make of that? And then I want to show Michael Flynn's response."

But, of course, we'll never get to the bottom of these things. But at the same time, if, you know, General Flynn was being paid to follow policy goals brought up to him by the Turkish government, well, that would be illegal, and it should be looked into certainly, and I think it obviously has been. But so far, what we're looking at with General Flynn are just apparently the lack of proper filing procedures and proper reporting procedures. And a lot of these crimes or alleged crimes are not really quite as big as people would like to think. We haven't seen any indictments on the general or his son yet. I think -- it looks like the (INAUDIBLE) to the both of them is coming to a close, and if something's going to come out about the Flynns, it'll come out soon."

And he said, you know, he put out a statement through his attorney saying that he never speaks out about this because he wants the process to play forward. But these suggestions of kidnapping and nefarious things mentioned that were in this article are completely false. So, we will see where it goes. Michael Caputo, Michael Hopkins, thank you very much, you guys. Good to see you, as always."

She's been pretty much at it all week about the tactics of what she called the Clinton cult, and she'd like to reshape the party that she loves in a post- Clinton image. She's taking no prisoners and the grenades keep coming, Chief Washington Correspondent, James Rosen, on that. Plus, Bowe Bergdahl pleaded guilty to desertion. He received a dishonorable discharge and U.S. soldiers searched and died for him. But he may still get hundreds of thousands of dollars in back pay, that may just be too much to bear for those who laid everything on the line for him."

Now, Brazile is taking it a step further in two new interviews taking on critics and praising President Trump. Fox News Chief Washington Correspondent, James Rosen, joins us with the backstory tonight. Hey, James."

      "speaker": "JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Martha, good evening. In an interview today with Business Insider, Donna Brazile expressed regret for telling her ex-friends in the Democratic Party to go to hell on George Stephanopoulos' show last weekend, but she also did offer words of praise, as you say for an unlikely figure. Now, unless you've been living under a rock for the past 10 days, you already know that in her memoir hacks, Brazile claims the Democratic National Committee secretly rigged last year primary process to favor Hillary Clinton in exchange for Clinton's help in retiring the party's $15 million bank debt. That along with other untoward recollections in Brazile's book prompted an open letter from nearly 100 former Clinton campaign staffers, including Mrs. Clinton personal aide, Huma Abedin, communication director, Jane Palmieri, campaign manager, Robby Mook, and campaign chairman, John Podesta. All of whom called Brazile's account troubling and puzzling. It really did cause me to pause and say are these really my friends or are they just imposters, Brazile responds to business insider. Adding, how many of those people who signed that letter got paid last year? I didn't. How many of those people had to get cameras installed in their home? How many of those people had to go home at night driving a different route because somebody was following? I did. In an appearance before an audience of nearly 300 people in San Francisco's commonwealth club last night, Brazile said my Democratic friends are mad at me. So what? No gumbo for them. Nor will Brazile's gumbo-less friends likely be pleased that her praise for the man who defeated Hillary Clinton. Let's give Donald Trump some credit, Brazile's told the audience. I know you're all going to boo me. He cracked a blue wall. He saw everyday what we saw. He saw Hillary's campaign flying over Michigan and Wisconsin. Last week, Brazile, a long time CNN commentator, explained why she agreed to come on Fox News to promote her book, which she did in an appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight, two nights ago. I was part of CNN for well over 14 years of my life, Brazile told business insider. I'm excited to go and see what it's like to be in a Fox studio. I wonder if they're going to put, you know, some special lipstick on. Now, obviously, Martha, you would be in a better position than me to confirm whether Fox News possesses and applies some kind of special lipstick. Suffice to say if you don't cough up this prized information what we all want and need to know."

But this isn't the way to do it. And it's not helpful. It's not, you know -- it's not true. She said it was rigged. Then she said I didn't mean it like that. She said I gave the questions to both sides, and then I'm not sure how I did it. It's just disingenuous and it's not helpful."

But instead of doing all of that, they really need to look at the heart of her revelations. The fact that Hillary did ran this campaign from Brooklyn. Bernie's campaign, Jeff Weaver, the campaign manager have been making these accusations for a long time, and for Donna Brazile to come out and corroborate them, this is a very big moment for Democrats. And instead of disparaging her, you just take her seriously. This is someone who is widely respected among Republicans and Democrats alike. You've heard that repeated over the last few days. Everyone loves Donna Brazile. She's someone who is respected. She's a Clintonite. And for her to make these allegations it's a very big deal."

And you just saw the pictures of them in James' piece. But I know there is a lot in this book about Russia and about hacking. But what I find fascinating is that it doesn't seem like that's what she's talking about. She's not saying that they lost because of Russia hacking. She's saying we lost because we didn't understand what was going on out there. And I wonder, Michael, if that's what got -- what has people so riled up. She's not following the narrative of why they lost."

And I think a lot of Democrats have admitted that Russia could have played a factor in the election, and the poor messaging of the campaign, and ignoring some of the blue collar lunch- pail states is what brought us down. And I don't think that's something that we're denying, but I think that it's something we have to work on. And we saw on Tuesday, the Democrats have gotten better at that messaging, and we've gotten better reaching out. And, you know, onward and forward."

We took a self- reflective look and said here's where we went wrong. The DNC has done not of that. Instead, the Democratic Party has its fake Russia collusion conspiracy theory that they're pointing to as a reason they lost the election, instead of citing the fact that Hillary never went to Michigan, she was part of the establishment elite, she used the DNC for narcissistic self-promotion rather that caring about Democratic voter. Instead of taking an inward look, you're just pointing -- making the blame game and pointing at Russia."

Plus, he admitted to deserting his platoon, he was dishonorably discharged from the army, so why would Bowe Bergdahl be compensated nearly $300,000?

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That was retired senior chief petty officer Mike Toussaint. His military service dog, Remco, was killed during a failed raid in 2009 to rescue Bowe Bergdahl. And tonight, there is some other shocking news in the Bergdahl case that would certainly upset him and the many others who risked their lives to bring Bowe Bergdahl home safely. The army is considering the request that he be compensated $300,000 in back pay for the time that he spent in captivity. Just last week, Bergdahl pled guilty to deserting his agency, his group, and he was dishonorably discharged from the army. He was given no time behind bars, which outraged many in the military who we spoke to here. But now, Ben Collins joins me, former Special Forces officer who served three tours in Afghanistan. Ben, good to have you with us tonight. So how does a convicted deserter who got a dishonorable discharge qualify to be paid by the U.S. military?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEN COLLINS, FORMER SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the key thing here is the fact that he did just plead guilty to desertion. So normally, if a soldier is captured and they're officially a prisoner of war, and while they're prisoner of war, they still accumulate rank, so they're still making rank during the normal time block, and all the years that they're away, all that pay that is accumulated they get back. The difference here is Bergdahl is not a prisoner of war. He was not a prisoner of war. He's now an admitted deserter. So he made the decision to walk off that base. He walked into the hands of the enemy. He was not a prisoner of war, and he shouldn't get that money back in my opinion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean there are concerns that he might get it. The decision hasn't been made yet. But we know that the judge felt that they were mitigating circumstances in this case, and he gave him no time behind bars regardless of all the things that we just talked about. So do you think there's a chance that the argument might be made and might be successful?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I didn't believe -- I couldn't believe that he got off with no jail time. So certainly, I could see, you know, the bureaucratic process figuring out some way to get him his money back. And if that's the case, you know, look, I hope every one of those families of the six soldiers that died and the wounded, I hope they take him to civil court and they get every penny of that. And every penny that that guy stands to make for the rest of his life for that matter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, you look at the things that Bowe Bergdahl said in the court process. He said I understand that leaving was against the law. He uses the word, leaving. He knows that he left of his own volition, and everybody that we've spoken to who was part of that group knew that he left. And you listen to Mike Toussaint, he said I know -- we all knew that but we went to find him because that's what we do. We're not just going to leave him out there even if he walked off on his own. I mean -- go ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "And Toussaint looked -- that service dog, Remco showed more honor and courage than Bergdahl did. And this drives at the heart of something for the military personnel. You know, we use words like, you know, the brotherhood, and warrior ethos, and all of that for a very good reason. And I know that sounds archaic in today's society. But at the end of the day, you're talking about young men and young women that find themselves in the most unimaginable events. When their friends are dying and they are told to stand up and move forward in combat. And I'm going to tell you, where that courage comes from is love. And it's love for the men and women on the right side and the faith that they're going to stand up and move forward to. And that's what Bergdahl betrayed. So it's that feeling of betrayal and that base point that soldiers and marines and air men that they feel together, that's what he betrayed. So there's the legal part in this, but I can tell you that the thing that hurts us the most is that love of his fellow soldier that he just got up and left in the middle of the night."

And those people have no reason to be afraid because they have treated women honor and respect. Now, as to the issue of whether there's a witch hunt going on, I do think that's true. And I think we have to have some pretty careful understanding of what is inappropriate behavior, what's not, what's borderline. Seems there's a frenzy here.

Now, a lot of people come on me at non-twitter anyway because I'm liberal and they don't like what I have to say.
