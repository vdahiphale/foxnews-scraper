      "sentences": "All right, Tucker, thank you. What a news night. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, The Hill's John Solomon is out with a smoking gun report that the FBI informant we've been telling you all about has the evidence that shows a Russian effort to get the corrupt Uranium One deal approved by the Obama administration. Also tonight, Investigative Reporter Sara Carter is now detailing that she has uncovered a \"treasure trove\" of documents that ties Uranium One directly to the Russians. Only information you will hear tonight on \"Hannity\" and I will be joined by both Sara and John later in the program. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first tonight, new reports of sexual misconduct is now rocking liberal America. Plus, a second woman tonight accusing Senator Al Franken of sexual misconduct. And Hillary Clinton continues to viciously attack her husband's accusers, even after saying that all women should be believed. The Clintons have led an effort to victim shame these women for decades. And with the help of their sycophantic friends and their willing accomplices in the media, well, they have helped create the environment we're now living in. All of that and much more in tonight's big breaking news Opening Monologue and investigative report. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right, breaking news tonight about high-profile mainstream media journalists who are being accused of sexual misconduct. CBS News has now suspended Lion of the Liberal Media anchor Charlie Rose, and PBS is now stopping production and distribution of his show following a report in The Washington Post. Now, according to the Post tonight, eight women are accusing Rose of inappropriate sexual behavior including by making unwanted sexual advances, lewd phone calls, being naked in front of them and groping them. In a statement to the Post, Rose admitted wrongdoing. He apologized for his actions and he said that he thought he was pursuing shared feelings. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then there is New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush. He has also been suspended tonight over a Vox.com report were several women are accusing him of sexual misconduct. That includes unwanted sexual contact and kissing. Thrush has apologized also in a statement. We're going to continue to follow both these stories tonight. But the developing situation with Senator Al Franken and the latest comments from Hillary Clinton, it is now exposing a massive problem with the liberal mainstream media in America, because for decades, the media has been feigning moral outrage when it comes to allegations against Republicans while defending year in and year out those Democrats who have been accused of doing far worse. A massive double standard. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, there is a new allegation against Franken. A second woman is now accusing Democratic Senator Al Franken of sexual misconduct. The woman is alleging that during a 2010 state fair in Minnesota that Senator Franken grabbed her behind while the two were posing for a picture. The woman also posted the picture on Facebook and later responded to a comment about this writing, \"Al Franken totally molested me. Creeper.\" Now keep in mind this is two years into Franken's first term as a U.S. senator. Now, Senator Franken is responding to the latest allegations by saying he takes thousands of picture with people, he doesn't remember this specific incident. And Senator Groper added that he feels badly that the woman felt disrespected by their interaction. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we did reach out to Senator Franken for a statement but his office, shockingly, refuses to get back to us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Unfortunately, none of this should really be all that surprising. This is the same guy who made jokes -- nobody else in the media will talk about it -- about drugging and raping women. Joke? Who does this? And last week, Franken was accused of sexual misconduct by radio host Leeann Tweeden and Tweeden revealed explosive information about Senator Franken last week. According to her, during a 2006 USO tour, Franken forcibly kissed her while supposedly rehearsing a skit backstage. There's also this photo of Franken groping Tweeden while she was asleep on a flight. Now Leeann Tweeden says she didn't even know that happened until after she got home and started looking through the pictures of that trip. Franken did issue an apology but claims he doesn't remember the kissing incident backstage. Senator Franken is also being accused of harassing yet another woman, Melanie Morgan, radio, TV, personality, cofounder of the website Media Equalizer. She is accusing Franken of harassing her on the phone. This allegedly happened after they got into an on-air argument during an appearance on Bill Maher's old show \"Politically Incorrect\" back in 2000. And Melanie Morgan says she had to threaten to call the police to get Franken to stop, which he did. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, despite all of that, some members of the media, well, they're making excuses for Al Franken, even tonight.

And what the mainstream media won't tell you is that Franken has been sick and twisted for years. For example, he was on \"Saturday Night Live\", 1995. He suggested a skit about drugging and raping Lesley Stahl of \"60 Minutes\". He said, \"I give the pills to Lesley Stahl, then when Lesley's passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her. Or, that's why you never see Lesley until February. Or, when she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her.\" It's creepy. It's supposed to be funny. And in 2000, Franken, he wrote a satirical article for Playboy magazine. The headline, \"Porn-O-Rama\". The vast majority of what Franken wrote, we can't even repeat on TV, but in one part, Franken wrote \"I'm talking of course about the internet, which is a terrific learning tool. For example, a couple of years ago when he was 12, my son, he used the internet for a sixth grade report on bestiality.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then in 2008 when Franken was running for the Senate, he actually apologized for the comments we just showed you. But it turns out Franken was lying. How do we know? Because in his new book, Franken says he faked the apologies in order to win votes. He writes, \"To say I was sorry for writing a joke was to sell out my career, to sell out who I've been my entire life, and I wasn't sorry. When I had written Porn-o-Rama or pitched that stupid Lesley Stahl joke at 2 in the morning, I was just doing my job.\" His apologies aren't real. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then there is the Clintons. Now, for those of you in the mainstream media, pay attention. Why is this important? Because for 30 years -- 30 -- Democrats on behalf of the Clintons have smeared, slandered, besmirched, victim shamed anyone and everyone who dared to tell what turned out to be the truth about Bill Clinton. And the media has always been their willing accomplices in and out this. They have been complicit up to and including through last year. The only reason now some in the political world are finally just starting to acknowledge what Clinton did is because Bill and Hillary Clinton are no longer important. So now that it's politically expedient, now that they can't hurt them, the Clintons that is, members of the media -- even some, but only some -- are only beginning to start to call out the deplorable behavior. So it's not about principle for them, it's about, well, from 1991 until 2016, the media defends the Clintons on everything regardless of how damaging or disgraceful the allegations were and, well, they can do it now. They can say maybe it wasn't right, but I believe Juanita. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK, well, Hillary Clinton continues to smear, slander, besmirched her husband's accuser today.

Then in Carl Bernstein's book about Hillary, well, he writes that Clinton would refer to Gennifer Flowers as trailer trash. Bill Clinton later admitted to having a sexual relationship with Flowers and he admitted it only when he was under oath. Next up, Paula Jones. She accused Bill Clinton of exposing himself in a hotel room and after filing a lawsuit against him, Clinton ended up paying Jones $850,000 with an out-of-court settlement. And in a related case, Clinton lost his law license in Arkansas for five years. The Clinton machine also went vicious after Jones, according to The New York Times and fake news CNN and other outlets, longtime Clinton ally, CNN pundit for awhile James Carville, remember, infamously said this about Jones, \"If you drag $100 bill through a trailer park, you never know what you'll will find.\" And Carville also slammed Jones by saying that she only sued Clinton because of money. Then of course there's Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern that had an affair with Bill Clinton. And just like the other accusers, well, Hillary had a nasty nickname for Lewinsky.

Broaddrick also describes an encounter where Hillary tried to silence her. Well, that's who the Clintons are, who they've always been. What they did to these women is reprehensible.

The one piece of truth that actually did come out of Hillary Clinton's mouth, just ingenuous as it was, is that you have to take each one of these cases separately. And the sheer number of allegations in any one man's case does not prove that sexual assault or rape happen. You have to think about timing. You have to think about context. You have to think about the fact in the case of these Washington Post investigations that you were talking allegations that are somewhere, sometimes 20, 30 years old and you had activists, journalists who were soliciting and procuring women to tell the stories.

      "utterance": "All right, Tucker, thank you. What a news night. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, The Hill's John Solomon is out with a smoking gun report that the FBI informant we've been telling you all about has the evidence that shows a Russian effort to get the corrupt Uranium One deal approved by the Obama administration. Also tonight, Investigative Reporter Sara Carter is now detailing that she has uncovered a \"treasure trove\" of documents that ties Uranium One directly to the Russians. Only information you will hear tonight on \"Hannity\" and I will be joined by both Sara and John later in the program. But first tonight, new reports of sexual misconduct is now rocking liberal America. Plus, a second woman tonight accusing Senator Al Franken of sexual misconduct. And Hillary Clinton continues to viciously attack her husband's accusers, even after saying that all women should be believed. The Clintons have led an effort to victim shame these women for decades. And with the help of their sycophantic friends and their willing accomplices in the media, well, they have helped create the environment we're now living in. All of that and much more in tonight's big breaking news Opening Monologue and investigative report. All right, breaking news tonight about high-profile mainstream media journalists who are being accused of sexual misconduct. CBS News has now suspended Lion of the Liberal Media anchor Charlie Rose, and PBS is now stopping production and distribution of his show following a report in The Washington Post. Now, according to the Post tonight, eight women are accusing Rose of inappropriate sexual behavior including by making unwanted sexual advances, lewd phone calls, being naked in front of them and groping them. In a statement to the Post, Rose admitted wrongdoing. He apologized for his actions and he said that he thought he was pursuing shared feelings. Then there is New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush. He has also been suspended tonight over a Vox.com report were several women are accusing him of sexual misconduct. That includes unwanted sexual contact and kissing. Thrush has apologized also in a statement. We're going to continue to follow both these stories tonight. But the developing situation with Senator Al Franken and the latest comments from Hillary Clinton, it is now exposing a massive problem with the liberal mainstream media in America, because for decades, the media has been feigning moral outrage when it comes to allegations against Republicans while defending year in and year out those Democrats who have been accused of doing far worse. A massive double standard. And tonight, there is a new allegation against Franken. A second woman is now accusing Democratic Senator Al Franken of sexual misconduct. The woman is alleging that during a 2010 state fair in Minnesota that Senator Franken grabbed her behind while the two were posing for a picture. The woman also posted the picture on Facebook and later responded to a comment about this writing, \"Al Franken totally molested me. Creeper.\" Now keep in mind this is two years into Franken's first term as a U.S. senator. Now, Senator Franken is responding to the latest allegations by saying he takes thousands of picture with people, he doesn't remember this specific incident. And Senator Groper added that he feels badly that the woman felt disrespected by their interaction. Now, we did reach out to Senator Franken for a statement but his office, shockingly, refuses to get back to us. Unfortunately, none of this should really be all that surprising. This is the same guy who made jokes -- nobody else in the media will talk about it -- about drugging and raping women. Joke? Who does this? And last week, Franken was accused of sexual misconduct by radio host Leeann Tweeden and Tweeden revealed explosive information about Senator Franken last week. According to her, during a 2006 USO tour, Franken forcibly kissed her while supposedly rehearsing a skit backstage. There's also this photo of Franken groping Tweeden while she was asleep on a flight. Now Leeann Tweeden says she didn't even know that happened until after she got home and started looking through the pictures of that trip. Franken did issue an apology but claims he doesn't remember the kissing incident backstage. Senator Franken is also being accused of harassing yet another woman, Melanie Morgan, radio, TV, personality, cofounder of the website Media Equalizer. She is accusing Franken of harassing her on the phone. This allegedly happened after they got into an on-air argument during an appearance on Bill Maher's old show \"Politically Incorrect\" back in 2000. And Melanie Morgan says she had to threaten to call the police to get Franken to stop, which he did. Now, despite all of that, some members of the media, well, they're making excuses for Al Franken, even tonight. Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Excuse me, in the case of Leeann Tweeden, there's the evidence. It's all there. Franken is not even denying it. It just shows how low the mainstream media, Democrats are willing to go to defend people that suit their ideology, like Franken. And what the mainstream media won't tell you is that Franken has been sick and twisted for years. For example, he was on \"Saturday Night Live\", 1995. He suggested a skit about drugging and raping Lesley Stahl of \"60 Minutes\". He said, \"I give the pills to Lesley Stahl, then when Lesley's passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her. Or, that's why you never see Lesley until February. Or, when she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her.\" It's creepy. It's supposed to be funny. And in 2000, Franken, he wrote a satirical article for Playboy magazine. The headline, \"Porn-O-Rama\". The vast majority of what Franken wrote, we can't even repeat on TV, but in one part, Franken wrote \"I'm talking of course about the internet, which is a terrific learning tool. For example, a couple of years ago when he was 12, my son, he used the internet for a sixth grade report on bestiality.\" Then in 2008 when Franken was running for the Senate, he actually apologized for the comments we just showed you. But it turns out Franken was lying. How do we know? Because in his new book, Franken says he faked the apologies in order to win votes. He writes, \"To say I was sorry for writing a joke was to sell out my career, to sell out who I've been my entire life, and I wasn't sorry. When I had written Porn-o-Rama or pitched that stupid Lesley Stahl joke at 2 in the morning, I was just doing my job.\" His apologies aren't real. Then there is the Clintons. Now, for those of you in the mainstream media, pay attention. Why is this important? Because for 30 years -- 30 -- Democrats on behalf of the Clintons have smeared, slandered, besmirched, victim shamed anyone and everyone who dared to tell what turned out to be the truth about Bill Clinton. And the media has always been their willing accomplices in and out this. They have been complicit up to and including through last year. The only reason now some in the political world are finally just starting to acknowledge what Clinton did is because Bill and Hillary Clinton are no longer important. So now that it's politically expedient, now that they can't hurt them, the Clintons that is, members of the media -- even some, but only some -- are only beginning to start to call out the deplorable behavior. So it's not about principle for them, it's about, well, from 1991 until 2016, the media defends the Clintons on everything regardless of how damaging or disgraceful the allegations were and, well, they can do it now. They can say maybe it wasn't right, but I believe Juanita. OK, well, Hillary Clinton continues to smear, slander, besmirched her husband's accuser today. Just take a listen to the latest attack by Hillary."

They sprung into action to attack all to attack Flowers. And then Bill and Hillary, they show up on \"60 Minutes.\" They denied the charges and went after Flowers' character. And the media, they never took it seriously. How do we know?

      "utterance": "That's the media laughing. What do they find so funny? Now to further smear Flowers, Hillary told Vanity Fair the following. Well, \"If we'd been in front of a jury, I'd say, Ms. Flowers, isn't it true you were asked by the AP in June of 1990 and you said no? Weren't you asked by the Arkansas Democrat and you said no? I mean, I would crucify her.\" Really, Hillary? Crucify her? What happened to believing her? Women have a right to be believed. Then in Carl Bernstein's book about Hillary, well, he writes that Clinton would refer to Gennifer Flowers as trailer trash. Bill Clinton later admitted to having a sexual relationship with Flowers and he admitted it only when he was under oath. Next up, Paula Jones. She accused Bill Clinton of exposing himself in a hotel room and after filing a lawsuit against him, Clinton ended up paying Jones $850,000 with an out-of-court settlement. And in a related case, Clinton lost his law license in Arkansas for five years. The Clinton machine also went vicious after Jones, according to The New York Times and fake news CNN and other outlets, longtime Clinton ally, CNN pundit for awhile James Carville, remember, infamously said this about Jones, \"If you drag $100 bill through a trailer park, you never know what you'll will find.\" And Carville also slammed Jones by saying that she only sued Clinton because of money. Then of course there's Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern that had an affair with Bill Clinton. And just like the other accusers, well, Hillary had a nasty nickname for Lewinsky. According to a journal entry that was made public, Hillary's friend Diane Blair said Hillary called Lewinsky a \"narcissistic Loony Tune\". And yet Kathleen Willey, she accused Bill Clinton in the Oval Office of groping and grabbing and fondling and touching and kissing her all against her will, while she was a volunteer at the White House. Willey later said that Hillary enabled her husband's predatory behavior. And of course we can't forget Juanita Broaddrick. She alleged that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978. Broaddrick also describes an encounter where Hillary tried to silence her. Well, that's who the Clintons are, who they've always been. What they did to these women is reprehensible. Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign came up with the term bimbo eruptions to describe the women who came forward and made accusations against Bill. George Stephanopoulos wrote in his memoir that in '91 Hillary said, \"We have to destroy her,\" when describing one of Bill's accusers. And speaking of George, watch how he handled one person who threatened to leak information about Bill Clinton to the press. Watch this."

If you went on the radio and said that Bill Clinton is the father of an illegitimate black child, you would be laughed at. They would think you're crazy. I guarantee you that if you do this, you'll never work in Democratic politics again, maybe you don't want to. I'm not saying it matters. You will be embarrassed before the national press corps. People will think -- nobody will believe you and people will think you're scummy. The alternative is you don't do it, it causes you some temporary pain with people who tomorrow aren't going to matter. And you have a campaign that understands it in a difficult time you did something right. And, you know, that's important. I mean it doesn't mean anything. We can't do anything for you specifically or anything like that, but you know that you did the right thing."

Their allies in the Democratic Party, their friends in the media, they knew it. They did everything they could to cover it up and completely trash Bill's accusers up to and including last year's election. Is that inexcusable? The media also never reported that Hillary and her family foundation -- I talked about it a lot last year -- took tens of millions of dollars from countries that abuse women, kill gays and lesbians, persecute Christians and Jews which is horrible. She took all of that money.The Clintons literally by taking it endorsed that repressive behavior. They bought her silence and the media of course all last year, they gave him a free pass. Now, so while it's nice to see that some on the left and the media now that Clintons have no power, are only starting to admit how horrible the Clintons were to Bill's accusers, I argue it's a little too little too late. Here with reaction, CRTV Host, Michelle Malkin, former deputy assistant to the president, Fox News national security strategist Sebastian Gorka. I want to be very clear, Michelle. Nobody has a monopoly. There are horrible Republicans out there, horrible people in general. That's not what I'm describing here. I am describing systematically, because of politics, the Clintons were protected by the media and they went out and just abused these women again and again and smear them to death, even up to and including through the election last year."

      "utterance": "That's right, Sean. And this is not ancient history. You're going to have all of these liberal wheelers out there asking, why is Sean Hannity and Michelle Malkin and Sebastian Gorka talking about Bill Clinton? It's because so much of the mess that we're in now is a result and legacy of the Clinton victim smear machine. These two are the godparents, Hillary and Bill Clinton, the godparents of victim shaming smear tactics. And now, we've got this case where you've got all of these liberal media journalists who are tying themselves in yoga knots to try and reconcile their own roles and their own culpability in enabling the Clinton smears against all of his accusers and victims with the left wing, feminist ideology of believing all women. And now what we know of course is it's not revelation. It's merely confirmation, Sean, that the idea that we should believe all women has an exception. Really, the rules to radicals 2017 has always been that you should believe all women, except when they are accusing liberal Democratic men and liberal Hollywood weirdoes. There's a second corollary to that unwritten rule that is not being exploded and exposed for the farce that it is. And that second corollary is this, Sean and Dr. Gorka, it's this, that all women must be respected, unless of course they are female Republicans, conservatives, pro-lifers, stay-at-home moms, and gun owners. I have lived this for the past 25 years in public life, along with all of the women who've been smeared by leftists in the media and in the Democratic Party. We're always treated as less than women and less than human. And when we have called out the misogyny and hypocrisy and the double standards of the left, we get attacked even more. The hypocrisy and double standards are thicker than Thanksgiving gravy."

So now, 30 years later, they find morality. So it's okay if Al Franken admits to it, then it just disappears as an issue. You look at Bob Menendez, Senator Menendez. We're not going to cover that story, but we don't have the proof on Judge Moore and he is the problem. So number one, Sean, it's the unbelievable level of double standards. But the second thing is beyond that, it's what Sharyl Attkisson has written about in her book \"Smear\". It's the persistent smear tactics, just making stuff up because it's politically expedient to your friends. How is it that you have all these individuals who are supposed to be journalists, but they literally manufacture stories out of nothing to attack the President? Sometimes it's trivial. You remember recently the fish feeding event in Japan, right, where they cropped out that the President is actually doing exactly what his host did before. Why? Because it's expedient to make the President look bad, or it gets far more serious. CNN is going to say that James Comey is going to counter everything the President said about the FBI investigation him or not. It goes on and on and on because it's all about politics. It's never about the truth, Sean, it's never just about journalism."

They give a 21-year-old kid a computer and access to Google and they call him a journalist. That's how political works, that's how \"Huff Post\" works.

Because I am an investigative journalist myself, and I want to address some of the comments then Sebastian Gorka had said at the end of the last segment as well, which is where are the investigative journalists particularly on this issue? And it's an issue that I've been covering for the last year at crtv.com, particularly when it comes to false allegations of sexual assault and rape. And to answer the question about how often it happens, it is a lie of the left-wing feminist establishment that only 2 percent of allegations are false. In fact, the literature shows that it's anywhere between eight and 41 percent. So the issue that you're raising, Sean, is very important which is how do ordinary citizens who cannot trust ideologues and advocates in the media to tell them the truth that each and every one of these allegations? The one piece of truth that actually did come out of Hillary Clinton's mouth, just ingenuous as it was, is that you have to take each one of these cases separately. And the sheer number of allegations in any one man's case does not prove that sexual assault or rape happen. You have to think about timing. You have to think about context. You have to think about the fact in the case of these Washington Post investigations that you were talking allegations that are somewhere, sometimes 20, 30 years old and you had activists, journalists who were soliciting and procuring women to tell the stories. Just because stories all sound the same, doesn't mean they are true. Assertions are not truth until they are corroborated as facts, and corroborated with evidence. Shown that all of the reporting I've shown from Daniel. Two railroaded on surviving wrongful convictions. There are many innocent men in this country."

That is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now. If you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there's no connection to uranium one. This are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files. They said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case. We now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration.

There's no separate companies. They are all related. The Russian nuclear energy is controlled from the top, from Putin. They are all one. They all talk to each other. So the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009, 2010, and why is it that CFIUS either wasn't told, or CFIUS people knowing about it --"

This person said without a shred of doubt, we knew in 2009 a year before CFIUS ruled that Thomas were engaged in criminality, without a shadow of a doubt, we knew that Russia was trying to gain a corner on the U.S. market, get a strong hold on our uranium, and without a doubt we knew they were using political levers to try to get their way here.

Maybe what we begin to see happen is virtue coming back in America as people realize whether it's the extraordinary scale of the opioid epidemic, which the Trump administration reported on today, but the stunning amount of harassment and violation of women that we are seeing come out day after day now. All of a sudden, all of these things at the left tolerated are beginning to be unacceptable and very painful, and that may lead the country, not just Republicans, not just conservatives, but the country, to have a really serious conversation about what are the standards we want going forward?"

The things that are coming out now for example, about the whole uranium one case and all the pieces that surround that, and I say to myself, where's the congressional hearing that week after week, month after month, simply strips away the lies and gets the facts back up so the American people can see what really happened?"

This is before CFIUS ended up getting the nine department approval, including Hillary's state and Eric Holder's justice, and allowed this deal to go through, which on the surface never made sense. 20 percent of America uranium in the hands of a bad actor, a hostile regime, Putin and Russia."

And second, UCLA basketball player, you are at a great University, you have a great future, what are you doing shoplifting? I think people should be pretty irritated that these guys will have a privileged life, have a privileged future, have a chance for a multimillion dollar career in the NBA, are out here embarrassing America, looking stupid and doing something that is totally dumb. And I'm embarrassed for that father, that he didn't have the decency to say thank you, Mr. President, I got to talked to my kid. I clearly didn't get things across to him. I just think this is a sign of what is sick about America, that people don't take responsibility, they don't take accountability. Trump probably shouldn't upset I left him in jail.
