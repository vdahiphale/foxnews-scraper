And it's unclear at this point if anyone has challenged the ruling. We know that 18-year-old suspect Devon Erickson was anti-Trump, supported the far left, and on social media expressed antipathy for Christians who hate gays. He even drove a car that was spray-painted with a pentagram, the number 666, the sign of the beast, and the words \"F society.\" The other suspect is listed in court documents as 16-years-old Maya Elizabeth McKinney. But apparently McKinney is transgender and goes by Alec. Bullying is reportedly being looked at as a motive for the shooting, but not the only motive. At least one of the suspects had been in therapy and had a history of legal and illegal drug use. And Alec McKinney's father is reportedly an illegal immigrant who had been recently deported in 2017 and had his own criminal history, including kidnapping, domestic violence, and weapons charges. Five months ago a parent warned the STEM school that bullying and violence could lead to the next Columbine. The school investigated, Laura, but found no evidence to support the claims.",

But I also want to say this, don't buy into the malarkey the Chamber of Commerce recites this endlessly that America needs millions and millions of more workers. The real translation for we have a worker shortage is, we don't want to raise wages. They never liked it when wages are going up. And if you believe in the law of supply and demand, a tight labor market means that wages are going up. And when wages go up that leads to happier workers, and maybe even happier voters in 2020 and maybe even people who are having bigger families which is also good for society. Now whatever you think of Trump's framework on immigration, it is a heck of a lot more than the Democrats are doing, which is nothing. Now last week we took you to Del Rio, Texas that sector of the border and it was nothing short of shocking. Our absurd laws, our rulings by radical judges have basically incentivized widespread fraud and the cartels are - doing all the human and drug trafficking are fat and happy, while regular Americans have to suffer. This must stop. Congress should stay in session until they pass the necessary legislation to close all these loopholes and end this madness. Now at the current pace, by the end of this calendar year, we will have caught and released almost 1 million migrants into the United States. Wrap your head around that figure. But immigration activists aren't buying it. They don't want you even to know these facts. The group New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice issued this statement today, \"This plan of the President's is a continuation of Stephen Miller's scheme to impose his White Supremacist ideology on the American people with anti-immigrant and racist attacks by punishing immigrants and asylum seekers\". They're so predictable that they're actually boring. Yesterday we heard from Americans whose lives have been shattered because of illegal immigration.

But let's make one thing clear, Trump, also while focusing on border enforcement and the need to change the system, he also appreciates, as we all do, that legal immigrants add tremendously and have consistently to our nation's unfolding story - our economy and our culture. And any media person who says differently about Trump and what he believes is lying to you. But the President also correctly understands that our safety, our security, our American culture and our prosperity have at times been compromised and our people harmed by feckless politicians who'd rather complain on MSNBC than offer a way forward. The President is now calling their bluff with his sensible plan, and that's THE ANGLE. Now despite the common sense of Trump's immigration plan, it's still in sort of broad stroke form, why are Democrats just reflexively rejecting any type of compromise?

Fast forward to April of 2016, I'm - the Australian government is reaching out trying to connect with me, 10 Downing Street is connecting with me, and then of course, which I find very suspicious is, that the DIA reached out to me at the U.S. Embassy in London. These two individuals named Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley just days before this infamous meeting I had with Alexander Downer, who I've testified under oath and I've reported both to the FBI and Bob Mueller that I felt that he was a spying on me. And something I want to you know make clear about this meeting with Downer. I don't think I was just suspicious that he was spying on me because I'm - in my transcripts to Congress you see people like Mark Meadows and John Radcliffe asking me if I ever was presented with transcripts of any meetings I had with Alexander Downer, Josef Mifsud or any of these strange people that were running into me?

And so now there's some obfuscation between James Comey, John Brennan, and James Clapper about how can they use this dossier in an intelligence report, or should they report it to the president.

A lot of the lawsuits are getting to the courts, and the courts are making it harder and harder to use race as a proxy. You come up with this adversity score, and then you don't tell the student what his score is, and the schools get to decide which portions of it. What they're actually getting to do is throw away, did you perform well in school, do you have some aptitude. Those kinds of things are what the SAT is supposed to do. Now, if you don't want an SAT anymore, that's fine, but what you shouldn't be allowed to do is have the SAT company work in tandem with the Affirmative Action crowd that's just giving more advantage to one group over another group."

In 2007, Black was convicted after prosecutors accused him of, quote, several acts of mail fraud and obstruction. And it's worth noting that several of these convictions were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. But Black still served 42 months in prison. He got his sentence cut short but not short enough. And he was forced to leave the United States upon his release. Now despite all of this, as well as pleas for his clemency from luminaries of every political persuasion, this was the reaction today."

He certainly has never mentioned it. And in any case, anyone who has read it can see that it is not uncritical. It's no whitewash. It points out some of the less salubrious aspects of his career. And I am not uncritical of him. In general, I am supporter for policy reasons. And he was at pains to say when he phoned last week that his motivation, and he authorized me to say this, urged me to say this, was not that we'd known each other a long time or that I've been generally supportive of him. It is that after careful examination by the White House Counsel and his legal staff, they confirmed what Alan Dershowitz and others lawyers said on my behalf, and the president's own words were, it was an unjust verdict, and I never should have been charged, and it was a bad rap. Those were his motives. If he handed favors out to his friends, there would be, you would have five ambassadors in every embassy."

I have to say, Laura, I know you're a well-qualified lawyer. I'm a lawyer, I haven't practiced for 50 years, but I am in theory a lawyer. And any serious jurisdiction except the United States would disbar most of these prosecutors. It's absolutely outrageous what they do. And as everybody knows, basically what they do is they target somebody, they round up everybody near them in whatever activity is objected to, say you better jog your memory or there's an obstruction of justice going on here and a conspiracy to subvert justice, and you will be charged. But if you can jog your memory successfully and help us, then you have immunity from perjury and carry on."

But for some reason Douglas County District Attorney Judge Teresa Slade sealed the entire case file, banning the public from seeing anything in it. So what is she hiding? Trace Gallagher is in our West Coast Newsroom with all the details. Trace?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Laura. Both suspects in the Colorado STEM school shooting are being charged as adults. The charges themselves, including murder, theft, and arson, are public, but despite prosecutors wanting nearly all the documents public, as you say, Judge Teresa Slade decided to seal them both, though she didn't show any cause or compelling need for secrecy. And it's unclear at this point if anyone has challenged the ruling. We know that 18-year-old suspect Devon Erickson was anti-Trump, supported the far left, and on social media expressed antipathy for Christians who hate gays. He even drove a car that was spray-painted with a pentagram, the number 666, the sign of the beast, and the words \"F society.\" The other suspect is listed in court documents as 16-years-old Maya Elizabeth McKinney. But apparently McKinney is transgender and goes by Alec. Bullying is reportedly being looked at as a motive for the shooting, but not the only motive. At least one of the suspects had been in therapy and had a history of legal and illegal drug use. And Alec McKinney's father is reportedly an illegal immigrant who had been recently deported in 2017 and had his own criminal history, including kidnapping, domestic violence, and weapons charges. Five months ago a parent warned the STEM school that bullying and violence could lead to the next Columbine. The school investigated, Laura, but found no evidence to support the claims."
