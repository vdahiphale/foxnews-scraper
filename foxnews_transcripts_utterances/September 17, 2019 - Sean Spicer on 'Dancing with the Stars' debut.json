So, as you got the border security fight, you got the gun debate, you got the opioid crisis, you got a lot of unresolved issues in America. But they're not one, but two impeachment efforts that are now underway tonight by House Democrats. They want the president, and then they also want some of them, Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The House Judiciary Committee today spent over five hours on the now- debunked Russia probe to remind everyone these are the words of the Mueller report after they spent two years investigating, this was the bottom line. The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, as you also probably remember, the outcome was a disappointment to Democrats who were shocked. And they are now hoping that they can salvage an impeachment case anyway. They're pursuing the Russia probe continually, the president as a racist, his taxes which are under investigation in New York, and they are also digging into that. And also his businesses and the connections that he has through those. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, today, the House Judiciary Committee questioned former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who by the way, had already testified before Congress three times and has been interviewed by the special counsel adding up to what he figures is about 20 hours' worth of questioning in total. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So, as you got the border security fight, you got the gun debate, you got the opioid crisis, you got a lot of unresolved issues in America. But they're not one, but two impeachment efforts that are now underway tonight by House Democrats. They want the president, and then they also want some of them, Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, out. The House Judiciary Committee today spent over five hours on the now- debunked Russia probe to remind everyone these are the words of the Mueller report after they spent two years investigating, this was the bottom line. The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. So, as you also probably remember, the outcome was a disappointment to Democrats who were shocked. And they are now hoping that they can salvage an impeachment case anyway. They're pursuing the Russia probe continually, the president as a racist, his taxes which are under investigation in New York, and they are also digging into that. And also his businesses and the connections that he has through those. So, today, the House Judiciary Committee questioned former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who by the way, had already testified before Congress three times and has been interviewed by the special counsel adding up to what he figures is about 20 hours' worth of questioning in total."

Now, bear in mind, this is the latest poll on how the American people feel about this effort. 59 percent are opposed to President Trump being impeached, 40 --35 percent support that avenue and 41 percent were asked is it a good idea for the House Judiciary to conduct an impeachment inquiry? And 41 percent said, yes. 51 percent said, no, it's a bad idea. So, now, when asked by Congressman Matt Gaetz today why Democrats continue, despite perhaps what the polling says.

I have nothing to hide because we never committed any crimes at the campaign. We never colluded with anyone, which is exactly what the Mueller report says. So, I was happy to go. But then, they decided to issue me a subpoena. And then last week, they changed the rules of the House, so that not only members of Congress could ask me questions, but consultants to the committee who were brought in just for the impeachment proceeding could then start asking questions. It's a very unfair process."

Why don't you take the opportunity and have a testimony with Michael Horowitz who wrote the inspector general's report? Why don't you fix the problem of illegal immigration, which is -- you know, killing Americans because they're coming across the border illegally?

The president asked me to go have a conversation with Jeff Sessions is basically what's in the Mueller report. I've testified to the fact that I believe that to be accurate. And then, I just never did it. And so, they want to talk about what may have transpired had I spoken to Jeff Sessions. But it's all speculation because I never had the conversation.

And today, we watch the majority to simply trash procedure, they trash everything because they're so just be in on getting this president. I termed with what has happened today is bring a big donor to workday. Because at the end of the hearing, which we objected to, they allowed a staff member, who's a big donor Mary Burke, $70,000 to the Democratic Party. He got to ask 30 minutes of questions. 30 minutes and he's a contract employee of that committee. He doesn't have to give up his practice anywhere else, he comes and does what he wants to. So, let's bring a big donor to workday, and he got to ask questions. But when it came time for the 30 minutes of staff questions on our side, they would not let the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee take that 30 minutes and use it. They said members had already had their time. I'm not sure that American people are going to understand how you let a paid donor, who is now a contract employee, not a staff member, overriding an elected representative."

All they want to do is have cameras show up and press show up. And they'll throw anything they can to get the president, to try and tear him down. They have become the literally, the political arm of the DCCC. The problem we're having is, here is Corey out and stated so well. He made his statements today, he's testified before Congress many times. They've gained nothing in these investigations. But people are getting tired of it. They're going to see it even more so. And when the people actually look at really what happened today, how they just trampled over time and rights. And then, actually, put a paid democratic person up there, and bring a lobbyist and basically bring a donor today. That's just amazing to me when they did that over the rights of our duly elected representatives of the U.S. Congress -- States Congress."

I think Durbin really struck the right note with two words, \"get real.\" The advice would really be well given to Nadler who's own so-called impeachment hearing on the president is a bit of play-acting also. But certainly, this claim that they're going to impeach Kavanaugh is ridiculous. And it's not about -- it's not about impeaching Kavanaugh, it's about dirtying him up and destroying his reputation, credibility, and the reputation and the credibility of the court that he sits on."

And the claim that somehow he misrepresented what he had done in college I think isn't borne out by the facts. This is -- this is another blind alley. They come up with a new -- a new allegation in which the report was that they never spoke to the source of the allegation and they never spoke to the victim, and that the only information they have is that the victim has denied it to her friend or says she doesn't recall it.

He said, Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable.

A similar playbook proved powerful when a real estate mogul turned reality T.V. star with no political experience promised to make America great again. Bernie Sanders turned out a passionate grassroots following in 2016 but fell short. Now many of those supporters appear to be turning towards the Senator from Massachusetts. Last night Elisabeth Warren's campaign estimates that 20,000 people showed up for a rally in New York City, President Trump's home turf. Her message, fundamentally transform our government.

I think the more she talks, the more she becomes the face of the Democrat Party, I think the more the Republicans are going to look spectacular, come November 2020.

You're not going to cheat our people and you are not going to take our jobs. The president is actually been setting up for those people, and while that is a process, he has moved that further along.

I didn't buy my gun from the government. They can't buy that gun back. And if it's mandatory, they are not buying it, they are coercing me to give it to them. They are stealing it. It's confiscation.

Red flag laws, for someone who maybe has mental issues or has been engaged in assaulting a spouse, people think that's a good idea. People also think they know what assault weapons are. So, I listened to Michael. Michael says you have to be careful, and I agree. Bat what Beto is talking about is assault rifles. And when you ask the American people in polling it's interesting even people who are members of the NRA, people who are self-identified as Republicans say, they think, you know, given what happened in El Paso and what happened in Dayton, I could go on, you know at Las Vegas, somebody should do something."

But for most Americans, they think no, you know what? We don't need these weapons of war on the streets of America. Even if you are a hunter, you don't need an AR-47 to shoot a dear.

      "utterance": "Martha, good evening. The preliminary exit polls are in and things are not looking good for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While he still could pull off a surprise victory tonight against his main opponent Benny Gantz of the Blue and White Party. Polls indicate he is not going to have the 61-seat majority in the Israeli Knesset in order for him to govern here in Israel. The key here is a third party. The party our house Israel led by Netanyahu's former defense minister and long-time rival Avigdor Lieberman. Lieberman according to exit polls is expected to get anywhere between eight and 10 seats in the Israeli Knesset. This is going to make him the king maker in all of this. Basically, deciding who the next prime minister of Israel is. You can hear some of the Likud music behind me. This is theme music for the party. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expected here shortly. He is going to make a short and important speech according to his spokesman. Back to you, Martha."

      "utterance": "All right. Trey, thank you very much. Trey Yingst will be watching that throughout the evening tonight as that tally continues to come in a tough election tonight for Benjamin Netanyahu. And finally, this evening, a new episode of the Untold Story podcast is available. It features Andrew Pollack who lost his daughter Meadow in the Parkland school shooting. Pollack believes that the Obama administration rules to some extent tied the school's hands when it came to discipline and allowed the Parkland shooter to stay out of jail. Controversial. It deserves a listen. I hope you will. You can subscribe to the Untold Story podcast at foxnewspodcast.com or wherever you listen. New one up every week. That is “The Story” for tonight on this Tuesday, September 17, 2019. But as you know, “The Story” goes on and so we will look forward to seeing you back here tomorrow night at 7 o'clock.
