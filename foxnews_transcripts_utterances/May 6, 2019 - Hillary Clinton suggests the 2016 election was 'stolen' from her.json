      "sentences": "It's \"Hannity\" at 9:00 p.m. in East, 6:00 p.m. on the West Coast. We're glad you're with us. Buckle up. The Democratic mob is out of control, grasping at straws. It is officially a psychotic state of denial. This is the absolute truth and reality that the Democrats in Washington and the media mob cannot possibly come to grips with the reality, the truth that will set them free. They are in now a psychotic rage and it keeps spinning over and over in their little liberal brains. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Every single thing -- I will say it tonight once and for all -- you will hear from this day forward about Mueller, Russia and collusion and obstruction and Trump is nothing but forever meaningless and just a lot of noise by bitter people. Four separate investigations concluded no Trump campaign, no Trump Russian collusion -- none, zero, nothing. Nothing they say is going to change that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The FBI's nine-month counter intel investigation, nothing. The House Intel investigation, nothing. The bipartisan Senate investigation, nothing. And special Robert Mueller's witch hunt found nothing. And they were trying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mueller is done. It's over. This is like worse for them an selection night 2016 especially when the exit polls showed at 5:15 that Donald Trump didn't win. It's like it's shown in 2004, John Kerry was the next president. Wrong again. Look at the liberal tears, panic, mayhem and downright unhinged nature of everybody. Tonight, continue the hysteria. And, frankly, I may be blunt here. This is now officially a mass mental disturbance never before seen on this kind of level, full-blown psychotic meltdown. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The rage Trump's mob new favorite target, they have to blame somebody for themselves for the lies they told, the conspiracies and the hoax they believe and spread. This is where it gets so absurd. Listen closely to this: under federal law, yes, the law, the Attorney General Barr was not required at all, zero, to release any portion of the Mueller report. He didn't have to release one word. But in an effort to be transparent, he did it anyway. He didn't have to.  The A.G. released the report after redacting that was legally required, including the grand jury investigation, investigatory sources and methods. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Prior to full release, we know Barr submitted March 24th, a public letter outlining the report's key findings, no collusion, no determination on obstruction. But the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, the Office of Legal Counsel, all concurred pretty much within an hour that there was no obstruction. While offered Mueller the chance to review his letter before he sent it.  Mueller declined, speak now or forever hold your piece. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mueller later admitted, Barr's summary was in no way inaccurate or misleading, despite writing a whiny letter about he's misinterpreted by the media mob. Me and Mueller have something in common. We see the media mob for who they are. And Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee but refused to be interrogated in the House, not by the congressmen and women that are unaccountable and elected to office but by Nadler's lawyers and staff.  This has never happened in the 206 years of history of that committee, and Barr was not going to let it happen now. He is still willing to testify before actual committee members. I think they are afraid of him. Now, during this entire process, Barr told the truth. He committed no crimes. He went above and beyond what the law requires in terms of transparency. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, laughably, because of what I just outlined for all of you, and described the list of prominent Democrats, they are still calling for Barr to resign or be impeached including crazy Uncle Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, the cowardly Schiff and, of course, there's always Maxine Waters.  No one else is calling for impeachment, she is. Citing little evidence, Speaker Pelosi even claims Barr committed the crime of lying to Congress. No, he didn't. And Nadler is moving to hold Barr in contempt to Congress. And his colleague, yes, Chicken Little himself, Congress Steve Cohen, he actually - - he's calling for Barr to be locked up. This is -- they lost it. They are unhinged. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They can't beat Trump in 2020 and they know it. It's the only way to get rid of him. Now, congressional Democrats are calling for Mueller to testify, of course, another desperate attempt to keep the collusion hoax, conspiracy theories going for as long as possible. Let's milk it dry. It doesn't matter what Mueller would say at this point. It doesn't matter in the least what he says. Now, maybe Mueller would love to take another parting shot at Trump and the administration and get another dig in. But he still gets invited, if he does, to the good D.C. establishment parties. It doesn't matter one iota legally. The decision by Barr is made. It's done. It's finished -- all noise. That's why the president rightly said, why let Mueller testify? He works for Barr. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, the endless smearing of an innocent man, the duly elected president of the United States, this now gets serious. This has to stop.  Now, if you don't like President Trump and you are suffering from this psychotic rage against him, my advice to you is go try and beat him at the ballot box and, by the way, good luck with that. Crazy Uncle Joe, good luck. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But if Mueller does testify, he should definitely be forced to answer significant questions about his two year, $30 million political persecution. Why did he think it was OK to hire a team of biased Democratic donors with major complex of interests, question one, to investigate the Trump campaign? Why did he even hire Hillary Clinton's former lawyer? That's pretty ballsy. And also, why did he hire Andrew Weissmann, his pit bull, who literally at Hillary Clinton's victory party, he was trying to celebrate but it didn't happen? Why did he hire zero Republicans? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why did Mueller -- when did Mueller know that the Russian collusion was a real hoax? There's no evidence it didn't happen. Did he conceal that fact from the president to set up a perjury trap? And why didn't he tell us?  Why didn't he tell the country? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, that would be -- a perjury trap on obstruction. By the way, if Mueller's mandate was broad enough to investigate taxi cabs, loan applications, FARA violations, tax violations, why would it not have been broad enough investigate Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian collusion, again, created by a foreign intelligence officer spy, we know now full of Russian lines and even the \"New York Times\" admitting that Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier could have actually been official Russian disinformation campaign chaos creation from the very start? Well, what about spying? Did Mueller even bother to investigate the fact that members of the Trump campaign were spied on? How many instances were they spied on? How many spies were involved? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Thanks to our a year plus, two years of reporting and a new story from \"The New York Times\", thanks for catching up, guys. You are slow on the up take but I know you were pushing lies for two years. We know that the Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, he was spied on by an informant named Stefan Halper, and a blonde bombshell we now learned undercover agent sent by our own government who was flirting with him and using her charms and suggestions of information, well, we're going to have a great relationship.  That actually happened, right out of a bond movie.

And let's not forget John Huber's investigation to all of the leaks. Speaking of which, more unearthed texts, it never ends, the endless stream of new information from the former FBI lovebirds Page and Strzok suggesting that America's top intel agencies were rampantly leaking sensitive information about the Russian investigation just after President Trump was elected. In December 2016, Strzok writing Page, quote, Think our sisters, other intel agencies, have begun leaking like mad, scorned and worried and political, they're kicking into overdrive. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In an email in April, Strzok also wrote, quote: I'm beginning to think the agency got info a lot earlier than we thought and hasn't shared it completely with us. That might explain all these weird, seemingly incorrect leads all these media folks have. Would also highlight agency as the source of some of the leaks. Now, there are concerns that these leaks were coming from either the National Security Agency or the CIA, all under Obama and Biden's watch.  Those agencies were led by Clapper and Brennan, two of the biggest Trump haters in America.

Maybe it has to do with the tax cuts, the deregulations, the better business conditions, the limited government, low taxes philosophy that worked for John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and it is now working for Donald Trump. Thankfully, Americans are tuning out these conspiracy threorists on NBC News. Look at this Gallup poll. Now, the president now has from Gallup the highest approval numbers of his presidency. Gee, how did that happen?  A few points up from President Obama during his 3rd year in office.

It was 80 electoral votes or just shy of 80 electoral votes in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, all throughout the country that the Donald Trump turned from blue to red. So it's not like this came down to a single state or one congressional district Maine - Second District or something. This was a big win. But #4 and this is important. This is what Hillary Clinton said when she questioned what Donald Trump was saying. She said, \"We've been around me in the United States for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes we may not have liked them. He is talking down our democracy and I for one am appalled\".

Or will they just resort to the same Russian lies and hysteria and conspiracy theories that crippled down their credibility forever. Donald Trump has forever branded them fake news. It's tattooed all over their slogans.

It is officially a psychotic state of denial. This is the absolute truth and reality that the Democrats in Washington and the media mob cannot possibly come to grips with the reality, the truth that will set them free. They are in now a psychotic rage and it keeps spinning over and over in their little liberal brains. Every single thing -- I will say it tonight once and for all -- you will hear from this day forward about Mueller, Russia and collusion and obstruction and Trump is nothing but forever meaningless and just a lot of noise by bitter people. Four separate investigations concluded no Trump campaign, no Trump Russian collusion -- none, zero, nothing. Nothing they say is going to change that. The FBI's nine-month counter intel investigation, nothing. The House Intel investigation, nothing. The bipartisan Senate investigation, nothing. And special Robert Mueller's witch hunt found nothing. And they were trying. Mueller is done. It's over. This is like worse for them an selection night 2016 especially when the exit polls showed at 5:15 that Donald Trump didn't win. It's like it's shown in 2004, John Kerry was the next president. Wrong again. Look at the liberal tears, panic, mayhem and downright unhinged nature of everybody. Tonight, continue the hysteria.

      "utterance": "under federal law, yes, the law, the Attorney General Barr was not required at all, zero, to release any portion of the Mueller report. He didn't have to release one word. But in an effort to be transparent, he did it anyway. He didn't have to.  The A.G. released the report after redacting that was legally required, including the grand jury investigation, investigatory sources and methods. Prior to full release, we know Barr submitted March 24th, a public letter outlining the report's key findings, no collusion, no determination on obstruction. But the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, the Office of Legal Counsel, all concurred pretty much within an hour that there was no obstruction. While offered Mueller the chance to review his letter before he sent it.  Mueller declined, speak now or forever hold your piece. Mueller later admitted, Barr's summary was in no way inaccurate or misleading, despite writing a whiny letter about he's misinterpreted by the media mob. Me and Mueller have something in common. We see the media mob for who they are. And Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee but refused to be interrogated in the House, not by the congressmen and women that are unaccountable and elected to office but by Nadler's lawyers and staff.  This has never happened in the 206 years of history of that committee, and Barr was not going to let it happen now. He is still willing to testify before actual committee members. I think they are afraid of him. Now, during this entire process, Barr told the truth. He committed no crimes. He went above and beyond what the law requires in terms of transparency. Now, laughably, because of what I just outlined for all of you, and described the list of prominent Democrats, they are still calling for Barr to resign or be impeached including crazy Uncle Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, the cowardly Schiff and, of course, there's always Maxine Waters.  No one else is calling for impeachment, she is. Citing little evidence, Speaker Pelosi even claims Barr committed the crime of lying to Congress. No, he didn't. And Nadler is moving to hold Barr in contempt to Congress. And his colleague, yes, Chicken Little himself, Congress Steve Cohen, he actually - - he's calling for Barr to be locked up. This is -- they lost it. They are unhinged. Look."

They want to impeach President Trump, he said it, why? They can't beat Trump in 2020 and they know it. It's the only way to get rid of him. Now, congressional Democrats are calling for Mueller to testify, of course, another desperate attempt to keep the collusion hoax, conspiracy theories going for as long as possible. Let's milk it dry. It doesn't matter what Mueller would say at this point. It doesn't matter in the least what he says. Now, maybe Mueller would love to take another parting shot at Trump and the administration and get another dig in. But he still gets invited, if he does, to the good D.C. establishment parties. It doesn't matter one iota legally. The decision by Barr is made. It's done. It's finished -- all noise. That's why the president rightly said, why let Mueller testify? He works for Barr. And, by the way, the endless smearing of an innocent man, the duly elected president of the United States, this now gets serious. This has to stop.  Now, if you don't like President Trump and you are suffering from this psychotic rage against him, my advice to you is go try and beat him at the ballot box and, by the way, good luck with that. Crazy Uncle Joe, good luck. But if Mueller does testify, he should definitely be forced to answer significant questions about his two year, $30 million political persecution. Why did he think it was OK to hire a team of biased Democratic donors with major complex of interests, question one, to investigate the Trump campaign? Why did he even hire Hillary Clinton's former lawyer? That's pretty ballsy. And also, why did he hire Andrew Weissmann, his pit bull, who literally at Hillary Clinton's victory party, he was trying to celebrate but it didn't happen? Why did he hire zero Republicans? Why did Mueller -- when did Mueller know that the Russian collusion was a real hoax? There's no evidence it didn't happen. Did he conceal that fact from the president to set up a perjury trap? And why didn't he tell us?  Why didn't he tell the country? By the way, that would be -- a perjury trap on obstruction. By the way, if Mueller's mandate was broad enough to investigate taxi cabs, loan applications, FARA violations, tax violations, why would it not have been broad enough investigate Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian collusion, again, created by a foreign intelligence officer spy, we know now full of Russian lines and even the \"New York Times\" admitting that Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier could have actually been official Russian disinformation campaign chaos creation from the very start? Well, what about spying? Did Mueller even bother to investigate the fact that members of the Trump campaign were spied on? How many instances were they spied on? How many spies were involved? Thanks to our a year plus, two years of reporting and a new story from \"The New York Times\", thanks for catching up, guys. You are slow on the up take but I know you were pushing lies for two years. We know that the Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, he was spied on by an informant named Stefan Halper, and a blonde bombshell we now learned undercover agent sent by our own government who was flirting with him and using her charms and suggestions of information, well, we're going to have a great relationship.  That actually happened, right out of a bond movie. And on Friday, \"The New York Times\" reporter who broke the story had this pretty stunning admission. Let's take a look."

How many spies ultimately were utilized to spy on the Trump campaign? Who ordered the spying on the Trump? And what did Obama and Biden know and when they did know it? Did top intel officials try and abuse their power, bypass American laws?  Did they outsource illegal spying on we the people, U.S. citizens? Did they outsource that which they knew was illegal to friendly countries to do the jobs they would not be able to do? Well, the attorney general is now definitely investigating this spying and probably sooner than later, we're going to have the answers we deserve, even sooner, we'll have the results of the Inspector General Horowitz's investigation into FISA abuse. And let's not forget John Huber's investigation to all of the leaks. Speaking of which, more unearthed texts, it never ends, the endless stream of new information from the former FBI lovebirds Page and Strzok suggesting that America's top intel agencies were rampantly leaking sensitive information about the Russian investigation just after President Trump was elected. In December 2016, Strzok writing Page, quote, Think our sisters, other intel agencies, have begun leaking like mad, scorned and worried and political, they're kicking into overdrive."

That might explain all these weird, seemingly incorrect leads all these media folks have. Would also highlight agency as the source of some of the leaks. Now, there are concerns that these leaks were coming from either the National Security Agency or the CIA, all under Obama and Biden's watch.  Those agencies were led by Clapper and Brennan, two of the biggest Trump haters in America. What did they leak? What did they know? When did they leak it? When did they know it? Republican lawmakers, they are rightfully calling for a new investigation into all of these leaks surrounding the Russia probe. That's only a small portion of what we will be getting night after night in this program. We told we're not stopping. We're going to continue to demand, truth, and justice, because the rule, the application, equal application of laws and, frankly, with no hyperbole, our constitutional republic is at stake here. Now, we do have some really good news to report. The media is trying really hard to ignore the economy in this country is booming like we have not seen in over 50 to 60 years. One-point-three-million more jobs opening in American than we actually have jobless individuals. Think of that. Financial optimism is at 18-year high. Unemployment at a 49-year low. In Pennsylvania, Uncle Joe's home state, guess what, they are so desperate for workers that they are actually having job seminars in prison. When are you getting out? We need to hire you, no kidding. We're seeing record low unemployment for those with a high school degree, even those who dropped out of high school. Record numbers of unemployment for women, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, youth unemployment. On Friday, in order to explain the Trump's great economic boom and recovery that we never got in eight years of Obama-Biden, well, you have MSNBC junior conspiracy theorist Chris Hayes, he actually took Twitter to issue brand new multipart conspiracy theories, this time about how businesses and Republicans conspired, they were so out to get Obama, that they all conspired intentionally to make the economy bad under Obama's presidency.  And now, they're working hard to make the economy good. Maybe it has to do with the tax cuts, the deregulations, the better business conditions, the limited government, low taxes philosophy that worked for John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and it is now working for Donald Trump. Thankfully, Americans are tuning out these conspiracy threorists on NBC News. Look at this Gallup poll. Now, the president now has from Gallup the highest approval numbers of his presidency. Gee, how did that happen?  A few points up from President Obama during his 3rd year in office. We have a lot to get to tonight. Joining us with a lot of reaction, FOX News contributor, Sara Carter, investigator, and the author of the bestseller \"The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and to Frame Donald Trump\", Gregg Jarrett.

So, he decided \"I'll let Barr say it. He'll be the villain. And they'll use my report as a pretext for impeachment. And, you know, it's gotten pretty vicious towards Bill Barr. I mean, they are accusing him of lying, if you actually read his testimony under questioning by Charlie Crist. He didn't lie at all.

Those are going to reveal an enormous amount of information. I can tell you this because I've spoken to sources who are familiar with them. They need to get ahold of the all of these texts, emails, and find out how expansive this investigation was because I'm going to tell you this right now, it didn't just revolve around Trump and those in his campaign. I believe when they take a good hard look at this, they're going to find out that the abuse of power extended years before and that they were utilizing and weaponizing the intelligence community to investigate people that they considered enemies.

And John Kerry said and quote, I can't believe I'm losing to this moron, close quote. They think even less of Donald Trump than they think of George W. Bush. They think of him as a racist, a fascist, a dictator, a moron, you name it. She still doesn't understand why she lost. Donald Trump and the Russians had nothing to do with her failure to step foot in the state of Wisconsin. Donald Trump had nothing to do with her arrogance and assuming the so-called blue wall will be there for her.  Donald Trump and the Russians have nothing to do with her putting an unsecured server in her basement and then lying about it and destroying 30,000 emails under subpoena.

I don't believe this. I told him about 2004. Dick Cheney called my radio show that day, at 5:35 on election day 2004 to talk to Florida and Ohio.

In fact, the - but the other point is, that a lot of the folks who cover these races haven't taken the time to really understand how the game is played. #1, electorally, but #2, how data has really changed how elections are won and lost? And they look at these public polls that frankly don't - are not that accurate, because they are the cheapest ones available to the media and they kind of look at it from that perspective, as opposed to looking at the turnout models, who's up and who's down. But let me just say four things about Hillary Clinton. #1, I hope she keeps giving advice to candidates. #2, she didn't run a great campaign. #3, it's not like this was close. It was 80 electoral votes or just shy of 80 electoral votes in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, all throughout the country that the Donald Trump turned from blue to red. So it's not like this came down to a single state or one congressional district Maine - Second District or something. This was a big win. But #4 and this is important. This is what Hillary Clinton said when she questioned what Donald Trump was saying. She said, \"We've been around me in the United States for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes we may not have liked them. He is talking down our democracy and I for one am appalled\". Then she sent out a tweet where he basically said, \"Donald Trump refuses to set this, by doing that he is threatening our democracy\". So at the time the media was in an outrage that Donald Trump was threatening, isn't going to accept the outcome of the election and this was undermining the integrity of our institutions. And yet no one has a problem right now with Hillary over and over again undermining the outcome, which is not in question. All of those states Trump won, because he ran a better campaign."

Remember Joe Biden, we have him on tape, bragging about getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired or else he's withholding a billion taxpayer dollars. That guy was investigating his son and it's even catching the attention of Left-wing outlet Vanity Fair. But will anyone else in the media mob ever cover it? Or will they just resort to the same Russian lies and hysteria and conspiracy theories that crippled down their credibility forever. Donald Trump has forever branded them fake news. It's tattooed all over their slogans.

And it sort of devalues it to today toss it around as easily as the Democrats do. Georgia, we've heard a lot about this from Stacey Abrams, who has been touted for the U.S. Senate, now is going to hold off and run for Governor, she may run for President. But this is one that Democrats point to all the time. In Georgia, the increase in black turnout in the last election - it was up by 16% in Georgia, nationwide it was up by 11. In fact, the non-white percentage of turnout in Georgia was higher in 2018 than it was in 2016, let alone 2014.
