The heated debate over gun control took a major heat this week with retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens arguing for a repeal of the Second Amendment, calling it a relic of the 18th century. In a New York Times op-ed, Tuesday, Steven's pointed to his dissent in the landmark Heller decision, the 2008 case that affirmed an individual's right to bear arms, writing, 'Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA's ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.' if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, columnist Kim Strassel and 'Wall Street Journal' columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow Jason Riley.

We want to repeal the Second Amendment and that's why what he said matters. The problem that the gun control left comes up against after we have one of these tragedies and they want to turn it into another debate on gun control is that even while gun ownership has grown in the country, violent crime including violent crime involving guns has been falling dramatically, for decades and that is the reality out there.",

Because things are not going to pass through Congress any time soon. This is a very pro-Second Amendment House and Senate and so the only option that gun controllers have is to go back to the Supreme Court and their goal and their hope there is to either overturn Heller which could take some time, but to chip away with other lawsuits and decisions that would, for instance, give officials more ability to ban certain types of guns. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Elizabeth Warren says she is in favor of what she calls sensible gun control. Now, why the reluctance? The reluctance in large part is because the Democrats understand that they have at least a claim on some states --Senate seats now like North Dakota, Indiana, West Virginia which if they came out as fully against the Second Amendment as Justice Stevens has, they would probably lose those seats forever.

That was not the case in 2016, President Trump ran behind most congressional candidates and as a result, the Republicans actually lost a handful of seats on net in the house, so there was no surge, that will minimize the decline because there are a lot fewer people, vulnerable Republican who is are first-time members in marginal seats.",

Strategically, I think he's very clear about who our enemies and adversaries are and who our friends are and believes very much in pushing back on our adversaries and supporting our friends. But he does so, I think in a generally very pragmatic way. One of the outstanding examples is what he told often in the first term of President George W. Bush, excuse me, in early part of the century that was called the Proliferation Security Initiative. It was a way of getting an international legal basis for intercepting ships that were carrying contraband from North Korea and other places without going through the impossible process of a whole revision of the nonproliferation treaty. It was very successful. I think it led to intercepting missiles that were heading to Libya. He also, I am told, I wasn't really involved in this, but someone who was a legal adviser in the State Department many years ago, said that John pulled off something people said was impossible, which was getting the UN General Assembly to reverse the Zionism, his racism resolutions back in 1991 when he was working for President George H.W. Bush. So, he is man who knows how to get things done. I think people should keep that in mind.",

We want to repeal the Second Amendment and that's why what he said matters. The problem that the gun control left comes up against after we have one of these tragedies and they want to turn it into another debate on gun control is that even while gun ownership has grown in the country, violent crime including violent crime involving guns has been falling dramatically, for decades and that is the reality out there."

The majority in the Supreme Court took a different view, but they didn't outlaw regulation of guns and you don't -- and the constitutional amendment, I think we all agree passing that to repeal the Second Amendment would be very hard, but you could."

Because things are not going to pass through Congress any time soon. This is a very pro-Second Amendment House and Senate and so the only option that gun controllers have is to go back to the Supreme Court and their goal and their hope there is to either overturn Heller which could take some time, but to chip away with other lawsuits and decisions that would, for instance, give officials more ability to ban certain types of guns."

Bernie Sanders who is the Uber progressive, his position on gun control is that is an issue for the states to decide nor does he think manufacturers of gun should be held liable for crimes committed with guns. Elizabeth Warren says she is in favor of what she calls sensible gun control. Now, why the reluctance? The reluctance in large part is because the Democrats understand that they have at least a claim on some states --Senate seats now like North Dakota, Indiana, West Virginia which if they came out as fully against the Second Amendment as Justice Stevens has, they would probably lose those seats forever. So, I don't think you're going to get much traction at that level.

The other X factor here, Paul is that we have never had children, high-school aged children leading an effort like we've seen in recent weeks. So, we don't know if that has staying power or not.

Four Republicans gearing up to defend their congressional majority in the 2018 midterms, some good news and some bad in the latest Fox News poll. The GOP appears to be closing the gap in the generic congressional ballot with 46 percent favoring the Democratic candidate in their district compared to 41 percent for the Republican. That has narrowed significantly from the fall when 50 percent said they favored Democrats and only 35 percent said Republicans, but the poll also finds a large advantage for Democrats when it comes to voter enthusiasm with 46 percent of Democrats saying they are more fired up than usual about voting in November compared to just 28 percent of Republicans.

That is to say a law that encourages states to adopt laws that allow people to flag somebody who might be a problem. I was taken -- you put a piece on the Wall Street Journal editorial page from -- I think it was the former superintendent of the Boston Police Department who talked about how if the Parkland shooter had been in Boston, they would have been flagged to the -- by school authorities and the local law enforcement long before it got to a point that they could walk into a school with a weapon and start shooting. And that these red flag laws might be a good way for suburban Republicans to say, 'Look, we just can't depend upon Washington solving the problem. We've got to solve this problem by passing a law here in our state to allow us and detect and help solve this problem before it results in a shooting.'"

There was a memo this week from one of the Democratic campaign committees that was leaked that was advice to candidates saying, 'You ought to say, we want to look for opportunities to work with the President on problems that face our country,' that's the right tone for the Democrats to take. But my sense is, I have been in a lot of these races for the House, where the primaries are yet to be held that we are likely to see candidates who are not going to take that advice, their advice is going to be, 'By God, I'm going to oppose the President each and every way that I can.'"

He would look for opportunities to work with the President and said, 'I'm never going to support Nancy Pelosi.' Now, you said the generic ballot is all over the place. Not really. If you take a look at it, the real clear politics average is 7.1, but here are all the polls since the 21st of March, 6 points, 5 points, 5 points, 7 points, 7 points -- and if you look at it over time, January 1st, the Democratic advantage was 12.9, February 1st, 7.3, it grew to 9.3 by March first, and today at 7.1.

Political scientists refer to this as surge and decline, and what happens is typically when a President comes into office, he brings with him a large number of people of his party who win in marginal seats and then in the first midterm get swept out. That was not the case in 2016, President Trump ran behind most congressional candidates and as a result, the Republicans actually lost a handful of seats on net in the house, so there was no surge, that will minimize the decline because there are a lot fewer people, vulnerable Republican who is are first-time members in marginal seats."

Press secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders said last week that 43 percent of Trump's appointees are still awaiting confirmation and the Senate is currently sitting on 78 nominees who have already been vetted and passed out of committee, but can't get a floor vote.

I think it's because Senator McConnell would like to have -- to be able to use this sort of process if he is in the minority to block the Democrats from running the government as well. Remember, when Obama was President, they did a lot of imposition of things, of statutes, regulations you know, affecting energy, finance, labor laws, the Trump government comes in, rolls all of that back, puts people in the bureaucracy.

One thing we do have to point out is that Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos is also the owner of The Washington Post, which is one of the President's primary critics in Washington and it raises the question in people's mind whether he's going after them as he often strikes back at his political enemies because of this. Similarly, AT&T's attempt to take over Time Warner is now being sued for antitrust by the Justice Division, and AT&T thinks it's because of CNN, another Trump enemy.

You have a bureaucracy that you do not want to unleash on individuals or corporations, just to do the bidding of a presidency.

Recall though, Paul, not too long ago in cities like New York City we're blocking so-called big box stores like Costco, Walmart and the rest of them because they were going to take over jobs. Now, the threat is that Amazon is taking retail away from them. Bear in mind, though, Amazon basically is a platform for tens of thousands of private vendors selling tens of thousands of differentiated products. It's simply a different delivery system.

      "utterance": "So, let me ask you first about John Bolton, the new National Security Adviser, you have known John Bolton, worked with him for years, how would you describe his world view?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLFOWITZ",
      "utterance": "You know, I think in all these descriptions of John's world view, there's a confusion between strategy and tactics. Strategically, I think he's very clear about who our enemies and adversaries are and who our friends are and believes very much in pushing back on our adversaries and supporting our friends. But he does so, I think in a generally very pragmatic way. One of the outstanding examples is what he told often in the first term of President George W. Bush, excuse me, in early part of the century that was called the Proliferation Security Initiative. It was a way of getting an international legal basis for intercepting ships that were carrying contraband from North Korea and other places without going through the impossible process of a whole revision of the nonproliferation treaty. It was very successful. I think it led to intercepting missiles that were heading to Libya. He also, I am told, I wasn't really involved in this, but someone who was a legal adviser in the State Department many years ago, said that John pulled off something people said was impossible, which was getting the UN General Assembly to reverse the Zionism, his racism resolutions back in 1991 when he was working for President George H.W. Bush. So, he is man who knows how to get things done. I think people should keep that in mind."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right, that's going to be fascinating to watch. Let's talk about North Korea because you know, the meeting with week with Xi Jinping and ', what do you make of that? Is that an enhancement for peace or is that display to the benefit of Kim?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLFOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Well, it certainly plays to the benefit of Kim. It puts him on the world stage. It makes him a much bigger figure than -- no North Korean leader has ever met with a US President, just take that on the surface, but we also have to remember, we know very little about anything that's going on behind the scenes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLFOWITZ",
      "utterance": "So, I imagine quite a bit is going on and this could be just a repeat of a play we have seen over and over again of play for time, promise things later, collect payment now, relax the sanctions -- that would obviously be good both for ' and for Xi Jinping in China. But there could be something bigger going on and I think we ought to keep our eye on that because I'm not sure it's a good thing. He talks about the idea that he would not need nuclear weapons if North Korea's security was assured, but his demands for North Korean assurance -- security assurance go a very long way. They basically involve the US leaving South Korea militarily, some kind of deal between North and South Korea that might in fact end up being unification on Kim's terms. And unfortunately, on this score, that would clearly suit Xi Jinping in China. Unfortunately, it would suit possibly the current the South Korean government, which is very sketchy to be charitable in its view of North Korea and it just might suit President Trump's agenda of getting US troops out of the peninsula where they are still there 60 years after the armistice and it's only because of the threat from North Korea."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Yes, okay, that could be -- I mean, I think some people look at that outcome and say, 'Well, that could be the worst-case scenario,' from a US strategic interest because we would be tempted to -- depending on the promises once again from ' that they were in fact, going to get rid of their nuclear program when they have violated how many promises over the last 25 years, so you'd have to say if we fell for that, if Donald Trump fell for that that would be a strategic defeat."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "But we don't know of course know where this is headed, but one thing that seems obvious is the meeting with Xi Jinping and then, this planned meeting with the South Korean President that ' has planned. This is not the diplomatic isolation that they were under for more than -- for a long time, particularly in the Trump administration where they are trying to apply so much pressure. This really does as you say put Kim on the world stage and makes him appear as if he is an equal with all of these leaders, not just a rogue government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLFOWITZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLFOWITZ",
      "utterance": "We don't and we do know that in the past, China has played a very -- I would say less than honest role in saying they are going to do things and them not doing them and actually assisting this nuclear program which they claim not to want to see happen."

      "speaker": "WOLFOWITZ",

      "speaker": "WOLFOWITZ",
      "utterance": "I think I would say be very careful. Don't get caught up in your own rhetoric about you've produced a meeting that probably no other President would have produced under conditions that are generally a response to American pressure. That's a good thing, but don't feel you then have to prove that you were successful by agreeing to something that you shouldn't agree to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right, thank you, Paul Wolfowitz. Appreciate you coming in. When we come back, protests over controversial speakers becoming a common occurrence on college campuses. Now, a new survey offers a revealing look at what students really think about free speech."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Amid protests and speakers controversies at colleges across the country, a new survey offers a revealing look at what students really think about free speech on campus. A recently released Gallup-Knight Foundation poll finds that 61 percent of college students agree that the climate on their campus prevent some students from expressing their views, up 7 points from just a year ago. The survey also finds that while 92 percent say political liberals can freely express their views on campus, just 69 percent believe that political conservatives can and although 90 percent of students say it is never acceptable to use violence to prevent someone from speaking, more than one-third believes shouting down speakers is acceptable at least some of the time. We are back with Dan Henninger, Jason Riley and Jillian Melchior. So, Jillian, you are the closest to college age in this group, what do you take away from this poll?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "It's disturbing. I think one thing that we are seeing is college students saying that they support the idea of diversity and inclusion, view that as more important than free speech rights, and I think that really reveals a fundamental logical breakdown of the quality of education that these students are getting because they have perceived that inclusion is a goal that is backed by rights like the First Amendment. So, I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding there. You also see widespread support for things like school policies that would punish people who engage in hate speech or reference of rhetoric or even wear costumes or clothing that people consider offensive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "So, if you, for example, if I being a white man decided to wear a sombrero on Cinco de Mayo and somebody was offended by that, they would support me being punished or a ban on that kind of clothing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Absolutely and I think one thing that is important to note is how far that can go. At the University of California or University of Clermont, there was, last year, a student suggesting that hoop earrings are offensive, that that's cultural appropriation. So, I think what we are talking about here is not just small events but widespread things that are fundamentally getting at people's freedom of expression."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Jason, you do a fair bit of speaking on college campuses, how do you find the climate? Does it jive with this survey?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "It does. I mean, it varies from campus to campus. But I do, I do see this and particularly at campuses known for being more liberal, you find this and, you know, the good news is that a majority of students on campus still support free expression. The problem is the trend line. That number has been shrinking, Paul, and what's also interesting is the more time a student spends on campus, the less willing they think it is -- the less willing they feel it's okay to speak out on controversial issues. In other words, a higher number of freshmen feel comfortable expressing controversial views than do seniors, so that gets worse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "The more you're in campus, it's disturbing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Disturbing trend line and it's really unfortunate. College should be a place where you sharpen your critical thinking skills, where you engage people you disagree with and learn how to debate them, not silence them, but that clearly is not what is going on in campus today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Dan, you and I are old enough to remember when it was absolutely the opposite from the 60's and the 70's when people said free speech -- you know, there was the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley that basically said, 'Let students be able to express themselves as they want and protest this or that.' Now, students are so, I guess, I don't know, afraid or offended so easily that they say, 'Please, don't get in my face with anything that I disagree with.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think one big difference, Paul, maybe that the tact then -- the students, the proponents of the Free Speech Movement had gone through -- had an education where they were still taught the meaning of free speech and even the First Amendment, which obviously has been deemphasized now in favor of almost daily, I would call it propaganda I see, about the idea that speech has to be -- it can't be hateful. It has to be diverse and that free speech and the First Amendment should give way to that. That is what students hear all of the time. One reason we've gotten so far with this sort of things that Jillian was describing, I think, is that a lot of school college administrators are sympathetic to that idea and as far as the Presidents go, that has got to be the biggest flock of sheep in the history of humanity. They just get ruled."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "How much of this trend line, Jillian, do you think is related to Trump and the Trump phenomenon because I have noticed that it's the Democrats on campus who seem to now take a more alarmist view about free speech than two or three years ago?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, he's in a way put into very sharp perspective of the problems that already existed. If you look at it, the Massou protests for example, which triggered about 50 protests nationwide -- that was before President Trump became President but I think that you've got what the current political polarization and the anger, campuses have become the hot beds for this and you are really seeing people's intolerance toward dissenting opinions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Is this a good argument, Jason, for spending, sending, having an off campus term in Cuba and China for every single American student?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "You know what's ironic is, and you mentioned this, that you have women's groups, minority groups being the most intolerant, and what's ironic about that, Paul is, all of these social movements were so reliant on free speech. Where would the Civil Rights Movement be without free speech? Or when is liberation be without free speech? So, to Dan's point, we need a better K through 12 education."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Paul, this is a hit to ABC for bringing back 'Roseanne.' The network was taking all kinds of grief from media critics and Hollywood liberals for reviving a show who star Roseanne Barr as a Trump supporter as is her character. Guess what? 18.2 million people -- staggering number tuned in to watch the reboot, most watched comedy in years. So, you know, 'Roseanne' was popular back in the day because it took a rare look at a working class family. Networks that take a rare look at the part of the country that voted for this President might get some ratings return."

      "utterance": "Paul, liberals are upset about a citizenship question being added to the census. They say, it might as a result in an undercount of people here illegally but, Paul, the purpose of counting every ten years is to find out who can vote? Who is here legally? And for the purposes of apportioning congressional districts. So, I think we need to keep our eye on the ball here and that liberals need to get their priorities straight."

Because Ecuador has just cut off the internet connection for Julian Assange who is holed up permanently in their London embassy and they did this because Assange criticized United Kingdom for kicking out all of those Russian diplomats. Paul, if Julian Assange does not have the support of Ecuador, it looks like he is a man without a country these days."
