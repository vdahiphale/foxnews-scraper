You know, we thought that the retirement watch was officially over at least for today because they gaveled out of the bench this morning, the final opinions of the day, and no one made a hint or a peep about any kind of retirement, and this afternoon this letter surfaces. We now know that Justice Kennedy wanted to talk with President Trump and deliver this letter and talk to him about walking away from the bench effective July 31st. It is seismic because even though Justice Kennedy was appointed by a Republican president, President Reagan, he was always often left and center when it came to social issues, things like abortion and LGBT rights. So, he's been a key swing vote even though he doesn't like that term. In a lot of these 5 to 4, he's been the five who've made the decision. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, I think he's been reliably conservative on a number of things, but he's definitely broken away. He has an independent streak when it comes to some of the social issues. He authored the sweeping landmark decision, the Obergefell decision, which legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states. And I know that he wanted that to be part of his legacy. Often talked about the dignity of LGBT people, their families, the children that they were raising. But when it comes to things like health care, you know, after the arguments were heard here on the affordable care act, there was a lot of speculation about what Kennedy going to do? How he's going to vote? Well, it turns out, according to everyone I know inside the court, he never wavered. He was always the vote against the ACA, finding it unconstitutional. It turn out, in that case, it was the chief justice who was the deciding vote that went over with the liberal wing of the court to decide that. Now, looking forward, there're number of groups, they're flooding my emails and my box today, saying they really celebrate Justice Kennedy for what he did on these issues, of social issues being left of center. They're now worried about who the president will decide. We know there's a list of 25 they came up with in November of 2017. And so, I'm told, at least, by people close to the White House and the president that he's planning to stick to that list and not really add fresh new names. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, there're people we know like Senator Mike Lee, other prominent federal judges who've been added to that list as well. And we hear from Democrats today saying absolutely they're going to hold the line into everything they can do to try to block this vote until after the midterms. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A lot of the pressure that Justice Kennedy got to go ahead and step down was coming from across the street in the senate where there were senators privately telling him we don't know that we can be sure that we're going to hold on to the senate. They were concerned about what would happen to their party if that was indeed the case. But now, with this filibuster gone on Supreme Court justice votes, they need 51. They know they have that now. But they'll have to keep all the Republicans together to get someone on that bench and in the seat before the midterms. And it sounds like, as you've said, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to do that, Dana.",

You're already hearing Chuck Schumer say no, we're going to wait until after the midterms. Crying Chuck doesn't have a shot though. This is going to be voted in the fall. The difference when they're talking about what happened with Garland when Obama was a lame duck and he had the vacancy, McConnell delayed it until after the presidential election.

And this is the only one printed on over-sized parchment. It's also distinctive because there are only two signatures on it, John Hancock, Charles Thompson.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" This is a Fox News alert. It's the decision that could reshape the Supreme Court for a generation and be a defining moment for the Trump presidency. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote on the high court, announcing just hours ago that he is retiring at the end of next month. President Trump reacting to the news."

      "speaker": "SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, we thought that the retirement watch was officially over at least for today because they gaveled out of the bench this morning, the final opinions of the day, and no one made a hint or a peep about any kind of retirement, and this afternoon this letter surfaces. We now know that Justice Kennedy wanted to talk with President Trump and deliver this letter and talk to him about walking away from the bench effective July 31st. It is seismic because even though Justice Kennedy was appointed by a Republican president, President Reagan, he was always often left and center when it came to social issues, things like abortion and LGBT rights. So, he's been a key swing vote even though he doesn't like that term. In a lot of these 5 to 4, he's been the five who've made the decision. So, I think he's been reliably conservative on a number of things, but he's definitely broken away. He has an independent streak when it comes to some of the social issues. He authored the sweeping landmark decision, the Obergefell decision, which legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states. And I know that he wanted that to be part of his legacy. Often talked about the dignity of LGBT people, their families, the children that they were raising. But when it comes to things like health care, you know, after the arguments were heard here on the affordable care act, there was a lot of speculation about what Kennedy going to do? How he's going to vote? Well, it turns out, according to everyone I know inside the court, he never wavered. He was always the vote against the ACA, finding it unconstitutional. It turn out, in that case, it was the chief justice who was the deciding vote that went over with the liberal wing of the court to decide that. Now, looking forward, there're number of groups, they're flooding my emails and my box today, saying they really celebrate Justice Kennedy for what he did on these issues, of social issues being left of center. They're now worried about who the president will decide. We know there's a list of 25 they came up with in November of 2017. And so, I'm told, at least, by people close to the White House and the president that he's planning to stick to that list and not really add fresh new names. So, there're people we know like Senator Mike Lee, other prominent federal judges who've been added to that list as well. And we hear from Democrats today saying absolutely they're going to hold the line into everything they can do to try to block this vote until after the midterms. A lot of the pressure that Justice Kennedy got to go ahead and step down was coming from across the street in the senate where there were senators privately telling him we don't know that we can be sure that we're going to hold on to the senate. They were concerned about what would happen to their party if that was indeed the case. But now, with this filibuster gone on Supreme Court justice votes, they need 51. They know they have that now. But they'll have to keep all the Republicans together to get someone on that bench and in the seat before the midterms. And it sounds like, as you've said, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to do that, Dana."

Interesting two things about Justice Kennedy, Kimberly, he went to the White House today earlier, met with President Trump privately before any announcement was made, so quite gentlemanly, like a good public servant might do. But the second thing is that he wanted a Republican president with a Republican majority senate to be able to have this vote coming up. And even though he was a swing vote on a lot of these things, I think that says something about him, who was originally appointed by Ronald Reagan."

Maybe he wanted to stay a little bit longer, but he thought that this would be best for him to do and do it at this time. And if you look at it, and Shannon explained it beautifully, which is the timing of it is very, you know, crucial and essential in terms of having the votes and being able to get someone on there that will do a great job and be able to serve, you know, for years to come. And someone that, you know, is in keeping with, you know, the GOP values and traditions, conservative values and traditions, a constitutionalist. And President Trump has really received wide praise for Neil Gorsuch. I mean, has really been a fantastic justice on the court, for the country, and in terms of, so far, in terms of the rulings and the way he's decided. So now, it's the -- the pressure is on to find someone else, and there are so many good choices and candidates in the 25 -- the initial 20 and he added another five. So, it looks like he's going to pick from one of those. And he's got some excellent, you know, choices like Senator Mike Lee."

      "utterance": "Yeah. I'm kind of the swing vote at the table here. I can go left. I can go right. Really independent. I see myself as the Kennedy of The Five. All kidding aside, this definitely moves the court to the right. And, you know, it really puts the pressure on Ginsberg to stay as long as possible. The left is going to put up a big fight over this. You're already hearing Chuck Schumer say no, we're going to wait until after the midterms. Crying Chuck doesn't have a shot though. This is going to be voted in the fall. The difference when they're talking about what happened with Garland when Obama was a lame duck and he had the vacancy, McConnell delayed it until after the presidential election. That was the difference. This is just the midterms. And I think the senate is going to stay in Republican hands, so this will definitely move the court to the right. This is kind of the golden age of conservatism when you think about it. I mean, the court, and the presidency, the congress, the senate, state houses, state legislatures, all in the right's hands for now until they screwed up and hand it over to the left. But, there're so many issues at stake, marijuana, technology, immigration. I mean, this is a big pick. He better not mess this up. We've seen other presidents mess it up big time. And, but like Kimberly said, this list is strong. Going through these names, I mean, these are some of the best people out there. Women, guys with the best credentials you'll ever see. Mike Lee even was speculated to be a great choice by his colleague, Senator Ted Cruz. And I think he'd be a solid pick as well."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think -- here's the thing. I think Republicans sold their souls on Trump in order -- the legitimacy, the justification, if you will, Dana, was -- so we can have a Supreme Court appointment. The guy that deserves all the credit for that is, of course, Mitch McConnell, the senate majority leader, who denied a hearing for just about a year to Merrick Garland, a Democrat. So -- so much for stability and rules of order. I mean, he just took it, and now you understand what's at stake. The thing about Justice Kennedy was -- Justice Kennedy, even though, you know, I certainly disagree with him on things like voting rights, guess what, he was seen as an open-minded person and who could go either way. What we have now is the potential for a Trump nominee who's basically locks us into the, kind of, partisan paralysis we see in congress on the Supreme Court. And half the country will simply say the Supreme Court is in the hands of conservatives, and I don't have a fair shot if I go before the court because everything's going to be decided on a partisan basis, not on the basis of law."

Remember Harry Reid when he was in charge of the Democrats and the senate, he use the nuclear option to get more of President Obama's nominees through, and it was Mitch McConnell who said you will live to regret this.

And when that happened, people had to decide whether they were going to support the Republican nominee because anything would be better than Hillary. That's not selling your souls. That's making a pragmatic decision. And when you talk about civility, you can't help -- you can't say to a bunch of people you sold your souls. Anyway, I know that's just a turn of phrase. You probably didn't mean it. I'm enjoying the emotional reaction on the left side of this. There're foreseeing some kind of grim apocalypse as if the Supreme Court is being replaced by Duck Dynasty.

But I do think, you know, to everybody's point, Kennedy pleased and displeased often the same people. Ronald Reagan appointed this man who backed abortion and gay marriage, which tells you, you can never predict what's going to happen when you put that person on the court. When they get on the courts, sometimes things change and they start thinking about, hmm, do I really want to mess things up? Do I really want to pull things back? They change."

I don't think there's any question about the party selling its soul, because if you think about a man who defamed John McCain, a man who talks about grabbing women roughly, for the evangelicals, I don't think there's any question abortion was the issue, abortion in terms of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court ruling. And they want someone there who will overturn Roe v. Wade. And they're willing to overlook all of Trump's flaws in the sense that say, oh, well, Hillary would put a lefty up there, right? OK.

And I think, Greg, there's a bigger point here which is you need Americans to believe in this court. This court does not have an army. There's nobody to make you respect the court. So the idea is that the American people would grant them authentic and sincere leeway to make decisions based on law. If people start to believe that, oh, you know, this is just a Trump puppet court."

And to your point that you've just made, I mean, the court swings to the left and to the right over generations, and I think part of the American people that stays the same is they always respect the institution of the court. Once the Supreme Court makes a decision, the country says, you know what, Supreme Court decided and were going to agree with it, whether that's a left-wing court or a right-wing court.

You know, only 26,000 people voted in that election. So, it's 15,000 or 9,000, I think, was the final there.

And you saw the rise of the tea party, and then they have that internal warfare with the moderates and the tea party. This is still playing out today. Right now, Donald Trump is doing that to the Democrats. He's pushing the Democrats so far to the right. They didn't really have a lot of room, he's kind of pushing -- yeah, to the left, off the cliff to a certain extent, and this is why you see a socialist, an occupy Wall Street Democrat who wants to abolish ICE, who wants to impeach the president, and believes in Medicare for all which, by the way, cost $30 trillion over ten years. So, this is the result and I think this is good to have her voice in congress. I'm really glad that we're hearing her, but she's obviously a star. She's got a big bright smile, very young, attractive, tall, good- looking woman, a lot of energy, and she's going to be on every single cable news show for the next couple of months.

And, you know, it's like, yes, he follows in the footsteps of Hillary Clinton. He should have done more, and he did less, and he lost. So maybe he's going to do a book tour and cry about it for a year. We'll see. As for the, you know, momentum and progressives and, basically, socialist winning, you know, OK. This is the Democratic Party. They don't have any messaging. Now they have fringe candidates like this coming out. That is not going to win any, like, major elections or anything like that. It's too alienating. It's too far left. It's not the principles that are sustainable and work unless you would like to run for office in Venezuela. Then it would be fantastic. But, you know, nevertheless, she went out there, she put herself out there to win and to run, and she managed to pull this off I think much to everyone's surprise, including her own. So, we'll see what happens, but I think it's presenting very polarizing, you know, choices, you know, come the election. But we'll see what, you know, what she does with it.

She will be on MSNBC more than Russians. The media desperately wants to crown somebody as a superstar because they're suffering for the dream. They need the new Obama, and they're going to overlook the extreme rhetoric that is on her side. You know socialism never has worked, unless it's in a capitalist society where the effects don't count. But she will get the hero worship. They won't notice the people that support her that there're some troubling people that support her. You can look it up. The radical talked about impeachment.

And then you charge him and you say, you know, \"Seems like you're a little biased.\" He goes, \"Oh, I never let my bias impact my investigation.\" I mean, come on. It's common sense. He was so biased he couldn't participate fairly in the Mueller investigation. He got fired. That means he's so biased he shouldn't have been participating in the Hillary and the Trump-Russia FBI investigation. The context is critical. It's not like he was saying out of the blue, \"I hate Trump. These are my personal feelings.\" These text messages about hating Trump and stopping Trump and insurance policies were made in the context of him discussing investigative steps and decisions he was making as an FBI agent. Also, I just want to bring up one thing that we glossed over last week. Susan Rice's chief cybersecurity officer testified on camera that he -- she gave him a stand down order about Russia interference. When Russia was interfering in the 2016 election, Susan Rice said, \"Stand down. Don't do anything about Russian interference.\" Come on. I mean, how serious is this?"

We all like soccer and watching soccer with our families. And you can only really do that when there's peace and prosperity. Netanyahu is creating a contrast between what is and what could be. Does that sound familiar? As John Bolton and his mustache meets with Putin, there seems to be a new pattern taking shape. And while world leaders have exchanged pleasantries before, this feels different. It's as if peace is being sold and, finally, people are buying. Let's hope these opportunities aren't squandered the way they were before. So if an outstretched hand works with North Korea, which can go either way at this point, or Iran or Russia, maybe it can work with our fellow Americans, too. To quote the guy who kicked this whole thing off, \"we'll see what happens.\" All right, Dana, there's a couple of things here.

That is -- provides a new opening. And I would imagine they are figuring out, if you can talk directly to the people of Iraq, they might be able to force change in their leadership. The other thing I would say is that the freedom of information, being able to get unfiltered, raw information through people's phones, on the Internet, rather than through state television could be a really big answer in places like Iran, Venezuela, other places, maybe even North Korea, and Russia, frankly."

Assistants and interns, they get the job where they have to race when the decisions are handed out and run to the cameras in order to give them. Shannon Bream and her team gave us their all over the last couple of days."

Anna Willie (ph), she's Shannon's assistant. She's got a, like, amazing stride. Calls (ph) associates Brynn McCarthy (ph) and Vaughan Golden (ph), and their great camera crew. That's Shannon Bream. She did it herself not too long ago."

      "utterance": "Wow. All right. Good advice, right? OK, so got a book here to promote called \"The King of Content: Sumner Redstone's Battle for Viacom, CBS and Everlasting Control of His Media Empire.\" And this is by Keach Hagey, who works for \"The Wall Street Journal.\" It talks about the 95-year-old media mogul who, you know, was quite controversial, as well. But it includes a look in his life, board room and courtroom battles, angry ex-girlfriends, family drama. A hard look at how the media consumption and the media industry are changing as we know it today. And it just hit book stores yesterday. So please, take a look and pick up a copy. I think it's a pretty fascinating discussion about media today and some of the things, how it's evolved and changed over the past."

A one of its kind version of the Declaration of Independence is being put on display at Philadelphia's Museum of the American Revolution. Two hundred copies of the declaration were made immediately after the signing, but only 26th of the original copies made on the night of July 4, 1776, exist today. And this is the only one printed on over-sized parchment. It's also distinctive because there are only two signatures on it, John Hancock, Charles Thompson. Later copies had signatures of all of 56 of the Founding Fathers. This rare copy is usually kept under lock and key by the American Philosophical Society Library in Philadelphia. So if it's your thing, go take a look."
