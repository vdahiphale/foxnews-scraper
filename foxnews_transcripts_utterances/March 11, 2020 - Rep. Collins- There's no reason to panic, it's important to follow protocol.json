So easier for Biden to get to where he needs to be than it is for Sanders but I think we've seen you know, we've seen that - normally what would happen now is somebody would say, you know what, I've lost - let me maybe give it another shot, at another week but if it doesn't turn out maybe I should fold my tent. But Bernie Sanders is not the conventional politician who might be inclined to do that. He believes, he's leading a revolution to both transform the Democratic Party and then to fundamentally transform the United States of America. So it struck me today that when he talked about the debate and he said, I'm going to ask these questions of Joe Biden that he was saying to his supporters, I'm still in this fight, may not be the nominee but I'm going to fight for these ideas. If he's not going to be the candidate, he wants to be able to write the platform and he's had great success in drawing the Democrats including Joe Biden to his direction. Biden has endorsed some very unusual things that he would not as a traditional Democrat necessarily jumped out and endorsed you know, health care for illegal aliens, free healthcare, he endorsed the court framework of the Green New deal and at one point said even if that cost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs, he was willing to do it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Airplanes were constantly being rebuilt to be seen overseas. So, the pilots kept fly training once in a while. I was sent overseas as a fighter pilot with no experience, none of us had any experience at that time. When I say no experience, I had a total of something like 15 hours in the airplane. Went I went overseas over a period of three months so that's nothing. When I first got into combat, I flew my first mission with an oxygen mask at 28,000 or 29,000 never having worn and oxygen mask before, never having fired my gun in the air and with a total of someplace between 13 and 14 hours flight training. No time to be scared. That doesn't mean that down deep inside I wasn't jumpy but I had no real knowledge of fright. I was so busy saving my own hide. I think I'm safe in saying none of us had any gunnery training in the air. We had all fired our guns at ground targets but we had never flown in combat. We have never fired our guns in the air. I got shot up several times. When I say shot up, I was flying around and the Japanese shot me in my airplane. We didn't know what we're doing. None of us had ever fired at an aerial target. None of us had fired our guns at another target until we fired at Japanese planes at high altitude. We simply went up there and put their sights on something and fired. In all my flights where I was in combat, I used up every bit of my ammunition. There was none of this sitting and figuring somebody out and shoot them down. You get up there and you fired. So, on several occasions, I got rid of Japanese on my tail shooting me up, and I had no ammunition. All I could do is dodge. Some of the war is still right there. I remember being shot up and shot down. Terrible things that happen stay in your mind. I was in combat long before I should have been. If one lives long enough having been in the service, one becomes a hero. I certainly was in some very hot spots. I can remember every detail of every one of those flights.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel warns that 70 percent of her country's population, some 80 million people could contract the virus as calls here were louder for the President to step up in that piece by Michael Goodwin in the New York Post today. So as for the Dow it is in bear market territory. It plummeted another 1400 points today.

The reason up to now the World Health Organization resisted calling this a global pandemic is because it didn't want to give the impression the coronavirus was unstoppable. So now the Director General of WHO is saying as loud as possible all countries can change the course of this disease. Coronavirus has down affected more than 120,000 people in 114 countries on six continents. In this country more than 1100 cases in 40 states. In DC 31 people have now died. Today Dr. Tony Fauci director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease told lawmakers that things will get worse and then he was asked to give the public a realistic assessment. Watch."

Today the NCAA president also announced that college games including March Madness will have limited fans quoting here, \"I have made the decision to conduct our upcoming championship events, including the Division 1 Men's and Women's basketball tournaments with only essential staff and limited family attendance.\" Washington State Governor Jay Inslee has closed Seattle schools and banned large gatherings in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties and finally the Grand Princess cruise ship is in Day 3 of disembarking passengers. As of late last night more than 1400 had left the ship, that number has not been updated but it's certainly higher considering people were getting off throughout the day.

In fact, I have carried on my normal workout routine in doing work from here at home and communicating with (inaudible) in DC especially we've been dealing with FISA and other things on - in Washing. And I think what's interesting is we can come in contact - one of the reasons that we're following the protocols set forth because I was exposed to someone who has tested positive is to make sure everybody follows these recommendations. As Dr. Fauci said, if we take control of this and we do what we're supposed to, we can make sure that this virus is relatively contained. People can be exposed but not get the virus and I think I'm a living proof of that, if we do the right things, do our hand washing, if we're sick, go to doctor, those kind of things. And that's why, the message I'm trying to get out is the administration's working through as well is follow the protocols and we can make sure that we have this under control."

One of the things we need to do is make sure that - if we do anything on Capitol Hill, it's directed in the right way. My concern is like we have many times on Capitol Hill, we react only in emotion and feelings of moaning instead of the actual practicality so any economic issues that we deal with need to be directed at those who would benefit from it and not just simply a blanket pattern to cover what may be. And so that is our concern. The President wants to see our common continue to do well. I think we're going to see that happen but we'll see how it works out on the Hill."

The local hospital doesn't have any tests and the lab you know companies is Quest LabCorp, they don't have tests. They can - they can read the test if it's sent to them but they don't have the test.

And I think that's - in concern because if you're - if you have a doctor who has information who is symptomatic, who is showing signs, we have been told through CDC that those tests are available. What they're not testing for is folks who are not symptomatic like myself and that might be the disconnect that we're looking at but if everybody has a test and the Vice President has also said today that they removed the calls from these tests, not just for Medicare, Medicaid but from all private insurance as well.

I met with Vice President Pence with our caucus last week, and I thought he had a pretty good handle on how our government works. He's got relationships with governors that I think have been productive, he's been working with experts and he assured us every decision he makes we will be based on science. I'm frankly most concerned about the president. I just saw a new story today that he's made 29 false claims about the coronavirus so it seems like you can have the best intentions, the best experts, everyone doing what we're supposed to do and then the person at the top could set us back with misinformation."

That person has to be able to build and expand on the Obama coalition and Vice President Biden has done that so look, there are some real policy differences between Sen. Sanders and Vice President Biden.

He has beaten them twice. The last time, assault weapons were banned in this country, Vice President Biden banned them and when - if and when he is elected president, I'll say when because we fully intend to win, he will ban them again and so the reality is what you saw was Vice President Biden responding to frankly a distortion of his record.

Sanders would need of the remaining delegates to be elected, would need to re - need to get 55.9 percent in order to get to a majority, given where the two men are today. So easier for Biden to get to where he needs to be than it is for Sanders but I think we've seen you know, we've seen that - normally what would happen now is somebody would say, you know what, I've lost - let me maybe give it another shot, at another week but if it doesn't turn out maybe I should fold my tent. But Bernie Sanders is not the conventional politician who might be inclined to do that. He believes, he's leading a revolution to both transform the Democratic Party and then to fundamentally transform the United States of America. So it struck me today that when he talked about the debate and he said, I'm going to ask these questions of Joe Biden that he was saying to his supporters, I'm still in this fight, may not be the nominee but I'm going to fight for these ideas. If he's not going to be the candidate, he wants to be able to write the platform and he's had great success in drawing the Democrats including Joe Biden to his direction. Biden has endorsed some very unusual things that he would not as a traditional Democrat necessarily jumped out and endorsed you know, health care for illegal aliens, free healthcare, he endorsed the court framework of the Green New deal and at one point said even if that cost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs, he was willing to do it."

He's not the normal politician who cares about what James Carville with all due respect, my pal Jim and who Rep. Clyburn in fact, I think that's counterproductive.

Here now to respond to that and a few other things tonight, Christine Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi's daughter and the author of \"The Nancy Pelosi Way,\" and she's very involved and follows very closely all the Democratic politics, of course.

And basically, it looks like Republicans came home to the congressional Republicans giving them a bump, and about two-thirds of each party approves of their members and oddly Mitt Romney, or perhaps not oddly, Mitt Romney his ratings are about the same what he lost and Republicans who are mad at his impeachment vote, he gained in Democrats. So that --"

So, it looks like he -- it looks like basically this is based on impeachment, you know, Democrats did about what their party thought they would do, Republicans seemed very happy perhaps pleasantly surprised with what their party did to protect the president. And again, what Romney lost among Republicans, he gained in Democrats. So that's your snapshot, I also think that frankly everybody's numbers are going to be really more into focus now as we look at the coronavirus response and how people respond to use their power now. Hopefully for the common good and the health and wellness of the American people."

It will be interesting to see because we're so in the middle of this coronavirus moment which we certainly hope doesn't last very long -- but we are in it right now for sure and it sort of puts impeachment in the rearview mirror. But you have to wonder if you accelerate through, you know, the summer when you get into the heat of the general election and the conventions, my guess is that hopefully we are past this virus moment and the impeachment thing comes back because it does appear that, you know, voters weren't really all that happy with the fact that it was pursued. Has Speaker Pelosi, you know, sort of, has she talked about that? Does she think in the end that they shouldn't have gone down that road? That maybe it wasn't all that popular with the American people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PELOSI",
      "utterance": "Well, again, it was popular among people who felt that there was an abuse of power by the president and as we've discussed before, you don't base, you're doing the right thing and following the rule of law on a poll. The poll numbers tend to bounce around. I think that more Democrats and Republicans will come home as it were to their parties in the general election. So, you'll also have to look at what those people who either disapprove of the president on the Republican side or disapprove of Democrats on the Democratic side due in a general election matchup, where now you have as it were impeachment at the polls or not. And I think that will be the question next October or earlier for our troops who start voting in September."

So, it was a great 11 years, two days, started on March 9th at the bottom of the financial crisis. You made over 500 percent, you made over $20 trillion, not bad but now we've fallen into what they call a bear market, so we are 20 percent down from recent highs. And it's the fastest bear market in history, even faster than the Great Depression. And I know people always say that the stock market is not the economy but the stock market is a leading indicator as to where investors think the economy will be in six months' time. And this type of price action is telling us that they expect a very steep economic decline because of the coronavirus. So, it really depends on what President Trump says tonight in his address, will we get some more stimulus in the form of tax deferments? maybe cash injections."

I was an incident the navy on active duty, resigned my commission, went to flight school and came out as a marine. Flight training was not available. Airplanes were constantly being rebuilt to be seen overseas. So, the pilots kept fly training once in a while. I was sent overseas as a fighter pilot with no experience, none of us had any experience at that time. When I say no experience, I had a total of something like 15 hours in the airplane. Went I went overseas over a period of three months so that's nothing. When I first got into combat, I flew my first mission with an oxygen mask at 28,000 or 29,000 never having worn and oxygen mask before, never having fired my gun in the air and with a total of someplace between 13 and 14 hours flight training. No time to be scared. That doesn't mean that down deep inside I wasn't jumpy but I had no real knowledge of fright. I was so busy saving my own hide. I think I'm safe in saying none of us had any gunnery training in the air. We had all fired our guns at ground targets but we had never flown in combat. We have never fired our guns in the air. I got shot up several times. When I say shot up, I was flying around and the Japanese shot me in my airplane. We didn't know what we're doing. None of us had ever fired at an aerial target. None of us had fired our guns at another target until we fired at Japanese planes at high altitude. We simply went up there and put their sights on something and fired. In all my flights where I was in combat, I used up every bit of my ammunition. There was none of this sitting and figuring somebody out and shoot them down. You get up there and you fired. So, on several occasions, I got rid of Japanese on my tail shooting me up, and I had no ammunition. All I could do is dodge. Some of the war is still right there. I remember being shot up and shot down. Terrible things that happen stay in your mind. I was in combat long before I should have been. If one lives long enough having been in the service, one becomes a hero. I certainly was in some very hot spots. I can remember every detail of every one of those flights. I was happy to had the, in retrospect, happy to have had the experience. I was honored to be able to serve. I had innumerable, wonderful experiences that will stay with me."
