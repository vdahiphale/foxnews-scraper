It's been one giant hissy fit since November of 2016, and it's only gotten louder, more frequent and more violent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I've got news for you.

The Democrats were busy condemning the United States as a racist country steeped in systemic racism, focusing on the past. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Republicans were busy highlighting the greatness of America, with men and women from all walks of life praising the opportunity this country and this President offers focusing on the future. At their convention, the Democrats blamed America for all the wrongs that exist. Not one person condemned the anarchy and chaos occurring in cities burning across America. So, as I learned in the law of contracts, silence is acceptance. As such, it could be they see this as a benefit. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } None of their speakers mentioned the lives or businesses lost or destroyed by leftist looters and anarchists destroying our cities.

The Republicans were busy identifying the enormous gains to the economy and the safety and security of Americans under President Trump, recognizing America's greatness, focused on fixing the bad that has happened in the past, learning from it and making it better for everyone while still honoring America.

So what the Biden crew is doing is making this really big bet on blaming the pandemic on the President. Now, here's the problem. I'll give you some statistics on this. Rasmussen poll comes out late July, what it says is that fully half already -- half of America blames China for the virus, and this is even more interesting, 53 percent of Americans now want China to pay reparations for all of the costs they're imposing on this country, and that's up from 43 percent in March and that number is just going to keep rising and that's what Joe Biden has to face. Now, as an economist, Judge, let me tell you what the back of the envelope calculation looks if we start assessing China with the costs of the pandemic they have infected this country with and killed over 200,000 Americans with.

But if he doesn't raise the issue, then he has to contend with an American people who are mad as hell at the Chinese Communist Party. I'm telling you, if that's 53 percent now of Americans who want reparations from the Chinese. By the time Labor Day rolls around, it's going to be up to 60 percent, and by the time Election Day rolls around, it's going to be about 95 percent. The only people who are not going to be for that would be Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. So the other issue, Judge in terms of Joe Biden kind of ignoring China's pummeling of our economy on the one hand, and then trying to blame the President for the virus is that there's really some important questions the American people have to understand both about the origins of the virus and how China is using the virus to advance its political and strategic agenda. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you look at what they're doing behind the veil of the virus, they've cut a deal with the Philippines to take over the South China Sea.

The left just can't stop their outrage over the election of President Donald Trump. It's been one giant hissy fit since November of 2016, and it's only gotten louder, more frequent and more violent. I've got news for you. All the noise hysteria and outright lies spewed will only ensure President Trump's reelection. The two conventions America watched were as different as night and day, not just in terms of production quality, message and enthusiasm, but in terms of focus. The Democrats were busy condemning the United States as a racist country steeped in systemic racism, focusing on the past. The Republicans were busy highlighting the greatness of America, with men and women from all walks of life praising the opportunity this country and this President offers focusing on the future. At their convention, the Democrats blamed America for all the wrongs that exist. Not one person condemned the anarchy and chaos occurring in cities burning across America. So, as I learned in the law of contracts, silence is acceptance. As such, it could be they see this as a benefit. None of their speakers mentioned the lives or businesses lost or destroyed by leftist looters and anarchists destroying our cities. Not one of them mentioned how to end the anarchy, creating disorder, havoc and utter chaos."

Retired Police Captain David Dorn's widow, Ann, spoke of her husband killed at the hands of looters, murderers who gunned him down and live streamed his death as he bled out."

Both Dorn and the McCloskeys, calling for peace and an end to the violence as the left continues without any indication of when this will end. Bottom line, the left blames America first; the right puts America first -- and they want law and order back in America. In fact, that's been the message of the man we chose to bring us out of the O-Biden years, the man who spoke our language and understood our pain and work to satisfy our needs. President Trump's speech itself was a litany of the successes his administration has achieved and a compelling argument why Joe Biden cannot be elected President."

I mean, think about what the man has had to face. He has had to face, you know, a radical Democratic Party, people who have tried to impeach him. People have tried to take him down. A weaponized D.O.J., a media which is 94 to 96 percent negative coverage at him everything. And by the way, Judge, he is still winning. I mean, he is still winning and the man has more backbone than any person I've ever met in my entire life. He really is a role model to so many people.

And now all of a sudden, apparently, the numbers seem to be good, now, the internal numbers I understand, for your dad, and now all of a sudden Joe Biden wants to come out and start campaigning. And your father tweeted today. Let me read that tweet to you. I think we have it here. The tweet is, \"Now that Biden's polls are dropping fast, he has agreed to get out of his basement and start campaigning in 10 days. Sadly, that's a slow reaction time for President. Our beloved U.S.A. needs a much faster, smarter and tougher response. Get out there today, Joe.\" Well, clearly, Joe Biden is not in a position it seems to even -- he didn't even go to his convention to accept the nomination.

And I'm glad you're saying that about law enforcement, because it literally -- it breaks my heart to see what's happened, and if you look at these cities, right? I mean, first it was the Seattle and the Portland and the Minneapolis and Chicago and really now in New York, which is terrible. But why is no one talking about the fact you don't see Republicans protesting and picketing their convention? Why is it that it only goes one way and they'll make the Republican -- the Democratic Party makes the Republicans out to be such, you know, terrible people that aren't sensitive, that are unhinged, that you know, cling to their guns, right?

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAVARRO",
      "utterance": "So what I say is, first of all, Joe Biden is riding a mule into a boxed canyon and here's why. I think there'll be three issues in this campaign, channeling John Kennedy in the Senate, right? I think there'll be three issues in the campaign. First, it will be jobs and the economy, but the problem Biden has is we've got the greatest jobs president and trade negotiator in history. So, he gets pummeled on that. We've got like 10 Democratic mayors, 10 tokes over the thin blue line. So the President Trump is going to win on law and order. So what the Biden crew is doing is making this really big bet on blaming the pandemic on the President. Now, here's the problem. I'll give you some statistics on this. Rasmussen poll comes out late July, what it says is that fully half already -- half of America blames China for the virus, and this is even more interesting, 53 percent of Americans now want China to pay reparations for all of the costs they're imposing on this country, and that's up from 43 percent in March and that number is just going to keep rising and that's what Joe Biden has to face. Now, as an economist, Judge, let me tell you what the back of the envelope calculation looks if we start assessing China with the costs of the pandemic they have infected this country with and killed over 200,000 Americans with. If you look at the $10 trillion of stimulus alone, that's 10."

Perversely, the government values a life at $10 million. A life is priceless, but at $10 million, and soon to be 200,000 Americans dead, that's another $2 trillion. You add up all the pain and suffering and damages, as a lawyer, we're going to lose the equivalent of our entire years of GDP $20 trillion because the Chinese Communist Party lied about the virus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "So what do we do about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAVARRO",
      "utterance": "Well, that's why this is going to be such an important issue. The President has already raised this issue with the American people. Biden is in that boxed canyon because if he tries to raise that issue, he has to acknowledge that China, the Chinese Communist Party caused the pandemic, not President Trump. But if he doesn't raise the issue, then he has to contend with an American people who are mad as hell at the Chinese Communist Party. I'm telling you, if that's 53 percent now of Americans who want reparations from the Chinese. By the time Labor Day rolls around, it's going to be up to 60 percent, and by the time Election Day rolls around, it's going to be about 95 percent. The only people who are not going to be for that would be Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. So the other issue, Judge in terms of Joe Biden kind of ignoring China's pummeling of our economy on the one hand, and then trying to blame the President for the virus is that there's really some important questions the American people have to understand both about the origins of the virus and how China is using the virus to advance its political and strategic agenda. If you look at what they're doing behind the veil of the virus, they've cut a deal with the Philippines to take over the South China Sea. They've squashed Hong Kong behind the chaos of the virus. They invaded India."

This is not what America is supposed to be like. But Congressman Gaetz, look, you work in Washington. The Washington Police or the D.C. police were not there and this is what we're seeing. We're seeing police not being deployed. And there are so many people that I knew who were at the President's acceptance speech who were harassed and menaced. I mean, I could name five people right now who called me afterwards. They were petrified. This is the mayor saying that they can't be deployed."

Well, I'm not here for the woke-topia and Joe Biden is barely awake. So he's going to let these radical elements of the Democratic Party takeover, hurt our country and if we lose America, the sad thing is, Joe Biden might not even notice."

They have abandoned law enforcement this country. They wanted to destroy law enforcement. Do not believe them. Believe President Donald J. Trump."

And you know, no one is above the law, and Hunter Biden stayed on that Board, Judge until the day -- the week his father announced he was running for President. China same thing and profited millions. Follow the money is what we said. His brothers -- Joe Biden's brothers, Frank Biden and James Biden profited in Iraq. One of them building houses in Iraq with absolutely no experience in Iraq nor the housing industry. The other one Costa Rica and Jamaica. And it goes on and on."

And the truth is, there never really has been an investigation. And interestingly, the \"Wall Street Journal\" did an editorial and they said that the Biden global enrichment project is a scandal for which the family hasn't paid a political price. Who should be investigating this?"

      "utterance": "That's correct. And Jeanine, they said, I love what they said. They said, oh, no, it was a dormant investigation when Joe Biden happened to have this prosecutor fired. You know why it was dormant, if at all, because the oligarch who was head of the Burisma Corporation had fled the country and he was in Norway. But guess who was fishing with him in Norway? Hunter Biden. It's unreal thing."

We must do our job to ensure that the man currently occupying the Oval Office is held accountable to any and everything he has done. He built his wealth off the backs of New Yorkers.

She's out there still to this day trying to take down the Trump family. And when you saw that that first clip you played, she was running for election then. She ran on a platform of going after the President and his family and she has done that nonstop. It's embarrassing as a former Attorney General that a current Attorney General would behave that way. I think she needs to be looked at. You know, at a minimum, she needs to be disqualified from any cases involving that family. She also made a comment saying they're going to know my name laughing about the family. It's really -- it's despicable what she is doing what she continues to do, she can't get away with this."

Herschel, you made quite an impression at the R.N.C. this week when you said we can't solve anything with closed fists, we need an open hand. Do you think that your fellow sports players all feel the same way about walking off the court and not playing ball?"

Herschel, I want to continue with the question that I was asking you and that is, do your fellow sports players, do any of them feel pressure to not play and are there those that would rather play and not get involved in some of the pressure to walk off the court?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALKER (via phone)",
      "utterance": "Well, from what I've found out there, many of them that would rather play than walk off the court, but right now, it is kind of tough because of the pressure of some of the superstars, you know, if they walk off the court or doing a thing outside of that, they're afraid of what they be may belabor, and that's the reason I said I think politics shouldn't be in sports. There's no doubt I think each player has a voice and I think their voice should be heard, but it's kind of tough when the pressure is put on a team, and it is a team when some people may disagree with their overall message. And are there those on the teams that feel that the content of what they say is pretty much controlled by their -- by fellow players?"

      "speaker": "HERSCHEL",

So those players have to go along with the protocol. Otherwise, what are you going to be labeled? Right now, I think that's the problem in this society right now, if you don't agree with someone, you get labeled as something, so right now, no one is speaking out and this is such a great country that no one wants to speak out for. But I'm here to encourage people to speak out. Right now is the time you've got to speak out. Right now is the time you've got to get to the voting booth. Right now is his time you've got to make a decision and you've got to make your mind up just what you want for this country."

But you made an incredible statement and you said you can't solve anything with a closed fist. You've got to have an open hand. Do you think that the left and I know you spoke at the Republican Convention -- do you think that they still have their fists closed? Do you think they actually want to talk?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "There's no doubt they have their fists closed. You know, I was leaving the convention the other night as well. I was totally, totally embarrassed. I was totally, totally upset. I could not believe what happened. I want to apologize to Senator Paul, because I got my family safe. I got them in a car and got them to the hotel and I know he was not that far behind me and I didn't even go back to help. I didn't even think about it. And my hat is off to the police. My hat is off to them because the restraint that they have because of the constant attack that they were getting, and I cannot believe people will have the restraint to do that. And I think the Mayor, the Governor, they need to be to blame. I think if anyone get injured right now, they need to be to blame because I really think that people should fight and I hate to say it. I'm not this type of person, but you cannot have people to continue to just push you and push you and push you and shout at your ear and they're doing things that are uncalled for. And I told someone -- I'm with my family and I am not going to do this."
