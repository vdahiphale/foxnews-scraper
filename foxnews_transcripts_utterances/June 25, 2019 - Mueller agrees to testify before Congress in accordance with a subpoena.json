Now for all of you watching at home, I want to go back to that single appearance by Mahler, just 4 weeks ago and what he said about what any Congressional testimony from him would even look like."

And so what I find just so disheartening is that Bob Mueller said it all, 445 pages, that's all I'm going to say and what is he been doing, he's been courted by the other side just so they can harass the President and keep on this narrative that honestly, there's no there, there. And you know, I just find it just unbelievable that hearing Congress tonight, we find out about this on the on the House floor, they don't even go through normal protocol to let the minority know they broke House rules, I'm not even sure that the subpoena is valid because you can't issue the same subpoena from two different committees of jurisdiction. Listen, it is not a good day for America but Bob Mueller better be prepared because I can tell you, he will be cross-examined for the first time and the American people will start to see the flaws in his report. All right, in just a moment, Congressman Meadows is going to give us a couple of those questions that he thinks the Special Counsel - former Special Counsel would have to answer as posed by Republicans but Professor, I want to go to you, are we to believe that Mueller with all of his legendary experience, all the positions he's had, a U.S. veteran went out before the world and lied that he was - that he's going to limit any comments to what he said in the report in his 9 minutes of what he said in that press statement?"

Prosecutors are bound by Justice Department rules and tradition never to say a word beyond, we have decided not to charge X, not to charge Y. That's why Comey was so justly criticized he said, we decided not to charge Hillary Clinton but what she did was extremely careless. That deserved criticism and the Democrats are now asking Mueller to do the same thing, to commit the same sin that Comey committed. If Comey's smart, he will submit to the subpoena and he will say Justice Department rules and the presumption of innocence and the way prosecutors operate for centuries precludes me from saying anything beyond that we have made a decision not to charge the following people. We've made a decision to charge, we made decisions previously to charge the following people and I will answer no further questions and if you insist, you can take me to court and the courts will of course, back Mueller, what they would do is criticize Mueller if he went beyond that statement."

Now if anyone had a doubt over the last couple of years as to where Robert Mueller stands or which team he's playing on, I think it's been answered by now. He's clearly sympathetic to the Democrats who have done this witch hunt against the President. I'm actually looking forward to some of the questions that Congressman Meadows and his colleagues are going to ask like when did you know there was no Russia collusion? Weren't some members of your handpicked Democrat team briefed on this year in advance of the investigation beginning and why did you drag all these people through the mud and you know, violate the right to counsel of witnesses, pressure people - prosecute people, an old man for something that you don't prosecute Democrats for? I think there are a lot of questions to be asked here and Robert Mueller, we all know, he could have said you know what, there are pending prosecutions. I'm respectfully going to decline to answer any questions of yours so don't even call me. He could have done that if he were honest."

What did he know about the verification of the Steele dossier, if anything? Did his prosecutors bother to find out who actually fed the initial information and was a lack of veracity or truthfulness there? Was that in any way relevant to the underlying filing with the FISA court that was added in anyway interesting to the Mueller team."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, all of those questions were already answered within days of Bob Mueller opening up the investigation. The FBI knew that the Steele dossier was not credible, they knew that Christopher steel was not credible. They knew that they had problems with the chain of evidence as it came in. They also knew that the very first FISA application was flawed and that they did not give the amount of information that would suggest that there was innocence there, not guilt and so when you look at that, it's- but it's even further than that, it's about the connections to Russia. They carefully crafted their words and I can tell you, they made a connection to Russia that was not there. Adam Schiff knows it. Chairman Nadler knows it and soon the American people will know it because this carefully orchestrated report that I believe that Mr. Weissmann actually had a hand in is going to start to fall apart under cross examination. It shouldn't happen to begin with."

So they can ask him all they want about that, they can ask him about the FISA report so the only questions they can really ask him are questions by Republicans that are critical of the investigation, rather than questions by Democrats that go to the issue of whether there was evidence that might have justified some finding of guilt against Donald Trump.

But no, nobody can defy a subpoena but you can respond to the subpoena and then refuse to answer questions based on the traditions of the Justice Department, based on Grand Jury material, based on ongoing investigations, based on a range of possible defenses. But he can't refuse to answer questions about the FISA application and those are the kinds of questions that I think Republicans will be very well prepared to ask. Those are the kinds of questions which are currently under investigation by the Inspector General, whose report we're waiting for. But those are not in anyway, precluded. So I think that they're going to regret having called him. Look, I'm a Liberal Democrat, I'm on the Democrat side--"

What I'm trying to do also is protect the civil liberties of all Americans because as you said Laura, if they can do this to the Special Counsel, they can do it to any prosecutor. Any prosecutor comes in and says no, I decided not to prosecute this corporate executive, Congress can now come in and say, wait a minute, why didn't you prosecute this corporate executive. Tell us all the evidence that you rejected. Tell us about the witnesses you didn't believe, everybody is at risk from this democratic ploy."

Congressman Meadows, there's another issue which I know this panel has already delved into somewhat over the last year plus. But when we discover that Andrew Weissmann had been briefed by Bruce Orr. Andrew Weissmann of course, one of Mueller's top prosecutors as going back to December of 2016. I think a lot of people want to know wait a second, why exactly was he put on that Special Counsel team if he was you know, he was in touch with Bruce Orr that early? Is that a legitimate line of inquiry in your view? The makeup of the prosecution team? Look, if we're going to have them up there testifying, let's really get the information about that team."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a legitimate question. I think the bigger problem that we see is Andrew Weissmann was very much aware of all the improper protocols that were broken, not just with Bruce Orr but the way that Bruce Orr was sharing with Joe Pientka. They were working together to try to spin this and guess who was involved in all of that? Peter Strzok. He was right there coaching, saying, let's keep this covered up, let's make sure that it doesn't come out. I can tell you that Alan Dershowitz is very correct. We have to protect our civil liberties whether they're Republican or Democrat or in between, we have to protect those. This is a sad day for civil liberties and those who love those rights that we have and yet, it's a worst day for Congress because what we have now done, what Adam Schiff and them have done, they have basically harassed the President and put forth a political agenda. It's the fourth time we're going to get a different collusion narrative out of it, I don't think so."

I mean, people hear that phrase across the country and like Laura, what are you guys talking about? I'll tell you why. Because if you're on trial, if you're in court and you find out later that the jury actually had personal animus against you as a person or your views or your religion, then that can nullify the verdict, okay? I want to know more about what they did - did they get a legal opinion about potential conflicts of interest within the pool of prosecutors that made up this Special Counsel's office, that's another question. I mean, we're kind of playing 20 questions, we would ask Mueller tonight but I like to - I'd like to get the answer to that, Harmeet."

I agree with everything Professor Dershowitz said as well and I speak as a conservative civil libertarian who also believes in due process for the accused and when you have a politicized system, I mean, look, the basic principle in our system Laura, is that judges and prosecutors are supposed to be beyond reproach. And they're not even supposed to have an appearance of impropriety, much less actually propriety. Here we start out with Robert Mueller being - you know turned down for a job that he was proposed for and then taking this position to criticize the President and then handpicking 17 Democrats to be on his team to persecute the President and then refusing to honor Department of Justice guidelines. The very same reason that Rod Rosenstein gave for James Comey to be fired is exactly what Robert Mueller is being asked to do right now by talking about his investigation well in defiance of Department of Justice guidelines. And this reeks of impropriety so what it actually does Laura, setting aside the President, it really undermines the American people's confidence that when you see a prosecutor get up there, an FBI agent get up there and investigate somebody, it's going to be impartial, we don't believe that anymore."

But when you give a person that kind of power, they were three special prosecutors actually for a time in that case. You give them the power, there's all this collateral damage, we have to just put an end to special counsel, special prosecutors. We have to create a special division within the Justice Department, a permanent division within the Justice Department to do these kinds of investigations under the usual rules, no reports, no reports to make public, statements, we're prosecuting, we're not prosecuting, let's go back to the traditions that this country has been built on. Instead of trying to create new ways of politicizing our criminal justice system. Today, it's used against the Republicans, tomorrow against the Democrats, the day after tomorrow it's used against you.

      "utterance": "Well, and I'm not even sure I agree with you on the murderers, because they tell us, oh, we want to see serious criminal aliens go, but these same people defend the sanctuary cities, and they keep those murderers from being handed over to ICE for deportation. Not a few miles from the nation's capital, less than a month ago, MS-13 killed a 14-year- old girl. And the people who killed her had all already been caught for violent crimes, all crimes that qualified them to be turned over to ICE. But Prince George's County, Maryland, and the state of Maryland proudly proclaims itself a sanctuary state. And so they wouldn't turn those murderers over to ICE to be deported. And now we have one more dead 14- year-old girl."
