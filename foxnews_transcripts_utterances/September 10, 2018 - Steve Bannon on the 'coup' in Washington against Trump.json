      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham on \"The Ingraham Angle\" on a very busy Monday night. We are monitoring, as Sean said, Hurricane Florence. It is a Category 4 storm that is expected to smash into both North and South Carolina on Thursday night, right around our show time. We will provide an update later in this hour with important information that you do not want to miss. Plus, former chief strategist to the president, Steve Bannon, is here for a rare and exclusive appearance. He'll comment on that internal war at the White House and share exclusive footage from his new documentary, \"Trump at War.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And a tennis star meltdown. I'll explain why Serena Williams kind of got it all wrong this past weekend and I'll be joined by a former tennis great himself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, the NFL fumbles on the anthem again. And that's the focus of tonight's Angle. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last May, the NFL owners announced a policy requiring their players to either stand for the national anthem or remain in the locker room during the anthem. Anyone kneeling or protesting would be fined. But what a difference a few months make, as the NFL has now announced that it won't implement its own new policy. So this weekend, Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson of the Miami Dolphins took a knee during the anthem of their season opener. Their teammate, Robert Quinn, stood, but he did so with a fist in the air. So what penalties will they face? None. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } An NFL spokesman tells \"Sports Illustrated,\" \"The status quo continues as productive discussions are ongoing on the important work of social justice.\" And you might have forgotten that this all started back during the Obama era, and about August, 2016. That was when Colin Kaepernick refused to stand in a pre-season game for the 49ers. After that game, he defended his gesture, saying, \"I'm not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, remember, Kaepernick basically started on police brutality but now, this has morphed into a much broader movement that the NFL felt that it had to support. So in an attempt to appease the protesting players, and put the kibosh on the protests, the league committed nearly $100 million earlier this year to what they call \"social justice initiatives.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But just where does that money go? Well, $73 million of it will be divided into three organizations -- 25 percent to the United Negro College Fund, 25 percent to Dream Corps, which is kind of a left-wing social justice group founded and led by Van Jones. Their goal is to lower the prison population by half and provide sanctuary to all. Not sure what that means. And then half of the $73 million will go to something called the Players Coalition. Now, the Players Coalition was a nonprofit quickly formed by a group of NFL players to guide the social justice conversation and receive any money that the NFL might be willing to donate. And get this, they've consulted with George Soros-backed criminal justice groups and the liberal Center for American Progress, this, according to ESPN. The coalition is led by 12 players, but it was founded by Malcolm Jenkins of the Eagles and retired player Anquan Bolden. The group advocates for everything from criminal justice reform to racial equality to voting rights. But some players have withdrawn from the group, including Michael Thomas and Eric Reed, who was one of the first players to protest right along with Kaepernick. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In an interview with \"Slate,\" Reed trashed the NFL's attempt at hush money -- that's what he called it -- basically called it, and resigned it from the players coalition altogether, claiming that Malcolm Jenkins told him, \"the money would come from funds that are already allocated to breast cancer awareness and Salute to Service. So it would really be no skin off the owner's backs. They would just move the money from those programs to this one. We didn't agree with that, because we weren't trying to cut other worthy programs.\" Well, whatever the case, the NFL thought it could buy its way out of any further controversy surrounding the anthem by basically paying off a patchwork of left-leaning groups. But it didn't completely work. On the broadcast side of this issue, the increasingly liberal ESPN has decided it will simply no longer air the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at all before Monday night football. Well, I hope Colin and company are happy with that. The fans aren't. Viewership of the NFL season opener at least was down 13 percent from last year and reached the lowest rating for an opening game since 2009. They did better yesterday, though. Well, I have a better idea of all this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If these players or the NFL were truly concerned about making life better for minorities the United States, why not consider dropping the political chip on your shoulder and consider working with the Trump administration? I know you might not like his tweets, I get that. But I have a question, are you aware of President Trump's openness to criminal justice reform? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham on \"The Ingraham Angle\" on a very busy Monday night. We are monitoring, as Sean said, Hurricane Florence. It is a Category 4 storm that is expected to smash into both North and South Carolina on Thursday night, right around our show time. We will provide an update later in this hour with important information that you do not want to miss. Plus, former chief strategist to the president, Steve Bannon, is here for a rare and exclusive appearance. He'll comment on that internal war at the White House and share exclusive footage from his new documentary, \"Trump at War.\" And a tennis star meltdown. I'll explain why Serena Williams kind of got it all wrong this past weekend and I'll be joined by a former tennis great himself. But first, the NFL fumbles on the anthem again. And that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Last May, the NFL owners announced a policy requiring their players to either stand for the national anthem or remain in the locker room during the anthem. Anyone kneeling or protesting would be fined. But what a difference a few months make, as the NFL has now announced that it won't implement its own new policy. So this weekend, Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson of the Miami Dolphins took a knee during the anthem of their season opener. Their teammate, Robert Quinn, stood, but he did so with a fist in the air. So what penalties will they face? None. An NFL spokesman tells \"Sports Illustrated,\" \"The status quo continues as productive discussions are ongoing on the important work of social justice.\" And you might have forgotten that this all started back during the Obama era, and about August, 2016. That was when Colin Kaepernick refused to stand in a pre-season game for the 49ers. After that game, he defended his gesture, saying, \"I'm not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\" Well, remember, Kaepernick basically started on police brutality but now, this has morphed into a much broader movement that the NFL felt that it had to support. So in an attempt to appease the protesting players, and put the kibosh on the protests, the league committed nearly $100 million earlier this year to what they call \"social justice initiatives.\" But just where does that money go? Well, $73 million of it will be divided into three organizations -- 25 percent to the United Negro College Fund, 25 percent to Dream Corps, which is kind of a left-wing social justice group founded and led by Van Jones. Their goal is to lower the prison population by half and provide sanctuary to all. Not sure what that means. And then half of the $73 million will go to something called the Players Coalition. Now, the Players Coalition was a nonprofit quickly formed by a group of NFL players to guide the social justice conversation and receive any money that the NFL might be willing to donate. And get this, they've consulted with George Soros-backed criminal justice groups and the liberal Center for American Progress, this, according to ESPN. The coalition is led by 12 players, but it was founded by Malcolm Jenkins of the Eagles and retired player Anquan Bolden. The group advocates for everything from criminal justice reform to racial equality to voting rights. But some players have withdrawn from the group, including Michael Thomas and Eric Reed, who was one of the first players to protest right along with Kaepernick. In an interview with \"Slate,\" Reed trashed the NFL's attempt at hush money -- that's what he called it -- basically called it, and resigned it from the players coalition altogether, claiming that Malcolm Jenkins told him, \"the money would come from funds that are already allocated to breast cancer awareness and Salute to Service. So it would really be no skin off the owner's backs. They would just move the money from those programs to this one. We didn't agree with that, because we weren't trying to cut other worthy programs.\" Well, whatever the case, the NFL thought it could buy its way out of any further controversy surrounding the anthem by basically paying off a patchwork of left-leaning groups. But it didn't completely work. On the broadcast side of this issue, the increasingly liberal ESPN has decided it will simply no longer air the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at all before Monday night football. Well, I hope Colin and company are happy with that. The fans aren't. Viewership of the NFL season opener at least was down 13 percent from last year and reached the lowest rating for an opening game since 2009. They did better yesterday, though. Well, I have a better idea of all this. If these players or the NFL were truly concerned about making life better for minorities the United States, why not consider dropping the political chip on your shoulder and consider working with the Trump administration? I know you might not like his tweets, I get that. But I have a question, are you aware of President Trump's openness to criminal justice reform?"

They are living the American dream and they spend more time telling our young people how they cannot make it and telling them how white people are stopping them from being successful instead of reaching out and finding solutions. We have now around the football field millions of dollars -- billions of dollars represented by these young players, and not once have they come together and put together a conversation about -- how about entrepreneurship? How about hiring these young people? How about telling our young men to man up and stop deserting our families? How about respect? There are a lot of things we can do and at the end of the day, the left doesn't want that to happen. They would rather have us be in misery versus having real solutions.

And I want to talk about the NFL because at the end of the day, it is the management. It might not be all the owners, but the management has decided that this is a good deal for them. They are globalist. Right now they have figured out a way that they can make $27 billion for the next nine years in a global fashion. All they have to do is put on the face of NFL (inaudible) because China and France, and left-leaning countries, would love to embrace NFL and it has become a global brand.

People -- everyday, people, fathers, brothers, sisters, they are all concerned when they see things that happen on television or maybe the experience of being themselves. And so what Colin did obviously brought a lot of attention but this is one thing along a long spectrum and specifically when you talk about the coalition. Look, tomorrow we are actually having a listen and learn tour in New Orleans, learning about the criminal justice system, educating ourselves, hearing from the grass roots organizations who are involved in this, going to bail hearings, hearing from people that are now able to vote because of a law that was recently passed here in the state of Louisiana. So, players are engaged, players want to learn, players want to advocate. And I heard Burgess say something before about what guys are not doing. Let me tell you something, I'm a father of five. I live here in New Orleans. I'm in a room, a locker room, with 53 other guys from various places around the country and we do go into our communities.

I guess he hasn't been to sign to anyone yet which is tragic because he's a really good player. But why he left the Players Coalition. This is from November of 2017. He said, \"When we agreed to be a part of the Players Coalition we were under the impression that it would be our organization. We were under the impression that we would all have equal say. But we've come to find out that it's actually Malcolm and Anquan's organization. Nobody else really has a stake in the organization. Malcolm actually wants us to -- he calls it invest, I call it donate -- to the company that pay salaries for his staff. But again, we would have no equity.\" What is your reaction to his ongoing complaint about what happened with this Players Coalition, where a huge amount of money is going into concerns about where that money is actually ending up, who's getting what and what audit is being done and all that?"

And him and Malcolm have dealt with their differences and this is September, this is a month ago so I'm not going to comment on where they are or not because I believe that they are definitely in a better place, but again, where we are now is different.

So, again, it looks like from the outside -- and even some of the more left- wing critics of you guys -- and there are people on the left to really think you guys were just bought off, like this guy Stephen Crockett at \"The Root.\" I guess I'll put up the full screen, Ben, so you can hear what I say. It says, \"Malcolm Jenkins sounds like the man who turned his back on Harriet Tubman to do the good work of making sure he can effect change from inside the plantation. Please stop calling Malcolm Jenkins the face of Colin Kaepernick's movement. That would be like saying Ben Carson is doing the work that Malcolm X started.\" Well, that is a nasty comment about Ben Carson, but you get the point, that you guys were too quick to take the money instead of continuing the protest and standing against what the NFL owners are really all about.

I think that we can learn a lesson from what has happened here because on the outside, again, and when you watch the news and when you hear the tribalism that is going on, there's a lot of back-and-forth but there is no communication. And what we have done between players and the league is to come together, communicate.

You have an exact type of coup right now. What was said in that anonymous letter was absolutely outrageous and I think the president ought to take immediate and direct action to find out who the conspirators are. I don't think there is any one author. I think there is an author -- I think there is somebody that drafted it. There are many voices in there. I think you can tell the way it's written.

And he can't decide when he says that Trump is basically a clear and present danger and he is so dangerous that he's taking credit for all these good things that are happening that really should belong to Obama. And then we have this really tragic situation where the McCain funeral follow the script of the Paul Wellstone 16 years ago were turned into a pep rally.

He didn't wave a wand but he did have sensible policies. Booming manufacturing, wages going up in blue-collar, even CNBC had to do a piece today basically admitting that the addition of the manufacturing jobs under Trump has been astounding and it dwarfs what Obama did."

      "speaker": "HAHN",
      "utterance": "The growth in manufacturing under Trump is a product of the booming economy, a product of developing markets overseas where wages are rising. It's natural to happen. It started under Obama and it has continued. Don't forget, the jobs that Obama was creating, the economy was creating about 20,000 jobs more per month than they have been under the Trump administration over the last two years of the Obama administration. So it's not like this just happened."

He doesn't give a rat's caboose about your connections because he doesn't need them, and he certainly doesn't need your money. But to Chris' point, too, I love debating with Chris, he's a good friend, but he rarely, if ever, knows the numbers, and he doesn't know the numbers either. Barack Obama led the worst recovery from recession in modern American history. This is just a statistical, numeric fact. I know it's hard for liberals to digest, but it's a matter of fact."

That is a funny number, three, because Barack Obama was the first modern president never to achieve three percent annualized GDP growth. The reason he didn't was because he put on new regulations, he had this neo-socialist ObamaCare health plan, and he jawboned to the economy. He said, you didn't build that, now is not the time --"

By the way, Serena Williams had a messy loss during the U.S. Open final, an amazing player but a sad, sad event because of how this all went down.

We at the Ingraham household were watching every minute. Williams lost to Japan's Naomi Osaka, and Williams says the critical penalties lodged against her by that match's male umpire were indeed sexist, as you just heard. But this isn't the first time she's tangled with referees or umpires, even female ones."

Joining me with reactions is John Lloyd, a British and former tennis star and occasional commentator, along with sports agent Anthony Tall. All right, John, you've been out there on the court, just a few years ago, and I loved watching them play any part should be 70s in '80s. It is high-pressure. Was this a sexist call by the chair umpire?"

      "speaker": "JOHN LLOYD, FORMER PRO TENNIS PLAYER",
      "utterance": "No, no, no. Not at all. Carlos Ramos is a stickler for the rules. That is the way he is, and he went by the book. The three things that he called Serena for were correct. Could he have handled it differently? Could he have been a bit softer and maybe said something to her at the changeover and turned the mic off and said, listen, Serena, I can see the coaching going on. Tell your coach to cut it out, and then maybe this thing wouldn't have started. Perhaps. But once it started, this was Serena -- it was a bad day for her at the office, and you can't say that sort of stuff to the umpire, not these days. These umpires are very professional, they have rulebooks. Carlos Ramos is known for keeping the rules straight. You've got to use your common sense here and back off when the times were getting bad."

Margaret Court, who is the record holder in tennis grand slam, she is considered the grand dame of the sport, she was quoted as saying, the rules are the rules, and she doesn't like it when players try to pretend they are bigger than the game. Your reaction?"

      "utterance": "Yes, I think that Serena was having a really tough day. I think she was a little more upset with what was going on against Osaka as opposed to what the ref was saying to her. However, this has been a tough year with her with her getting random tests, random drug tests that she feels has been unfair, particularly coming off of her new child. Remember, this has hasn't been the sport that has been so welcoming to her and her sister. Remember, when they first came out, this was a whole new look, two black girls from Compton, and they took this sport by storm. So she has felt a whole bunch of different things over her 20 year career, 20 some plus year career --"

Anthony, she's a global superstar, and there have been glowing profiles about -- and John, you can chime in quickly, she has been lauded by everyone and everywhere, and she is the star still of tennis. Osaka is probably the next generation. But I don't know. My daughter and I were watching it together, she's 13, she doesn't even watch tennis very often, and she just kept looking at me, going, I can't believe she's speaking to the umpire that way. She doesn't even play tennis. John?"

Don't take that away from them because it has been unbelievable from where they came from and how their father predicted they were both be number one in the world, and they've achieved that. They've been amazing. This, though, was a bad by Serena. Could the umpire perhaps to diffuse the situation better? Perhaps. But Serena, I don't think, knew the rules. I don't think she realized she was about to a game penalty. I don't think she realized there was a three step to the rules, which the umpire enforced correctly, and she just lost it. You can't do that kind of thing, and it was a bad day for her."

And she said basically this sort of behavior, this is the sort of behavior that no one should be engaging in on the court. They have been many times when I was playing that I wanted to break my racket into 1,000 pieces, then I thought about the kids watching, and I grudgingly held onto that racket. One of the greatest players who ever lived in women's tennis. Anthony, close it out."

On Friday night, we aired a powerful town hall, got incredible kudos, thank you for sending them, featuring officials and residents from the south and west side in search of solutions.

He only did two weeks of high school. He wanted to be on the swim team. He loved dogs, he loved animals. Why would you do that? Why would you burn someone alive?
