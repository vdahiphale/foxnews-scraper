So, wage increases for example were stagnant under Obama and for a couple years before that, they have gone up. The middle class has been bolstered. The tax cut actually did affect middle-class families more than the rich as the Democrats are saying. They are having a very hard time going into an election where racism being thrown, the wall is not working. The economy is something that people can gauge no matter who is in office and say are they working to make my life better? That's the argument Elizabeth Warren is trying to make and it's the argument that President Trump is trying to make. But for people to say that we need a recession to get Trump out is disgusting because it actually hurts people's welfare. It hurts their families. And it makes living really difficult.

The media can't cause a recession but I agree cheering on a recession is not a good look for anybody. The Republicans need more for messaging than just the media wants a recession. And I think that's -- that the president talking about tax cuts goes right back to where the Republicans are very strong. And even if Nancy Pelosi will never allow a vote for tax cuts, for me politically, that's why Republicans should talk about it all the more. The president, the week before the midterm elections in 2018 at a rally said, we have a big middle-class tax cut that is coming and he promised it. Then nobody ever talked about it again. And now they are starting to talk about it and I think they are trying to say what tools do we have. And a payroll tax cut doesn't help the rich. People who are actually working tough jobs, maybe two or three jobs, they are the ones paying the most payroll tax.",

If this were a good idea, every brilliant M.D. would be out of work. The dems cannot separate Trump's personality from how well he runs the country. They conflate words with deeds, the real world with the Trump show. It saves them from having to come up with anything better, which they lack. Then there is the hypothetical. There is no big war but what if Trump gets us in one. There is no proof of collusion, but what if there was. There is no recession, yet, but what if there was one? Maybe the media can talk one into existence. It's been all hypothetical for three years. At any moment, unstable Trump could lead us somewhere really bad as he actually leads us to someplace good.

I think electability and experience are overrated in politics. Hillary was the most experienced and she lost. Barack Obama was the least experience and he won. And remember, Donald Trump was completely unelectable and he won. So you can throw that out the window. Right now, the American public believes someone that's experienced in Washington, D.C., just seems like an insider that's been there their whole life. Or someone that's electable like Joe is just someone that the pundits predict is electable and the pundits are always wrong, except me, of course. Biden's big strengths are his association with Barack Obama, and two, he's clinging desperately to that moderate lane by his fingernails. But he has been piling up so many gaffes and he's having a lot of trouble with the small donors and they are trying to cut back his schedule because he's too sleepy. And he's just not inspiring. He doesn't draw any crowds. Liz Warren had about 12,000 the other day. Biden I think hasn't cracked 1,000 from the last couple of months that I've seen. So, he's also promised to give health insurance to illegal aliens, eliminate coal and natural gas and raise taxes for the middle class. Really, really body blows if you look at a general election. But something he's going to have to deal with this winter when spygate is finally exposed, Williams. He's going to have to answer, what did he know and when did he know it. If he knew anything at all, and then if he didn't know anything at all, where was he?"

And this is interesting to me. What's interesting is, he is actually up right now in the polls. Before he ran this ad, he had increased in the CNN poll by seven points, now back up to 29 percent. You get Sanders and Warren and I think it's like 15 and 14, so it's about 30 percent, Jesse -- all of that. But the key for me is looking inside the numbers and when you look inside the numbers, what do you see? It's moderates, it's older Democrats, some of the young folks, but really strong number of conservative to moderate Democrats who are backing Biden. They see him as the alternative to Trump. In other words, Trump is the bully, here's a guy who we can see as a nice guy, Joe from Scranton who you can trust and who they think, if this is going to be a referendum on Trump -- he allows it to be a referendum on Trump because Joe is not objectionable."

But this is pretty gross, right, because the very people who will recession hurts are the same people that the media and Democrats claim to stand up for. And they are struggling in a lot of ways because Trump and his administration have been able to take away a lot of the arguments that Democrats have been making on the economy for years. So, wage increases for example were stagnant under Obama and for a couple years before that, they have gone up. The middle class has been bolstered. The tax cut actually did affect middle-class families more than the rich as the Democrats are saying. They are having a very hard time going into an election where racism being thrown, the wall is not working. The economy is something that people can gauge no matter who is in office and say are they working to make my life better? That's the argument Elizabeth Warren is trying to make and it's the argument that President Trump is trying to make. But for people to say that we need a recession to get Trump out is disgusting because it actually hurts people's welfare. It hurts their families. And it makes living really difficult. So I think they should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to push that. Having a recession is like saying there's going to be another sunset tomorrow. Of course, we always go into a new recession, but hoping for a political gain is pretty gross."

The media can't cause a recession but I agree cheering on a recession is not a good look for anybody. The Republicans need more for messaging than just the media wants a recession. And I think that's -- that the president talking about tax cuts goes right back to where the Republicans are very strong. And even if Nancy Pelosi will never allow a vote for tax cuts, for me politically, that's why Republicans should talk about it all the more. The president, the week before the midterm elections in 2018 at a rally said, we have a big middle-class tax cut that is coming and he promised it. Then nobody ever talked about it again. And now they are starting to talk about it and I think they are trying to say what tools do we have. And a payroll tax cut doesn't help the rich. People who are actually working tough jobs, maybe two or three jobs, they are the ones paying the most payroll tax."

The New York City medical examiner concluded that Epstein died by suicide from hanging. But Epstein's legal team, they say they plan to do their own independent investigation.

Now people are saying that was a set up to push the feds and the investigators off her trail. You have this man who was a model scout out in France and questions about his behavior and what he was doing, even possibly sending young women to Epstein in this country and then they ship her up.

Epstein was under their charge, under the Bureau of Prisons. He is no longer here so the victims can't even have their day in court. He can't have his day in court. Now, he can't defend himself. And it's a $500 million estate, you know, with all of these lawyers and all of these things. Like, I don't know if there is going to be actually a victim's compensation fund and I'm skeptical about this will. He was supposedly, even though we don't know where all of his money came from, a financial planner. He was somebody who was advising people on finances. And I would like to know what his will said before the will that he signed on that day was because if you are that wealthy, I'm assuming you have some sort of a will, some sort of a financial plan.

What really makes this incredible to me is McNeill had just stepped in water, had keys in one hand and umbrella in the other and a cell phone in his pocket. All of that could have brought the lightning current right to him. By the way you should know 12 people, 12 Americans have died from lightning since May.

Teenagers in the house heard the refrigerator beeping, so they went downstairs and saw the bear rummaging around the cupboards.
