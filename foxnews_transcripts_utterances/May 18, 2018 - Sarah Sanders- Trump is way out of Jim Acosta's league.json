Clinton and the DNC, remember, they paid over what, $12 million for the Russian dossier full of Russian lies. Where is the FBI, where is the CIA? Where are the spies? Of course, there weren't any. Instead of investigating it, well, they used former spy Christopher Steele who they fired as a trusted source, and they used false, completely unverified, never corroborated -- a dossier he put together to get a warrant and then spy on the Trump campaign. Never tell the judges she paid for it. And then in the process, lying to the FISA court judges on four separate occasions, never revealing Hillary paid for all of this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal we have seen in the history of this country.

Now, The Times didn't all of a sudden decide oh, we want to tell people the truth. This is about actively now assisting the deep state. And what the Times is doing is they're helping these bad actors get in front of the scandal, because they know it's coming out.

Congress -- well, they'll eventually get the documents that led up to the I.G. report. We'll see it all. Now, the DOJ is now slowly leaking this information to friendly news outlets like The Washington Post and The New York Times. Here's what they're now reporting is corroborating everything we have been uncovering. Let's run through the details, starting with this quote. The FBI obtained phone records, other documents using national security letters, a secret type of subpoena, officials said, and at least one government informant, i.e. spy, met several times with Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, and current and former officials say. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That confirms the FBI had a spy, an informant that infiltrated the Trump campaign. Where is the warrant? And in addition to lying to the four FISA judges four times to get the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, the FBI is using secret spies? Was there another secret subpoena? It sounds like the deep state was using every option available to go after the Trump campaign. By the way, after they, of course, rigged the Hillary investigation. Here is another significant quote that matches our reporting. Days after they closed their investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server, agents began scrutinizing the campaign of her Republican rival. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, The Times adds that both these investigations were made up of a small group of the same top officials. So, the same officials that rigged the Clinton e-mail investigation even though we know she broke laws and obstructed justice, well, then, they went after Donald Trump and set their sights on him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, next, now, is this shocking part that directly implicates here John Kerry and Barack Obama. Nobody has picked up on this. Top Australian officials broke with diplomatic protocol, allowed the ambassador, Alexander Downer, to sit for an FBI interview to describe his meeting with campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, all right? Diplomatic protocol broken. That means John Kerry from the get-go, this is the beginning, the Obama State Department and I'm sure the president, that means Obama, all involved. That means they knew about the spying from the start. And as we have been saying for months, John Kerry, Barack Obama, need to answer two simple questions. What did you both know? And when did you both know it? Now, these are other disturbing details in this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, these deep state sources revealed to the New York Times that four Trump campaign associates were being investigated by the FBI. It wasn't just Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, whoever he is. The FBI was also going after General Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort from the get-go. This was a major intelligence operation. And finally, these unnamed sources tried to spin that Peter Strzok/Lisa Page text messages what they were talking about who we now think is Andrew McCabe about their so-called insurance policy in case the unthinkable happened and Donald Trump won. They are absolutely claiming now, quote, they said anything the FBI did publicly would only give fodder to Mr. Trump campaign claims that the election was rigged.\" Now, Mr. Strzok countered that even if Trump's chances of victory were low, like dying before you are 40, the stakes are too high to justify inaction. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, that's laughable and it proves our point. The deep state, these top players not rank and file desperately trying to spin all of this damning, all of this incriminating evidence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, another new breaking story to tell you about tonight. Anonymous government sources have been repeatedly leaking to the media details about the FBI informant who did spy on the Trump campaign. And at the same time, they are accusing president, Republicans, even people like me, of putting this informant's life in danger. I have known his name for a full week. Here's the latest example from Washington Post: Bigger than Watergate. Trump joins push by allies to expose the role of an FBI source. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They are falsely smearing not only the president and congressional Republicans and yours truly. No, we are trying to conduct an investigation, Congress is. They have constitutional oversight authority. They are supposed to do this. In the process, Washington Post, as bias as they are, is revealing key details who the person is. For example, the source is a U.S. citizen and has provided information over the years to both the FBI and the CIA as The Post previously reported and aided the Russia investigation both before and after Mueller's appointment of May 2017, according to people familiar with these activities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK. On the basis of this, it's ridiculous. And for the record, the person's name has been out there in the media. I've known for over a week. And, by the way, it's not some closely held state secret. What is withholding now or unfolding before our eyes is utter insanity and the total hypocrisy on display for the whole country to see. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You got the DOJ, FBI are accusing the president, Republicans, people like me of endangering a source. At the same time, anonymous law enforcement, intel officials, they are the ones leaking the details about who the informant is. That is what we call a deliberative smear. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, here is point number two. This is really important. These unnamed federal officials have leaked more information to The New York Times and Washington Post than they have given to Congress because they are trying to get a friendly audience. And remember, Rod Rosenstein has been slow- walking, obstructing, stonewalling every congressional attempt to do their constitutional authority of oversight every chance he gets. When Rosenstein does actually comply, well, he turned over, what, heavily redacted information in the claims of national security. Well, we have seen that is just a lie. It's not true. Look at these leaks about the FBI informant. You know what? Would they really be doing this if it was a national security threat? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is about getting out in front of Congress, in front of the IG, in front of what they know is coming. They are trying to control the narrative slowly bleed it out. It has nothing to do with national security. Just like Rosenstein redacting the fact that James Comey didn't think that General Flynn lied to the FBI, neither did anyone else in the FBI. It had nothing to do with national security. That was a CYA and Rosenstein protecting his corrupt friends. He and Jeff Sessions, they either need to go or do their job. Also tonight, the president reacting to this horrible shooting.

Remember the Nixon scandal. It was about a third-rate burglary. This is a deep state, political hit job now spying on an opposition party campaign, FBI spies, during an election. And it gets worse. The deep state isn't even trying to hide it. And what they did, they are now bragging about it. The former Obama director of national intelligence, James Clapper, is actually saying spying on the Trump campaign was a good thing. Has he ever heard of the Constitution? We're going to unpack all the stunning new details tonight. Now, it will make you question how this could ever happen in the United States of America. And also tonight, a deep state source smear. This is pretty unreal. Liberal media, anonymous government sources falsely accusing the president, and Republicans and conservatives of endangering the life of the FBI informant, you know, the one spying for the FBI on the Trump campaign. Do they have a warrant? It's also revealing critical information about who this person really is. And tonight, the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he is now telling the special counsel, wrap up this corrupt investigation. Now also tonight, we have sad news out of Texas. The president reacting to yet another tragic school shooting, we will explain why it is time for this country to get serious when it comes to protecting our precious children. There is an answer.

It's literally hanging in the balance at this hour. You have unelected, deep state actors shredding our Fourth Amendment rights, your right to privacy, and protection against unreasonable search and seizure. This is, as I've been telling you, one of the darkest chapters in American history. The Trump campaign is targeted because people like Clapper, Brennan, Comey, and others. They think they knew better than you did, the American people, about who should be the president. They weaponized the powerful tools of intelligence, turned it on us and they are now politicizing differences, political differences. By the way, Clapper, since you are so concerned about Russia influence in the election, did you have a spy in the Clinton campaign? Now, we know for a fact her campaign was colluding, had a foreign agent Christopher Steele paying for Russian lies and propaganda to lie to the American people. Clinton and the DNC, remember, they paid over what, $12 million for the Russian dossier full of Russian lies. Where is the FBI, where is the CIA? Where are the spies? Of course, there weren't any. Instead of investigating it, well, they used former spy Christopher Steele who they fired as a trusted source, and they used false, completely unverified, never corroborated -- a dossier he put together to get a warrant and then spy on the Trump campaign. Never tell the judges she paid for it. And then in the process, lying to the FISA court judges on four separate occasions, never revealing Hillary paid for all of this. This is the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal we have seen in the history of this country. Talk about Watergate. This is Watergate on steroids and human growth hormone.

And what the Times is doing is they're helping these bad actors get in front of the scandal, because they know it's coming out. They are spinning the facts and crafting their own narrative."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, to steal a page from the FBI's playbook, well, they now know Crossfire Hurricane is coming. Now, here is why",
      "utterance": "the deep state is about to be exposed. It's all happening. Now, a portion of the DOJ report is set to come out in a couple of weeks. Congress -- well, they'll eventually get the documents that led up to the I.G. report. We'll see it all. Now, the DOJ is now slowly leaking this information to friendly news outlets like The Washington Post and The New York Times. Here's what they're now reporting is corroborating everything we have been uncovering. Let's run through the details, starting with this quote. The FBI obtained phone records, other documents using national security letters, a secret type of subpoena, officials said, and at least one government informant, i.e. spy, met several times with Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, and current and former officials say. That confirms the FBI had a spy, an informant that infiltrated the Trump campaign. Where is the warrant? And in addition to lying to the four FISA judges four times to get the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, the FBI is using secret spies? Was there another secret subpoena? It sounds like the deep state was using every option available to go after the Trump campaign. By the way, after they, of course, rigged the Hillary investigation. Here is another significant quote that matches our reporting. Days after they closed their investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server, agents began scrutinizing the campaign of her Republican rival. Now, The Times adds that both these investigations were made up of a small group of the same top officials. So, the same officials that rigged the Clinton e-mail investigation even though we know she broke laws and obstructed justice, well, then, they went after Donald Trump and set their sights on him. Now, next, now, is this shocking part that directly implicates here John Kerry and Barack Obama. Nobody has picked up on this. Top Australian officials broke with diplomatic protocol, allowed the ambassador, Alexander Downer, to sit for an FBI interview to describe his meeting with campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, all right? Diplomatic protocol broken. That means John Kerry from the get-go, this is the beginning, the Obama State Department and I'm sure the president, that means Obama, all involved. That means they knew about the spying from the start. And as we have been saying for months, John Kerry, Barack Obama, need to answer two simple questions. What did you both know? And when did you both know it? Now, these are other disturbing details in this. Now, these deep state sources revealed to the New York Times that four Trump campaign associates were being investigated by the FBI. It wasn't just Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, whoever he is. The FBI was also going after General Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort from the get-go. This was a major intelligence operation. And finally, these unnamed sources tried to spin that Peter Strzok/Lisa Page text messages what they were talking about who we now think is Andrew McCabe about their so-called insurance policy in case the unthinkable happened and Donald Trump won. They are absolutely claiming now, quote, they said anything the FBI did publicly would only give fodder to Mr. Trump campaign claims that the election was rigged.\" Now, Mr. Strzok countered that even if Trump's chances of victory were low, like dying before you are 40, the stakes are too high to justify inaction. Well, that's laughable and it proves our point. The deep state, these top players not rank and file desperately trying to spin all of this damning, all of this incriminating evidence. Now, another new breaking story to tell you about tonight. Anonymous government sources have been repeatedly leaking to the media details about the FBI informant who did spy on the Trump campaign. And at the same time, they are accusing president, Republicans, even people like me, of putting this informant's life in danger. I have known his name for a full week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here's the latest example from Washington Post",
      "utterance": "Bigger than Watergate. Trump joins push by allies to expose the role of an FBI source. They are falsely smearing not only the president and congressional Republicans and yours truly. No, we are trying to conduct an investigation, Congress is. They have constitutional oversight authority. They are supposed to do this. In the process, Washington Post, as bias as they are, is revealing key details who the person is. For example, the source is a U.S. citizen and has provided information over the years to both the FBI and the CIA as The Post previously reported and aided the Russia investigation both before and after Mueller's appointment of May 2017, according to people familiar with these activities. OK. On the basis of this, it's ridiculous. And for the record, the person's name has been out there in the media. I've known for over a week. And, by the way, it's not some closely held state secret. What is withholding now or unfolding before our eyes is utter insanity and the total hypocrisy on display for the whole country to see. You got the DOJ, FBI are accusing the president, Republicans, people like me of endangering a source. At the same time, anonymous law enforcement, intel officials, they are the ones leaking the details about who the informant is. That is what we call a deliberative smear. Now, here is point number two. This is really important. These unnamed federal officials have leaked more information to The New York Times and Washington Post than they have given to Congress because they are trying to get a friendly audience. And remember, Rod Rosenstein has been slow- walking, obstructing, stonewalling every congressional attempt to do their constitutional authority of oversight every chance he gets. When Rosenstein does actually comply, well, he turned over, what, heavily redacted information in the claims of national security. Well, we have seen that is just a lie. It's not true. Look at these leaks about the FBI informant. You know what? Would they really be doing this if it was a national security threat? This is about getting out in front of Congress, in front of the IG, in front of what they know is coming. They are trying to control the narrative slowly bleed it out. It has nothing to do with national security. Just like Rosenstein redacting the fact that James Comey didn't think that General Flynn lied to the FBI, neither did anyone else in the FBI. It had nothing to do with national security. That was a CYA and Rosenstein protecting his corrupt friends. He and Jeff Sessions, they either need to go or do their job.

Now, Trace Gallagher is going to have a full report in a few minutes. As we have been saying on this program, it's so far beyond time that everything be done to protect our kids in school. It's simple. We can solve this. This is not a political issue. Harden up the schools. Every school in this country needs a full threat security assessment, every school. We have to secure the perimeter and the entry points of every school. We must require a mandate, IDs for anyone walking into a school. Metal detectors in every single school. And we need to hire retired concealed carry police officers, retired military members, and we should have two on every floor of every school in America. That's what I think is the simple answer. And here's an idea, by the way, in case you're interested in new ideas. These people work 15 hours, retired military and retired police, concealed carry. Let's them give them federal, state, local tax break as incentives so it won't cost a lot of money. It's not political. It shouldn't be political. We protect our athletes. We protect our politicians. We protect those on the red carpet. How about we do this for our kids? Let's do it in their best interest. We have more coming up later in the program. Another disturbing scene to tell you about, this one taking place at Trump National Doral Golf Course, where police officers had to shoot a deranged man in his legs earlier today, after he reported started yelling anti-Trump rhetoric and opened fire inside of the resort. Police are saying this lunatic wanted to lure officers into an ambush-style attack. Thank God they were able to stop this particular nut case. All right.

So, they believe James Clapper was the one that actually delivered the information to CNN after the president was briefed on the dossier by Comey at Trump Tower. So, Clapper has a lot to answer for. But, basically, what Clapper is saying is like, look, we weaponized the intelligence community to spy on a campaign, because we were concerned about the Russians. But, Sean, what about the $500,000 that Clinton got for a speech in 2010 for a speech he gave to Renaissance Capital which, by the way, is very well-connected to the KGB FSB, Russian FSB, by this bank? Did they have spies with Bill Clinton at the time? Were people investigating the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation during that time? I don't think so. This is a very well-orchestrated, it appears, plan, to spy on a presidential campaign. And it was very well partisan. It involves Brennan. It involves Clapper. It involves foreign assets. It involves U.S. assets. I think we are only seeing the top of this iceberg. I'd like to see this unravel.

Instead, they deceive them as to the source, as to the fact that Steele had been fired by the FBI, and as to the fact that Sid Blumenthal and others have provided information.

And our friends with the Media research Center they found this gem of Jim Acosta covering President Obama's inauguration in 2013. The only thing missing from the so-called reporter are the pom- poms. Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Yes, with Obama, he needs to pinch himself. And he says he is a reporter. He says he is a journalist. No, he is a liberal activist. Be honest about it. Now brother, I spoke with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders about this and so much more. All right, Sarah, thank you for joining us. You look at all of what I'm pointing out here. I don't think there has ever been a more hostile news media in the country than there has been of President Trump. I think it's obvious. It's so bad that there is 91 percent negative coverage according to the Media Research Center."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "It's unreal the amount of negative coverage that comes from the media covering this White House. Not just because it's so one-sided but because there are so many good things they could be talking about. The economy is booming. ISIS is on the run. Remaking of the judiciary. Getting rid of the individual mandate. The foreign policy and the relationship that this president has built. Every day there is a good news story to tell. And yet, 90 percent of the coverage is negative. Sean, one of the clips that I hope that you'll go back and watch that I think Jim Acosta also said from that interview was that he would love to go one on one with President Trump. I have just little note to Jim. I think he should stick with going one-on-one with me because President Trump is way out of his league and I don't think he wants to take on that challenge because he's definitely not going to win. I think that the media bias is out of control and he certainly one of the leaders of the pack."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Look, if he wants to be an opinion person, I'm a talk show host. And as a talk show host sometimes I do straight news interviews and sometimes I give opinion. Other times I moderate debate and sometimes I debate. It's all encompassing. But I tell everybody I'm a conservative. We still do a lot, we break, frankly, we break more stories than most of them in a week than they do in a year in my opinion. And they've been wrong so often. Why -- why does this continue in this set? Every day I watch you. I don't know how you do your job. I could not -- there is not enough money on this earth to pay me to do what you do. And it's actually gotten personal and abusive. And have we gotten to the point where maybe they should submit their questions in writing and hand back written answers? Because what they are really trying to do is get a moment so they can show their audiences how tough they are and it's really show time for them. It's not about getting answers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "Look, I do my job because I love this country and I love getting to come to work every day and work for President Trump who also loves this country and wants to do good things. You can block out the critics and focus on the people across the country that love the president and love what he is going. And we try to spend our energy focused on those comments and the people and the voices coming from outside of D.C. and outside of New York and outside of the talking heads. Because those are the people that really matter and those are certainly overwhelmingly supporting President Trump and what he's done. And that makes it pretty easy to come to work every day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "You know, look at this week. The president was answering a question about the violent, violent gang known as MS-13. It was obvious. The media ran with it. And then they ended up almost all of them having to retract it. There is a lot of retracting that they really need to do though."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "It's incredible. A lot of times you see the media just automatically assume the worst out of this president, which is really sad because again, I think they are missing out on some of the most amazing things that are happening. He has had an incredible first year and a half. And they are missing that because they are so focused on being negative and attacking, not just the president but everyone around him. And I think that's a real disservice to the country. He clearly was talking about MS-13 when he referenced the animals. And I said it yesterday I'll say it again. I think he could have gone further."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I agree."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "These are some of the most despicable people that have ever walked this planet. The things that they do the type of activity they engage in. Animal is the nicest thing I think that the president could have called them and I hope he'll continue to call them out and continue to put pressure on every law enforcement agency and official in this country to bring them down and protect people across all over the country. And certainly I think he has done a great job doing that."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, Sarah, great job. I don't know how you do it every day. Amazing. We appreciate you being with us. And she is right. Fourteen states record low unemployment. Record low unemployment for African- American, Hispanics, for women. Let's see. Kept his promise on Jerusalem. Got out of the Iranian deal and look at what's happening with little rocket man. Just touching the surface. All right. We're not done. When we come back, we're going to talk more about the director of national intelligence under Barack Obama. We'll take James Clapper to task. Does he not believe in the rule of law or Constitution? It appears he doesn't. The FBI had a spy in the Trump campaign. Where is the one in Hillary's? That's next."

      "utterance": "Life from the America's news headquarters I'm Trace Gallagher. Ten people are dead. Another 10 more wounded in a mass shooting early this morning at Santa Fe High School in Texas. The alleged shooter 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis has been charged with capital murder and he is being held with no bond. Texas Congressman Michael McCaul, chair of the House homeland security committee says federal prosecutors are also considering weapons of mass destruction charges for the explosive devices found at the scene. Texas Governor Greg Abbott says he will organize round tables around the state to discuss preventing further shootings. And President Trump has now activated his gun safety commission. That's the group he convened in the wake of the Parkland school shooting in Florida back February. The White House declined to say if the president would revisit gun control measures proposed after the shooting. When news breaks out, we'll break in. I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to Hannity."

We have joining us from American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp. And by the way, she also serves on the president's media advisory board. Radio TV talk host, Dr. Gina Loudon. Good to see you both. Dr. Loudon, look, to me this is a simple, do we have a duel system of justice in this country? The Clinton system versus everybody else? And are we going to spy and get FISA warrants on every campaign? Or send that FBI informant without any warrant? GINA LOUDON, MEMBER, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN MEDIA ADVISORY BOARD: You know, Sean, as you pointed out many times on your show this is really more -- I mean, if all the crimes were happening, it wouldn't be such a big deal because the American people would know about it. If the media were reporting it fairly. And I want to put this in perspective. Imagine for a moment if during Watergate, for example, the media had been covering up for the things that happened during Watergate. That's not the case. In this particular instance the media is covering up for the criminals in this. And conspired against the American voter to undermine an entire election. We need to let that sink in as an American people. And we need to fight it on every level."
    },

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

Unverified, uncorroborated, Clinton bought and paid for, foreign national put together Christopher Steele, Russian lies to influence an election. Bad enough. Then it becomes the bulk of information, never verified, never tell the judges, four times she paid for it. Now we have a spy in the Trump campaign? OK, this is not the United States if this is allowed to stand."

      "speaker": "MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, CPAC",
      "utterance": "Yes. That's right. I think the worst part is that we have been covering this throughout the entire Trump presidency. And really even during at the end of the campaign. And there is still confusion about what our government did to try to undermine and influence the presidential election. You got to repeat that to yourself a couple of times and let it sink in. This is a constitutional crisis. You know, I watched this interview with Clapper on that show that I won't mention because I hate it so much. I also watched Mark Levin on your show. And I think Mark has this exactly right. Which is this is a constitutional crisis. I advise the president to do what Ronald Reagan did. He picked a tower commission. He picked three imminent experts in the field of foreign policy--"

We're going to find out who it is, it might be trying to rig the election for you. If the Russians tampering with campaigns is the big deal. You Clapper say it's not Trump, no, no, this is hyperbole.
