The media has been lying to you and misleading you, the American people, but their time is up. If you remember back in January, when I came back from vacation, I said 2018 would be the year of the boomerang.

Let's start with James Comey. A quick sidebar before we lay out the case against him. We have been a warning that the self-serving holier-than-thou former FBI director that he has the right to remain silent, but Jim Comey just can't seem to keep his mouth shut. And it's been amazing to me that Comey doesn't have an army of lawyers that have been telling him to keep quiet and not release this book because he is now tonight facing serious legal exposure. Here is what we mean. In his brand-new letter, these 11 members of Congress, they highlight how Comey spent 14 minutes back on July 5th, 2016, laying out the case for criminal prosecution against Hillary Clinton, but then at the very end, he said basically, never mind, and didn't recommend the criminal charges. We talked about equal justice under the law. We cannot have a dual justice system. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have since found out that Comey and Strzok, and their cohorts, they put the fix in to save Hillary Clinton and her campaign by reaching a decision not to prosecute before interviewing Hillary Clinton and 17 other key witnesses. They're all writing that months before they interviewed her. Reaction to this inexcusable absurdity, the letter today writes for this criminal referral: 'Comey's decision to not seek charges against Clinton's misconduct suggest improper investigative conduct, potentially motivated by a political agenda.' if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And because of that, these 11 congressmen are now referring the following criminal charges to the Department of Justice, 18 USC 1505, obstruction of proceedings before departments, agencies, and committees. And 18 U.S. Code 1515, definitions for certain provisions, general provision, which appears to be referring to making misleading statements. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And there is the issue of Comey's memos. This letter explains that in order for members of Congress to view them, well, they had to go to a secured facility because four of the seven memos were marked classified and at the secret and confidential levels. Well, we also have the issue of Comey and what he did with those memos. Here's what Comey said under oath back in June. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

On top of Comey lying, these members of Congress also point out that there appears to be, quote, material inconsistencies between Comey's congressional briefing on the FBI's relationship with the dossier author, Christopher Steele, and the DOJ documents that were provided to Congress afterwards. Here are the criminal charges that would apply in that case: 18 USC Code 1621, perjury generally, 18 USC 1001. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Instead of sitting down with the liberal media, you know, the dream team of liberals, George Stephanopoulos, Steve Colbert, the ladies of 'The View' and others, Comey probably should be lawyering up. This criminal referral letter is also recommending criminal charges against Hillary Clinton and an investigation. We know she broke the law by using that unsecured private email server and a mom and pop shop bathroom closet, then deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washing them and beating up her devices with the hard drive. These lawmakers today are now demanding an investigation into Clinton for hiding payments to Fusion GPS from the Federal Elections Commission. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, the Clinton campaign and the DNC that Hillary controlled, they funneled over $10 million, $12 million through a law firm, Perkins Coie. And then they paid Fusion GPS, which then hired a foreign national. Remember, foreign nationals are not supposed to influence our elections. Well, that's Christopher Steele. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Christopher Steele then puts together a dossier, full of Russian lies and propaganda that was never verified. Now, third in the congressional criminal referral letter is the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. She has issues tonight. These members of Congress, they want the Department of Justice now to investigate allegations that Loretta Lynch threatened the Uranium One FBI informant with reprisal. Remember, he was on the show. This is the informant went undercover for years and exposed Putin's money laundering, bribery, kickback, extortion, racketeering scheme that was used to get a foothold on America's uranium market. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, he is also mentioned in this criminal referral letter. The recent DOJ I.G. report found that McCabe lied under oath three times about leaking to the news media. Those are serious violations that involve at least three criminal statutes. And, of course, in the letter today, these lawmakers want McCabe investigated. And on top of that, we have the Trump-hating FBI lovebirds, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. They are also being referred for possible criminal charges tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The letter lays out how text messages show that Strzok removed a reference -- remember the Clinton exoneration statement, explaining how she was emailing with President Barack Obama. They withdrew it. They took it out. They wiped it out, which means that Obama knew about the server all along. They changed it to a government official. Sure, that's what we'll call President Obama, a government official. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These lawmakers are also calling for members of the deep state to be investigated to lying to federal judges. We have been talking about this, and one of the biggest revelations in the Stephanopoulos/Comey interview. In other words, the unverified, uncorroborated, Clinton bought and paid for, phony Russian propaganda dossier, they use that in order to get a warrant to spy on an American, a Trump campaign associate in the lead-up to an election. That's lying to a judge. And they never told the judge that they paid for it, either. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These are all major developments tonight. And all these bad actors that we have now been exposing for over a year, unpeeling that onion day by day -- well, now today, criminal referrals have been made to the Department of Justice. Finally, the big question tonight is what will the Attorney General Jeff Sessions do tonight? Will he defend the rule of law, the Constitution? Equal application of the law, equal justice under the law? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That big story, by the way, is only one of our breaking news stories tonight. The House Oversight Committee chairman, Trey Gowdy, he is asking the DOJ and the FBI, and the inspector general to look into issues that were raised by Congressman Mark Meadows in North Carolina about possible DOJ-FBI collusion over James Comey's June 2016 statement, and the larger Clinton email investigation. Congressman Meadows is rightly saying that he has uncovered new emails and text messages that prove this coordination. Unbelievable. We need to get to the bottom of all of this. Finally tonight, the self-righteous James Comey, who never should have written this book, he should have listen to me, his lawyers should have never allowed him to go out on this media blitz tour, which apparently knows no bounds. So, Comey sat down with late-night Trump hater, Stephen Colbert. He had so many hard questions, it was unbelievable. I almost felt bad for him.

And, finally tonight, James Comey, his BFF Andrew McCabe, they appear to be headed for a really ugly breakup. This comes after Comey confirmed today that he kicked off the investigation that led to McCabe being fired. McCabe is now firing back at Comey, and saying that he disclosed to his former boss that he was leaking to the media. The question is that since McCabe could face criminal charges, is he going to flip? Will he cooperate against Comey? Joining us now with a reaction, two of the lawmakers that signed the criminal referral later today, Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida, and Matt Gaetz, thank you both for being with us. Congressman DeSantis, to me, this has been a long time building. This has been a long time coming. So often, we hear the attorney general say there's a process, if I get a referral, I will look into it. They have now not only the referral but the specific laws that you believe and I believe were violated in each case. REP. RON DESANTIS, R—FLORIDA: Well, that's right, Sean. And he has this guy, Huber, who we now know, he's appointed. And I want to make sure that people like Huber know that these are -- this is information that Congress has developed. It's been in the public square, and then to focus on this stuff, because you have situations where Comey, he is out on this book tour acting like his values trump all, but yet he testified in front of the Congress that he didn't exonerate Hillary until after the interview, when we know evidence has come out that he exonerated her two months before with the memo. Then you look at somebody like Andrew McCabe. He rushed into prosecute Michael Flynn. They went in, they interviewed him, and prosecuted him for false statements. McCabe lied to the FBI. It is documented now multiple times. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Is there a different set of rules for McCabe?

Does that apply to General Michael Flynn, who was charged with lying to the FBI? Congressman Gaetz? REP. MATT GAETZ, R—FLORIDA: Sean, if lies were music it, Jim Comey would be Beethoven. But when you lie to Congress, it's a crime. When you leak information that's classified, it's a crime. And when you allow your personal politics to dictate the outcome of an investigation before you're even conducting the investigation in earnest that could be obstruction of justice. And so, in Congress, we did not just want to sit around and hope that Jeff Sessions and others would seriously look into these matters. We wanted to specifically detail the violations of law and then demand action from our attorney general because we cannot allow this to stand.

He is also pushing the dictator to release three American hostages there.

We'll have all of that breaking news tonight. Also, the House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, he wants answers over new evidence of possible DOJ/FBI collusion in the corrupt Clinton email case. That's huge news.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Maybe that will finally put liberal rumors to rest. Also tonight, we have a direct message to all of you the destroy Trump media. We know you're watching. While you have been pushing your crackpot conspiracy theories around the clock, 24/7, over a year, without any proof, on the show, we have been uncovering truth, facts, and actual evidence of what is now the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history. The media has been lying to you and misleading you, the American people, but their time is up. If you remember back in January, when I came back from vacation, I said 2018 would be the year of the boomerang. And that all of these scandals were going to swing back and blow up right in the Democrats and the media's faces, and that is exactly what is happening because there are stunning new developments just a tonight. Congressman Ron DeSantis and 10 other members of Congress, they have sent a criminal referral letter to the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, in the U.S. attorney, John Hoover. And these members are now -- of Congress, they are calling for criminal investigations into the potentially illegal actions of James Comey, of Hillary Clinton, of Loretta Lynch, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and other officials that have ties to the unverified Steele dossier. We've been talking about this. Let's start with James Comey. A quick sidebar before we lay out the case against him. We have been a warning that the self-serving holier-than-thou former FBI director that he has the right to remain silent, but Jim Comey just can't seem to keep his mouth shut. And it's been amazing to me that Comey doesn't have an army of lawyers that have been telling him to keep quiet and not release this book because he is now tonight facing serious legal exposure. Here is what we mean. In his brand-new letter, these 11 members of Congress, they highlight how Comey spent 14 minutes back on July 5th, 2016, laying out the case for criminal prosecution against Hillary Clinton, but then at the very end, he said basically, never mind, and didn't recommend the criminal charges. We talked about equal justice under the law. We cannot have a dual justice system. We have since found out that Comey and Strzok, and their cohorts, they put the fix in to save Hillary Clinton and her campaign by reaching a decision not to prosecute before interviewing Hillary Clinton and 17 other key witnesses. They're all writing that months before they interviewed her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Reaction to this inexcusable absurdity, the letter today writes for this criminal referral",
      "utterance": "'Comey's decision to not seek charges against Clinton's misconduct suggest improper investigative conduct, potentially motivated by a political agenda.' And because of that, these 11 congressmen are now referring the following criminal charges to the Department of Justice, 18 USC 1505, obstruction of proceedings before departments, agencies, and committees. And 18 U.S. Code 1515, definitions for certain provisions, general provision, which appears to be referring to making misleading statements. And there is the issue of Comey's memos. This letter explains that in order for members of Congress to view them, well, they had to go to a secured facility because four of the seven memos were marked classified and at the secret and confidential levels. Well, we also have the issue of Comey and what he did with those memos. Here's what Comey said under oath back in June. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "I asked -- the president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not to tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for our conversation. There might be a tape. And my judgment was I need to get that end into the public square. And so, I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter, didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of the special counsel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Here's the thing, what James Comey just admitted to is leaking classified government information, laws and crimes that apply. Look at this: 18 USC 641, public money, property, or records, this deals with removing those government memos from the FBI. Then there is 18 U.S. Code 793. We have talked about this a lot, gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information. 18 USC 1924, unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents, or material. All of this spells a massive legal trouble tonight for James Comey, but it's just the beginning of Comey's potential criminal misconduct. Comey wrote the Clinton exoneration statement before the investigation. That means before interviewing Hillary and 17 other key witnesses. Well, that's not what Comey testified to under oath. We have the videotape. Take a look. REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, R—TEXAS: Director, did you make the decision not to recommend that charges before or after Hillary Clinton was interviewed by the FBI on July the second?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "After. But if colleagues of ours believe I am lying about when I made this decision, please urge them to contact me privately so that we can have a conversation about this. All I can do is tell you again, the decision was made after that because I didn't know what was going to happen in that interview. She maybe lied during the interview in a way we can prove."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "But he wrote the exoneration in May. They interviewed her in July. On top of Comey lying, these members of Congress also point out that there appears to be, quote, material inconsistencies between Comey's congressional briefing on the FBI's relationship with the dossier author, Christopher Steele, and the DOJ documents that were provided to Congress afterwards."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here are the criminal charges that would apply in that case",
      "utterance": "18 USC Code 1621, perjury generally, 18 USC 1001. Instead of sitting down with the liberal media, you know, the dream team of liberals, George Stephanopoulos, Steve Colbert, the ladies of 'The View' and others, Comey probably should be lawyering up. This criminal referral letter is also recommending criminal charges against Hillary Clinton and an investigation. We know she broke the law by using that unsecured private email server and a mom and pop shop bathroom closet, then deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washing them and beating up her devices with the hard drive. These lawmakers today are now demanding an investigation into Clinton for hiding payments to Fusion GPS from the Federal Elections Commission. Remember, the Clinton campaign and the DNC that Hillary controlled, they funneled over $10 million, $12 million through a law firm, Perkins Coie. And then they paid Fusion GPS, which then hired a foreign national. Remember, foreign nationals are not supposed to influence our elections. Well, that's Christopher Steele. Christopher Steele then puts together a dossier, full of Russian lies and propaganda that was never verified. Now, third in the congressional criminal referral letter is the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. She has issues tonight. These members of Congress, they want the Department of Justice now to investigate allegations that Loretta Lynch threatened the Uranium One FBI informant with reprisal. Remember, he was on the show. This is the informant went undercover for years and exposed Putin's money laundering, bribery, kickback, extortion, racketeering scheme that was used to get a foothold on America's uranium market. Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, he is also mentioned in this criminal referral letter. The recent DOJ I.G. report found that McCabe lied under oath three times about leaking to the news media. Those are serious violations that involve at least three criminal statutes. And, of course, in the letter today, these lawmakers want McCabe investigated. And on top of that, we have the Trump-hating FBI lovebirds, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. They are also being referred for possible criminal charges tonight. The letter lays out how text messages show that Strzok removed a reference -- remember the Clinton exoneration statement, explaining how she was emailing with President Barack Obama. They withdrew it. They took it out. They wiped it out, which means that Obama knew about the server all along. They changed it to a government official. Sure, that's what we'll call President Obama, a government official. These lawmakers are also calling for members of the deep state to be investigated to lying to federal judges. We have been talking about this, and one of the biggest revelations in the Stephanopoulos/Comey interview. In other words, the unverified, uncorroborated, Clinton bought and paid for, phony Russian propaganda dossier, they use that in order to get a warrant to spy on an American, a Trump campaign associate in the lead-up to an election. That's lying to a judge. And they never told the judge that they paid for it, either. These are all major developments tonight. And all these bad actors that we have now been exposing for over a year, unpeeling that onion day by day -- well, now today, criminal referrals have been made to the Department of Justice. Finally, the big question tonight is what will the Attorney General Jeff Sessions do tonight? Will he defend the rule of law, the Constitution? Equal application of the law, equal justice under the law? That big story, by the way, is only one of our breaking news stories tonight. The House Oversight Committee chairman, Trey Gowdy, he is asking the DOJ and the FBI, and the inspector general to look into issues that were raised by Congressman Mark Meadows in North Carolina about possible DOJ-FBI collusion over James Comey's June 2016 statement, and the larger Clinton email investigation. Congressman Meadows is rightly saying that he has uncovered new emails and text messages that prove this coordination. Unbelievable. We need to get to the bottom of all of this. Finally tonight, the self-righteous James Comey, who never should have written this book, he should have listen to me, his lawyers should have never allowed him to go out on this media blitz tour, which apparently knows no bounds. So, Comey sat down with late-night Trump hater, Stephen Colbert. He had so many hard questions, it was unbelievable. I almost felt bad for him. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Great job, Savannah. Great job, Meghan McCain. It's about time members of the media took the kid gloves off and asked some real tough questions. Like we've been saying, Mr. Comey, do you want to sit down for a real interview? I'll give you three hours on my radio show, 575 stations, and a full hour here on the Fox News Channel. And, finally tonight, James Comey, his BFF Andrew McCabe, they appear to be headed for a really ugly breakup. This comes after Comey confirmed today that he kicked off the investigation that led to McCabe being fired. McCabe is now firing back at Comey, and saying that he disclosed to his former boss that he was leaking to the media. The question is that since McCabe could face criminal charges, is he going to flip? Will he cooperate against Comey? Joining us now with a reaction, two of the lawmakers that signed the criminal referral later today, Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida, and Matt Gaetz, thank you both for being with us. Congressman DeSantis, to me, this has been a long time building. This has been a long time coming. So often, we hear the attorney general say there's a process, if I get a referral, I will look into it. They have now not only the referral but the specific laws that you believe and I believe were violated in each case. REP. RON DESANTIS, R—FLORIDA: Well, that's right, Sean. And he has this guy, Huber, who we now know, he's appointed. And I want to make sure that people like Huber know that these are -- this is information that Congress has developed. It's been in the public square, and then to focus on this stuff, because you have situations where Comey, he is out on this book tour acting like his values trump all, but yet he testified in front of the Congress that he didn't exonerate Hillary until after the interview, when we know evidence has come out that he exonerated her two months before with the memo. Then you look at somebody like Andrew McCabe. He rushed into prosecute Michael Flynn. They went in, they interviewed him, and prosecuted him for false statements. McCabe lied to the FBI. It is documented now multiple times. Is there a different set of rules for McCabe? This is all about equal application of the law."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, think about this, I mean, when Meghan McCain actually asked Comey today about, oh, well, I lie, I told some of my lies in the book and you could still lie and be a good person like Andrew McCabe, I'm saying, wait a minute. Does that apply to General Michael Flynn, who was charged with lying to the FBI? Congressman Gaetz? REP. MATT GAETZ, R—FLORIDA: Sean, if lies were music it, Jim Comey would be Beethoven. But when you lie to Congress, it's a crime. When you leak information that's classified, it's a crime. And when you allow your personal politics to dictate the outcome of an investigation before you're even conducting the investigation in earnest that could be obstruction of justice. And so, in Congress, we did not just want to sit around and hope that Jeff Sessions and others would seriously look into these matters. We wanted to specifically detail the violations of law and then demand action from our attorney general because we cannot allow this to stand. The director of the FBI, James Comey, fired, the deputy director, Andrew McCabe, fired."

We're waiting for the inspector general to finish his report on the Clinton email investigation, but here's what we do know -- he doesn't have prosecutorial powers. Now, I understand that the attorney general put this other person in place and supposedly, they can work in conjunction with each other. Is that going to get the job done? Let me -- here are the facts as we know them. Clinton violated 18 USC 793, mishandling classified information, top secret, special access programming information. She deleted 33,000 emails. She acid washed her hard drive with bleach bit, she beat the crap out of her devices or had an aide do it so that there's no record of it. Is that not obstruction of justice? Is that not a violation of law? I mean, it's a simple yes or no here."

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",

Comey says that because Trump supposedly said that Comey, man, I hope you can find it to let Flynn go, that that is a potential obstruction of justice. But yet, when he was FBI director, he didn't pursue any obstruction of justice for the bleach bitting emails that were under congressional subpoena. Those were the critical emails in the Hillary Clinton investigation. And yet, Jim Comey didn't pursue that. So, how could you be so zealous with everyone associated with Trump's campaign, but then bend over backwards, time and time again, to not go after obstruction, or to not go after Hillary?"

He is one of the best lawyers out there. Also with us, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter, she has done no legal work for me ever.

Now, you have two different letters today, identifying different potential crimes he committed. And it's amazing to me that he continues to get on away in his glorious look at me book tour, because he is a potentially incriminating himself. Just look at the first interview. He admitted that politics intruded into his decision-making in the Clinton case. That's potentially obstruction of justice. He can't be much of a lawyer if he keeps yapping away."

Comey is now admitting, Sara, that it could be true, the dossier. Slow down. The Grassley- Graham memo, the Nunes memo, it was the bulk of information to get a warrant to spy on an American who happen to be associated with the Trump campaign in the lead up to an election. They presented that to a judge to get a warrant, and they don't know if it's true, they never verified it, and they never told the judge that Hillary bought and paid for Russian lies for a foreign national.

      "utterance": "Let me tell you why the media are so hysterical, Sean. They, Of course, despise Trump. They dislike Republicans in general. But the reason this is a whole level of hostilities because they know that they were part of why Trump won. They've gave him all the free publicity, having no blooming idea he was going to win. They treated him as a joke, and helped him pick off his rivals, one after the other. They feel guilty. They feel responsible. So, now, they're going after him with a vengeance. That's why the coverage has been so nasty."

Look --they've been wrong on Russia, and now it becomes Stormy Daniels. It's so ridiculous. You can't even make it up. But they have egg on their face because they've lied to the American people. They've hyped and hyperventilated for over a year with nothing."

      "utterance": "Yeah, where does it go? Well, it's sewage. And there's a reason why they are in last place when it comes to the TV ratings, because they are no longer a credible journalism organization. Why do you think they've ratcheted it up with the attacks on you? I love the tape, the montage that you show the other night. Hannity, Hannity, Hannity, Hannity, Hannity. I mean, it sounds like opera, almost, right? And it is Wagnerian if you think about it, what's happening to them. Look, the existence of bias has never been a problem with me. And you, and I, and Larry, have always been very upfront about what our ideological principles and views are, where we stand during election cycle, it is the pretense of objectivity. And that is the problem with CNN. There they are on their high horses, pretending to tell everybody else what qualifies as news and what qualifies as journalism. Journalism is an act. My friend, James O'Keefe, always says it. Our friend, James O'Keefe, always say journalism is an act. It is not an identity. And what threatens the mainstream media the most is that anybody can do it. Citizens can do it, talk show host can do it, ordinary bloggers can do it, and they can do it better than them."

And then when she won, he'll work for her as a press secretary. Did Chuck Todd tell people that he worked for the presidential campaign of Tom Harkin, probably one of the most left-wing guys to ever run for president? Did."

If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting. And will continue what we're doing or whatever it is that we'll continue. But something will happen."

Here with reaction, retired CIA senior intelligence officer, Sonoram Policy Group vice president, Daniel Hoffman. You know, it's pretty amazing that China backed down on intellectual property, on trade tariffs. Everybody said, oh, there's going to be a trade war. The same thing happened in this particular case. Rocket man is now afraid to deal with Donald Trump, even Vladimir Putin. Moscow was -- if the president hit Syria, nothing happens. Peace through strength works. You don't have to bring in cargo planes with $150 billion in cash and beg people to like you."

      "utterance": "Yeah, you know, one of the great stories about this is, if anyone in congress was sitting on the fence, wondering whether they should confirm Director of CIA, Mike Pompeo, as our next secretary of state, they should look at this evidence of diplomatic initiative, and, as you've said, peace through strength. I fondly remember President Reagan's evil empire speech, which is not inconsistent with summit meetings with Soviet leaders to conduct arms control talks. And I think that's what we're doing hear with North Korea. Mike Pompeo, the president consigliere on intelligence, he's deeply respected in the region among our allies. It was an excellent decision to send him to meet with the North Koreans, with Kim Jong-un, and determine the seriousness of the North Koreans in terms of their interest in coming to the negotiation table. As the president said."

I mean, imagine this. We have that opportunity, the president has put out an olive branch to Putin -- you know, why are you hanging out with this dictator, President Assad? And, also, look at the alliance with the Saudis, the Egyptians, the Jordanians, the Israelis, the Emirates now. There's a huge shift going on where, perhaps, a historic world peace can take place."

      "speaker": "HOFFMAN",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And, I will tell you, I'm going to reflect my own background here, but every one of those relationships has a significant intelligence angle to them. And, in order to manage those relationships and the challenges we face, I think it really helps to have someone like Mike Pompeo with his experience leading our diplomatic efforts. I think that shows a great deal of judgment on the part of the president."

His roles in Godfather Part Two, Raging Bull, are some of the more memorable roles he's had in Hollywood. But, unfortunately, in the last few years, well, he started in great movies such as Dirty Grandpa, or Santa, whatever it was, and in comedienne thing. It just seems these days De Niro is very angry and continues to be unhinged, trashing the president every chance he gets. Here's the latest."

According to reports, at the opening of the Tribeca Film Festival this afternoon, he slammed President Trump as a lowlife in chief. I'm sure that so hurts anybody. Anyway, Di Nero needs to focus on acting, maybe not. Maybe -- whatever. All right. Listen, we've got a big show tomorrow night. Hope you'll join us. The great one, Mark Levin, Judge Jeanine Pirro, Kellyanne Conway, Alan Dershowitz, will all be joining us. We will always be fair and balance. We're not the destroy Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham in Washington, tonight."
