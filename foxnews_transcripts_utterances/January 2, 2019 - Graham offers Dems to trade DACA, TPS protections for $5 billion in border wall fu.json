Is it good for you? Is it good for your families? Is it good for we, the people? Now, we plan to expose all the hatred that is out there every day. People that hate our Constitution. People that would shred our bill of rights, First, Second, Fourth Amendments. Along the way, we're going to offer solutions to protect the interests of every American. This is not Republican or Democrat. This is not conservative or liberal.

We have powerful forces and you can see them every day in society that have now aligned to destroy the president that we, the people have elected. It's a clear and present danger to every American, our Constitution and our future. So, we are inviting you in every week night at 9:00. I can assure you and I promise you, there'll be no other show on television like this.

Tonight, we start our \"Hannity Watch\" report on the hateful forces that are determined to destroy Donald Trump and his administration.  Let me be clear. They hate this president. And they also deep down they hate we, the people that voted for him. They can't believe we made that decision. You don't believe me? All right. Just listen to long serving Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson. This just happened yesterday.

Instead, every night on this program, we're going to be exposing them and what is the corrosive politics of division. This is what I call out five major forces of hate. You have the Democratic Party. If Donald Trump cured cancer today and gave every American millions of dollars today, every one, and they still try to destroy this man. As he represents to them the biggest obstacle to them regaining power. Second, perhaps the most obvious haters in America, we have the hate Trump media. It's now on TV every newscast every second of every minute of every hour of every day. A never ending nonstop Trump hate-fest, it's on a loop.  And newspapers in this country, they are actually trying to outdo each other, showing how much they hate Trump the most. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, when is the media ever told you about these things, for example. This is what \"Hannity Watch\" is all about. What about the president's success over the last two years? What about the accomplishments that are scrolling on your screen that we are showing you tonight, night in and night out?  Things they never talk about. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Don't expect the mainstream media to show this report from Real Clear Politics. Look at this, detailing the president's top ten accomplishments of the year. Promises made, promises kept. His successful appointment. He promised a guy like Brett Kavanaugh. Last year, he got it done for the Supreme Court. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Or the squeeze on China for unfair trade practices, intellectually property theft. That's changing. The middle class wage increase, the highest in 12 years. The middle class that the Democrats claim to care about. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The U.S., Mexico, Canada trade deal. Ending the Iranian nuclear deal. All promises, top accomplishments 2018. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When he moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Smashing ISIS. Increasing jobs, the lowest numbers -- unemployment numbers for minorities. Keeping members of the migrant caravan from pouring into the country. And we can't forget, this is my favorite -- America is now the largest oil- producing nation in the world. Not Russia. Not Saudi Arabia, the United States of America. And that doesn't include the pipelines being complete.  That doesn't include ANWR. That's going to be millions of high paying career jobs to our fellow Americans. Now, third, forces of hate, the deep state. We already know Hillary Clinton play multiple felonies. She violated the Espionage Act, with top secret classified information on a private server. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We know she obstructed justice. We know she destroyed subpoenaed emails, erased hard drives, broke up phones and BlackBerrys and iPhones, et cetera, with a hammer. We also know powerful people in the FBI and the DOJ purposely rigged the investigation to give her a pass that nobody else in America would ever get. That is not good for America. That's what we're asking tonight. Is it dangerous? The answer is obvious. Now, all of this allowed Hillary to continue her pursuit of the presidency.  Remember, they thought she should win 100 million to zero and allowed her to funnel money into a law firm. Hire an op research firm, hire a foreign national, use dubious Russian sources, collusion, to create a phony debunked dossier on Donald Trump. Now, that's the collusion I guess they were looking for but don't want to find. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We, of course, have the Russian lies. Never verified. Never corroborated.  Then, disseminated to you, we the people before the 2016 election to influence the outcome of that election in her favor. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And those same Russian lies never verified were then used by top people at our intelligence community in the FBI, in the Justice Department, to get four FISA warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate both before and after the election. All signed off by top officials. Here's a question tonight. Is that good for America or is that dangerous for America when you have fraud perpetrated on FISA court judges repeatedly? No arrests, no report yet, nobody held accountable? The media ignores the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in modern history? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, if this is allowed to continue, the United States of America will become a banana republic. We might as well shred the Constitution because it would be rendered meaningless. The principles of due process, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws, are similarly rendered meaningless. The deep state has been and is out to destroy the president. They hate the president. And they are doing it by any means necessary, obviously, and that's based on what we know today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, of course, item number four. We have weak Republicans. They hate the president. They only care about themselves. They stand for little. They have no courage. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We also have never Trumpers, number five, they hate the president. They just want to say, see, we were right. You were wrong. You nonintellectual, blue collar, hard-working, tax-paying, law abiding Americans. You did you this to us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No, they are trying to undermine a free and fair election. Now, imagine if any American tonight like you Robert Mueller scrubbed the phones of Trump haters and Russian investigators Strzok and Page, clean, wipe them clean. Imagine if like James Comey that you bragged about tricking a 33-year war hero into an FBI interview by bypassing all the normal protocol and procedures that would -- that you would use in past administrations. Imagine the deputy FBI director telling General Flynn he didn't need a lawyer and then charging him for lying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, on this show, moving forward, we are looking to protect you, protect this great country against forces of hate that would shred our Constitution. This will be your show. We will be your watchdog. We plan to expose all of this corruption. All of these lies, all the double standards when we see it. Oh, you mean like hypocrisy when Democrats supported building a wall and don't any longer because Trump wants one? We're going to expose that there really is hit in miracle. Real hate. And that hate is aligns forces are trying to destroy the president. They hate the president and hate us for voting for him. They hate traditional core conservative values that we hold near and dear to our hearts. Now, I'll admit, this one hour news program to be very blunt, this show will be an island unto itself. There will be no other show like it. I promise you. We are dedicated to protecting these deeply held American values, these principles, we are dedicated to telling you the truth about what's really happening in the country. All right. Now we turn our \"Hannity Watch\" on border security tonight.  Look at this. A 5-month-old boy will never see his hero father again.  Newman, California police officer, legal immigrant, Ronil Singh, viciously murdered by illegal immigrant with a very long criminal track record and ties to violent gangs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the county sheriff, Adam Christianson, said that this horrific crime do not have happened -- would have been prevented if not for California's catch and release sanctuary city status. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Over the weekend, a 22-year-old man in Knoxville, Tennessee, killed by suspected illegal immigrant who swerved into oncoming traffic. Just before Christmas, three illegal immigrants were indicted for the murder of a man living in Long Island. So many lives have been senselessly lost at the hands of people who never should have ever been in this country ever on the federal level. Let me say these statistics really slow so even Nancy Pelosi, who doesn't want to fund a wall and protected borders, she can understanding. Since 2014: 51 murder convictions have been handed down to illegal immigrants, 228 federal assault sentences, nearly 20,000 drug trafficking sentences. On the state level, it's even worse. According to the GAO, and their estimates since 1964, 27,300 arrests for murder have been carried out by illegal immigrants. Over 120,000 sex offenses. Nearly 400,000 assault charges. Over 1,000 acts of terror. Here's a tough question. I want people to fully understand this. If people keep getting killed, this 5-month-old boy will never see his father, his father the hero that got killed this weekend, because would have people in custody, we know they are here illegally. They commit other crimes. We don't hand them over to ICE, we won't enforce the law and deport them -- well, is Congress going to pay to raise the children of those killed like in the case of this California officer? Will Congress pay for the children's college education? Will they at least pay for the funeral? Because at some point, they bear some of the burden because these failed government policies are now aiding and abetting criminal activity that otherwise would not happen if we enforce the law, if we protected our borders. And Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats, they are now willing to shut down the government to prevent even a partial funding of a border wall that protects people on both sides. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this wall is designed to give border agents more time to apprehend those that want to cross illegally. I will be the first to concede, probably the vast majority, 99 percent, of people that want to cross into our country, they are looking for better life for themselves, their families, their children and an opportunity that they don't have in their own country. I don't blame them. We have a right to know who is coming into in country. We support legal immigration. On New Year's Eve, you got 150 individuals, there's the video, attempting to break across California's border with Mexico. Again, rocks, other projectiles thrown at border agents. And keep in mind those who successfully cross our border illegally on average, if they get across, criminal justice system, educational system, healthcare system, it's costing we, the taxpayers around $70,000 per person. Even top Democrats a few years ago realize the importance of stemming the tide of illegal immigration. Many of them sounded like Donald Trump. Take a look.",

Thousands of criminals, not just people coming over to seek the American dream like many would have you believe, but people who are actually convicted criminals were stopped, and those are the ones we stopped.

We have a duly elected put of the United States that is just truly hated by very powerful forces. And they have the united goal.  They want to destroy the presidency and this president. It is so bad that the president, the first lady can't even visit our brave troops in Iraq or talk to kids about Santa Claus without what is brutal character assassination, personal attacks, and just pure hatred. This is why we are introducing new segments on this program. We're going to call them \"Hannity Watch\". We're going to have a \"Hannity Watch\" on media bias where we will expose all the hate Trump news coverage. There is going to be a \"Hannity Watch\" on the economy -- things and how they impact your family, your pocketbook. \"Hannity Watch\" on healthcare. What is best for your family? \"Hannity Watch\" on Hollywood, how they have an agenda that is both political and biased and designed to indoctrinate. We'll have a \"Hannity Watch\" on campus where political correctness and indoctrination of our kids has gotten way out of control. We'll have \"Hannity Watch\" on the deep state prediction, huge, stunning news this year that will expose biggest abuse of power, corruption of our own government. We'll have \"Hannity Watch\" on socialism. That means the push to destroy free market capitalism. \"Hannity Watch\" on national security.

And sadly, that's at risk. We have powerful forces and you can see them every day in society that have now aligned to destroy the president that we, the people have elected. It's a clear and present danger to every American, our Constitution and our future. So, we are inviting you in every week night at 9:00. I can assure you and I promise you, there'll be no other show on television like this. And I hope you tell your friends and I hope you'll join us. All right. Tonight, we start our \"Hannity Watch\" report on the hateful forces that are determined to destroy Donald Trump and his administration.  Let me be clear. They hate this president. And they also deep down they hate we, the people that voted for him. They can't believe we made that decision. You don't believe me? All right.

Much like Hitler took over the Nazi Party, Trump has taken over the Republican Party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "These type of ignorant, hate-filled analogies are happening every day. And when they are not comparing us to Nazis, well, remember, we're the smelly Walmart people as FBI agent Peter Strzok called us, or the irredeemable deplorables that Hillary Clinton called us. Or remember when Obama referred to us he's the bitter, angry Americans that actually cling to our god, our guns, our bibles and our religion. Now, many of these forces are forces of hate. We know that many hate the president. They hate we, the people. On this show, we are not going to be hating them back. Instead, every night on this program, we're going to be exposing them and what is the corrosive politics of division. This is what I call out five major forces of hate. You have the Democratic Party. If Donald Trump cured cancer today and gave every American millions of dollars today, every one, and they still try to destroy this man. As he represents to them the biggest obstacle to them regaining power. Second, perhaps the most obvious haters in America, we have the hate Trump media. It's now on TV every newscast every second of every minute of every hour of every day. A never ending nonstop Trump hate-fest, it's on a loop.  And newspapers in this country, they are actually trying to outdo each other, showing how much they hate Trump the most. Now, when is the media ever told you about these things, for example. This is what \"Hannity Watch\" is all about. What about the president's success over the last two years? What about the accomplishments that are scrolling on your screen that we are showing you tonight, night in and night out?  Things they never talk about. Don't expect the mainstream media to show this report from Real Clear Politics. Look at this, detailing the president's top ten accomplishments of the year. Promises made, promises kept. His successful appointment. He promised a guy like Brett Kavanaugh. Last year, he got it done for the Supreme Court. Or the squeeze on China for unfair trade practices, intellectually property theft. That's changing. The middle class wage increase, the highest in 12 years. The middle class that the Democrats claim to care about. The U.S., Mexico, Canada trade deal. Ending the Iranian nuclear deal. All promises, top accomplishments 2018. When he moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Smashing ISIS. Increasing jobs, the lowest numbers -- unemployment numbers for minorities. Keeping members of the migrant caravan from pouring into the country. And we can't forget, this is my favorite -- America is now the largest oil- producing nation in the world. Not Russia. Not Saudi Arabia, the United States of America. And that doesn't include the pipelines being complete.  That doesn't include ANWR. That's going to be millions of high paying career jobs to our fellow Americans. Now, third, forces of hate, the deep state. We already know Hillary Clinton play multiple felonies. She violated the Espionage Act, with top secret classified information on a private server. We know she obstructed justice. We know she destroyed subpoenaed emails, erased hard drives, broke up phones and BlackBerrys and iPhones, et cetera, with a hammer. We also know powerful people in the FBI and the DOJ purposely rigged the investigation to give her a pass that nobody else in America would ever get. That is not good for America. That's what we're asking tonight. Is it dangerous? The answer is obvious. Now, all of this allowed Hillary to continue her pursuit of the presidency.  Remember, they thought she should win 100 million to zero and allowed her to funnel money into a law firm. Hire an op research firm, hire a foreign national, use dubious Russian sources, collusion, to create a phony debunked dossier on Donald Trump. Now, that's the collusion I guess they were looking for but don't want to find. We, of course, have the Russian lies. Never verified. Never corroborated.  Then, disseminated to you, we the people before the 2016 election to influence the outcome of that election in her favor. And those same Russian lies never verified were then used by top people at our intelligence community in the FBI, in the Justice Department, to get four FISA warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate both before and after the election. All signed off by top officials. Here's a question tonight. Is that good for America or is that dangerous for America when you have fraud perpetrated on FISA court judges repeatedly? No arrests, no report yet, nobody held accountable? The media ignores the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in modern history? Now, if this is allowed to continue, the United States of America will become a banana republic. We might as well shred the Constitution because it would be rendered meaningless. The principles of due process, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws, are similarly rendered meaningless. The deep state has been and is out to destroy the president. They hate the president. And they are doing it by any means necessary, obviously, and that's based on what we know today. And, of course, item number four. We have weak Republicans. They hate the president. They only care about themselves. They stand for little. They have no courage. We also have never Trumpers, number five, they hate the president. They just want to say, see, we were right. You were wrong. You nonintellectual, blue collar, hard-working, tax-paying, law abiding Americans. You did you this to us. No, they are trying to undermine a free and fair election. Now, imagine if any American tonight like you Robert Mueller scrubbed the phones of Trump haters and Russian investigators Strzok and Page, clean, wipe them clean. Imagine if like James Comey that you bragged about tricking a 33-year war hero into an FBI interview by bypassing all the normal protocol and procedures that would -- that you would use in past administrations. Imagine the deputy FBI director telling General Flynn he didn't need a lawyer and then charging him for lying. Now, on this show, moving forward, we are looking to protect you, protect this great country against forces of hate that would shred our Constitution. This will be your show. We will be your watchdog. We plan to expose all of this corruption. All of these lies, all the double standards when we see it. Oh, you mean like hypocrisy when Democrats supported building a wall and don't any longer because Trump wants one? We're going to expose that there really is hit in miracle. Real hate. And that hate is aligns forces are trying to destroy the president. They hate the president and hate us for voting for him. They hate traditional core conservative values that we hold near and dear to our hearts. Now, I'll admit, this one hour news program to be very blunt, this show will be an island unto itself. There will be no other show like it. I promise you. We are dedicated to protecting these deeply held American values, these principles, we are dedicated to telling you the truth about what's really happening in the country. All right. Now we turn our \"Hannity Watch\" on border security tonight.  Look at this. A 5-month-old boy will never see his hero father again.  Newman, California police officer, legal immigrant, Ronil Singh, viciously murdered by illegal immigrant with a very long criminal track record and ties to violent gangs. Now, the county sheriff, Adam Christianson, said that this horrific crime do not have happened -- would have been prevented if not for California's catch and release sanctuary city status.

      "utterance": "We're going to show you more of this later in the program tonight. But sadly, what happened in Newman, California, is all too common an occurrence. Over the weekend, a 22-year-old man in Knoxville, Tennessee, killed by suspected illegal immigrant who swerved into oncoming traffic. Just before Christmas, three illegal immigrants were indicted for the murder of a man living in Long Island. So many lives have been senselessly lost at the hands of people who never should have ever been in this country ever on the federal level. Let me say these statistics really slow so even Nancy Pelosi, who doesn't want to fund a wall and protected borders, she can understanding. Since 2014: 51 murder convictions have been handed down to illegal immigrants, 228 federal assault sentences, nearly 20,000 drug trafficking sentences. On the state level, it's even worse. According to the GAO, and their estimates since 1964, 27,300 arrests for murder have been carried out by illegal immigrants. Over 120,000 sex offenses. Nearly 400,000 assault charges. Over 1,000 acts of terror. Here's a tough question. I want people to fully understand this. If people keep getting killed, this 5-month-old boy will never see his father, his father the hero that got killed this weekend, because would have people in custody, we know they are here illegally. They commit other crimes. We don't hand them over to ICE, we won't enforce the law and deport them -- well, is Congress going to pay to raise the children of those killed like in the case of this California officer? Will Congress pay for the children's college education? Will they at least pay for the funeral? Because at some point, they bear some of the burden because these failed government policies are now aiding and abetting criminal activity that otherwise would not happen if we enforce the law, if we protected our borders. And Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats, they are now willing to shut down the government to prevent even a partial funding of a border wall that protects people on both sides. Now, this wall is designed to give border agents more time to apprehend those that want to cross illegally. I will be the first to concede, probably the vast majority, 99 percent, of people that want to cross into our country, they are looking for better life for themselves, their families, their children and an opportunity that they don't have in their own country. I don't blame them. We have a right to know who is coming into in country. We support legal immigration. On New Year's Eve, you got 150 individuals, there's the video, attempting to break across California's border with Mexico. Again, rocks, other projectiles thrown at border agents. And keep in mind those who successfully cross our border illegally on average, if they get across, criminal justice system, educational system, healthcare system, it's costing we, the taxpayers around $70,000 per person. Even top Democrats a few years ago realize the importance of stemming the tide of illegal immigration. Many of them sounded like Donald Trump. Take a look."

I personally would declare this a national security issue. And the commander-in-chief, my vantage point, he could allocate $5 billion from the military budget and get the job done. Government stays shut down, essential services, don't let the media scare you, that continues. Social Security check also go out. The Coast Guard is on duty. Our military branches are on duty and the people will be taken care of. But the cost of unfettered of illegal immigration is too high. The risks are too great. How would you feel new everywhere family member of this young officer with a 5-month-old son killed this weekend? This is an issue literally of life and death. Those drugs, they're headed to small towns and big cities all across America. So, to my weak Republican friends in Washington, hold the line, have a backbone, have a spine, you are there to serve the American people. We must give our border agents the tools they need, including the wall so they can end human trafficking, drug trafficking, violent criminals, each some terrorists or anybody else who plans to break our laws and hurt our fellow American citizens. We support legal immigration. On this program Republican, Democrat, I don't care. We will call you out, especially Republicans who don't hold the line and fund a border wall.  This is worth fighting for.

It's interesting and we go back a couple years ago, all these Democrats supported building wall, now they don't support building a wall.

A lot of these Democrats who -- as Chuck Schumer did back in 2006 voted for a wall, voted for, by the way, $25 billion for the wall. Now, the president is saying we need $5 billion next year and they are opposing it because of Donald Trump. Not because of any policy issues. What do they say to Officer Singh and his family, which a horrible heartbreaking story and unfortunately live it happens over and over every single day at the border? By the way, our Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was getting ready to give a briefing on all of the problems, the crisis at the border, at the beginning of this White House briefing and Pelosi, Schumer, kept interrupting her because they didn't want to hear the numbers. The numbers, Sean, by the way are alarming. You've seen these. Last year alone, over 3,700 known or suspected terrorists were stopped from entering our country. Thousands of criminals, not just people coming over to seek the American dream like many would have you believe, but people who are actually convicted criminals were stopped, and those are the ones we stopped. How many got across where we don't know about, where we don't have walls? And when we have walls, by the way, there's over 90 percent decrease in that kind of criminal activity and illegal crossings. So, this is a national crisis we have. The question is going to be, are they for border security or not, because they can't say they're for border security and then oppose the very things our experts say they need to the secure the border. And that's what this funding battle is all about."

They're not allowed to turn those kind of criminals over when they're released from prison - over to ICE. They're not allowed to share some of that information with our border agents who are tasked with keeping our country safe. And look, a lot of these democrats appear in Congress, they don't even want ICE. Last year alone Sean, our ICE agents, our border agents on the interior of our country stopped and saved over 900 kids from being sexually assaulted and human trafficked. That's going on at our border and they're stopping it, but they're surely not stopping all of it, and so why would they oppose this kind of funding it's because they're not for border security. You can't say you're for border security and then oppose the very things that everybody - all of our experts are saying it's going to take to keep this country safe."

If you set aside for a moment, what we call, political interference, what the sanctuary policies that have been discussed. And you set aside the media's effort to convince people that the Sheriff's wrong. This really wasn't preventable, that we could have reported this individual to ICE. Set that aside for a moment and ask yourself the question, why are we allowing criminal illegal aliens into this country and why is there any political interference in the first place in our ability to protect our communities and to have a communication or at least work with ICE?"
