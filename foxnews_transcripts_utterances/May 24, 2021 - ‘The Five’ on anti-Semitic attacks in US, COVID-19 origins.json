Now that's months before the first official reported case of coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci who has dismissed a lot of theory in the past is now saying this.",

Or the great phrase that is now used all the time, you are a conspiracy theorist. So, this is where stories like the Wuhan lab, the hunter Biden laptop, the crime wave, this is where all the stories go to die under a suffocating pile of media sarcasm, right? And now, right now as we are talking about this make way for the self-edits. They are going to show up an article to make it seem like they didn't really make fun of it. But it just -- I think that you have to remind yourself about a year ago, there are people all over the political map who are open to this idea, right? But it was one of many ideas. Yet the media acted as the narrative gatekeeper which it always does. And they get to label the dangerous ideas first and they go after you if you violate the norm. If you look closely, you will see how the interest of China often coincide with the media's deliberate avoidance of stories that harm China whether it is the Uyghurs, whether it's the NBA, whether it's the lab incompetence. So, you have to get to the bigger question, what is the incentive for China to cooperate over this problem when you still have Disney and you still have Apple and you still have the NBA working with China as they employ slave labor. I mean, why would China care about our moral outrage when we are still doing work with them while they use slaves? I mean, they are like -- they are like -- seriously, a legitimate question, what are you going to do about it? Nothing, so we will continue on with this, we're not going to cooperate. There is no reason, and also, we only have ourselves to blame in chasing the impeachment while this thing just exploded all over the place.",

So this feels pretty good, I do have to say that the real conspiracy was the effort to smear people looking for the truth as conspiracy theorist, co-conspirators, obviously the Democrats, they can only have one villain in this plot and that's Trump, it's too confusing to have China as another bad guy, you had to divide the country in an election year, couldn't have the country united against China. Greg mentioned corporate media, heavily invested in China, didn't want to rock the vote there. Obviously, China is not going to own up to this, and then even these scientists funded by Fauci involved in these labs, came out early and said no, no, no, look the other way, and the media followed. Even scientists not involved didn't say anything because it would jeopardize grants through the NIH. I remember you put up those full screens, was it six months ago? If you went near the story fact-checkers from an army of outlets descended upon you and you were basically called a pandemic birther in order to scare the be Jesus out of anybody that follow down that path. But the cover-up started to crack recently. Conservatives online followed the money, followed where the grants went, even found the language in the grant proposals talking about gain of function research at the labs. Scientists started to speak up, even Biden's national security council said you know what, we are not really buying what China is selling. And then that WHO delegation that was a complete disaster. They go over there, and they didn't present a shred of evidence for the natural theory. Not a shred of evidence while there is a mountain of evidence on the other side saying it came from the lab. I'm not going to bore you with that. I bore the audience on my weekend show enough, but I know what the Democrats are going to say. They are going to say, why does it matter where it came from? Well, that's all that matters, because if you want to prevent the next pandemic you have to figure out the origin in order to save millions of lives. That's the point.",

I think that's why, you know, everybody is talking in terms of clapping themselves on the back and saying, my conspiracy theory turns out to be right, but I think that this is something everybody wants. I don't -- I don't think it matters. The difference at the moment is that you have now intelligence about those three people who went to the hospital with COVID-like symptoms as reported by the Wall Street Journal. You have experts in that article, Dana, on both sides saying yes, they could have had a cold, they could have the flu, but they could also have had coronavirus. So now, there is a line to be followed and I'd love to see an investigation, I'd love to know the origins of this thing, I think that's just what everybody would want. But I got to say in all honesty, we are dealing with China. And I think the Chinese are an authoritarian society. I think that anybody who tells the truth about something this big is at risk of death from government officials, everybody is in fear of those government officials and they, you know, I mean, we know what they've done with the Uyghurs and others, we know what's going on in Hong Kong. This is a very cruel regime and they don't want anything about it.

It says they were either very ignorant about the way that the Chinese Communist Party operates or they were complicit. Immediately when we started hearing about this virus coming out of Wuhan I immediately thought, obviously there is a chance that this could come from a lab because it's China. And then you had all of this cover-up going on. I mean, Taiwan which is an ally of the United States told the World Health Organization in December 2019 that they knew this was something that could be contagious human to human. And then the World Health Organization which is beholden to China ignored that, covered it up and continued to say to the rest of the world while travel was still going on internationally that this was not a virus that could be contagious from person to person. And it is about following the money, because when you look at the lab and you look at the kind of research that they were doing, you know, it was very clear and obvious by the way that everybody in the media for the most part, not everyone, but most people except for the journalist who got kicked out of China, remember that happened --",

That's not anti-Semitic to say I differ with Israel's policies. You have debate among Jewish people including Bernie Sanders about what Israel is doing and how it conducts its policies. You have, you know, AIPAC versus J. Street (Ph) in terms of the Jewish American community taking different positions, so there's nothing anti-Semitic about criticizing Israel. I think that the larger issue here is where do we go as an American people with regards to this violence that we've seen in the streets. It's reprehensible. It is to be condemned by every side. I don't care if it's anti-Sematic violence against Jewish people, I don't care if it's anti-Muslim violence, I don't care if it's anti-white, anti- black or, you know, those people who want to say Chinese people brought COVID here and they are attacking the Asians in larger numbers. All of it tears at us as Americans and I think we all need to stand together in opposition to that kind of behavior. I will just weigh on one last thing about Israel, though. I think there's a generational divide you can start to see it now on the poll numbers about Israel that didn't exist previously. Everybody just, you know, wanted to support Israel they were so vulnerable.

Why is there a rise in anti-Asian attacks, a dramatic rise? It's because all violent crime is up, right? All violent crime is up across the board. We talk about this months ago. It was left off, but you cannot tease out specific hate crimes as something reprehensible without first condemning all of it as a group. So, this is all due to a reduction of policing, the lack of accountability. When you see repeat felons that keep getting out, no bail, it sends a message that when you get arrested, you're going to be out on the street before the cop is done doing his paperwork. That is a fact. Some people are more important to your question, Jesse, some people are more important to the media than others, which is why the media and the Democrats respond inconsistently to violence even when it's well-documented with words, pictures, and statistics. I don't know why it's so hard to maintain a consistent disavowal of all violence from the riots and the lootings to the police to the January 6th, to the gang crimes to the attacks on Asians, to the mentally ill attacking people on the street in New York City. If we were actually consistent about this, none of this stuff would ever happen and what you would to do is have a very strong support of law enforcement that would keep this from happening, because that's the incentive that one needs.",

Now in the process, they have killed Israeli Arabs. They have killed Palestinians. Four hundred of their own rockets misfired and killed Palestinians in Gaza civilians. You had one of the leaders of Hamas on Sky News admitting that they deliberately fire rockets from civilian areas in Gaza at civilian targets in Israel so that when Israel retaliates, they kill civilians, so then they are used for propaganda. And so when you see this overflow into the United States with pro- Palestinian Hamas supporting people attacking Jews in the streets and they know, to Greg's point, that they are not going to get arrested or if they do, they'll get out of jail really quickly and then come out and say as that guy did yesterday, I would do it again after beating a Jewish man in the street.

I had the joy of being in his class as a student in high school where I did many projects that are very embarrassing now. As a little girl, he sat me courtside while he coached basketball. He celebrated my diploma when I was in kindergarten, and many years later handed me my high school diploma. He's had an amazing ride and has made a difference in countless numbers of students' lives. And this was always the first to volunteer his cooking skills, his outdoor cooking skills, for science camping trips (AUDIO GAP) at Spring for faculty cookouts. And I'll admit, he once kicked me out of his class for violating the school dress code. But he also once gave me cover after planning the senior prank.

And it said anybody who brought up this, and not as a primary cause, but just one of many options, you are either -- you are either called a racist or xenophobic, right? Or the great phrase that is now used all the time, you are a conspiracy theorist. So, this is where stories like the Wuhan lab, the hunter Biden laptop, the crime wave, this is where all the stories go to die under a suffocating pile of media sarcasm, right? And now, right now as we are talking about this make way for the self-edits. They are going to show up an article to make it seem like they didn't really make fun of it. But it just -- I think that you have to remind yourself about a year ago, there are people all over the political map who are open to this idea, right? But it was one of many ideas. Yet the media acted as the narrative gatekeeper which it always does. And they get to label the dangerous ideas first and they go after you if you violate the norm. If you look closely, you will see how the interest of China often coincide with the media's deliberate avoidance of stories that harm China whether it is the Uyghurs, whether it's the NBA, whether it's the lab incompetence. So, you have to get to the bigger question, what is the incentive for China to cooperate over this problem when you still have Disney and you still have Apple and you still have the NBA working with China as they employ slave labor. I mean, why would China care about our moral outrage when we are still doing work with them while they use slaves? I mean, they are like -- they are like -- seriously, a legitimate question, what are you going to do about it? Nothing, so we will continue on with this, we're not going to cooperate. There is no reason, and also, we only have ourselves to blame in chasing the impeachment while this thing just exploded all over the place."

      "utterance": "Well, I'm not always on the winning side of a conspiracy theory debate, Dana. So this feels pretty good, I do have to say that the real conspiracy was the effort to smear people looking for the truth as conspiracy theorist, co-conspirators, obviously the Democrats, they can only have one villain in this plot and that's Trump, it's too confusing to have China as another bad guy, you had to divide the country in an election year, couldn't have the country united against China. Greg mentioned corporate media, heavily invested in China, didn't want to rock the vote there. Obviously, China is not going to own up to this, and then even these scientists funded by Fauci involved in these labs, came out early and said no, no, no, look the other way, and the media followed. Even scientists not involved didn't say anything because it would jeopardize grants through the NIH. I remember you put up those full screens, was it six months ago? If you went near the story fact-checkers from an army of outlets descended upon you and you were basically called a pandemic birther in order to scare the be Jesus out of anybody that follow down that path. But the cover-up started to crack recently. Conservatives online followed the money, followed where the grants went, even found the language in the grant proposals talking about gain of function research at the labs. Scientists started to speak up, even Biden's national security council said you know what, we are not really buying what China is selling. And then that WHO delegation that was a complete disaster. They go over there, and they didn't present a shred of evidence for the natural theory. Not a shred of evidence while there is a mountain of evidence on the other side saying it came from the lab. I'm not going to bore you with that. I bore the audience on my weekend show enough, but I know what the Democrats are going to say. They are going to say, why does it matter where it came from? Well, that's all that matters, because if you want to prevent the next pandemic you have to figure out the origin in order to save millions of lives. That's the point."

What's the next step do you think from the Biden administration on this? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that they want an answer. I think that's why, you know, everybody is talking in terms of clapping themselves on the back and saying, my conspiracy theory turns out to be right, but I think that this is something everybody wants. I don't -- I don't think it matters. The difference at the moment is that you have now intelligence about those three people who went to the hospital with COVID-like symptoms as reported by the Wall Street Journal. You have experts in that article, Dana, on both sides saying yes, they could have had a cold, they could have the flu, but they could also have had coronavirus. So now, there is a line to be followed and I'd love to see an investigation, I'd love to know the origins of this thing, I think that's just what everybody would want. But I got to say in all honesty, we are dealing with China. And I think the Chinese are an authoritarian society. I think that anybody who tells the truth about something this big is at risk of death from government officials, everybody is in fear of those government officials and they, you know, I mean, we know what they've done with the Uyghurs and others, we know what's going on in Hong Kong. This is a very cruel regime and they don't want anything about it. Now I know that the critics are going to say, well, you know, here in this country, there are certain things that we don't want to investigate either. You know, January 6th --"

I mean, Taiwan which is an ally of the United States told the World Health Organization in December 2019 that they knew this was something that could be contagious human to human. And then the World Health Organization which is beholden to China ignored that, covered it up and continued to say to the rest of the world while travel was still going on internationally that this was not a virus that could be contagious from person to person. And it is about following the money, because when you look at the lab and you look at the kind of research that they were doing, you know, it was very clear and obvious by the way that everybody in the media for the most part, not everyone, but most people except for the journalist who got kicked out of China, remember that happened --"

And you have to ask why. I don't think it's because China really just want to research viruses and to see what's happening in nature, I think there is a much sinister ploy there and we'll have to wait for more information on that."

      "utterance": "I don't think that they are intending to cause violence against civilians, but I think that's the argument, Jesse. I mean, to my mind, you know, we have to be very clear here and not confuse anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism or debate about Israeli policies. That's a separate issue. That's not anti-Semitic to say I differ with Israel's policies. You have debate among Jewish people including Bernie Sanders about what Israel is doing and how it conducts its policies. You have, you know, AIPAC versus J. Street (Ph) in terms of the Jewish American community taking different positions, so there's nothing anti-Semitic about criticizing Israel. I think that the larger issue here is where do we go as an American people with regards to this violence that we've seen in the streets. It's reprehensible. It is to be condemned by every side. I don't care if it's anti-Sematic violence against Jewish people, I don't care if it's anti-Muslim violence, I don't care if it's anti-white, anti- black or, you know, those people who want to say Chinese people brought COVID here and they are attacking the Asians in larger numbers. All of it tears at us as Americans and I think we all need to stand together in opposition to that kind of behavior. I will just weigh on one last thing about Israel, though. I think there's a generational divide you can start to see it now on the poll numbers about Israel that didn't exist previously. Everybody just, you know, wanted to support Israel they were so vulnerable. I think Israel and president -- Prime Minister Netanyahu better be aware of the fact that there are more and more Americans who are critical of Israeli policy."

Why is there a rise in anti-Asian attacks, a dramatic rise? It's because all violent crime is up, right? All violent crime is up across the board. We talk about this months ago. It was left off, but you cannot tease out specific hate crimes as something reprehensible without first condemning all of it as a group. So, this is all due to a reduction of policing, the lack of accountability. When you see repeat felons that keep getting out, no bail, it sends a message that when you get arrested, you're going to be out on the street before the cop is done doing his paperwork. That is a fact. Some people are more important to your question, Jesse, some people are more important to the media than others, which is why the media and the Democrats respond inconsistently to violence even when it's well-documented with words, pictures, and statistics. I don't know why it's so hard to maintain a consistent disavowal of all violence from the riots and the lootings to the police to the January 6th, to the gang crimes to the attacks on Asians, to the mentally ill attacking people on the street in New York City. If we were actually consistent about this, none of this stuff would ever happen and what you would to do is have a very strong support of law enforcement that would keep this from happening, because that's the incentive that one needs."

Now in the process, they have killed Israeli Arabs. They have killed Palestinians. Four hundred of their own rockets misfired and killed Palestinians in Gaza civilians. You had one of the leaders of Hamas on Sky News admitting that they deliberately fire rockets from civilian areas in Gaza at civilian targets in Israel so that when Israel retaliates, they kill civilians, so then they are used for propaganda. And so when you see this overflow into the United States with pro- Palestinian Hamas supporting people attacking Jews in the streets and they know, to Greg's point, that they are not going to get arrested or if they do, they'll get out of jail really quickly and then come out and say as that guy did yesterday, I would do it again after beating a Jewish man in the street. They know that they can get away with it just like Hamas knows that they can get away with attacking Israel because the international community is going to say, how dare you be violent against Hamas when really, they are just defending themselves. This is not an equal playing field when it comes to exchanging violence."

The last thing I'd point out is that it's very important that we all remember the struggles we have in this country are not a mirror image of every place that we look. And the issues, and Katie knows them very well, when you can understand what's going on between the Israelis and the Palestinian authority and all of that, is just it's much more nuance and complicated. It's much more difficult, it's not just a black and white issue, and so we have to be more thoughtful about how we talk about it.

But in terms of the policy, it is as Dana just laid it out to you when they catch people, especially men, but, you know, anybody, but children, they are thrown out. And so that's what we mean when we say the border is closed. I will say this. To my mind, the real Fox exclusive last week was George W. Bush, who has a book out now about immigration saying the problem is the Congress' failure to act. He tried to get something done when he was president, a group of Republicans tried to work with Democrats in 2013 to get something done, then it was a Republican House that stopped it.

They're realizing that their second 100 days will be much tougher than the first 100, and that this idea of student loan forgiveness is a no-go when it comes to Congress.

It might even be roughly the same as your internet cable smartphone bill. So, I don't think people are having -- you can't compare it to something like rent. Why can't, and I've said this before, a sheetmetal worker who didn't go to college claimed that he wants his car payment canceled because it's roughly the same cost and his truck is contributing more to society than an art history degree by far. So, why are these people so special that they can get their stupid college, you know, get it off -- no, that guy with a truck, he deserves it too. Then you get to that point of like, OK, then what other loans can you cancel? How do you exactly cancel them? Who pays for them? You think the bank is going to pay for them? Hell, no.

So, what we've got now is that this is not in a presidential budget proposal. But remember, the power of the purse is with the Congress. So, if the Congress wants to pass legislation that contains this $10,000 loan forgiveness, then-President Biden has basically said he's willing to sign it if it's in legislation that comes from the Congress. So, Congress has that right. But I think that the larger point here is that Biden has other priorities, which is the infrastructure deal, the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit for the working people.

So, I just want to tell the audience something. There could still be some very dangerous variants out there. I think everybody needs to be careful. All that stuff I said about COVID dying in the sunlight, what do I know? I'm not a scientist. I think you should trust your gut. If you want to hide in your basement, not a bad idea at least for the rest of the summer. I mean, traffic was a killer."

You know, I was going down Seventh Avenue after work and people were out partying. They were just thousands of people on every corner drinking. Everybody looked great. It was hot. It was like 85 degrees like around 6:00, 7:30 on Thursday night. It was just amazing. It felt like the war was over and people were celebrating except there are people that aren't there to celebrate it with you. And I think that that's an important thing to work. You know, I was looking at I'm thinking about my wife who's with her mother right now who's a widow and they're trying to look for a place to live. And I'm thinking there's a lot of people like that out there right now who are looking -- and this reopening has a sweet feeling to it. You got through it, but not everybody got through it."

Well, this weekend, my son Rafi began teaching the family how to properly raise and shaped bonsai. Here he is teaching my grandson Eli and me how to properly grow bonsai. Here he is tutoring his mom. He also taught brother- in-law Patrick. And here's Eli showing off his beautiful bonsai at the end of that tutoring session. So, with May flowers blossoming all around this time of year, it was a pleasure to see the love of gardening blossoming in my own family. My first job, you guys should know, was as a gardener at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, so it gave me a special pleasure."

And these are all the pages she thought were important for her daughter to read. So, I sign that for Abigail and good luck to you. And Congratulations, Class of 2021. Greg."

This hasn't yet been picked up by Fox Nation, but it's part one of an endless investigation into whether cats are out to destroy you. Let's take our first example right here. I believe this cat -- can you see it? This cat is indeed out to destroy you. If you just stare at the cat, you could tell he has one primary motivation, and that is to end your existence. Now, you need to send all your cat videos showing cats trying to destroy your life to me, care of Jesse Watters work e-mail. So, you just send it to the Fox e-mail Jesse Watters and he'll get them to me. But please send them all and it will start the long investigation."

He's impacted the lives of thousands of students, some going on to become Rhodes Scholars. And of course, he had a major impact on my education. I had the joy of being in his class as a student in high school where I did many projects that are very embarrassing now. As a little girl, he sat me courtside while he coached basketball. He celebrated my diploma when I was in kindergarten, and many years later handed me my high school diploma. He's had an amazing ride and has made a difference in countless numbers of students' lives. And this was always the first to volunteer his cooking skills, his outdoor cooking skills, for science camping trips (AUDIO GAP) at Spring for faculty cookouts. And I'll admit, he once kicked me out of his class for violating the school dress code. But he also once gave me cover after planning the senior prank. So, congratulations on four amazing decades, dad. And as he taught me in Spanish class, Gracias and Buenas Suerte."
