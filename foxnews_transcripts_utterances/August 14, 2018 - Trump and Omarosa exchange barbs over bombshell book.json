She said she quit. And then hours after she's fired, she comes up with this tape where the president allegedly uses a racial slur. Out of the blue, the same day she was fired, she starts talking about the tapes that someone played her. When they asked the person who allegedly played the tape, he says I don't have the tape. I've never even heard about the tape. Then she says, oh, Frank Luntz has heard the tapes. Frank Luntz comes out says, I don't know what you're talking about, Omarosa. I've never heard a tape. So, she has zero credibility at this point. Trump says he doesn't -- didn't say it. At this point, you have to take him at his word. Mark Burnett, the producer for The Apprentice allegedly told the president that there are no tapes that exist of him saying this word. Her history in the White House has been riddled with poor performance. Al Gore's office fired her for -- I think she was in charge of correspondence, and it turns out they found like 80,000 letters under her desk that she never even sent back. And then they transferred over to the Clinton team and commerce secretary office, and they had to get rid of her because she was an absolute personnel disaster. This is not a racial thing to call someone a dog. The list goes on and on. He's called Glenn Beck a dog. Ted Cruz, David Gregory, Ariana Huffington. And I think Sarah Sanders said the right thing today when she was confronted about the racial issue. She said, in one and a half years, Donald Trump has created 700,000 jobs for African-Americans in this country. And in eight years, President Barack Obama had only created $195,000.

She doesn't have to be doing all these interviews. There will be plenty of time for her to be the champion of the Democratic Party, if that's what they choose to do. What I would love to see is -- I think it would be very instructive, actually, not to have a debate with her but to have a debate about socialism versus capitalism. We talked about this on the show yesterday. But to have it done by a group like Intelligence Squared, that's an organization that puts on these great debates where the audience gets to vote right beforehand. Do you think socialism is better than capitalism? Vote now. And then you have the debate, and then you vote afterwards to see if you were persuaded in any way.

The Trump campaign filing an arbitration action against the former White House aide alleging breach of a nondisclosure agreement. The president also taking aim at Omarosa on twitter writing, when you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out.

This has absolutely nothing to do with race and everything to do with the president calling out someone's lack of integrity. The idea that you would only point a few of the things that the president has said negative about people that are minorities, the fact is the president is an equal opportunity person that calls things like he sees it.

Tweet number two, Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog and will do it again. Just watch. He can do much better. And tweet number three, little at MacMiller, I'm now going to teach you a big boy lessons about lawsuits and finance, you ungrateful dog. But then to advance the story just a little bit because this is what everyone is talking about, Omarosa makes a claim that the president was on tape saying the N-word.

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the media and Omarosa are perfect for each other. They both have very little credibility. They're both flip floppers. And they both hate President Trump. I don't trust anything she says. She's a serial fabricator. She should never have been hired for a job at the White House. She belongs in reality TV as a villain. He should never have hired the villain because, obviously, she's a huge backstabber. Hours after she was fired, she gets on the phone and starts lying to her friends and former colleagues about why she was fired. She said she quit. And then hours after she's fired, she comes up with this tape where the president allegedly uses a racial slur. Out of the blue, the same day she was fired, she starts talking about the tapes that someone played her. When they asked the person who allegedly played the tape, he says I don't have the tape. I've never even heard about the tape. Then she says, oh, Frank Luntz has heard the tapes. Frank Luntz comes out says, I don't know what you're talking about, Omarosa. I've never heard a tape. So, she has zero credibility at this point. Trump says he doesn't -- didn't say it. At this point, you have to take him at his word. Mark Burnett, the producer for The Apprentice allegedly told the president that there are no tapes that exist of him saying this word. Her history in the White House has been riddled with poor performance. Al Gore's office fired her for -- I think she was in charge of correspondence, and it turns out they found like 80,000 letters under her desk that she never even sent back. And then they transferred over to the Clinton team and commerce secretary office, and they had to get rid of her because she was an absolute personnel disaster. This is not a racial thing to call someone a dog. The list goes on and on. He's called Glenn Beck a dog. Ted Cruz, David Gregory, Ariana Huffington. And I think Sarah Sanders said the right thing today when she was confronted about the racial issue. She said, in one and a half years, Donald Trump has created 700,000 jobs for African-Americans in this country. And in eight years, President Barack Obama had only created $195,000. I just let that speak for itself."

      "utterance": "Well, I just think that's pretty ridiculous. I mean, the fact is that what you see here is an economy that's been recovering. It's been steady recovering. Black community still has twice the unemployment of the white community. Is he taken any steps to deal with that? Let's get to the dog thing because I think this kind of top of the news today. This is so deeply offensive. I mean, it's one thing he's calling LeBron dumb. He goes after Don Lemon, is dumb. He goes after black women. I can think of Federico Wilson, Maxine Waters, Susan Rice, Donna Brazile, and now this thing. I just thought -- I don't care of you race, but I just think to call a woman a dog in this way was so demeaning, so beneath the office of the presidency. I worry about just our kids. I mean, that you have to say, oh, that's the president. That's the way he talks about a woman that he disagrees with. On some level, I wonder why is he engaging? Why would the president engage with this person? But then you realize, oh, in some of these tapes, like, we thought these stuff about being fired in the White House situation room by John Kelly, who's going to believe that? But here comes the tape. Then, with regard to the N-word, here comes, she says, people say, oh, no such tape. Then Katrina Pierson and others who were Trump aides say we never had such a conversation with Omarosa. Omarosa produces a tape. I'm thinking, wow. So maybe there's something to it. You say she has no credibility. I would agree with you. I would have agreed with you a long time ago, Jesse. But she keeps producing tapes that, in fact, back up her story"

And they always find a way to get in there, especially to the most powerful person who can usurp any of their enemies around them and right the wrongs that have been done before them. And so, the president, obviously, is a loyal person. Look at some of the people that he's had on his campaign staff, and some of the people that he's hired in the White House, somewhat questionable, not all of them. Some of them are very good hires. But, however, here, because it was only loyalty, that was the only connection that they've had because, you know, no one really knows what her area of expertise is. You know, we were all sitting around here before the show trying to figure out exactly what she did, regardless of her title. And when someone who is loyal feels betrayed, that's when you see the kind of reactions that the president is displaying. I do think it's a distraction. I think the story would go away. And I think he would actually come off more sympathetic if he didn't engage her to this level. But he feels like he has to push some of these fused to this level. And I think you'll see in the future instead of background checks in the White House they're going to give psych tests."

When it comes to Omarosa, one, I would point out, she proved me right, she is a unifier. She brought me and Brian Steller from CNN. You know he used my quote on the show on his thing. So she -- wow, oil and water. She brought us together. But here's the thing about her, she is a bad human being. Her race and gender is irrelevant. She's manipulative, evil, mean person. The things that she says -- and let's just say will give it to her. Let's say our president is mildly racist, and when he gets mad, he says stereotypical things. You, who claim to be the African- American watchdog for us in the White House, not only sites go down, you did nothing about it, and you profited from it. And it wasn't until your poor work got you fired. These our problems you try to profit again. She's not a dog. She's not any -- she's a palm, and that's way worse than anything else."

I do want to ask you this, Jesse, there is something to be said about starving a story, right? Like ignore her. Consider her irrelevant. Just move on. And talk about all the good things going on. But, that the president -- one, he probably -- it's not in his nature to do that. He likes to counterpunch.

There's great things happening in North Korea with the remains coming back from our soldiers. And all we're talking about is this hysterical woman who's humiliated herself in front of our eyes.

It's not -- I know we hear the term witch hunt a lot, but I really believe that based on the investigation that's going to come out that there was a lot of -- and this is -- Omarosa is an example of that, that the president made some bad choices in terms of who was in his campaign, and they took advantage of his inexperience and not knowing who to trust him, who not to trust. They tried to make money. They probably didn't think he was really going to win. And they did all kinds of things behind the back door to be number one. So, I'm looking forward to Mueller to come out and say this happened, this happened, the people who did wrong are indicted, they're in court, and things are looking more like going toward stone than going towards Trumpsville. So, I can't wait for it."

If they drag this on and this, all of a sudden, we're getting into late September, and then we get into early October, and they still have not concluded this investigation, doesn't the president -- can he say, listen, you guys are now involving yourselves in electoral politics.

If so, why the artificial deadline? If not, why was that the name? What he was basically saying is that putting an artificial deadline on an instigation is a bad idea. And so, you've never heard Mueller come out and say, I'm going to get this done by September 1st. You hear Rudy Giuliani say that. You've heard rumors about it. And even if they like to get it done -- do I think that Robert Mueller would love to drag this out because he's enjoying it so much, I doubt that. I also think that in the CNN poll, not only do people think it should wrap up, I agree with that, but they also said -- 63 percent said they would -- that the investigation has some importance on their vote in the midterm. That doesn't mean that it's bad for President Trump. It might mean that for Republicans are thinking, hmm, we better get out there and make sure that the Democrats don't take over and drag this out even further.

Meanwhile, terror fears gripping the United Kingdom once again, this time after a car plowed through a crowd outside parliament in London. It injured a number of pedestrians. Police are treating the incident as a terror attack after arresting a male suspect. The president reacting on twitter saying, quote, another terrorist attack in London, these animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength.

And, you know, how to dehumanize groups of people. And I think we have to do a better job as a society. You know, not only as politicians but also as parents and as citizens. How do we learn to value life a little bit more? And how do we extend that?

And now we have a similar situation where people were abusing children, training them in firearms and to shoot up schools and to shoot up law enforcement. There was allegedly a dead body of a child found on the premises. It was buried. Some of the children at the compound -- it was a cult compound, in my opinion. They were using the child's death as a way to say when the child is resurrected, he's going to come back as Jesus and then instruct these kids on how to maim and injure other children at schools. So it was another individual who was the leader, apparently, was related to the guy involved in the '93 bombing at the World Trade Center. So to go out, and the judge says she didn't see a reason presented by prosecutors to think that these people would cause additional harm to the community. And I just think that's just so erroneous and such a misguided understanding of what these people are capable of. I don't know how she can sleep at night. I really hope nothing else happens here."

When I think back to what Dan Coats said, I think it was at the beginning of this month or the end of July, in testimony in front of the Congress in which he said it feels like right before 9/11, right, that like that -- that period where you know that there's some chatter out there. You're not exactly sure how to connect the dots.

I never really have the time for days off, because I'm always too busy working. But it doesn't matter, because it turns out even when you're on vacation, you still aren't relaxing.

And if I'm on an island, I can't help you anyway, because I'm on an island. So I leave my phone in the hotel room. But we're all workaholics. We wouldn't be here if we didn't work hard."

And today, I'm happy to share the successful dinner. Their Garfield arrived Saturday night, and he hid under the couch for a little bit, but then he had a good time playing with 4-year-old Madison and 2-year-old Harper. They had a Wonderful lasagna dinner, with Madison and Harper having actual lasagna. Garfield ate cat lasagna that they made, which was a mix of dry and wet cat food. Clara said it's a special day for the girls, that she and her husband tried to do nice feats like this for their girls. Very cute."

She has been visited by the likes of Stevie Wonder and Jesse Jackson. But this woman has such an incredibly powerful voice. She has sung at the inauguration of four different presidents. She has won 18 Grammys including ten for best R&B vocal performance. Her voice, her pitch, her power all on display throughout her beautiful life.
