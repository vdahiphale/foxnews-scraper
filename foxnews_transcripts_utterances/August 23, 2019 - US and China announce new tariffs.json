I think they are worried this trade war. I think that's what CEOs, they don't know whether they can invest, they don't know whether they can hire, they want certainty. One day the president comes out and says we need to cut the payroll tax, we need to index capital gains, the next day he walks it back. That is the last thing the markets want to hear.

So when Americans understand that, and then when China tries to bully us, that only strengthens our resolve. The negotiations will continue behind closed doors. We are going to resume those talks in September."

      "utterance": "I am very concerned about this trade war. It's certainly hurting our economy. The way the president's handling these trade negotiations is not in our economic interests. It's clear that China has violated trade rules, but the United States has isolated ourselves with our traditional trading partners."

      "speaker": "BRET BAIER, HOST",
      "utterance": "This is a big back-and-forth day. The Chinese announced $75 billion of additional tariffs. The Dow took a major hit when the president responded to that on Twitter, and a series of tweets after that. And then late in the day, the president said he, in fact, was going to increase the tariffs on the Chinese on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. Let's bring in our panel, we'll star there, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. There's a lot of just volatility, there's a lot of uncertainty, and the markets don't like that. JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Exactly. And neither do CEOs of companies. They want stability. And they are not really worried about monetary policy, Bret. I don't think they are worried about another basis point on the interest rates. I think they are worried this trade war. I think that's what CEOs, they don't know whether they can invest, they don't know whether they can hire, they want certainty. One day the president comes out and says we need to cut the payroll tax, we need to index capital gains, the next day he walks it back. That is the last thing the markets want to hear. That's uncertainty to them, and I think it's hurting."

It was a speech by the Federal Reserve chair out of Jackson Hole, but, \"It is incredible they can \"speak\" without knowing or asking what I'm doing, which will be announced shortly. We have a very strong dollar, a very weak Fed to. I will work \"brilliantly\" with both and the U.S. will do great. My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\" Here is the president just a couple weeks."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "He's talked about it for a long time, but he's a good friend or is he an enemy? SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": I think you can justify calling the president of China an enemy, and we are in an economic competition with them, the two biggest economies. Hard for me to understand why you call the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who, by the way, you appointed to the job as an enemy and liking him to the president of China. And maybe I'm easily shocked. I did find that shocking today."

There's feeling, like there's worry, but they also say, go get them. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": That's right. And to date, the effects of the trade war are showing up more in the stock market than they have in, say, the employment figures, which I think are critical to President Trump's chances for reelection. But all of this is a reminder that the only closed economy, Bret, is the global economy. And so this trade war has affected the Chinese economy, which in turn has affected the German economy, which brings down Europe, and that is having blowback now in terms of our businesspeople operating in this climate of uncertainty. They don't know actually where the supply chains will go, and they don't know where the tariff levels will remain."

    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "And I think that's why, and I think Trump knows it's having an effect. That's why he's subsidizing farmers who are responding to retaliatory tariffs from China. That's what he wants to delay some of these trade sanctions until the Christmas shopping season is over. He knows it's having an effect."

It would be after several of these tests have happened in recent weeks. We are going to take a road down the 2020 Candidate Casino. There are fewer to bet on this week, but you have $100 in chips.
