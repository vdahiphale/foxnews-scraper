I mean, if she wins the primary, she's probably going to win because the Republican Party is so decimated there. But I do think that this loose talk about impeachment absolutely helps President Trump. Maybe not himself in his approval ratings, but it will galvanize Republicans to go out and support other Republicans in order to prevent that. You can't impeach somebody just because you don't like them or that their rhetoric isn't good. And in fact, I would say that there's one Democrat really making this point. Susan Glasser interviewed Congressman Jerry Nadler in The New Yorker. And so he was head of the Judiciary Committee, and it would be up to him. And he said, \"My view of impeachment is to be very careful that when Tom Steyer is saying 'I will only give you money if you pledge that you will vote for impeachment,'\" that that -- that Nadler says that is very premature.

We'd take 10 trillion, thrown that into the budget, and announce a three- year tax holiday for the remaining 49 states. You don't pay any taxes, because we got it from Mexico. And then the remaining 37.5 trillion goes against solving world -- major issues like hunger, poverty, air pollution, which costs 2.5 trillion a year, for 15 years that's 37.5 trillion. The Mexican officials and police can now deal with California, gang crime, and their bankrupt cities and their economic inequality. We get tax breaks, and the world conquers all of its problems.

Two of those times they were warned that he was going to be a possible school shooter. And now he's running a P.R. campaign, he's going on CNN, and blaming the NRA, and not accepting responsibility. And he's taking credit away from the other department that showed up ahead of his own deputies. It almost seems like he's more concerned with bashing the NRA than solving the school safety issue. And Democrats, who for the last several years had said that police departments need to be held to a higher standard, need more supervision, need more scrutiny. Now, they really have no appetite to look into the sheriff. Republicans usually give police the benefit of the doubt, but at this point there's -- looks like there's a lot of mistakes that were made and Republicans want to investigate here.

So all these things are in play, but it doesn't mean that we should be derelict in our duty to do an examination of the sheriff's department, just like we've done in the FBI, to make sure that the right protocols in place. To make sure that this doesn't happen again. That is healthy, it is responsible, and it is competency. And that's what we need to focus on here.

So why would you take that out on dues paying members of the NRA who want to rent a car from you. Why are you punishing them? It doesn't make sense. And then it gets even worse, I think, because now an elected official in Georgia is saying, oh, yeah, Delta, we're going to come back at you and take away your tax break. Like, this is actually going to lead nowhere because a corporation has the right to make a decision. If they want to lose customers, fine. If it means that much to them and they want to take the P.R. hit for it, or maybe they think they get good P.R. out of this, they've made that calculation as a business.

They tried to delegitimize the presidency. He's at war with the press. He's frustrated. So this is just another example where he feels that people are trying to obfuscate issues.

There's a real pull between the pragmatists of the Democratic Party where there's a shrinking number, and the progressives. And in California, progressive is where you really want to be if you want to succeed in Democratic politics right now. You think of Tom Steyer and Nancy Pelosi. Like, she continues to give Republicans a lot of -- to run against her. So I think that -- I wouldn't say that Feinstein is not going to win. I mean, if she wins the primary, she's probably going to win because the Republican Party is so decimated there. But I do think that this loose talk about impeachment absolutely helps President Trump. Maybe not himself in his approval ratings, but it will galvanize Republicans to go out and support other Republicans in order to prevent that. You can't impeach somebody just because you don't like them or that their rhetoric isn't good. And in fact, I would say that there's one Democrat really making this point. Susan Glasser interviewed Congressman Jerry Nadler in The New Yorker. And so he was head of the Judiciary Committee, and it would be up to him. And he said, \"My view of impeachment is to be very careful that when Tom Steyer is saying 'I will only give you money if you pledge that you will vote for impeachment,'\" that that -- that Nadler says that is very premature. So I feel like the elders of the Democratic Party are trying to tap the brakes on this, because they realize it's not the path to victory.

Because she's actually very good about the United States military, national security, foreign policy, has common sense as it relates to the economy, the tax issues. And so they want to go so far left and so liberal that they're going to do -- they're going to seek out people like that. They want people who are like bomb throwers. But it's going to really fracture and alienate, I think, a lot of voters that might've gone Democrat. This new kind of, like, platform the Democratic Party has.

Democratic Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf put out a press release this weekend to sound the alarm about potential ICE raids in her city before they happened. She says it was her ethical obligation to do so."

Residents should know that they do not have an obligation to open their door if an ICE official knocks. While I am very committed to being a law-abiding citizen, I feel confident that my sharing this information, because I did not receive it through official channels, is legal and frankly, it's my ethical obligation. I felt that it was my duty to share the information."

The move came days after the president warned that he may pull ICE agents from the state, which refuses habitually, to cooperate. So let's go California, shall we?"

We'd take 10 trillion, thrown that into the budget, and announce a three- year tax holiday for the remaining 49 states. You don't pay any taxes, because we got it from Mexico. And then the remaining 37.5 trillion goes against solving world -- major issues like hunger, poverty, air pollution, which costs 2.5 trillion a year, for 15 years that's 37.5 trillion. The Mexican officials and police can now deal with California, gang crime, and their bankrupt cities and their economic inequality. We get tax breaks, and the world conquers all of its problems. This is the answer. We'll be right back."

I actually think that the Democrats, if they want to push back on immigration, these stories about parents and children being separated at the border and held miles apart, unable to see each other. There was one story today of an African woman who has not seen her 6-year-old daughter in several weeks. And I think that's a much stronger play for them. Not this."

There's going to be a lot of these anti-Trump superheroes who are going to pop up, like this person in California, like Rahm Emanuel, who kind of want to earn their street cred by fighting the system and fighting Donald Trump. You get a lot of free publicity. And they can survive it, because they're in left-wing precincts. But I don't think it's good for the country. She's breaking the law. U.S. Code 1234 -- you cannot conceal, harbor or shield from protection an illegal alien. You can face fines or imprisonment, up to five years. Although she's never going to jail. It's amazing how the Democratic Party has changed their platform over the last couple decades. This party a couple years ago voted for the border fence, voted to, you know, not shield illegal aliens from protection, voted for sweeps, voted for raids. Now it's just open season. Let them in, give them free stuff. Never prosecute them. It's amazing. They're not the party of law and order any more. And Trump, when he fights the federal government, when he thinks things are wrong, he's called a traitor. When the Democrats do it, they're heroes."

It means that the March deadline is not going to be in place. The second thing to say is, I think that what the mayor of Oakland is doing is saying even if you are here illegally, there are certain steps. Like, you don't have to open your door. You don't have to do X, Y, Z. That's information that's given out by everybody. That's not breaking the law. That's not supporting people being here illegally.
