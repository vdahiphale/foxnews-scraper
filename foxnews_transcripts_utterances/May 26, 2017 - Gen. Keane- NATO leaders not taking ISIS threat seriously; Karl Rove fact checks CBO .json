And now, with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan -- starting tomorrow; comes a word that ISIS has called on followers to rise up in an all-out war on so-called \"infidels in the west.\" The attack on Ariana Grande fans in Manchester Arena, Monday night was just the latest in a wave of terror that's put intense pressure on MI Five, the British intelligence agency. There's been a shock rise and plots here, at least five reportedly disrupted -- in the past two months alone -- with authorities juggling an estimated 500 active investigations focusing on 3,000 persons of interest. The workload facing officers and agents is described as unprecedented -- and one of the people who were on the radar was the arena bomber: Salman Abedi, believed to be the man in a brown robe seen last July, taking out the trash at its family home. More than a dozen raids related to this investigation have led to a significant evidence in around of at least eight terror suspects here in Manchester, including Abedi's older brother -- as we've been reporting -- his younger brother and father are also being questioned Libya.

There are a 26 million people will be enrolled this year. The next year, they said, in February of 2014, they said 24. They repeated that in March of 2015 and in March of last year -- they said 15 million people would be enrolled in ObamaCare as a result of the law. Now, what was the reality? The actual number is just over 10 million, which means that their estimate, they estimated -- overestimated by 16 million or 260 percent in 2013, 14 million in 2014 and 2015 or 240 percent more. And one year ago, one year ago, they overestimated by 150 percent, they were half again as many people estimated to be on ObamaCare as are actually on ObamaCare. So, I think, Mick Mulvaney is absolutely right, why trust their numbers?",

There's been a shock rise and plots here, at least five reportedly disrupted -- in the past two months alone -- with authorities juggling an estimated 500 active investigations focusing on 3,000 persons of interest. The workload facing officers and agents is described as unprecedented -- and one of the people who were on the radar was the arena bomber: Salman Abedi, believed to be the man in a brown robe seen last July, taking out the trash at its family home. More than a dozen raids related to this investigation have led to a significant evidence in around of at least eight terror suspects here in Manchester, including Abedi's older brother -- as we've been reporting -- his younger brother and father are also being questioned Libya.

I think the number that Rick quoted was 3,000 people on a watch list in the U.K. And this weekend, the U.K. is going to be living with their military riding the trains, riding on buses, being on the public street. You know, right now, these folks are winning. They are changing how we are living, at least, how our closest ally is good to be spending the week this weekend. We ought to all be concerned that in 16 years, we've not made much progress if any progress since 9/11 in defeating this threat."

The way to defeat this, certainly -- is to form an alliance, recognized that this is a multigenerational problem, we're fighting an ideology much like Fascism, and Nazism, Communism in the 20th century. And when they formed safe havens, you have to crush them and you have to have a sense of urgency to do that. Well, we don't do that properly; we get 9/11, because we didn't do it properly in Afghanistan, and we're not doing it properly in Syria. This is the problem that NATO has. They -- ISIS formed the safe have in Syria in 2012, they were routed over Iraq in 2014 with 30,000 fighters -- they group from several hundred. They were able to plan, train, recruit, and inspire, and direct attacks outside Iraq and Syria as we painfully are aware of; 32 of them in NATO countries alone. NATO and the Arabs should've crushed that safe haven in Syria years ago and it's still there today. And it's because NATO and their leaders are not serious, they are not taking this threat seriously and there are other leaders in the world like them who lack the political and moral courage to see the truth and to tell their people the truth; that's not what they're doing."

That is where the majority of the threat comes from; they're all Muslims, they live in Muslim communities, and they know each other.

Look, the CBO says if that the Republican plan is passed, that 23 million people will lose their insurance coverage. Well, how can 23 million people lose their insurance coverage if ObamaCare is repealed, when only less than 11 million have gotten coverage with insurance policies under ObamaCare? It doesn't make any sense. What they're referring to is 23 million people will not sign up if ObamaCare is repealed. But the estimates from the CBO on ObamaCare have been traditionally very, very bad. Here are the CBO estimates for what enrollment would be this year starting in February of 2013. There are a 26 million people will be enrolled this year. The next year, they said, in February of 2014, they said 24. They repeated that in March of 2015 and in March of last year -- they said 15 million people would be enrolled in ObamaCare as a result of the law. Now, what was the reality? The actual number is just over 10 million, which means that their estimate, they estimated -- overestimated by 16 million or 260 percent in 2013, 14 million in 2014 and 2015 or 240 percent more. And one year ago, one year ago, they overestimated by 150 percent, they were half again as many people estimated to be on ObamaCare as are actually on ObamaCare.

And he's saying, look, it's fine to spend all this money on these programs, but it's your money. So, are you OK with us spending this money on this program if the program has been proven over years to not work, or if maybe there are too many people? Maybe, you know, 30,000 is too many people to work at the State Department. He's sort of approaching this in a novel way. Politically, can this work?

In Washington, as he said, if you spend $100 this year and you spend $100 next year, that's a cut. If you spent 107 next year, that's a cut. And let me give you a real practical example: the Democrats are going around saying you're cutting Medicaid and the Republicans are on the health plan by $880 billion over the next ten years. Well, this year -- excuse me, wrong whiteboard. This year, Medicaid -- we're spending $389 billion. Under the Republican plan in ten years, we would spend $469 billion in FY- 27, that's $80 billion more than we're spending today and 21 percent more and they would say -- the Democrats would say, well, that's a cut because it's less than what they would like to spend, not what we need to spend."

Trying to get a bad quote and smear his campaign. But with that said, what I wished would happen here when we look at the violence, the media has told this story of what would happen in Montana over and over again. But what they do, is they refuse to tell the story about happens at Trump rallies when conservatives are getting beaten up -- or at Berkeley when conservatives want to go and listen to a conservative speaker; they don't tell that story. Or a Republican congressman at Town Halls, where they're getting ruffed up and shaken up, they don't want to when the left behaves poorly; they just want to tell the Republican story when they have a bad act.

But that being said, you can't get mad at the journalists who're reporting these stories, and a lot of times, Martha, this White House whether they like it or not, they corroborated at the end, right. With that being said, I think we need to find out what we know about this investigation, we need Muller to do his job, we need the senate intelligence committee to do their job, and get to the bottom of who talks to the Russians, what they said, and how do we make sure the Russians never collude in our elections again."

There is an ongoing investigation by a special counsel, Robert Mueller. Is there any way -- is this just the way that Washington operates now, or is there any way that this White House can get anything done? Because we all know this is not going away anytime soon."

If you don't play both ends of the court you're absolutely going to get crushed. And that's why I think bringing Bannon on at this role as defensive coordinator, very smart move. One thing I want to take issue with my good liberal friend Richard Fowler is this."

At the top of today's docket for the allies and the world leaders, they were talking about trade and about terror. The president's major focus so far on this fast-paced nine day tour, chief White House correspondent John Roberts joins us now with more from the conference in Sicily."

      "utterance": "Martha, good evening to you. Three reel headlines coming out of today's first day of the G7 summit, first of all, the U.S.-U.K. intelligence sharing relationship is back on a firm footing, second, that the United States is considering increasing sanctions on Russia, and third, that the president is thinking whether to pull out of the Paris climate accord is beginning to, quote, evolve somewhat. Let impact this all, first of all to the intelligence sharing, of course, you know that yesterday the U.K. decided to suspend intelligence of evidence sharing with U.S. counterparts because of leak that were coming out about the Manchester bombing. Teresa May, last night, talk with the president at the NATO summit about it. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, went to London, today, to apologize to the foreign secretary and it appears that everything is on a firm footing once again. Second, on Russia, the president chief economic advisor Gary Cohn, yesterday, said that the United States and the president was, quote, looking at Russia sanctions which led some people to believe that the president might be thinking of relaxing the sanctions. At a briefing this afternoon, here in Taormina, Gary Cohn said not so fast, we're thinking of doing exactly the opposite. Here's what Cohn said."

    {
      "speaker": "GARY COHN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR",
      "utterance": "We're not lowering our sanctions on Russia. If anything, we would probably look to get tougher on Russia. So, the president wants to continue to go, to keep sanctions in place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "And the third big headline on the Paris climate agreement, of course, the president was expected before the G7, Martha, to announce whether or not the U.S. would stay in the climate accord. He decided to delay that decision until after this summit. According to Gary Cohn, again, the economic advisor, the president's thinking on this is evolving. Cohn is saying on the record, quote, I think he's leaning to understanding the European position. He knows in the U.S. there's very strong opinions on both sides, but he also knows that Paris is an important meeting too many of the European leaders. So the president is taking today and again tomorrow to listen to their opinions on this before forming his own opinion and his own decision about what to do. One other thing that happened to note today, during the summit is that all of the leaders got together to sign a joint communique -- a joint statement against terrorism. They do said they all want to get on the same page and act cooperatively, Martha, to sort of act from a position of strength that, you know, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Martha."

This trip is focused on that goal, bringing nations together around the goal of defeating the terrorism that threatens the world. I have been very, very direct with Secretary Stoltenberg and members of the alliance in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations."

We have all of those sorts of colorful things that punctuated the coverage here. But let's start with the serious stuff. What did you make as you look at those speeches and those moments what was the progress made here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "I think that this was a very substantial and really largely successful trip by the president. I know there was some concern inside the White House whether they were biting off more than they could chew in these nine days, and traveling all throughout the Middle East and Europe, but it went pretty well. I think when you look at it a week or two from now, or a month or two from now, people are going to point to the weekend in Saudi Arabia and trying to build that Sunni Muslim coalition, 54 nations to fight radical Islamic extremism, Sunni extremism, and to try to isolate Iran. That was really, I think, the most consequential part of this trip. But I think also, the meeting with the European leaders, first at NATO and now the G7, you know, president pretty tough yesterday talking about how the NATO nations need to pay up, need to pay their 2 percent commitment, that didn't plays a lot of the European leaders but I think most people at home are going to think good, good on the president to tell them why they shouldn't be free riders and it shouldn't be on the back of American taxpayers."

As you point out, Chris, I think at some ways it's like being with your own family. It's easier to be tougher on them, to be more demanding of them, is it not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And also, I would say this about Saudi Arabia. It wasn't just trying to paper differences over. Yes, he did not talk at least in public about human rights and some are going to criticize him for that. But I will tell you, White House officials say that they've got some teeth along with good rhetoric when it came to those Muslim nations fighting extremism. That they have agreed to cut off financing, both by the government themselves or people inside those countries to radical Islamic groups. And in fact, the treasury department is going to have greater access to be able to monitor whether they're keeping those promises. So that is a significant development, it wasn't just a matter of papering over differences."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, absolutely. And you know, his focus was clearly -- his largest focus on terrorism and recognizing the threat of it around the globe, whether he was in the Middle East or Europe. And President Obama is criticized at times for downplaying it in favor of other things like climate change. Speaking of that, this discussion about the Paris accord, he heads back to Washington, there's no doubt there's a very deep divide among people in the Trump team over whether or not this accord should be kept or to be shelved, and now we're learning is that his thoughts on this are evolving."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, that's what one of his advisors said that they're evolving. I will say, I think we could make too much of this because whether the president formally pulls out of the Paris accord or not, he's taken a number of steps in terms of rolling back environmental regulations that are going to make it almost impossible for the U.S. to comply with the kind of guidelines for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that would have been needed to meet the goals. So he could stay in accord, but whether or not -- in fact, there are the policies in place that would allow us to meet our commitments is something different."

      "utterance": "Well, you know, my favorite moment -- and I have to say I was a little bit horrified by it is when the president puts the prime minister of Montenegro away so that he can get in front. But what I particularly like is when someone said, well, we're no longer leading from behind."
