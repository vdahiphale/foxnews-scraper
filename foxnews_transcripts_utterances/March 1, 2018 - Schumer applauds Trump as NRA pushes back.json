A database where if school officials and police officers notice something wrong, it's not about due process, actually that is the due process. They say this person is a threat, but he hasn't violated any laws yet. But they say --there needs to be a database for that. Where that person goes and then you figured out later. But at that point, there's no gun. And it's in a civil court, so there's a low bar and you can go and get a judge to get, you know, through a court order.

Along with hardening soft targets in dealing with the mentally ill, these are all practical things. I think what the Dems are doing, which is very smart, they're piling their other stuff on there and they're saying they're lauding him. Whenever you get praise from a liberal, you should be very worried. But, I think we've talked about this before. If there's a Republican who moved to the middle, you know it's going to be Trump because he's a populist. When a populist here's somebody saying don't take away my guns, they'll say I'm with you, and then if somebody else's says get those guns away from those creeps, he'll say I'm with you, because a populist is with the popular opinion.

I don't see anything wrong with that in terms of the promise program they want to redo. These cops were dealing with this violent, ridiculous person down there causing mayhem and they weren't treating him like a criminal. Sometimes you have to treat an 18- year-old high school kid like a criminal and stop suspending him and putting him in timeout, and maybe, actually, make him pay the price. The background checks, I can agree with. I think that's common sense. It's all about sharing information. Whether you're suspended for violence, whether it's a crisis at your house and you've been called -- the police 55 times or whatever it is. Put that in some sort of system and make sure everybody has access to it. The raise in the age limit, I'm still a little wishy-washy. I haven't decided yet. I see on the hand you don't want an 18-year-old person, maybe to get a gun. But at the same time an AR -- the same time that wouldn't have prevented most of these mass shootings. Most of these mass shootings are people above 18. And if you're a hunter, if you like sports shooting and you're in our rural state, why deny them their constitutional right.

Evaluate the situation because, perhaps, with the young people that were so personally and tragically affected by this, it has changed a little bit of the tone, the willingness to listen, to try to do something better because it's not politicians, although some of them were motivated in certain ways by different parental ideology and whatnot. That's what I think people are listening. Well, it's not this congressman, or this Republican, or this Democrat. It's people who were there, experience loss, and tragedy, and suffering, and they're being real in terms of how they experienced it, and genuine in terms of wanting to do something about it.

The civil tax system target the people who need to be targeted. You put them in a database. I'm seeing this happening with opioids right now. Donald Trump talking about suing -- the government suing pharmaceutical companies. So they're targeting law-abiding citizens because of a tiny percentage of abuse, right? They're going to go after the companies that create the drugs and they're going to go after -- they're going to make it harder for cancer patients and people with illnesses to get opioids because there's abuse.

Although, he did say that our defenses could overwhelm Putin, so it's not that big of a deal. I do think that Putin is feeling a lot of heat. He has an election coming up. And obviously, he's going to rig it. But, he looks pretty small because if you think about -- ten days ago on February 7, the United States military absolutely kicked his rear end in Syria. There were many Russian mercenaries that were sent to Syria. They were basically doing terrible things to innocent people. We went in and took care of that. And the oligarch that's involved with all this Mueller stuff was in actually in charge of those mercenaries. So there's a lot of stuff going on here. And I think what Putin was trying to do with this announcement -- who knows if it's even true, but that he was trying to make it look like the country of Russia is bigger and better than it actually is. In every single area of its economy, all around the world, their geopolitical efforts, the things they try to do here that they didn't succeed in in 2016, all of those things make that country look really small. But internally, he has to make it look like he's so big. One thing that's changing though when those social media posts started going up after those mercenaries were killed, he can't stop that. And so, he has to figure out a way to try to prevent people from getting information.

This is going to cost the Russians a lot of money. They don't have a lot of money. So I think this is a waste of money for them. But this is all about prestige and Putin wanting to be back like he was during the cold war. President Obama scrapped our tactical nuclear weapons, took them off the warships.

States were ranked on everything from education to opportunity, from infrastructure to crime. But California scored low for one simple reason: It's impossible to live there unless you are super rich or homeless -- then come one, come all. Just any U-Haul dealer. Renting a truck to go San Francisco to Dallas will cost 3,200 bucks. The return trip only 1,100 -- that's a 180 percent surcharge. And it's based on a truck shortage in California, because so many people are leaving one left-wing city to a more pragmatic, affordable one. So maybe Californians leaving California, they're the real dreamers. But anyone who's been to L.A. knows the ugly truth: It's turned into a post-apocalyptic wasteland with 55,000 homeless in that county alone. Massive encampments have enveloped Skid Row under overpasses and streets nearby. S.F. isn't much better, spending millions last year on cleaning up human waste left on its streets by the homeless. It's odd: We're living in a time where Hollywood embraces dystopian fiction, they spend millions trying to recreate the look of life after nuclear war. I could save them some money: Just grab an iPhone and drive downtown. All right. I'm going to go to you, Juan. I never go to you first, so I thought it might be a time to ask this question.

      "utterance": "Not going to happen. That bill isn't going to happen. I can safely say that any -- with that language, it's not going to work. I think what President Trump was trying to get at, and he used imprecise language, is he's talking about a database for what he calls the crazy guys. A database where if school officials and police officers notice something wrong, it's not about due process, actually that is the due process. They say this person is a threat, but he hasn't violated any laws yet. But they say --there needs to be a database for that. Where that person goes and then you figured out later. But at that point, there's no gun. And it's in a civil court, so there's a low bar and you can go and get a judge to get, you know, through a court order. I think that's what he's getting at, but I don't know. I think that's a smart move because I think that makes sense. Along with hardening soft targets in dealing with the mentally ill, these are all practical things. I think what the Dems are doing, which is very smart, they're piling their other stuff on there and they're saying they're lauding him. Whenever you get praise from a liberal, you should be very worried. But, I think we've talked about this before. If there's a Republican who moved to the middle, you know it's going to be Trump because he's a populist. When a populist here's somebody saying don't take away my guns, they'll say I'm with you, and then if somebody else's says get those guns away from those creeps, he'll say I'm with you, because a populist is with the popular opinion. And if the population has two different opinions, he will say yes to both of them."
    },

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what's happening too is that -- Jesse, there's a conversation happening in Washington, and that conversation might not actually lead to legislation, but there is movement in the state. So, for example, Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, they passed a law to increase the age to 21 in terms of purchase, and he's going to dedicate $500 million to harden -- to all the schools. That's a huge commitment for a state when you can spend it on a lot of other things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "That's an enormous commitment and he's feeling a lot of heat down there in Florida. It looks like he's doing the right thing so far. I do get nervous when crying Chuck endorses something. It makes me run on the other direction. But in this case, I think what the president, when he was using imprecisely language as you would say, it's a gun violence restraining order. So if someone hasn't committed a crime or hasn't been involuntarily committed to a mental institution but is killing animals and acting crazy and beating up his mother, is a mess, like the kid was in Florida, you go to a judge, there's due process, you say let's prevent him from buying a weapon or taking the weapon away. Rubio supports this legislation. I don't see anything wrong with that in terms of the promise program they want to redo. These cops were dealing with this violent, ridiculous person down there causing mayhem and they weren't treating him like a criminal. Sometimes you have to treat an 18- year-old high school kid like a criminal and stop suspending him and putting him in timeout, and maybe, actually, make him pay the price. The background checks, I can agree with. I think that's common sense. It's all about sharing information. Whether you're suspended for violence, whether it's a crisis at your house and you've been called -- the police 55 times or whatever it is. Put that in some sort of system and make sure everybody has access to it. The raise in the age limit, I'm still a little wishy-washy. I haven't decided yet. I see on the hand you don't want an 18-year-old person, maybe to get a gun. But at the same time an AR -- the same time that wouldn't have prevented most of these mass shootings. Most of these mass shootings are people above 18. And if you're a hunter, if you like sports shooting and you're in our rural state, why deny them their constitutional right. I don't get that."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

People who favor of gun control are not single issue voters, and therefore their opposition is diluting. But in this moment, what the young people down in Florida leading the way, I think you're seeing a shift in opinion. And the question is whether or not the shift is on the right. And I think that's why, pretty much like Greg said, Senator Ben Sasse in Nebraska said the president is reflecting the last person to talk to him. And you have people like Breitbart saying, oh, it's Trump's gun grab. So you see the people on the right reacting as if, oh, my God, what's Trump doing. But people on the Democratic side or on the left are like, well, let him do what he wants to do. But he's got a fight among people who supported him in 2016. And even with the plans that he's put forward, can it get 60 votes in the senate without strong Republican support? Can it get 218 in the house?"

Yesterday, Walmart said it would no longer -- that it was raising the age limit to 21 for its stores. And also, Kroger said the same thing, which I always -- I didn't know they sold guns there.

And certainly, we're seeing a little bit with the president. He's trying to be very open-minded. Listen to both sides. Evaluate the situation because, perhaps, with the young people that were so personally and tragically affected by this, it has changed a little bit of the tone, the willingness to listen, to try to do something better because it's not politicians, although some of them were motivated in certain ways by different parental ideology and whatnot. That's what I think people are listening. Well, it's not this congressman, or this Republican, or this Democrat. It's people who were there, experience loss, and tragedy, and suffering, and they're being real in terms of how they experienced it, and genuine in terms of wanting to do something about it. Even the first lady commented on that. She says the children are using their voice and they're trying to get it out there to do something so it doesn't happen again to somebody else.

And then he went -- he knew what he knew who he had to please. But this is what it's like when you get a populist. And for better or for worse, people are very pro-populist but you never know what the next day is going to bring because it's based on popular opinion. Here's my concern. What worries me as we're going to end up punishing law-abiding citizens. Not just in guns though, but in other arenas. For example, if you think -- if you decide to rig the system to make it harder for legal -- law-abiding citizens to get guns. You're not targeting the actual troubled -- the nuts, right? The civil tax system target the people who need to be targeted. You put them in a database. I'm seeing this happening with opioids right now. Donald Trump talking about suing -- the government suing pharmaceutical companies. So they're targeting law-abiding citizens because of a tiny percentage of abuse, right? They're going to go after the companies that create the drugs and they're going to go after -- they're going to make it harder for cancer patients and people with illnesses to get opioids because there's abuse. There's a small amount of abuse. It is a parallel argument to guns. The overwhelming majority of people who have guns are law-abiding citizens. The people that use legal medications are law-abiding people with cancer, with pain disorders. We are punishing people by creating -- by going after the system than actually going after the system abusers."

It's a concept that all rational actors around the world understand. You're not going to blow us up. We're not going to blow you up. So let's just call the whole thing off. However, there're people who seek to end the earth for the promise of heavenly reward. They are not rational. ISIS is now spreading to other vulnerable regions around the globe. There's nothing more dangerous than a toxic ideology that regenerates indefinitely. And it's OK with destroying the world because to them that's a reward. There's no mutually assured destruction argument with them. That's scary. So we have to think beyond missiles from Russia, start thinking about cyber terror, which is a big deal because that can make you think there's a missile attack, and the attempt to paralyze our power grid, which would cause us to turn on each other.

And it's just so unrealistic. And the military -- Adam Kinzinger, the congressman from Illinois was on my show today. He said we are not prepared. And I said, well, that's not very reassuring. Although, he did say that our defenses could overwhelm Putin, so it's not that big of a deal. I do think that Putin is feeling a lot of heat. He has an election coming up. And obviously, he's going to rig it. But, he looks pretty small because if you think about -- ten days ago on February 7, the United States military absolutely kicked his rear end in Syria. There were many Russian mercenaries that were sent to Syria. They were basically doing terrible things to innocent people. We went in and took care of that. And the oligarch that's involved with all this Mueller stuff was in actually in charge of those mercenaries. So there's a lot of stuff going on here. And I think what Putin was trying to do with this announcement -- who knows if it's even true, but that he was trying to make it look like the country of Russia is bigger and better than it actually is. In every single area of its economy, all around the world, their geopolitical efforts, the things they try to do here that they didn't succeed in in 2016, all of those things make that country look really small. But internally, he has to make it look like he's so big. One thing that's changing though when those social media posts started going up after those mercenaries were killed, he can't stop that. And so, he has to figure out a way to try to prevent people from getting information. And the best was to help the people of Russia is to get them more information."

It doesn't go in a straight line so it's harder to defend. That's fine. The missile defense system that we have in Anchorage, Alaska, and in Eastern Europe, mostly designed for one or two missiles or from rogue regimes. They've always felt it was a threat to them. It kind of was to a certain extent. Like Greg said, if they're going to shoot six, we'll shoot seven. We're all dead. It doesn't matter. We're both rational actors. This is going to cost the Russians a lot of money. They don't have a lot of money. So I think this is a waste of money for them. But this is all about prestige and Putin wanting to be back like he was during the cold war. President Obama scrapped our tactical nuclear weapons, took them off the warships. And now, President Trump said we want to design two new tactical nuclear weapons, one on a submarine, one on a navy warship. And I think that was a response to President Trump's design there. It's funny to hear the Democrats not say much about this. You know, when there's a few bots around causing trouble, it's a cold war."
