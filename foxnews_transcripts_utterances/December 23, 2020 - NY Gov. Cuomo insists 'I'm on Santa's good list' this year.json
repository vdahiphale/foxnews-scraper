Before leaving the White House today for Florida for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, the president did veto the National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the Department of Defense, also the United States military, the president -- and this just in the last 45 minutes -- announced that he was doing so. One of the sticking points was the names of Confederate soldiers and Confederate generals on military bases. The president wanted to keep them there. But, ultimately, that did not happen in the final language. So the president veto that. It appears that there may be an override of that veto in the House and Senate. Now getting on to what you were talking about, the COVID relief, this has been going on for months, the negotiations. And, yesterday, the president came out last night and said, wait a minute, the United States, Americans need more money in their pocket; $600 is not enough. He wants $2,000, possibly more, to go to families who are in need, who have been affected by COVID-19. The president put out this video last night from the White House on social media. He complained about that $600, calling those payments -- quote -- \"ridiculously low.\" This was a package, though, his own Treasury secretary spent months negotiating. Listen here.",

Let's do it!\" Now, 10 days from now, the president, any time he gets legislation to his desk, Charles, he has 10 days, not including Sundays, to either sign or veto it, which makes this very interesting, is the fact that 10 days from now is January 3. That is the day the 117th Congress takes over. If the president does nothing, he could do what's called a pocket veto, where he essentially just sits on it. Then the legislation dies. It's possible that he could do that in its current form. He could send it back. It's also possible that the House and Senate could override that veto. Now, we have heard a little bit about a pro forma session. That means that the House, a small group of members of the House are going to come back tomorrow for about 30 seconds. They are going to propose the $2,000 checks on the House floor, and then see where that goes.

Americans should be taken care of. We paid our taxes. We paid our dues, and a lot of individuals have suffered, at no fault of their own. No one expected COVID. No one wanted COVID. And, certainly, we have a lot of folks who are out of business. Over 500,000 businesses have filed for bankruptcy since the start of COVID.

The more desperate, the more dire the urgency was to provide them with relief, the more likely the state and city governments were to get some sort of bailout. They were betting that they would get -- they would be second in line and that they would get it, so long as the small businesses got it. Well, they failed. And now we're in a lose-lose situation, in terms of the city and state's economics and every one of the cities and states that are in this situation, because you got no business tax revenue from the small businesses, and you also have no bailout for the state and city governments. So, now what do we do, right? So, they have -- if you're asking me what a bottle of water looks like, it looks like a regular bottle of water that everyone drinks from, not one that's blue for this part -- for this person, but pink for him, and so on and so forth. It's the same water that we all drink. You can't have different rules. Your strategy failed. Now you have to level the playing field. There is absolutely no basis for saying that New York City has a different set of circumstances and we have a lot of density. Well, guess what? The 75 percent that you took off the table when you kept us -- when you capped it at 25 percent, that eliminated 75 percent of the problem. The mass exodus that happened pre-COVID and the mass exodus that happened after COVID solved a lot of the rest of the problem. So, the density argument really has no validity. The only data we have ever seen in terms of the restaurant industry in New York is that it's fourth on the list in terms of severity; 1.4 percent of the cases result from restaurants spreading it.

Before leaving the White House today for Florida for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, the president did veto the National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the Department of Defense, also the United States military, the president -- and this just in the last 45 minutes -- announced that he was doing so. One of the sticking points was the names of Confederate soldiers and Confederate generals on military bases. The president wanted to keep them there. But, ultimately, that did not happen in the final language. So the president veto that. It appears that there may be an override of that veto in the House and Senate. Now getting on to what you were talking about, the COVID relief, this has been going on for months, the negotiations. And, yesterday, the president came out last night and said, wait a minute, the United States, Americans need more money in their pocket; $600 is not enough. He wants $2,000, possibly more, to go to families who are in need, who have been affected by COVID-19. The president put out this video last night from the White House on social media. He complained about that $600, calling those payments -- quote -- \"ridiculously low.\" This was a package, though, his own Treasury secretary spent months negotiating. Listen here."

That is the day the 117th Congress takes over. If the president does nothing, he could do what's called a pocket veto, where he essentially just sits on it. Then the legislation dies. It's possible that he could do that in its current form. He could send it back. It's also possible that the House and Senate could override that veto. Now, we have heard a little bit about a pro forma session. That means that the House, a small group of members of the House are going to come back tomorrow for about 30 seconds. They are going to propose the $2,000 checks on the House floor, and then see where that goes.

How dare you choose to send $1.3 billion to Egypt and to their military, but yet and still not take care of the veterans here in our country? How dare you say, because someone made $75,000 last year, that they can only get so much of the COVID relief funding? How dare you think that this isn't about America first? Americans should be taken care of. We paid our taxes. We paid our dues, and a lot of individuals have suffered, at no fault of their own. No one expected COVID. No one wanted COVID. And, certainly, we have a lot of folks who are out of business. Over 500,000 businesses have filed for bankruptcy since the start of COVID.

Two new museums in D.C. is part of the bill as well. And so, when you look at all this waste, including money towards gender studies, what does that have to do with COVID relief? So, money does need to go to small businesses. Money does need to go to the people who have lost their jobs, and, arguably, not the big corporations and those that are doing well during a pandemic, and for funding a vaccine.

They basically used small businesses as a pawn. The more desperate, the more dire the urgency was to provide them with relief, the more likely the state and city governments were to get some sort of bailout. They were betting that they would get -- they would be second in line and that they would get it, so long as the small businesses got it. Well, they failed. And now we're in a lose-lose situation, in terms of the city and state's economics and every one of the cities and states that are in this situation, because you got no business tax revenue from the small businesses, and you also have no bailout for the state and city governments. So, now what do we do, right? So, they have -- if you're asking me what a bottle of water looks like, it looks like a regular bottle of water that everyone drinks from, not one that's blue for this part -- for this person, but pink for him, and so on and so forth. It's the same water that we all drink. You can't have different rules. Your strategy failed. Now you have to level the playing field. There is absolutely no basis for saying that New York City has a different set of circumstances and we have a lot of density. Well, guess what? The 75 percent that you took off the table when you kept us -- when you capped it at 25 percent, that eliminated 75 percent of the problem. The mass exodus that happened pre-COVID and the mass exodus that happened after COVID solved a lot of the rest of the problem. So, the density argument really has no validity. The only data we have ever seen in terms of the restaurant industry in New York is that it's fourth on the list in terms of severity; 1.4 percent of the cases result from restaurants spreading it. There is no reason whatsoever, other than that restaurants are the easy scapegoat, like they always are."

And so I spoke to two Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee, and they told me that, frankly, they're not comfortable even having him in the room because of the sensitive nature of the information that they handle there.

Just one of them is what to do about Hunter Biden. Here you have a case where the president-elect in the past has demanded independent counsels who could not be fired by the president whenever there was a conflict of interest. Here you have the president's son already under federal investigation. If you look at reports like the one that came out in The Wall Street Journal today, there's more and more facts coming out which are placing Hunter Biden in worse and worse light. Is President Biden really going to appoint an attorney general who isn't going to try to cover up or to help out the Biden family, but allow the investigation to go forward? And then the other thing that they're really worried about is gender racial diversity. President Biden has said that -- president-elect Biden has said he's going to pick the most diverse Cabinet in history. And so he's tried to mix and match all kinds of different races and genders to get the right balance. That's also clearly delaying that pick as well.

It's not just Hunter Biden. It's the president's brother is involved as well. A lot of people on the left were giving Attorney General Bill -- (sic) Bob Barr a hard time. But, in the end, Bill Barr actually allowed Mueller to finish his report, allowed the report to be made public, allowed Mueller to testify before Congress and lay out everything he had found.

So, everyone knew an end-of- the-year-mess was coming. But here's the key thing. President Trump won in these negotiations. First, the COVID relief bill, which -- which Speaker Pelosi insisted on $3.4 trillion, turned out to be about one-tenth of that spending, all on the areas President Trump insisted on, more help for small businesses, getting airline workers back to work, helping defeat this COVID. And on the overall spending bill, as you recall, these are several bills put together. But in funding the government for the year, his priorities, rebuilding the military, more money for the wall, fully funding veterans and confronting China, he won every one of those elements.

Secondly, the foreign aid is pennies in this overall funding budget. In fact, most of the foreign aid was focused just on what the president asked for, which is, let -- we need dollars to support American values and confront China. And, for example, I asked that same question about Pakistan. Why are we spending money on gender issues to Pakistan? Well, it turns out that, in the Middle East, President Trump and Ivanka Trump have been leading the effort to make sure young girls can go to school, women can begin businesses, because we have learned, when there are stronger women's rights in those -- those Middle East countries, America is safer.

      "utterance": "Jonathan, thank you very much. So, what impact will this have on the Senate run-offs in Georgia? Let's ask former White House Deputy Chief of Staff and FOX News contributor Karl Rove. Karl, what's the read down there now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, this makes it a murky, confusing picture. For the last couple of weeks, we have been having the Democrats take a lackadaisical attitude towards COVID relief. One of them, Jon Ossoff, even said, let's not get into the details about it, and sort of slow-plan. And the two Republicans in last few days have been celebrating the success of the Senate in passing a bill. And now it gets a little bit more complicated. The president was not -- did not offer this up during the course of the negotiations. And it's sort of a last-minute thing. And it's going to make things more complicated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "What about, though, folks out there who might actually say, golly, I need more than $600, and I'm glad that the president is pushing for this, because Congress doesn't get just how out of touch -- it feels like the average man or woman who cannot work from home is suffering pretty mightily."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Look, I think that's right. There are people who say, look, I'd like to have more. There are also people who, though, have the opinion of, look, who's going to pay for it? And particularly small businesspeople or people in agriculture might say, we're -- $600 seems like a -- seems -- may seem small. But when you add it all up, it's trillions of dollars, and it's a trillion dollars, and where's that money coming from? So, the better the -- the sooner this gets behind us, the better off we are. People do want to have something done. But they don't want to have the checkbook just sort of opened up and money thrown out the windows, and there is the tension between them that want and them that thinks they ought to restrain the spending."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I don't know that you have to make it a larger bill, right? Only less than $300 billion that I can count will be going straight to households, and a lot of people are wondering where the heck the rest of it's going. Karl, what's going on with respect--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, can I explain a little bit of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "A bunch of is going to small businesses to continue the Paycheck Protection Program, in which small businesses get assistance in keeping people at work, on the payroll, even if the sales don't justify it. That's another way that even larger sums of money are being put into people's pockets. And, more importantly, small businesses are kept alive, so those jobs remain as the economy returns, and we don't have a lot of small businesses go out of business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "No, I agree. We want to keep them whole, and we want to make sure maybe people have money to go spend at those locations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "And some of these places, we need to keep those states open. But I'm not a big poll person, but I do like them in terms of directions, for directional stuff. Ironically, I like the gambling sites better. Why can't -- why haven't the Republican candidates been able to stretch a lead? They will get a little momentum for two or three days, and then, all of a sudden, it looks like it's completely gone. Why can't they get the sort of momentum that maybe they had in past elections?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, because Georgia is changing. Georgia is now a competitive status. It's not the deep red state that it was 20 years ago. It's a 52-48 state, red state, on a good day. Joe Biden carried it for the first time since 1992 for a Democrat. And the Democrats want it. They know what they can get if they take these two seats. They tie the Senate at 50/50. Kamala Harris breaks any tie, and they can do wherever they want--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "-- short of -- you don't even need to change the rules change. They just need to pass legislation that falls under the budget reconciliation rules. They could pass a major takeover of the health care. They could pass Medicare for all with 50 votes and Kamala Harris voting to break the tie. So, you pass a big tax bill, as long as it's inside the budget resolution, 50 votes, and the vice president of the United States breaking the tie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Sure. Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "So, they're pouring all kinds of resources into it, and nobody should think this race is going to be a runaway for either side. It's going to be very competitive. I think the Republicans will win, but it's going to be very close."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "What will be -- I got 30 seconds -- though, the determining factor for that victory?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "The quality of each side's ground game. How good are they at getting out people who voted this fall to vote again or getting people who sat on the sidelines this fall to get out and vote again? And full disclosure, I'm a chairman of a national finance effort to help the Republican candidates called the Georgia Battleground Fund."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I know they're glad to have you, lucky to have you. And so are we, Karl. Thank you very much. We really appreciate it. All right, folks, I will be back here tomorrow.
