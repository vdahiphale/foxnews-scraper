      "sentences": "Welcome to “Hannity.” We start tonight with a Fox News alert. The left's favorite conspiracy theory is now dead. It is buried. There was no collusion. No conspiracy, no obstruction, nothing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The witch hunt is over and there will be no further charges, no further indictments, after 675 days and nine months before that with the FBI investigation -- in other words, almost three years total of an intensive, virulent investigation. Robert Mueller's report has officially been submitted to the attorney general of the United States. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } President Trump, no more indictments. No collusion charges will be filed. No obstruction charges will be filed, and no conspiracy charges nor they be filed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Congressman Mark Meadows put it very well. The Mueller report delivery suggest that no more indictments are coming, which we now know is true, from a special counsel, and that means that we just completed two years of investigating Russia collusion without one pollution related indictment. Not even one. Instead after nearly two years, tens of millions of your tax dollars, the Mueller witch hunt only managed to prosecute, oh, a few people for process crimes. Let's see, Papadopoulos' big 12 days in jail, lying to prosecutors, military hero lieutenant general Michael Flynn has not been sentenced. He nearly went bankrupt, how to sell his home because of mounting legal bills. With both McCabe and Comey, the FBI director and deputy director, admitting and bragging that they set him up, something they would never do any Obama or Clinton administrations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we have Roger Stone, he's going bankrupt, facing trial for allegedly lying to Congress and harassing a witness. Michael Cohen, of course, we know his case, pleading guilty to lying to congress, other crimes related to taxicab medallions, and bank applications fraud and taxes. And Paul Manafort, oh, he may spend the rest of his life in prison because of taxes and, again, lying on bank loan applications. What do they all have in common? Nothing, zero, to do with Trump, the campaign, Russia, or collusion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mueller also indicated dozens of Russians -- indicted in this case, Russian nationals, they will never come here. They're never going to be extradited. Many were Russian spies or Russian bot companies, they will never, ever face trial or be extradited to the United States. Putin, the bad actor he is, Russia, the bad nation they are, they're never going to allow it to happen. None of these charges involve camping collusion whatsoever. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have plenty of predawn raids and guns drawn and doors kicked down in the middle of the night, SWAT gear, hours and hours of hard core interrogations, screws turn, lives ruined. The money spent for about? Trump-Russia collusion was, as we always said, a hoax, a lie conceived by hate, driven by fear. A 22-month witch hunt, not into a crime, but into an individual, a person, that is Donald Trump, who became president, and everyone around him. This is not how it's supposed to work in this country. This cannot happen again. This is pretty downright despicable, and when you look at our Constitution, rule of law, application, or equal application of our laws, equal justice under the law, every American tonight should be outraged, concerned about how did we get here? Especially now that we have evidence of known crimes, massive abuse of power, which will be the focus of us in days and months going forward. Now, the full weight of America's justice system can be used to persecute a sitting president of the United States where they even tried to set the election up for the person that they loved, when that person should have been indicted. That would mean nobody in America safe. And still, as the attorney general points out, the Mueller investigation, it was not hindered in any way, not by the president, not by anybody. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As if being president isn't hard enough, the president, well, he was forced to deal with this undue burden of what is a baseless, absurd investigation that all began before he became president in July of 2016. Now, this, of course, as the mainstream media spread a constant, steady stream of lies and misinformation to the entire world about America's sitting president. A small reminder -- oh, and this will get big as days unfold. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It's now been played bear for the country in the world to see. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have watched constitutional rights trampled on, the Constitution or shredded. The rule of law, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws, frankly, is as of today, a joke. One that will have a long- standing impact on this country and our future. And the big, big question tonight is, where do we go from here? What about all the laws that we know have been broken with real evidence? Up until now, many Democrats, all these deep state operatives that have abused power and conspired against Trump and been involved in conspiracies, yes, they've gotten a free pass. Mueller spent 22 months investigating President Trump over what was a fantasy based on no evidence. Meanwhile, we have for two years on this program presented real, actual Russian campaign collusion in the 2016 election, the biggest abuse of power scandal in history. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have real collusion with real evidence. Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier was literally put together by a foreign spy, Christopher Steele. He used real Russian lies. Yes, from Russia. And why was that not investigated? Why are we not talking about that tonight? That dirty Clinton Russian dossier, which was never verified, and we now know unverifiable because his author, he can't stand by his own dossier, his own writings. The same dossier used or obtained a FISA warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate. And we now know reporters were fed and spread those Russian lies and they were spreading it to the American people before the 2016 election. That includes \"The Washington Post\", David Corn, and Michael Isikoff. We know FISA court judges, that they were lied to, frauds committed before them. They were never told about the dossier's author, hating Trump. They were never told about the hyper partisan nature, Hillary Clinton paid for it! They were never told that none of this was verified or corroborated, never told any of this. Why was Carter Page in the middle of all of this, why were his constitutional rights allowed to be violated based on Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies? Why was the Trump campaign spied on because of Clinton? Bought and paid for Russian lies? Why is none of this, why is that not been investigated? Where is a special counsel for that? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And also, we now know, thanks to \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, we now a high- ranking Ukrainian official tried to help Hillary Clinton get elected, interfere in our election. They did it by timing the release of embarrassing material about then campaign chairman Paul Manafort. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A Ukrainian court called it an illegal intrusion into the American election campaign. Why was that not investigated by Mueller? What about the Uranium One scandal? What about the whole issue of Vladimir Putin having thugs right here in America that we know were involved in bribery, extortion, kickbacks, money laundering? Why do we know? Because we had an American FBI spy inside of Putin's network telling our top law enforcement. Putin wanted a foothold in the uranium market in America, and he got it because people like Hillary Clinton and others signed off on that ridiculous -- we don't have enough uranium, we have to important, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. What about the Clinton Foundation? Oh, they ended up taking about $145 million from all those executives involved in that Uranium One deal. That was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signing off on it, her husband meeting with Vladimir Putin, three times as normal speaking fee in Russia. Why was that not investigated? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why were there, when you think about this, no criminal referrals for those associated with Clinton? Oh, that's right, none of that was investigated because as special counsel investigation was a partisan witch hunt from day one. Remember, after all, Mueller hired a team filled with big-time Clinton, Obama loving, Trump-hating Democratic donors. His top lawyer, Jeannie Rhee, literally Hillary Clinton's lawyer at the Clinton Foundation. How in good conscience did she ever get hired by Mueller? Why was Mueller's pit bull, his top prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, the guy intended Hillary Clinton's election night victory party that never transpired. He was a top investigator for Mueller from the very beginning of the investigation. And don't forget Peter Strzok, he was involved from the get-go. You know Peter Strzok, he had a girlfriend, Lisa Page, Strzok was the one who was calling Trump supporters, smelly Walmart shoppers, saying that Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero. He referred to Trump as a deplorable human being, loathsome. He saw the Russia probe as an insurance policy to stop Trump in case he wins. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And don't forget how they rigged. He was the one who interviewed Hillary Clinton and her investigation. He was writing Hillary's exoneration in May of 2016 before they did the investigation in July and he interviewed Hillary July 2nd, Comey exonerated her on July 5th and then they started investigating Donald Trump. And what about the biggest slam dunk obstruction of justice case ever? Even Alan Dershowitz couldn't get me off. I asked her might last night, if I subpoenaed 33,000 emails, I delete them, I acid wash my hard drive with Bleach Bit, and then I bust up my devices, my BlackBerries, my iPhones with hammers, removes them SIM cards, I think I would be in jail for a long time. Don't forget, we had classified and top-secret information on Hillary's secret server. What about Mueller's other investigators, other prosecutors? How many of them? They donated tens and tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats, yes, including Hillary, and Mueller hired zero, zip registered Republicans. So, we are going to find out over the weekend, maybe next week, sometime soon, this Mueller report, at least the content, to the extent we are allowed, to the extent the attorney general decides it is in his discretion and his discretion only. We're going to find out as much as we possibly can about what's in there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But know this: this is only, whatever it is, it's only one side of the story. Whatever you hear is only the prosecutorial viewpoint from what is a group of hyper-partisan Trump haters, those who are always hell-bent on bludgeoning this president, no matter what. Facts matter, truth matters. And tonight, as pointed out by Byron York, we know that Mueller did not indict Donald Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner or other people subject to the insane media hysteria speculation. As the media ever going to apologize to them? Don't hold your breath. And we know that Mueller did not charge anyone in the Trump campaign -- nobody -- and will not be charging anyone, further, with conspiring with Russia to fix the 2016 election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We know that Robert Mueller never subpoenaed the president. We know that President Trump did not fire Mueller -- we know -- as many predicted he would. We know that the president did not interfere tonight with the Mueller investigation. This was an investigation into collusion. If there is no collusion, obstruction, or conspiracy that was found, nothing else matters. No matter what these people that have been sending you lies for years tell you. But we must never forget what has happened here. A partisan witch hunt that was designed to protect their favorite presidential candidate, rigged that election when she should have been indicted. They didn't want Donald Trump to win, so then they lied and committed fraud before a FISA court, denying a fellow citizen their constitutional rights, spying on an opposition party candidate in an election year. Having it leaked to the American people, Russian lies to influence the election. And then of course, telling Donald Trump, James Comey did it, while he signs onto the FISA application in October of 2016, in January 2017, he said it's unverified and salacious. That is not what he told the FISA court. They never told a FISA court that Hillary paid for it. They never told the FISA court Christopher Steele hated Trump. They never told the FISA court that nothing is verified here. This cannot happen if we want to remain a constitutional republic. We must bring the real perpetrators of real fraud, real conspiracy, real abuse of power and corruption to justice. Where we go from here tonight matters. All of those who abuse their power, all of those who did everything in their power, that we grant them, we give to them, to first stop Donald Trump from ever being elected, and then having an insurance policy if he was elected, thinking they knew better than you, we, the American people. They thought they knew better than all of us. They all need to be held accountable as we move forward from this day on, in the days, the weeks, the months ahead. And, by the way, you in the media, I promise you, you will be eating your fake news conspiracy theories and reports and hysteria for decades to come. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now, Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz is with us and -- he's going to write his own rebuttal's books report which will be interesting. Fox News analyst, bestselling author of \"The Russia Hoax\", Gregg Jarrett, and former prosecutor Sidney Powell. I saw you earlier on earlier, Professor, with Bret Baier, and you rightly made the point, this is one side. But we do know there are no indictments. We do know that they won't be any further indictments. And that says an awful lot to me.",

None of the witnesses were cross-examined by the Trump legal team. The Trump legal team didn't have an opportunity to submit responses and answers. I would have thought the better policy would be for Attorney General Barr to withhold releasing the report for a week or 10 days, give the Trump team an opportunity to respond, and then simultaneously release both reports to the public. That's what the adversary system is about. You have a one-sided report by the prosecution and then you have a one- sided report by the defense, and then the public has the right to assess the veracity and persuasiveness of each report, and come to their own conclusion. That is what the marketplace of ideas is all about. So, I want to urge every American, if, in fact, they only produce the Mueller report -- even if it's exculpatory -- it will have some negative things, withhold final judgment until you see the Trump defense team's response. Only then can you really form a final judgment about who's right and who's wrong here.",

So I want to pick up on a couple of points, Sean, that you just made with your panelists, which is that in addition to the Special Counsel investigation, there's been a parallel investigation that's been run here at the Justice Department by the Inspector General, Michael E. Horowitz. And he's been looking at a handful of issues. One is the leaking of classified memos, classified information by senior FBI executives; also the (inaudible) gifts by those executives from members of the media and others; and then most importantly, these allegations of surveillance abuse through the FISA court in the 2016 campaign. And on that point, Fox News exclusively obtained 40 pages of text messages, I have them here, between the former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. And these text messages, Sean, show that in October of 2016, just nine days before the FISA application was granted for Carter Page, there was a lot of concern and heartburn by a senior Justice Department official about the bias of a confidential human source that was associated with the application. Based on our reporting, we believe it's the former British spy, Christopher Steele. These text messages, I'm also told tonight since our story went online, were never provided to some of the House committees that were seeking these text messages of Andrew McCabe last year. They thought that this obstructed their investigation. And finally, in the text messages, you see senior people at the FBI sharing very derogatory blogs about then-candidate Trump and even using the D word to describe the Congressman Trey Gowdy. So you can get a sense if you go online and read our story whether it's more evidence of political bias that may have infected these investigations, Sean.",

When John and I first started reporting on this - I mean, this was years ago - not only did we see that exponential increase in unmasking, but we also know and we've discovered through our stories and through our investigations that former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power has had over nearly 300 unmaskings. She even attested in testimony to Trey Gowdy that she didn't even sign off on all these. So maybe that means someone else was signing her name and unmasking people. And these would be people probably connected to the administration or people connected to the campaign.

The headline tonight is that after nearly two years of investigating Robert Mueller's probe of alleged Russian collusion is officially over with no further indictments. Even the President's critics like James Comey now acknowledging they are no longer sure there was collusion or even obstruction of justice despite all the speculation on the surface. That certainly sounds like good news for the President. It means flatly he and members of his family, close aides will not be indicted by Robert Mueller despite all the claims to the contrary by this critics. However, we still do not know the specifics of the report, and of course, it does not mean the investigations are over. As you've been talking about, Democrats run the House. They're already talking about bringing Mueller in as a sworn witness for testimony that could still be damaging to the President, that information that did not lead to an indictment but that could be considered by the House for possible impeachment down the road. Also, don't forget the Southern District here in New York, where former attorney Michael Cohen pled guilty to crimes, still investigating the Trump organization. The President and the White House, though, feel confident in talking to some of his allies that parts of this report will get to Congress and the public. But they feel confident with the new Attorney General William Barr in charge. He tipped off the White House about 4:30, 5:00 p.m. today the report was coming. Then he went to the Congressional committees in the House and Senate, told them that it was coming. Bottom line tonight, Sean, is that in talking to allies of the President in private, they're telling me that they're very confident that this report is going to show there was no collusion with the Russians. But I am picking up from some advisors to the President that they're nervous about what Robert Mueller is going to say in this report about allegations of obstruction of justice that clearly he is not going to indict the President or others around him over obstruction of justice. But they think the details of the report may suggest that Mueller believed there was some kind of obstruction but did not bring charges, I'm told, by these advisors to the President because of that longstanding Justice Department--",

      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "utterance": "Welcome to “Hannity.” We start tonight with a Fox News alert. The left's favorite conspiracy theory is now dead. It is buried. There was no collusion. No conspiracy, no obstruction, nothing. The witch hunt is over and there will be no further charges, no further indictments, after 675 days and nine months before that with the FBI investigation -- in other words, almost three years total of an intensive, virulent investigation. Robert Mueller's report has officially been submitted to the attorney general of the United States. President Trump, no more indictments. No collusion charges will be filed. No obstruction charges will be filed, and no conspiracy charges nor they be filed. Congressman Mark Meadows put it very well. The Mueller report delivery suggest that no more indictments are coming, which we now know is true, from a special counsel, and that means that we just completed two years of investigating Russia collusion without one pollution related indictment. Not even one. Instead after nearly two years, tens of millions of your tax dollars, the Mueller witch hunt only managed to prosecute, oh, a few people for process crimes. Let's see, Papadopoulos' big 12 days in jail, lying to prosecutors, military hero lieutenant general Michael Flynn has not been sentenced. He nearly went bankrupt, how to sell his home because of mounting legal bills. With both McCabe and Comey, the FBI director and deputy director, admitting and bragging that they set him up, something they would never do any Obama or Clinton administrations. And we have Roger Stone, he's going bankrupt, facing trial for allegedly lying to Congress and harassing a witness. Michael Cohen, of course, we know his case, pleading guilty to lying to congress, other crimes related to taxicab medallions, and bank applications fraud and taxes. And Paul Manafort, oh, he may spend the rest of his life in prison because of taxes and, again, lying on bank loan applications. What do they all have in common? Nothing, zero, to do with Trump, the campaign, Russia, or collusion. Mueller also indicated dozens of Russians -- indicted in this case, Russian nationals, they will never come here. They're never going to be extradited. Many were Russian spies or Russian bot companies, they will never, ever face trial or be extradited to the United States. Putin, the bad actor he is, Russia, the bad nation they are, they're never going to allow it to happen. None of these charges involve camping collusion whatsoever. We have plenty of predawn raids and guns drawn and doors kicked down in the middle of the night, SWAT gear, hours and hours of hard core interrogations, screws turn, lives ruined. The money spent for about? Trump-Russia collusion was, as we always said, a hoax, a lie conceived by hate, driven by fear. A 22-month witch hunt, not into a crime, but into an individual, a person, that is Donald Trump, who became president, and everyone around him. This is not how it's supposed to work in this country. This cannot happen again. This is pretty downright despicable, and when you look at our Constitution, rule of law, application, or equal application of our laws, equal justice under the law, every American tonight should be outraged, concerned about how did we get here? Especially now that we have evidence of known crimes, massive abuse of power, which will be the focus of us in days and months going forward. Now, the full weight of America's justice system can be used to persecute a sitting president of the United States where they even tried to set the election up for the person that they loved, when that person should have been indicted. That would mean nobody in America safe. And still, as the attorney general points out, the Mueller investigation, it was not hindered in any way, not by the president, not by anybody. As if being president isn't hard enough, the president, well, he was forced to deal with this undue burden of what is a baseless, absurd investigation that all began before he became president in July of 2016. Now, this, of course, as the mainstream media spread a constant, steady stream of lies and misinformation to the entire world about America's sitting president. A small reminder -- oh, and this will get big as days unfold. Take a look."

      "utterance": "You can see the disappointment. Oh, it's got to be killing them. I can almost taste their tears from here. Years and years of breathless hysteria, lies presented as facts and truth. What do Rachel Maddow and all the other MSNBC conspiracy theorists, what are they going to cover now? What does fake news CNN, where they find their content now? What old Chuck Todd at night be dreaming of? Now, I'm sure per usual, they will find other fake, anti-Trump conspiracies to push, all while never apologizing for outright lies, breathless, hysterical coverage, day after day, night after night. We've been right all along. The president has been vindicated, but so much damage has already been done. We now have our partisan two-tiered system of justice that we have been warning you about. It's now been played bear for the country in the world to see. We have watched constitutional rights trampled on, the Constitution or shredded. The rule of law, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws, frankly, is as of today, a joke. One that will have a long- standing impact on this country and our future. And the big, big question tonight is, where do we go from here? What about all the laws that we know have been broken with real evidence? Up until now, many Democrats, all these deep state operatives that have abused power and conspired against Trump and been involved in conspiracies, yes, they've gotten a free pass. Mueller spent 22 months investigating President Trump over what was a fantasy based on no evidence. Meanwhile, we have for two years on this program presented real, actual Russian campaign collusion in the 2016 election, the biggest abuse of power scandal in history. We have real collusion with real evidence. Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier was literally put together by a foreign spy, Christopher Steele. He used real Russian lies. Yes, from Russia. And why was that not investigated? Why are we not talking about that tonight? That dirty Clinton Russian dossier, which was never verified, and we now know unverifiable because his author, he can't stand by his own dossier, his own writings. The same dossier used or obtained a FISA warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate. And we now know reporters were fed and spread those Russian lies and they were spreading it to the American people before the 2016 election. That includes \"The Washington Post\", David Corn, and Michael Isikoff. We know FISA court judges, that they were lied to, frauds committed before them. They were never told about the dossier's author, hating Trump. They were never told about the hyper partisan nature, Hillary Clinton paid for it! They were never told that none of this was verified or corroborated, never told any of this. Why was Carter Page in the middle of all of this, why were his constitutional rights allowed to be violated based on Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies? Why was the Trump campaign spied on because of Clinton? Bought and paid for Russian lies? Why is none of this, why is that not been investigated? Where is a special counsel for that? And also, we now know, thanks to \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, we now a high- ranking Ukrainian official tried to help Hillary Clinton get elected, interfere in our election. They did it by timing the release of embarrassing material about then campaign chairman Paul Manafort. A Ukrainian court called it an illegal intrusion into the American election campaign. Why was that not investigated by Mueller? What about the Uranium One scandal? What about the whole issue of Vladimir Putin having thugs right here in America that we know were involved in bribery, extortion, kickbacks, money laundering? Why do we know? Because we had an American FBI spy inside of Putin's network telling our top law enforcement. Putin wanted a foothold in the uranium market in America, and he got it because people like Hillary Clinton and others signed off on that ridiculous -- we don't have enough uranium, we have to important, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. What about the Clinton Foundation? Oh, they ended up taking about $145 million from all those executives involved in that Uranium One deal. That was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signing off on it, her husband meeting with Vladimir Putin, three times as normal speaking fee in Russia. Why was that not investigated? Why were there, when you think about this, no criminal referrals for those associated with Clinton? Oh, that's right, none of that was investigated because as special counsel investigation was a partisan witch hunt from day one. Remember, after all, Mueller hired a team filled with big-time Clinton, Obama loving, Trump-hating Democratic donors. His top lawyer, Jeannie Rhee, literally Hillary Clinton's lawyer at the Clinton Foundation. How in good conscience did she ever get hired by Mueller? Why was Mueller's pit bull, his top prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, the guy intended Hillary Clinton's election night victory party that never transpired. He was a top investigator for Mueller from the very beginning of the investigation. And don't forget Peter Strzok, he was involved from the get-go. You know Peter Strzok, he had a girlfriend, Lisa Page, Strzok was the one who was calling Trump supporters, smelly Walmart shoppers, saying that Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero. He referred to Trump as a deplorable human being, loathsome. He saw the Russia probe as an insurance policy to stop Trump in case he wins. And don't forget how they rigged. He was the one who interviewed Hillary Clinton and her investigation. He was writing Hillary's exoneration in May of 2016 before they did the investigation in July and he interviewed Hillary July 2nd, Comey exonerated her on July 5th and then they started investigating Donald Trump. And what about the biggest slam dunk obstruction of justice case ever? Even Alan Dershowitz couldn't get me off. I asked her might last night, if I subpoenaed 33,000 emails, I delete them, I acid wash my hard drive with Bleach Bit, and then I bust up my devices, my BlackBerries, my iPhones with hammers, removes them SIM cards, I think I would be in jail for a long time. Don't forget, we had classified and top-secret information on Hillary's secret server. What about Mueller's other investigators, other prosecutors? How many of them? They donated tens and tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats, yes, including Hillary, and Mueller hired zero, zip registered Republicans. So, we are going to find out over the weekend, maybe next week, sometime soon, this Mueller report, at least the content, to the extent we are allowed, to the extent the attorney general decides it is in his discretion and his discretion only. We're going to find out as much as we possibly can about what's in there."

    {
      "speaker": "But know this",
      "utterance": "this is only, whatever it is, it's only one side of the story. Whatever you hear is only the prosecutorial viewpoint from what is a group of hyper-partisan Trump haters, those who are always hell-bent on bludgeoning this president, no matter what. Facts matter, truth matters. And tonight, as pointed out by Byron York, we know that Mueller did not indict Donald Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner or other people subject to the insane media hysteria speculation. As the media ever going to apologize to them? Don't hold your breath. And we know that Mueller did not charge anyone in the Trump campaign -- nobody -- and will not be charging anyone, further, with conspiring with Russia to fix the 2016 election. We know that Robert Mueller never subpoenaed the president. We know that President Trump did not fire Mueller -- we know -- as many predicted he would. We know that the president did not interfere tonight with the Mueller investigation. This was an investigation into collusion. If there is no collusion, obstruction, or conspiracy that was found, nothing else matters. No matter what these people that have been sending you lies for years tell you. But we must never forget what has happened here. A partisan witch hunt that was designed to protect their favorite presidential candidate, rigged that election when she should have been indicted. They didn't want Donald Trump to win, so then they lied and committed fraud before a FISA court, denying a fellow citizen their constitutional rights, spying on an opposition party candidate in an election year. Having it leaked to the American people, Russian lies to influence the election. And then of course, telling Donald Trump, James Comey did it, while he signs onto the FISA application in October of 2016, in January 2017, he said it's unverified and salacious. That is not what he told the FISA court. They never told a FISA court that Hillary paid for it. They never told the FISA court Christopher Steele hated Trump. They never told the FISA court that nothing is verified here. This cannot happen if we want to remain a constitutional republic. We must bring the real perpetrators of real fraud, real conspiracy, real abuse of power and corruption to justice. Where we go from here tonight matters. All of those who abuse their power, all of those who did everything in their power, that we grant them, we give to them, to first stop Donald Trump from ever being elected, and then having an insurance policy if he was elected, thinking they knew better than you, we, the American people. They thought they knew better than all of us. They all need to be held accountable as we move forward from this day on, in the days, the weeks, the months ahead. And, by the way, you in the media, I promise you, you will be eating your fake news conspiracy theories and reports and hysteria for decades to come. Joining us now, Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz is with us and -- he's going to write his own rebuttal's books report which will be interesting. Fox News analyst, bestselling author of \"The Russia Hoax\", Gregg Jarrett, and former prosecutor Sidney Powell. I saw you earlier on earlier, Professor, with Bret Baier, and you rightly made the point, this is one side. But we do know there are no indictments. We do know that they won't be any further indictments. And that says an awful lot to me."

      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "It does. But, you know, the report will be very critical of the Trump administration and of President Trump. We have to remember, it's a completely one-sided report. None of the witnesses were cross-examined by the Trump legal team. The Trump legal team didn't have an opportunity to submit responses and answers. I would have thought the better policy would be for Attorney General Barr to withhold releasing the report for a week or 10 days, give the Trump team an opportunity to respond, and then simultaneously release both reports to the public. That's what the adversary system is about. You have a one-sided report by the prosecution and then you have a one- sided report by the defense, and then the public has the right to assess the veracity and persuasiveness of each report, and come to their own conclusion. That is what the marketplace of ideas is all about. So, I want to urge every American, if, in fact, they only produce the Mueller report -- even if it's exculpatory -- it will have some negative things, withhold final judgment until you see the Trump defense team's response. Only then can you really form a final judgment about who's right and who's wrong here."

And here we now have word from the Department of Justice, there will be no more indictments, which means nobody was ever charged with a Russian pollution-related crime like conspiracy. There should never have been, as I argue in my book, and investigation by the FBI. We learned just days ago from Lisa Page in her closed her testimony, she admitted readily, we didn't have any evidence of collusion when we launched the probe. And nine months later with a special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed, we still didn't have any collusion. Go back and look at Comey's testimony, which also was behind closed doors. He confessed to the exact same thing. So, here we are two and half years later, God knows how many millions of dollars spent, but I feel, for the people, and I talked to six of them, who are subject to interrogation by Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors -- they were browbeat, they were pressured into lying, to saying things that were not true to incriminate other people, that is not just unconscionable for a prosecutor to do, but in fact, it's an attempt to suborned perjury.

Lying to a FISA court, a committing a fraud on purpose, we know Bruce Ohr testified. He warned everybody. Steele hates Trump, Hillary paid for it, it's unverified. Now we know it's unverifiable because Steele says I have no idea if it's true. So, there's no way the FBI could have verified it. But they signed off on it.

An objective, nonpartisan investigation, open to the public, not behind closed doors, not one-sided, so that everybody in America could see what went wrong with the 2016 election in terms of Russia's attempt to influence it, and make sure we can prevent it in the future. That's what commissions are supposed to look into. But when you make somebody into a prosecutor, they are not interested in the truth.

So I want to pick up on a couple of points, Sean, that you just made with your panelists, which is that in addition to the Special Counsel investigation, there's been a parallel investigation that's been run here at the Justice Department by the Inspector General, Michael E. Horowitz. And he's been looking at a handful of issues. One is the leaking of classified memos, classified information by senior FBI executives; also the (inaudible) gifts by those executives from members of the media and others; and then most importantly, these allegations of surveillance abuse through the FISA court in the 2016 campaign. And on that point, Fox News exclusively obtained 40 pages of text messages, I have them here, between the former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. And these text messages, Sean, show that in October of 2016, just nine days before the FISA application was granted for Carter Page, there was a lot of concern and heartburn by a senior Justice Department official about the bias of a confidential human source that was associated with the application. Based on our reporting, we believe it's the former British spy, Christopher Steele. These text messages, I'm also told tonight since our story went online, were never provided to some of the House committees that were seeking these text messages of Andrew McCabe last year. They thought that this obstructed their investigation. And finally, in the text messages, you see senior people at the FBI sharing very derogatory blogs about then-candidate Trump and even using the D word to describe the Congressman Trey Gowdy. So you can get a sense if you go online and read our story whether it's more evidence of political bias that may have infected these investigations, Sean."

Joining us now, The Hill's John Solomon and Fox News contributor Sara Carter. House Minority Whip Congressman Steve Scalise is with us. It's interesting what Catherine said. But John and Sara, both of you began this journey into this whole abuse of power corruption scandal, which I argue is the biggest in history, with the abuse of intelligence. Now, according to Catherine, we're going back to that. John, you wrote a great column today, \"The wisdom of Trump's lawyers and the accountability for the Mueller report.\" Lot of good you found out of it, no matter whatever innuendo might be in there tonight, next week or over the weekend."

So I think that's going to turn out to be one of the most important things that happened here. But when this is all said and done, what your last panel just talked about is the most important thing. If we don't want a repeat of this in history, accountability has to be handed out to all the people who pulled off this ruse."

And remember, we talked about the weaponization of the intelligence community. And that's why it's so imperative that it be investigated. When John and I first started reporting on this - I mean, this was years ago - not only did we see that exponential increase in unmasking, but we also know and we've discovered through our stories and through our investigations that former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power has had over nearly 300 unmaskings. She even attested in testimony to Trey Gowdy that she didn't even sign off on all these. So maybe that means someone else was signing her name and unmasking people. And these would be people probably connected to the administration or people connected to the campaign. So this is something that still needs to be investigated. This is abuse of our system and abuse of our intelligence apparatus. There is no other word to describe this.

It's not in question. But we also now know about Ukrainian attempts to influence the election to favor Hillary.

Obviously, the report's got to come out. If it turns out like we're hearing that there aren't going to be further indictments, the number one, it does vindicate President Trump, but also raises and gives credence to those claims that this was a witch-hunt. And Sean, I'd like to see not only the report be made public, but how many tens of millions of taxpayer dollars were spent over nearly two years to meander around and, as you say, bully people if there was no collusion, which was the intent of the Mueller investigation. By the way, what about people like Adam Schiff who said two years ago that there was more than circumstantial evidence of collusion?

Democrats expect this to be a dud, a dud. This is why Adam Schiff is so adamant about moving forward with investigations on his own, that have nothing to do with Russia. He wants to push forward and investigate everything Trump, from his taxes to his family. I don't think the American people are going to buy this. I think this is over. And I think, as far as when the report comes out and it does become public, it will really be in the hands then when it goes public to the President. And for President Trump to come out, and of course, he'll have to come out and make a statement, but to say it's time for this country to move on. And - but the next thing is, of course, there has to be an investigation into what happened here so that it never happens again.

      "utterance": "Sean, good to see you. The headline tonight is that after nearly two years of investigating Robert Mueller's probe of alleged Russian collusion is officially over with no further indictments. Even the President's critics like James Comey now acknowledging they are no longer sure there was collusion or even obstruction of justice despite all the speculation on the surface. That certainly sounds like good news for the President. It means flatly he and members of his family, close aides will not be indicted by Robert Mueller despite all the claims to the contrary by this critics. However, we still do not know the specifics of the report, and of course, it does not mean the investigations are over. As you've been talking about, Democrats run the House. They're already talking about bringing Mueller in as a sworn witness for testimony that could still be damaging to the President, that information that did not lead to an indictment but that could be considered by the House for possible impeachment down the road. Also, don't forget the Southern District here in New York, where former attorney Michael Cohen pled guilty to crimes, still investigating the Trump organization. The President and the White House, though, feel confident in talking to some of his allies that parts of this report will get to Congress and the public. But they feel confident with the new Attorney General William Barr in charge. He tipped off the White House about 4:30, 5:00 p.m. today the report was coming. Then he went to the Congressional committees in the House and Senate, told them that it was coming. Bottom line tonight, Sean, is that in talking to allies of the President in private, they're telling me that they're very confident that this report is going to show there was no collusion with the Russians. But I am picking up from some advisors to the President that they're nervous about what Robert Mueller is going to say in this report about allegations of obstruction of justice that clearly he is not going to indict the President or others around him over obstruction of justice. But they think the details of the report may suggest that Mueller believed there was some kind of obstruction but did not bring charges, I'm told, by these advisors to the President because of that longstanding Justice Department--"

But when we look at FISA abuse, we look the malfeasance at the highest echelons within the Department of Justice, he is going to be the one to do that.

Innuendo? Maybe people shouldn't have sat in a meeting or this piece of paper didn't look good? What?"

Just looking at the team that he put together. But a lot of people should be worried tonight in the deep state. All right. When we come back, don't go anywhere, lot more reaction to tonight's big breaking news. The Mueller report is in. there will be no further indictments coming. There are a lot of media people, the hate-Trump media mob, they're crying. Right now, they're so upset. They've been lying to you for over two years. Straight ahead."

Joining us now with more reaction, Media Reporter for The Hill, also WOR news/talk radio host, Joe Concha, and Fox News contributor, former pollster, Doug Schoen. Actually it was told, Joe, that somebody said, Bill Barr made this happen. Bill Barr stopped Mueller from doing his job. And actually, if you look at it, oh, Mueller's actions weren't blocked by anybody. Is this now their way of admitting, \"Oh, we lied to you for over three years and we're sorry?\" Maybe I'm misinterpreting it."

I mean, remember hearing that story over and over again. And clearly, that didn't happen. Look, this was always called the Russia investigation for a reason. It was in every (inaudible) those words below me, it's in every headline, every lead paragraph. And when you take Russia out of Russian investigation, it loses its impact. So you ask me, will they apologize? That would mean putting aside ego. You'll get the Hubers (ph) of the defeated instead for those who pushed this narrative. And what's going to happen? No apology. There'll simply be a pivot to whatever is most negative towards the President next. No apologies here because egos don't allow for that, Sean."

      "utterance": "Yes. And I think from what I saw today from Adam Schiff and his colleagues, that's precisely where they're going. Look, this is a big win for Donald Trump, but it's also a big win for him vis-.-vis 2020. It proves his case. And with the Democrats keep going, Sean, as they may well, that's going to just play at their hands of overreach that we saw in 1998 when the Starr Report was used unsuccessfully by the Republicans.
