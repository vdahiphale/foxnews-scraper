If you wear a mask, stay six feet apart and follow the rules, you are safe to get back in the classroom. That's the latest finding from researchers at the CDC, who say transmission within schools has been, quote, very rare. They cite data from several studies including this one out of Wisconsin where spread between students was, quote, limited and no staff members contracted COVID at work. Researchers also writing there is, quote, little evidence that schools contribute to spread within the larger community as long as safety protocols are followed. The new guidance comes, as teachers' unions across the nation insists classrooms are too dangerous to return to. In Chicago, for example, a strike is now looming with faculty members insisting only a vaccine will make their workplace safe."

We very much appreciate it. Alex, to you first. You just heard in the intro there, the White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain saying, look, the teachers' unions are not overruling science, but in fact, that's exactly what they're doing because all of these studies that are being cited show that you give students masks and you keep them six feet apart, and there's virtually no spread. Your thoughts."

The unions have discovered that this is something that they can use, I guess, to get more gains for their members in other ways. And they are playing extremely hard on this. And it has nothing to do with the science. The science says that children, especially any child who's healthy enough to go to school, is at essentially no risk, you know, from serious consequences for COVID. This has been clear, you know, almost -- for almost a year now. The science also says, and this has been clear, you know, for months and months, too, that schools are not a major vector of transmission. And in a country like France, OK, the schools in France have essentially remained open almost since April or May of last year, the epidemic has waxed and waned in France as everywhere else. Guess why the schools are open there. The schools are open there, because the teachers are actually committed to teaching their kids in person. And then unions want that; they don't want remote learning. And so, even in a place with really strong unions, the schools are open."

I mean, the studies in South Karolina showing that kids are actually safer, better off in school than they are within the larger community. The Washington Post Karol wrote this, this op ed, you know, saying teachers are vital public servants, and they should, for the time, start acting like, quoting, \"cops and firefighters, nurses and National Guard troops, mail carriers, and DMV workers, spies and bureaucrats have been back on the job for months and never left. They show their courage and dedication every day, assuming some risk for themselves and their families. Our teachers are needed, too.\" What do you think?"

And they are wanting to get all this money from the Biden administration. And that will be how they bring back the kids. But I also want to bring back to the point of masks and social distancing. The schools that aren't open right now are generally in major metropolises across the country. And in those places, it doesn't matter how much money you rain down on them, you're not going to be able to social distance six feet in every direction and have schools open full time. So, I'm almost worried about these studies that the Biden administration is kind of pushing because it will lead to part time school in September, something I've been worried about for a while. Yes, we talked about, you know, the mental health of students. I want you to listen to this mom, mother of four Chicago public schools. We talked to her earlier this week and she said this. Listen."

But we have some overdose data coming in, and it is terrible. And, you know, that's teens through people in their 50s. But, you know, I'm hearing -- look, I get a lot of e-mail, right? Because, you know, I'm sort of on Twitter and people know who I am. And it's parents e-mail me, college students e-mail me, high school students e-mail me. And they are, you know, as we're heading into a full 12 months of this, people are starting to really lose hope, and they don't understand. I mean, yes, it's nice to hear that police and firefighters are working. How about -- how about the -- how about the clerk at your local grocery store or Walmart? How about -- you know, how about anybody who works at a mall? Like, why isn't that teachers are, you know, are so much better than everybody else that they don't have to work? I don't understand, or they get to choose exactly where they work from. Teaching is an in-person job. It's always been an in-person job. And there's good reason for that.

The department claims they have spoken to both the intelligence community and law enforcement and that all are in agreement. This threat is real, and it is imminent. Let's pull up the bulletin. It says, quote, \"Information that suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite violence or commit violence.\" Now, the rub here is that DHS says they don't have any evidence of a specific or a credible plot. But this terror warning does match up with a recent decision by the FBI and Secret Service to keep a couple thousand National Guard troops here in D.C. through the end of March. Now, the Capitol Police have basically admitted to failing to protect the Capitol from an invasion on January 6th. Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan was in that meeting, and he says, keeping the guard in D.C. for a few more months is a good call. Listen."

What we're not addressing are the two biggest polluters on the planet, China and India. So, what we're doing, we're surrendering our sovereignty as it comes to conservation policy, to the globalist, and it's not really affecting the polluters. I'll tell you who's proud of it. Russia is excited, they're going to be able to sell more of their energy and get back in the market after taking a beating since we became energy independent.

Is that inciting people to violence if you're willing to pay people to get out of jail after they've already committed violence? Should Kamala Harris be impeached? So, no, the answer is no. We would never do that because we're reasonable people. The Democrats are wanting to impeach the president because they're deranged with hatred and bitterness. But the President never said anything close to what Kamala Harris did. She -- the president never said anything close to what Bernie Sanders did, in saying, Well, the Republican plan is you get sick and die. Well, that incited one of his followers to almost kill Steve Scalise, wound four or five others, and nearly have a massacre of 20 congressmen because he was incited by intemperate words of Democrats. But none of us would have said they should have been impeached.

I've made very reasonable arguments against many of the President's positions on a series of very important issues. Scarborough has no clue because he's become deranged and surrounded himself with sycophants. So, he has no idea of what's going on. And all he does is call names.

I want to go in; see the evidence. And then, I'll make up my mind. Any chance, Andy, in your estimation that they can convince what appears to be 12 more senators to jump on board with this?"

      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

And that gives every Republican who took that position the out to say, it's not a question of how bad the facts are. It's not a question about whether I'm against violence. Of course, I'm against violence. Of course, I'm against the siege of the Capitol. The Constitution doesn't permit this. So, that's sort of the I think, safe legal position that they're trying to gravitate to."

Now, I think we may have talked about this before I prosecuted an incitement case against terrorists in the 1990s. It's a very tough proof. I don't think there's a case there.

In other words, if the outcome of the trial is already obvious, which we have just discussed, it might be, which I believe yesterday's vote shows clearly there is no possibility of conviction if you have that many, 45 Republicans believing that the trial itself is unconstitutional. Then the question is, is there another way to express condemnation of the President's activities with regard to the riot and the pressure that he put on state officials? She's talking about censure.

This is very typical language coming from not only the largest economy in Europe, the Germans, but also from many in Europe. I think the troubling sign here is that the Biden administration goes back to their typical language of happy talk, and pretending like somehow consensus is just a meeting that we're supposed to have. And it's very difficult when you look at the issues that China has been pushing. You look at the Huawei issue. You look at TikTok and the nervousness that many Western governments have, with Communist China bringing in their data. And facial recognition around the corner, the push from irresponsible facial recognition companies in China. We've got a lot of issues and if the Biden team is looking closely at this, I think they're going to be very surprised going forward."

This is a Western alliance. And I think when you look at NATO spending, when you look at Nord Stream 2 what the Germans have been doing in terms of buying Russian gas. This is the problem, is that the Western alliance is fraying not because America has been doing something different, but because little by little, we've seen the Western alliance fray from the Western side of Europe. The Europeans, little by little, had been moving away from us. And I think when Donald Trump put his foot down and said, if you care about the Western alliance, you got to act Western. You got to pick the Western side and for the Chancellor of Germany, on the Day of International Remembrance of the Holocaust, for her to somehow say that she doesn't know which side she's on between Communist China and the United States, that's very, very troubling.

This is one of hundreds of restaurants in Westchester County and hundreds of thousands across the country that will likely have to deal with higher wages. As you said, Bernie Sanders introducing legislation yesterday that would effectively double the minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25, previously the first increase in 10 years. And one big secret about that law, guess what, they want to put in cost of living adjustment and adjustment based on median wages. A lot of people not paying attention to that big impacts there. But for impacts to restaurants, generally, let's turn to Scott Broccoli. He is the owner operator of Rare Bit. Scott, you face this in San Francisco, saw the minimum wage rise.

Let's bring in Andrew Puzder, former CEO of CKE Restaurants and author of it's time to let America work again. Andy, you know, this, as Gerri was just saying, this conversation has been going on for years. In fact, it went back in the archives and I found a restaurant tour in New York owns a chain of restaurants who said the following. Her name is Nora Brodsky. He said, our restaurants will no longer be viable if labor costs rise above 35% of revenue. And no, we can't just jack up prices and pass the additional cost along to customers. There are real limits to what people will pay. You heard him. And then along with the rest of the tour that we just talked to, Gerri Willis, just talk to what's your consensus?"

Small businesses are dropping like flies, they're closing every day and the jobs go with them. And the people that work at those restaurants, their minimum wage become zero. You can't shut it down when you're coming out of a recession. You can't increase labor costs. Bernie Sanders knows perfectly well that nobody is out there making $7.25 an hour. You can't hire an employee for less than $11 or $12 an hour right now, despite what the federal minimum wage is. This is political. Now, you know, Gerri mentioned that Congressional Budget Office reports saying that they lose 1.3 million jobs, that was the median number. They said you could lose up to 3.7 million jobs. And a report came out on Monday of this week looking at the research on the minimum wage by the National Bureau of Economic Research, again, a nonpartisan group, and they said it kills low wage jobs. So you're going to kill small businesses, you're going to kill low wage jobs. You're going to hurt American workers. Sanders knows it, this is political. I don't even think they actually want to pass it. I think they prefer if Republicans prevented it."

    {
      "speaker": "PUZDER",
      "utterance": "You know, really, that's where it should be done. It should be done at the state level or at the city level. You know, Florida is a very prosperous state right now. They've got people moving there from all over the country to get away from high taxes in states like New York. California has been a very prosperous state. I mean, you can raise the minimum wage in San Francisco to $15 an hour and people aren't probably aren't going to notice. You go 80 miles east to Stockton and it'll hurt. So, state level is fine, better at the city level, but I would point out that Florida did not raise their wage to $15 an hour this year. It goes to $15 an hour by 2026."

    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "You know what I hear, and that business owners say a lot of times whenever they talk about raising minimum wage, we start looking at things like automation and outsourcing, right? I mean, some of these restaurants are already in the of COVID going toward a lot of automation, which is in essence going to cost some jobs down the road."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PUZDER",
      "utterance": "You know, that's absolutely right. You can't pay people more than what they produce for your business. In other words, if you bring somebody in there, you know, they're an entry level employee, they probably don't produce anything at first. After a couple months, maybe they're producing $7, $8, $9 benefit for your business an hour. Well, you can't pay them $15 an hour, so you try and find some other way to accomplish that task. Either you hire fewer people, or you try and hire experienced people who are actually worth a higher wage, or you automate. If you can automate your automate because it's less expensive. So, that's what a minimum wage will do. It will kill small businesses, which we need right now, and it will kill jobs, which we've got 10.7 million people unemployed, another 7 million that aren't in the labor force but want a job now. That's 18 million people looking for jobs coming out of this pandemic recession. We need to find jobs for them. We don't need to kill those jobs."

I mean, it's not Trump pushback by any stretch, but there is some pushback against the Biden ministration especially about this vaccine rollout. HOWARD KURTZ, \"MEDIA BUZZ\" HOST: Absolutely. The press has been openly challenging President Biden and Press Secretary Jen Psaki about the botched vaccine rollout and why Biden initially set the goal so low, it's just a few days ago that Biden snapped in an AP reporter who asked about the goal. And that pressure, I believe, caused him to throw out the 150 million shots in 100 days rather than 100 million. Look, Biden's only been in office a week, he's not a miracle worker. But at the same time, the media are essentially not buying the argument that this is all Donald Trump's fault. Governors also bear some responsibility, by the way. And I believe that has caused a new president to have to modify his approach."

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That was a mistake. But, look, it doesn't take an army of investigative reporters to know that this vaccine rollout is incredibly frustrating beyond the lack of availability of doses, the sheer process of registering is either confusing or impossible, or you spend endless hours online being bounced from one website to another. And I think that for many millions of Americans, this has been an awful experience the media kind of challenging that frustration. And, by the way, Biden also told reporters that any American who wants a vaccine will be able to get it by the spring. Jen Psaki had to walk that back because Anthony Fauci and other scientists saying it's going to take till the summer or even the fall."
    },

They also had a whole bunch of liberals including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and others, that was fine. A hundred political writers have written to the editor demanding an apology, and changing and this was terrible, all over one guy, one conservative, one day. And Politico, to its credit, said no. We want a diversity of voices, but it does show you how newsrooms have changed. Just one other quick point on the press, and Biden, and Trump, clearly, there's not the same hostile tone as with President Trump and his press secretaries compared to President Biden and Jen Psaki. And I think the reasons are one, Jen Psaki takes a more conciliatory approach. We're not hearing any talk of fake news. Also, Biden is not under investigation or impeachment at the moment. But also, perhaps most importantly, there was such a visceral dislike by so many journalists against Donald Trump. And what we're seeing now is things are becoming a little bit more adversarial with Biden, not just on the pandemic on a whole bunch of issues, because when you sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office, you own these issues."
