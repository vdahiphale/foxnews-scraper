      "sentences": "Happy Thursday, everyone. What a great show we got tonight. As you know, just hours after our All American Christmas tree was torched by a babbling madman. Not to be confused with Geraldo. A new tree was erected and it looks absolutely fabulous. So a big thank you to that adorable tiny elf Dana Perino and her tiny little elf friends. They worked all nights. It's almost as fabulous looking as Gerald Ford Jr. Yes. Like to welcome his support to his first time on the show. You need a new agent. This show kills more jobs than China. But it's a tribute to the spirit of the people who work here and deliver this magnificent show. You can burn down the damn tree and we're going to just put up another and by we, I mean not me. Other people did it. I didn't put it back up. The only thing I know how to put up is a two-way bathroom mirror. But also just hours after the Fox Christmas tree was torched by a babbling madman, the babbling madman was released. CNN anchors now face more punishment than arsonists. You win universe. Also, here's the funny side story. A photographer told the New York Post that the arsonist had allegedly exposed himself to reporters outside the Ghislaine Maxwell trial in Manhattan last week. OK, that's not a funny side story. But at least we found something Joe DeVito and the arsonist have in common. Thanks to this madman, we're learning how many crimes you can get away with. Showing your junk and burning people stuff. What Kilmeade calls a Tuesday. That I won't say the Christmas creeps name because that's what he really wants. And also it's very hard to pronounce. Is it -- is it Doocy or is it is Doocy, but it's true, it's Doocy. The is the arsonist who torch the Fox News Christmas tree was freed after his arraignment on Wednesday night. Because his charges were not eligible for bail under new liberal reform laws. He has a better chance of facing consequences from Smokey the Bear. Who could have seen this coming? Well, we all did.",

It's like a weatherman who says hey, you see that category five off the coast of New Jersey and moving west at 25 miles per hour? I think you should all get the hell out of there. And no one moves. That's our government. You can say to them, look, you're releasing FINS that are about to reoffend. And like Kat confronted with a simple math problem. They just stare blankly. And then of course, the FINS reoffend. I could go through the examples of the violent felons sprung from jail, thanks to bail reform, but there are so many of them that would take up the entire show and bleed literally into the next hour. And the last thing I want to do is piss off evil Shannon Bream. But it's old news. Another violent criminal is let loose to beat up another woman sucker punch and other elderly Asian burned down a Christmas tree. That's how it works. The justice system exists now to keep criminals safe from consequences. I mean, here's a typical scene playing out all over.",

So the last few days, it show you what's good and what's bad about the world. This is stuff Colbert or CNN don't understand. Along with others who are walled off from the consequences of unchecked crime. Thanks to a progressive perversion of incentives, criminals react to them, as you would expect them to. These people are lawless, but they're not dumb, meaning of consequences no longer exists for crime, they will commit more crime. And prison was once the disincentive and it worked. Which is why we got rid of it. We are now pissing on the grave of common sense. Now we were lucky that no one died that the night of that -- of the arson. But I prefer counting on justice and not luck. It's why I avoid casinos. So the madman walks, which sends a message to others like him. Repercussions no longer exists for the most disgusting behavior whether it's assault, murder or arson. But there's good news, the tree is back up. And like me, it looks great. And if you keep burning it down, we'll just put up another. That's the real holiday spirit. And we need more of it now than ever.",

Not to be confused with Geraldo. A new tree was erected and it looks absolutely fabulous. So a big thank you to that adorable tiny elf Dana Perino and her tiny little elf friends. They worked all nights. It's almost as fabulous looking as Gerald Ford Jr. Yes. Like to welcome his support to his first time on the show. You need a new agent. This show kills more jobs than China. But it's a tribute to the spirit of the people who work here and deliver this magnificent show. You can burn down the damn tree and we're going to just put up another and by we, I mean not me. Other people did it. I didn't put it back up. The only thing I know how to put up is a two-way bathroom mirror. But also just hours after the Fox Christmas tree was torched by a babbling madman, the babbling madman was released. CNN anchors now face more punishment than arsonists. You win universe. Also, here's the funny side story. A photographer told the New York Post that the arsonist had allegedly exposed himself to reporters outside the Ghislaine Maxwell trial in Manhattan last week. OK, that's not a funny side story. But at least we found something Joe DeVito and the arsonist have in common. Thanks to this madman, we're learning how many crimes you can get away with. Showing your junk and burning people stuff. What Kilmeade calls a Tuesday. That I won't say the Christmas creeps name because that's what he really wants. And also it's very hard to pronounce. Is it -- is it Doocy or is it is Doocy, but it's true, it's Doocy. The is the arsonist who torch the Fox News Christmas tree was freed after his arraignment on Wednesday night. Because his charges were not eligible for bail under new liberal reform laws. He has a better chance of facing consequences from Smokey the Bear. Who could have seen this coming? Well, we all did."

It's like a weatherman who says hey, you see that category five off the coast of New Jersey and moving west at 25 miles per hour? I think you should all get the hell out of there. And no one moves. That's our government. You can say to them, look, you're releasing FINS that are about to reoffend. And like Kat confronted with a simple math problem. They just stare blankly. And then of course, the FINS reoffend. I could go through the examples of the violent felons sprung from jail, thanks to bail reform, but there are so many of them that would take up the entire show and bleed literally into the next hour. And the last thing I want to do is piss off evil Shannon Bream. But it's old news. Another violent criminal is let loose to beat up another woman sucker punch and other elderly Asian burned down a Christmas tree. That's how it works.

For CNN, the attack is merely an opportunity to wag your swollen finger at the people who are kicking your ass every night. How imbecilic, yes, arson is indeed bed, but you didn't care about January 6. What a miserable wretch. You got any dumber she could fill Chris Cuomo's seats. Justice seat. So the last few days, it show you what's good and what's bad about the world. This is stuff Colbert or CNN don't understand. Along with others who are walled off from the consequences of unchecked crime. Thanks to a progressive perversion of incentives, criminals react to them, as you would expect them to. These people are lawless, but they're not dumb, meaning of consequences no longer exists for crime, they will commit more crime. And prison was once the disincentive and it worked. Which is why we got rid of it. We are now pissing on the grave of common sense. Now we were lucky that no one died that the night of that -- of the arson. But I prefer counting on justice and not luck. It's why I avoid casinos. So the madman walks, which sends a message to others like him. Repercussions no longer exists for the most disgusting behavior whether it's assault, murder or arson. But there's good news, the tree is back up. And like me, it looks great. And if you keep burning it down, we'll just put up another. That's the real holiday spirit. And we need more of it now than ever."

The only pipeline Biden hasn't ruined goes from Russia to Germany. But praising the White House for their apparent role in lowering gas by a fraction is like thanking your kidnappers for cutting off only one finger. Not that I would know. Don failed to mention that current prices are still way higher compared to what we were paying a year ago under Trump. Of course, he never looked at those numbers perhaps because the White House told him not to but either way, I save money on gas by commuting to work like this.

But if gas prices can come down, two questions you ask: Is supply better or is demand worse? I hope it's not demand worse.
