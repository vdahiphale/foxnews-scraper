Pleasure to have these two gentlemen here. I feel confident we are going to get to the bottom of it with the two view here. Steve, congrats on the new show. We can't wait for that to get started. But in the meantime, what can we do here at home and abroad to combat extremism? STEVE HILTON, \"THE NEWS REVOLUTION\" HOST: I think that Kelly is exactly right. And it's really helpful, I think, to have someone as serious as that in charge of fighting the fight against terror, who takes it seriously, because I think what you have seen over the last few years, and it's not just here in America, but in the U.K. too, there's a lot of talk about fighting terrorism and the people agreeing with how serious it is. But if you look at what's actually been going on, it hasn't been good enough. Let's just take Manchester. Obviously it's still very fresh and there's a lot of grief and anger and pain. But while we should reserve most of our anger for the militant Islamists who actually did this terrible thing, I think some anger also needs to be reserved for the authorities because actually if you back to this guy, just as with so many of these attacks, it turns out that he was known to the authorities. He's actually complained about to an anti-terror hotline, it turns out, about six years ago. There was a warning after warning. He was traveling around Libya, Syria, he slipped through the nets. So there is something going wrong with the way we are approaching this. And I think what I'm really pleased to see is when President Trump and Secretary Kelly and the administration really are putting this at the top of the agenda, saying they need more resources to fight this threat, that should be reassuring. And there was one final thing. Actually, what America did after 9/11 was really important, the way that actually everyone said, look, there's something serious went wrong here. We need to investigate it, review all of our procedures and process it the way we fight terrorism. That hasn't happened in the U.K. And I think that America, therefore, despite these growing threats seems to me to be in a stronger position today, exactly as Secretary Kelly said, than anywhere else in the world despite the rising threat that we face.",

You have to show strength. The past eight years, we haven't had that. We were leading from behind. President Trump is putting us forward. We're leading from the front again. And he's putting more focus, he is, on law enforcement. And immediately after the attack in Manchester, he threw the special operations community into work, and the Seals went out and did a raid. Sometimes, you have to do that, an eye for an eye. And I like that he's doing that. Also, though, we need to, and this goes back on the leaks that we've talked about. The CIA and NSA need to get focus back on fighting terrorism and less on being in the political agendas and political arena. And that's where I see we need to actually concentrate more and actually have more of a focal point. And President Trump can do it. He's got somebody great as a CIA director right now in Mike Pompeo, and that needs to be a focus, where we are not succeeding that.

And that's what it was like with Obama, time and time again, going overseas, groveling, trashing America. Do you remember in Strasbourg, France, where he called America arrogant, where he apologized to the Muslim world for us taking a stand against terrorism, which he would never do explicitly, of course, all of the whitewashing, the euphemisms, going overseas to Europe and apologizing that America would assert itself and assert and defend its own sovereignty. He called that dictating to the rest of the world.

The one last thing I'd say about this trip that I think was especially important was, although it was tragic, it was also timely that the Manchester attack took place to underscore and to provide very sharp punctuation to the Trump agenda and the reason why he is the commander-in-chief of this country because it's the safety, security and prosperity of our people that enhances not only our country but the rest of the world!"

So in this case, The Washington Post headline is \"Jared Kushner now a focus in the Russian investigation.\" But if you read the story, you've got to go five paragraphs down, and The Post says The Post has not been told that Kushner is a target and the central focus of the investigation, and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

Go back to 1966 Supreme Court case, Sheppard versus Maxwell, which showed that prejudicial publicity was used to overturn a conviction, and they saw violations of the First Amendment, of the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, and of the 14th Amendment, due process.

Joining me now is the host of \"The Next Revolution\" which launches on FNC on Sunday, June 4th, at 9:00 p.m. eastern, Steve Hilton, and author of the new book, \"The Ranger Way, Living the Code On and Off the Battlefield,\" Kris \"Tanto\" Paronto. Pleasure to have these two gentlemen here. I feel confident we are going to get to the bottom of it with the two view here. Steve, congrats on the new show. We can't wait for that to get started. But in the meantime, what can we do here at home and abroad to combat extremism? STEVE HILTON, \"THE NEWS REVOLUTION\" HOST: I think that Kelly is exactly right. And it's really helpful, I think, to have someone as serious as that in charge of fighting the fight against terror, who takes it seriously, because I think what you have seen over the last few years, and it's not just here in America, but in the U.K. too, there's a lot of talk about fighting terrorism and the people agreeing with how serious it is. But if you look at what's actually been going on, it hasn't been good enough. Let's just take Manchester. Obviously it's still very fresh and there's a lot of grief and anger and pain. But while we should reserve most of our anger for the militant Islamists who actually did this terrible thing, I think some anger also needs to be reserved for the authorities because actually if you back to this guy, just as with so many of these attacks, it turns out that he was known to the authorities. He's actually complained about to an anti-terror hotline, it turns out, about six years ago. There was a warning after warning. He was traveling around Libya, Syria, he slipped through the nets. So there is something going wrong with the way we are approaching this. And I think what I'm really pleased to see is when President Trump and Secretary Kelly and the administration really are putting this at the top of the agenda, saying they need more resources to fight this threat, that should be reassuring. And there was one final thing. Actually, what America did after 9/11 was really important, the way that actually everyone said, look, there's something serious went wrong here. We need to investigate it, review all of our procedures and process it the way we fight terrorism. That hasn't happened in the U.K. And I think that America, therefore, despite these growing threats seems to me to be in a stronger position today, exactly as Secretary Kelly said, than anywhere else in the world despite the rising threat that we face."

He made this a key focal point of his campaign. And it was part of the thing people want to make America safe, national security focus and foreign policy. He emphasized that when he was away on this recent trip, strong messaging, saying \"drive them out.\" KRIS \"TANTO\" PARONTO, \"THE RANGER WAY\" AUTHOR: And that's what you need to do as a leader. You have to show strength. The past eight years, we haven't had that. We were leading from behind. President Trump is putting us forward. We're leading from the front again. And he's putting more focus, he is, on law enforcement. And immediately after the attack in Manchester, he threw the special operations community into work, and the Seals went out and did a raid. Sometimes, you have to do that, an eye for an eye. And I like that he's doing that. Also, though, we need to, and this goes back on the leaks that we've talked about. The CIA and NSA need to get focus back on fighting terrorism and less on being in the political agendas and political arena. And that's where I see we need to actually concentrate more and actually have more of a focal point. And President Trump can do it. He's got somebody great as a CIA director right now in Mike Pompeo, and that needs to be a focus, where we are not succeeding that. And that is the CIA and NSA are really not doing their jobs, which is combating terrorism more than leaking and being in the political arena. And that's bothering me a little bit."

They then went ahead and said, OK, we are back on board together. It was a matter of hours, but nevertheless, wow, what bad reputation to have.

I totally agree with what was just said about how we need to get back to the real business of fighting these terror networks. But I think, the other thing I would say is a real refreshing change in this administration is that you've got a president that has put really good, qualified people in charge and seems to trust in their professionalism. It seems to me they are really working as a team, because he has empowered them to do the right thing. He's not being micromanaged for political ends. He's actually putting good people in charge and letting them get on to the job and seeing his role as president is to give them the support you need and especially to get them the resources that they need.

France, 50 percent, the U.K. 58 percent, and even the U.S., 62 percent.\" Also, campus reform is reporting on a new poll that finds one third of millennials say safe spaces are absolutely necessary. Joining me now with reaction is the founder of executive director of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza. Gentlemen, thanks for being here tonight. Quite a study, Dinesh. How concerning is the lack of support for free speech among American millennials? And do you find this surprising?"

      "utterance": "Well, I think it's very disturbing because the whole purpose of a university is to challenge your assumptions, to turn your world upside down, to take assumptions and turn them into questions. If you go to four years of college and you don't have your basic assumptions challenged, even overturned, you haven't really got a proper liberal arts education. And so I think it's very pathetic that you've got these young people who feel they need to be sheltered. Sheltered from what? In fact, the only two groups that are really regularly battered on campus are political conservatives and evangelical Christians. Otherwise everybody else has a safe space. It's called the American campus."

      "utterance": "You're absolutely right. It's unbelievable to me how this happened and how the whole thing developed. Now, Charlie, safe spaces, what is that? What is wrong with American youth? They are so ill-prepared then for the real world when they go out there to try to get a job, they're not going to get hugs and snacks and whatever. They are going to have to work hard and earn their keep and actually open their minds and listen to other viewpoints."

      "utterance": "Just yesterday, I was speaking to a group of 60 or 70 year olds. I was trying to explain what a safe space was, and they thought I was making it up. A safe space, for people who don't know, it's a physical location on a college campus where college students can seek refuge if they hear ideas that they find threatening to them. Now, think about that. That this agreement is a form of assault? That you need to actually go find a safe space? And in these safe spaces, they have crayons and Play-Doh and cookies and milk. We're not making this up. And it is soft. And what is the agenda behind this? The liberal academic elites, they want to shelter an entire generation from ever hearing an idea or perspective that might disagree with the leftist worldview. Dinesh hit it out of the park. If there are any point of use that actually did safe spaces, it Christians and conservatives. We're the ones that are under attack on the campus. Dinesh is 100 percent right."

      "utterance": "The really powerful people on the college campus are the administration and the faculty. And those people are completely supportive of the leftist ideology. So the threat comes from the powerful people on campus who have the ability to shape your grades, the ability to penalize you, to send your home, to expel you. So it's the conservative and the Christians who are on the defensive. Right after Trump's election, my daughter, who is a senior at an Ivy League college, noticed there was a gala of intolerance that swept across her compass, in a sense almost a witch hunt against any students who might conceivably have voted conservative last year."

Sean is back on Tuesday and you can catch me on \"The Five\" at 9:00 p.m. eastern. We thank you so much for joining us. We wish a great night for you and enjoy your weekend.
