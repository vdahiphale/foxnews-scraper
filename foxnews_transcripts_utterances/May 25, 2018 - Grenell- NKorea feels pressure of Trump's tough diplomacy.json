This is an issue that has frustrated many administrations before the Trump administration, and I'm very pleased to see the action that we've seen over the last couple months. Look, this all started from President Trump doing really tough diplomacy with the Chinese. We've seen the Chinese raised their hand for sanctions at the U.N. multiple times, and yet, not really implement those things. And what President Trump did early on in his administration was signal that diplomacy was going to be tough, and he pressured the Chinese to actually implement the sanctions that they had voted for previously, in consecutive years. And so what we saw pretty quickly was, once the Chinese decided to implement the sanctions, we saw action. We saw the North Koreans feel the squeeze, feel the squeeze of President Trump's diplomacy, and come to the table. And so now we have to have clear eyes and wait and see what happens but I'm very confident that this president knows how to negotiate. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I've seen him personally negotiate and he also knows how to really use both the carrot and the stick, if you will, and he's been very successful at that so let's wait and see.",

Weinstein was greeted by throngs of reporters and cameras which capture this historic moment in the MeToo movement, as the man who's so many women have accused a forcible sexual assault turned himself in, he left in handcuffs after being fingerprinted and headed to his arraignment in criminal court.

To watch Harvey Weinstein in that courtroom, he seemed at points, Mark, to be floored by what the judge was saying.

But in the court of law, let's just make one thing clear. I'm not suggesting he's innocent, because I'm part of the public and I'm aware of the 80 plus allegations. But in the court of law, they're going to streamline this case and focus exclusively on that one victim, the other victim will be handled on a different trial. But that one victim, and what are the specific allegations? DNA doesn't help because the defense is going to be, yes he did it, but she consented. So the whole case will come down to her single credibility. And I'm sure, Ben Brafman, who I know well, is going to do everything he can to destroy her credibility. And it's sad if she's telling the truth because that's how these cases are, but it's not a slam-dunk at all for prosecutors."

The court of public opinion is certainly speaking and I'm glad that these women are feeling some sort of indication at least to see this scene, and to know that Harvey Weinstein's life whether he goes to jail or not has been ruined. It was interesting, I don't know if anyone else caught it. Asia Argento, spoke at the Cannes Film Festival a couple weeks ago, and she said to the audience there that this is a first step moving towards a resolution for these women but there are many more to continue to fall and point it out to the audience where there, obviously, were a number of men that she was also saying, we're watching you too."

And you know, we look at the Bill Cosby case for example, and I felt that it was good to watch that play out in a court of law, both sides presented their case. I think in that case in many ways, it came down to the drugs that were used, that were -- I think part of the reason that people found him guilty. And this is going to be another real test case for these situations because women have said, they didn't want to come forward because they didn't want to necessarily go through this process. And they knew that it was their word against his. You know, what legally is the possible precedent that is set by this case going forward with all these other cases?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "There is a huge difference between the Bill Cosby case and this one. You hope it's the same outcome if you absolutely believe as do I that he's guilty of what's being alleged, but it's very different. What jurors relied upon in that case primarily, were Cosby's own words were in a civil deposition, he admitted to drugging a lot of these women. In this case, this man is alleging \"I didn't do it.\" He's claiming, \"I had consent.\" So, the only difference between what the defense is alleging and what the prosecution is alleging is the state of mind of the alleged victim. What she did or said to lead Weinstein, to believe that this was not consensual. It's a very closed scenario."

      "utterance": "So President Trump, continuing to press the issue of whether the government under the Obama administration was spying on his presidential campaign. And maybe most importantly, when? That process may have begun. On Twitter today, the president writing this, \"The Democrats are now alluding to the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a spy, as illegal as that may be.\" He writes, \"But what about an informant who has paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the Russia hoax. We'll break that down in a moment. So, all this comes down to questions of which federal agencies did what and when? And what actually was the beginning point? Why did they get involved? This former federal official claimed, they weren't spying on the Trump campaign, they were keeping tabs on the Russians heading into the 2016 election. Joining me now Byron York, chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner, and a Fox News contributor who has written almost daily following the course of this whole thing as we have watched it play out. Byron, what did you think in particular about what the president said today? Is he on firm ground with that tweet or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I thought he is a little ahead of where the rest of us are including me on what we know. I mean, we know that this informant got in touch with three officials of the Trump campaign, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Clovis. We know he tried to insinuate himself into the campaign that way. We think that perhaps, he was either trying to find out what if anything they knew about Russian hacking or perhaps he was trying to plant information with them, we know those things. On the other hand, we don't know when it started, we don't know when the FBI became interested in that particular project. So when the president said, it started a lot earlier than we knew, we're not clear about that. And when the president said they was paid a lot of money, we don't know about that either."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, so in terms of when it started, that is a pretty important point thou. And what have we learned over the course of the last day or so about when that might have been and why does that matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, we do think it was earlier than we originally thought. Remember we had been told that the FBI counterintelligence investigation began on July 31st, 2016, very specific date when they filed the official papers to start an investigation. But we do know now that their interest in Carter Page, for example, went back much earlier on March 21st, 2016. President Trump -- Candidate Donald Trump went to the Washington Post Editorial Board and he told them that he was going to announce that day his list of foreign policy advisers and he read off four or five names and included them among those names Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. And we know that Andrew McCabe, the number two at the FBI and James Comey himself then the head of the FBI briefed the Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Carter Page soon after that and also later briefed a much larger group of Obama Administration officials. They discussed whether to have what's called a defensive briefing that is to get in touch with the Trump Campaign and say, listen you've got somebody on your staff, maybe there's some questions about some of the things they've done. They decided not to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me jump in there for just one second, Byron, because that's a moment that really interests me because there's this meeting. You know, well, should we let someone know in the campaign because ostensively the premier concern is whether or not the Russians might have an influence on the campaign, right? So there's a moment where you have the opportunity to intervene and to potentially blow the whistle on them and to give people a heads up. You know, some of the stuff you might be reading on the internet might be coming from the right, whatever it is. But that decision was made in that room do not let them in on it and to me there's only a couple of reasons why that could be. What's your interpretation of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, you're absolutely right. That is a critical decision because remember we've heard from a lot of former officials who said listen, this investigation was an investigation of the Russians. It was not an investigation of the Trump Campaign, and if it was indeed an investigation of the Russians, you would wonder why they did not give this defensive briefing to the Trump campaign. So the answer is actually we don't know. And what's also interesting is the first discussion I mentioned was just Comey, McCabe's speaking to Attorney General Lynch. Later though, they briefed what's called the National Security Council Principals Committee which is really big deal, Secretary of State, Treasury, Defense, Head of the CIA the U.N. Ambassador, the White House Chief of Staff and a number of others were all briefed on this Carter Page stuff. And again, a decision was made not to give a defensive briefing to the Trump Campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And in fact, they didn't let Mr. Trump in on anything until after he was elected. Then they decided he had to know about the dossier because it might be dangerous if he didn't. Very interesting, Byron, thank you so much. Good to see you tonight."

This comes after an administration official briefed the press yesterday on the situation with North Korea saying that Pyongyang had been acting in bad faith with statements and actions. One of those actions last weekend after an agreement with North Korea to meet in Singapore and hammer out the details of the summit, the White House sent the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Joe Hagan and a team to Singapore. That team waited on the ground for three days and the North Koreans never showed up. This letter that the President sent yesterday and then North Korea's response overnight really is demonstrating what the President believes is the art of the deal when it comes to international diplomacy. But there are some Democrats who don't like the president's negotiating style. Listen to what Democrat California Brad Sherman said earlier today."

But also came to the point of threatening nuclear war with the United States if diplomacy doesn't work out. So we have competing narratives here for why this thing was canceled.

      "utterance": "Well, I think as President Trump said, let's wait and see. This is an issue that has frustrated many administrations before the Trump administration, and I'm very pleased to see the action that we've seen over the last couple months. Look, this all started from President Trump doing really tough diplomacy with the Chinese. We've seen the Chinese raised their hand for sanctions at the U.N. multiple times, and yet, not really implement those things. And what President Trump did early on in his administration was signal that diplomacy was going to be tough, and he pressured the Chinese to actually implement the sanctions that they had voted for previously, in consecutive years. And so what we saw pretty quickly was, once the Chinese decided to implement the sanctions, we saw action. We saw the North Koreans feel the squeeze, feel the squeeze of President Trump's diplomacy, and come to the table. And so now we have to have clear eyes and wait and see what happens but I'm very confident that this president knows how to negotiate. I've seen him personally negotiate and he also knows how to really use both the carrot and the stick, if you will, and he's been very successful at that so let's wait and see."

    {
      "speaker": "GRENELL",
      "utterance": "Look, I think that this president has signaled multiple times that he's going to fight for the American people and use all of the tools that the U.S. government has. He's not just going to make one argument but he is going to say as he said to President Xi early on, look, if you help us out with North Korea which is a very serious policy for us, it's a threat to the American people. If you help us out on North Korea, you're going to be able to get a better trade deal from us. Those types of negotiation skills, to intermingle multiple issues, I think is a fantastic way to negotiate. I've waited a long time to see a president actually use all of the tools that the U.S. government has at its disposal, and this president has shown he is willing to do that."

And here's a look at it. \"As President Trump said, U.S. sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran's economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.\" There's lots of corporate entanglement between Europe and Iran and they don not necessarily want to unwind that, ambassador."

    {
      "speaker": "GRENELL",

They can either choose to do business with the United States, or they can choose to do business with Iran but they're not going to be able to do both. President Trump has been clear about that, Secretary Pompeo has been very clear about that. What we're seeing here throughout Europe are companies telling us that, of course they are going to choose the United States. And when forced to make a decision about choosing either doing business with the mullahs, or doing business with the United States, every time they are going to choose to do business with the United States. I think it's diplomat's duty to follow the president's directives and policies and to be out front. And all we are trying to do is present that choice to businesses throughout Europe. It's their choice, they can decide which government or which market they are going to want to play in, and at the end of the day, whatever they choose is their decision."

      "utterance": "You know, we were there to talk to the Health Science and Technology committee about this cutting edge technology, and how it can be integrated into what our -- into how we continue to serve our veterans. And you feel that the way that we work on technology for the battlefield has to be extended across that bridge until after they come home."

    {
      "speaker": "MEEK",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. A lot of the devices that fund are originally funded through DARPA, which is the Department of Defense"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEEK",
      "utterance": "And as you mentioned we give our warfare as the best absolute best technology we can on the battlefield. But once they come home and they face the V.A. system, there is really no DARPA for veterans back here. And so we're trying to fill that Death Valley gap with the help in the battlefield versus the care they receive here back home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And there are American companies that are making -- you know, as I said during the hearing, you know, iron man isn't just in the movies. I mean, they are creating arms that are fully usable from the elbow to the wrist, all the way down to the fingers. Tell people a little bit about what can be done now that is so new and incredible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEEK",
      "utterance": "Well, now it's even going a step further. So the one device you mentioned actually is the only full range that includes the shoulder, but now they are hard wiring them into your brains, so you actually just think about it in the moves. Other things like virtual reality. There's one veteran we worked with it at Vermont (Ph) University where he lost his arm in Vietnam, and through technology he put on through virtual reality, actually he turned a doorknob and he started to cry. It's actually the first time he'd actually felt a doorknob in 25 years. And so to your point, science fiction is becoming science fact."

      "speaker": "DAN ROSE, U.S. ARMY VETERAN",
      "utterance": "Standing up was surreal. Like the (Inaudible) leg, you know, pushing up and standing up and being eye level with people again was just an amazing experience."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, the other side of this is government spending and how it's used, right. This technology is so psychologically beneficial, as Dan said it, and it can turn people's live around. You talk about the fact that 20 members, 20 veterans commit suicide every single day. This technology helps to improve their lives and we hope to prevent some of those lives from being lost in that horrific way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEEK",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And it's one thing to think about being able to stand and be eye level with the world again, and something that you and I would take for granted. But going that step further, we're actually working with some V.A. medical centers on a mental health study showing those benefits. Obviously the medical benefits were there are things like reduce seeing urinary tract infection, increasing muscle and bone density, but there are things that you don't think about, the unseen wounds of war that they talk about."

      "speaker": "MEEK",
      "utterance": "We are. We are very fortunate to work with United Rentals, one of our major sponsors. And they are sponsor of Indy 500 team Rathal Letterman Lanigan and they watch the program called Turns for Troops. The web site is Turnsfortroops.com. And what they do is for every lap that driver Graham Rahal completes throughout the entire Indy car season, United Rentals donate $50 to our program."
