Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate who trails by about 50,000 votes, is scheduled to speak in one hour's time from. Now, will it be a concession speech?

They have talked about it. We don't know whether they're going to demand that or not. As it stands right now, the Republican, Brian Kemp, in the next few hours, he could actually be certified as the winner this election. He stands at 50.2 percent of the vote. That would have to go below 50 percent for a runoff vote in December. Abrams would need 17,000 votes. The tone here is changing. It's getting worse each day.

Nelson and the Democrat for governor, Andrew Gillum, are both banking, though, on having about 5,000 people turn out by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow. Those are the ones that may have been notified late that signature mismatch on their ballots would invalidate their votes if it's not fixed.

This has been an ongoing problem. However, some -- several consumer advocacy groups are criticizing the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food and safety, because they're saying you're not telling us who the brands are, where this tainted salmonella turkey is coming from. The department has rebutted and said, hey, we don't know where the source is just yet, so it would be reckless for us to bring up any other brands. But there you have one brand there. In terms of just this year, in 2018, according to the CDC, you're seeing 164 people who have been sick because of salmonella all across the country, 63 hospitalized, and including one death as well. Overall, just in the past year, and we're seeing on an annual basis, the CDC is saying that there's 1.2 million cases of salmonella outbreak. So it's affecting a lot of Americans, especially around the holiday time. So if you're concerned about the symptoms, what are they? Diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps that you will receive roughly about 12 to 72 hours when you come in contact. And last but not least, really quickly, how to avoid it. Thaw your turkey in the fridge, not the counter. Don't wash the turkey before you cook it. Don't put the stuffing -- this is a big one -- don't stuff the turkey. Try to cook your stuffing in another pan. And make sure to reheat your leftovers, Neil.   CAVUTO: Good reminders, all. All right, Kristina, thank you very, very much.

So, that's why right now the latest numbers on Central Americans claiming asylum in the United States, 91 percent lose their case when they get in front of an immigration judge, if they show up. So, it's just people that are in dire straits taking advantage of a low threshold in the system to get their foot in the door, because once -- the initial interview they do at a port of entry is by what they call refugee asylum officer from the CIS. The threshold is so low, because they want to make sure that they don't send anybody back to be persecuted. That's what need to be fixed and that's what we asked Congress to fix. Raise that threshold, because once it gets to an immigration judge, 90 percent lose. We have got to close that gap.

Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate who trails by about 50,000 votes, is scheduled to speak in one hour's time from. Now, will it be a concession speech? It doesn't sound like at this point. Or will it be an extreme legal challenge to this entire vote? Will the Abrams campaign, as they have discussed, issue a legal challenge, saying this vote in Georgia was so corrupt and so irregular, it affected the outcome, basically asking a judge to overthrow the vote and have an entire revote with the same candidates? That would be a very high bar, a tough thing to achieve. They have talked about it. We don't know whether they're going to demand that or not. As it stands right now, the Republican, Brian Kemp, in the next few hours, he could actually be certified as the winner this election. He stands at 50.2 percent of the vote. That would have to go below 50 percent for a runoff vote in December. Abrams would need 17,000 votes. The tone here is changing. It's getting worse each day.

In some cases, that is because somebody voted for both the Senate candidates, Bill Nelson and Rick Scott. In some cases, it's because people drew their own bubbles or squiggles on a ballot. In others, though, in most of them, people just left the Senate side blank. And that means nobody gets the credit. And that is making it very tough for Bill Nelson to catch up to Rick Scott. He is nearly 13,000 votes behind. And even if he got all the contested ones today here in Broward, Nelson would only had about 500 to his total. And this is the place where his lawyers have been hoping to find thousands of fresh Nelson votes. Nelson's team, though, not giving up the fight.  His team just announced a fund-raising appeal asking for cash to help keep up with the deep-pocketed Scott campaign. But Rick Scott is now accusing Nelson, the Democrat, of just battling this election out in court to alter election laws ahead of the 2020 presidential race. Nelson and the Democrat for governor, Andrew Gillum, are both banking, though, on having about 5,000 people turn out by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow. Those are the ones that may have been notified late that signature mismatch on their ballots would invalidate their votes if it's not fixed.

And we attribute that considerably to those suburban women. So, when it comes to health care, and the actual advances that we have made, whether it is working on pharmaceutical costs, whether it is doubling the child tax credit, whatever that might be, we need to make sure that women know about those initiatives, know that we are working for them, and really making sure that we are hearing what their concerns are.

By the way, just the talk of that idea that we could put sort of the hatchet down between ourselves and the Chinese and maybe start the beginnings of progress on the trade front level, let alone, no deal, was enough to lift stocks today.

He says nothing specifically, only the continuation of this investigation, which the president says should have never happened. The White House, after a court ruling, has also temporarily reinstated the White House pass of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta. He's back here at the White House. The administration had revoked his pass after Acosta refused to give up the microphone at a presidential press conference last week. The president says the White House will develop new rules for press conferences, focusing on decorum. CNN sued to get Acosta's pass back.

I suspect, in the background, what was lurking was, if you don't submit at least written answers under oath, then you will face a subpoena. And I think there's been probably some negotiations behind the scenes about sort of working all that. I mean, otherwise, the president could just save his answers and use them to respond to whatever report Bob Mueller submits to the Justice Department and presumably ultimately to the Congress."
    },

      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "I suppose that's right. But I think the other way to look at it, of course, is, it's just a wrap-up and that there's really no intention to pursue things further, once the president's answers are included as a part of the report, right?"

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "Well, he may not have agreed to respond to those kinds of questions.  I mean, I don't know what the questions are. I suspect the questions don't have anything to do with obstruction of justice, because he, I think, indicated early on he had no intention to respond in that way. He obviously also has said, since it veers off from the mandate of the investigation, he doesn't intend to have any responses with regard to questions involving the Trump Organization and his activities prior to the campaign run for president. I suspect that they're probably limited to what -- what would be the heart of the mandate, which would be the origins of the -- of the Russia investigation and matters related to the campaign, and whether or not there were any meetings with Russian officials, and whether or not he knew about certain things and what he didn't know, and those sorts of things. I would think all of those things would be fair game and would be within the mandate set by the deputy attorney general."

    {
      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "Well, the president says that he wrote the responses. And the first piece of advice you give any client is, make sure you understand that the responses that you are giving are just as if you were in a grand jury proceeding sworn under oath, under penalty of prosecution for perjury. So, whatever you say, make sure that what you say is the truth."

If you think of the indictments and the guilty pleas and all, most have involved things having nothing to do with Russia, everything to do with business transactions, some going back many years. Is it your feeling that this could go the same way, that whatever Mueller comes up with might have in the end very little to do with Russia?"
    },

      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "I think it will have very little to do with Russia collusion, which is to say there will be an awful lot of Democrats who will be sorely disappointed that there wasn't the Holy Grail at the end of all of this. There will be a report, I imagine a fair amount of great public pressure to see that report is released to Congress. I suspect much more will be discussed about what the president's efforts were in terms of trying to orchestrate some degree of control over the investigation, whether it be the firing of Jim Comey or other things related to that, but..."

And only recently, because it involves the Trump administration, are Democratic critics suggesting that there's something wrong about the president's own Office of Legal Counsel opining on the legality and constitutionality of the president's action. But, look, it's an issue that the Constitution doesn't answer. The Congress attempted to fill that void with the Vacancies Act. The president acted pursuant to the Vacancies Act. He sought the opinion, as he appropriately should, by the White House counsel to the Office of Legal Counsel. He did all the things that you would expect a responsible president to do.  And he filled the position temporarily, pending a permanent appointment with the advice and consent of the Senate. I don't see there's any constitutional problem with that. I don't see that there's any legal problem with that."

I told you stocks ended up on the day, down on the week. It was a horrific week. But everything seemed to be pegged to promising China talks. I keep repeating myself, maybe at the risk of overdoing it, that this whole issue of trade or whether we get things back on track with China will dominate the picture. The better they look, the better for stocks. The worse they look, the worst for stocks. Could it change everything if these two strike a deal next week? After this."

That reversed what had been a 200-point slide yesterday turning into 200- point gain. Just the hints of that reinforced today or hinted at today by the president lifted stocks yet again. Let's go to market watchers Jonas Max Ferris, Dan Geltrude. Dan, it is a reminder, as if we needed it, that the prospects for a deal with China are very much market-moving events, right?

You know, Jonas, one other thing I think of too is -- and this is where the midterms could make a difference -- we have already seen Congressman Pascrell of New Jersey, who is going to have a very key role on trade within the House Ways and Means Committee, the subcommittee on that, who's already said, you know, that deal you scored with Mexico and Canada, it has to go by us, by me.

There's been almost too much winning by America.  I know this sounds nuts, because Trump's like, we're going to win, you will get sick of winning. But the bottom line is, our interest rates started to get too high. Our -- our dollar got too strong.

This has been an ongoing problem. However, some -- several consumer advocacy groups are criticizing the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food and safety, because they're saying you're not telling us who the brands are, where this tainted salmonella turkey is coming from. The department has rebutted and said, hey, we don't know where the source is just yet, so it would be reckless for us to bring up any other brands. But there you have one brand there. In terms of just this year, in 2018, according to the CDC, you're seeing 164 people who have been sick because of salmonella all across the country, 63 hospitalized, and including one death as well. Overall, just in the past year, and we're seeing on an annual basis, the CDC is saying that there's 1.2 million cases of salmonella outbreak. So it's affecting a lot of Americans, especially around the holiday time. So if you're concerned about the symptoms, what are they?

The border here in San Diego substantially secure. The idea that you can cross anywhere on the border and still claim asylum, no longer the case. If you do claim asylum, you have got a long wait, five weeks, up to four months. Also, a lot don't have any money left -- left to go home.

You can claim political asylum if you're in fear of persecution of your home country for your political beliefs, your race or religion or being part of a specific social group. Poverty, wanting a better life in the United States, unfortunately, it doesn't qualify for politically asylum. So, that's why right now the latest numbers on Central Americans claiming asylum in the United States, 91 percent lose their case when they get in front of an immigration judge, if they show up. So, it's just people that are in dire straits taking advantage of a low threshold in the system to get their foot in the door, because once -- the initial interview they do at a port of entry is by what they call refugee asylum officer from the CIS. The threshold is so low, because they want to make sure that they don't send anybody back to be persecuted. That's what need to be fixed and that's what we asked Congress to fix. Raise that threshold, because once it gets to an immigration judge, 90 percent lose. We have got to close that gap. But, again, 90 percent of these people, based on the current data, will lose their case. They will be ordered to go home."

Many escaping from Honduras are escaping what they say is gang violence that threatens their lives.  Another group from Nicaragua, this harsh political crackdown that has targeted families, we're told. And they take their families and others with them to escape that. So, it has to be a life-and-death provable issue, right?"

      "utterance": "Bingo. I mean, if they're really escaping fear of persecution in Honduras, they're two countries away. And Mexico has offered asylum to many of these people.  About 2,000 have accepted. So the first question that asylum officers should ask, if you're escaping fear and persecution under the rules of asylum in Honduras, why didn't you take the offer in Mexico? And I have said this for weeks. So this isn't so much about escaping real true fear and persecution. This is about getting to the United States to join a family members that is here illegally or to get a job. And your own video clips on FOX shows these -- some of Honduran caravans are carrying the Honduran flag. I have never seen people that are supposedly persecuted by the country carrying the flag of the very country that's persecuting them. It's just -- it's ridiculous."

So, she don't like what ICE does, change the law. Or you know what? Strap a gun on your hip, put a Kevlar vest on, and go arrest somebody that doesn't want to be arrested that's a significant criminal alien that you let out of your sanctuary jail in California that you support the sanctuary policies. Look, the men and women of ICE aren't making this up. They're doing their jobs. They are protecting the homeland. They're enforcing the laws that Congress enacted. And to vilify them, call them names, it's just ridiculous. She ought to go -- I said last night she ought to go walk the wall of the National Law Enforcement Memorial of the hundreds of Border Patrol agents, ICE agents that gave the ultimate sacrifice and lost their lives, and apologize to them and apologize for the families of these men and women that died serving their country."

I have worked with her for months before I retired. She -- I was up on the Hill many times with her trying to get these loopholes by Congress. When someone steps up to the plate to be the secretary of homeland security, they have given their life up. She's working 24/7 and 365.

We're also waiting on this ongoing recount going on in Florida. University of Memphis Law Professor Steven Mulroy on all of this. Steven, in the Georgia situation, she's behind enough that it would be difficult for to catch up to or get the votes under 50 percent for Kemp that would require a runoff. So what do you suspect? What will she say?"

Either she will concede, or she will indicate that she will be filing a lawsuit to suggest that there were illegalities and improprieties, other problems with the election, such that the election could be challenged, and that it would have been enough to make a difference in the outcome. In this particular case, as you have already pointed out, the votes still yet to be counted, provisional absentee or whatever, wouldn't be enough to bring it down to a traditional runoff. So she'd have to file some sort of litigation, maybe focusing on the controversies that we have seen in the last few weeks, with Brian Kemp changing registration, not allowing people to be registered because their signatures didn't quite match, that kind of thing."

That's how you cure that. You're right, though, that the 4,000 wouldn't be enough to make up the difference for Senator Bill Nelson.

Huffington Post a few hours ago released what they are reporting is soon to be a letter was signed by 17 different Democratic congressmen who say that they would support Fudge over Pelosi in a potential speaker bid. That letter has yet to be released as of this moment, so we don't totally know how the math is going to stack up, and if and when that letter is released. I think that it's been interesting to see the Congressional Black Caucus say that they're going to endorse Pelosi over Fudge, even though Fudge used to be chair of Congressional Black Caucus. I think that that doesn't bode well for Fudge's chances in this ultimate face-off. So, I mean, we will have to see how this all shakes out. I think the meeting today between the two shows that I think Democrats are trying to kind of close rank and close opposition and get all their ducks in a row behind Nancy Pelosi. So we will have to see what happens."

Ultimately, if she -- if Nancy Pelosi is kind of able to win over a couple of those individuals over to her side, then she would be able to secure that on the first vote. So, we will just have to see how strong her support is, although it has been interesting after November to see all of these really young Democrats, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other individuals like her, juxtaposed with Nancy Pelosi. I mean, it's just been kind of an interesting, weird conglomerate, and to see that going forward. It'll be interesting to see if Democrats can pull off pushing down -- pushing down dissent and being able to just keep everyone in line, like they have been."
