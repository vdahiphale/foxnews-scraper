But instead, he's very tricky about how he describes Mifsud. Because what we believe is that Mifsud is actually not some type of Russian asset as the Mueller dossier makes him out to be. We believe that Mifsud is, in fact, just some type of Western intelligence person. As a matter of fact, he was -- he was in Malta, which is a small country, small island part of the European Union. He was in the Foreign Ministry there. He taught school in London. He taught school in Rome. He actually worked with our FBI and held conferences with the FBI. And this is the kicker of all of it, and this is going to really, I think, make people really laugh. So at the time that we were starting our Russia investigation, okay, in the early 2017.

But why stop there? How about his medical records? How about his internet search history? How about his texts or transcripts of his phone calls? Why not? And if people who don't like Donald Trump can get that information about him, what about those of us who don't like CNN? Can we get Don Lemon's tax returns? What about Jeff Zucker's internet search history? That would be compelling. Seriously, why not? What's the limit? Is there a limit? Donald Trump is on stage right now and about to speak. Before he takes the mic, we're going to check in with Victor Davis Hanson who is sitting on the set.

But I don't understand the narrative because they're basically saying that 35 years ago, when Donald Trump was in his early 40s, he either did one of two things. The guy who now gave us 3 percent GDP plus and record economy we haven't seen in 40 years was financially incompetent, and that matters, apparently, or he didn't pay taxes on money he never made or money he lost, so it doesn't make any sense. And so I guess what the people bake into the idea that the Manhattan real estate market wasn't a nice place ever and that people who participate in it take ups and downs, and then then -- so it's not a story, but it is a story in this sense. It's the Logan Act, the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment, Mueller -- it's one more narrative rather than here's Trump's record, and here also on the progressive side, here's our record, so the people are going to adjudicate, and that can't happen, because they don't want that question to be asked.
