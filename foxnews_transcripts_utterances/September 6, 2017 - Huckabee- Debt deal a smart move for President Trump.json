And that's something she needs to do and nine other Democrats in red states that Trump took. Also needs to be talking to him more, or at least appearing to be willing to compromise. But the Democrats have completely and utterly game the Republicans time and time again. And that's the frustration you see with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. They have the numbers. They can't get it done. Tax reform, I think more likely, numbers wise, because they all want a tax cut for individuals and corporate rate. But then you have President Trump out there talking about a 15 percent rate when Paul Ryan is actually 25 percent is what's reasonable there. And I think that you are also continuing to see the fact that Donald Trump has no interest in being part of any party. He is a party of one.

Fix the other legs of the immigration issue to actually begin some -- by the way, I take issue with the idea that if we take them out of the economy, when you have so many millions of Americans out of the workforce, or Henry Cuellar's district in Texas, which has 26,000 people out of work.

A bipartisan deal between Republicans and Democrats has actually been reached. President Trump throwing a major political curveball today, siding with Democrats, yes, Democrats for a bill that will keep the government open and raise the debt ceiling into mid-December. It will also fund recovery aid for Hurricane Harvey. Senate leaders Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell addressed reporters this afternoon after the deal was reached."

We, Democrats, you know, some people urged us, don't help at all, particularly on debt ceiling.

He's a former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee is here. And she's a senior director of research and consumer insight for Bustle.com, Jessica Tarlov is here. Governor Huckabee, I saw you laughing while Chuck Schumer was talking. So I thought you might want to jump in."

      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS",
      "utterance": "Well, I was wondering if Chuck Schumer is in the orthopedic ward, because I think he broke his arm patting himself on the back for this extraordinary moment. It's just funny to watch Chuck Schumer sit there and talk about what a bipartisan guy he is. And he is been one of the biggest stumbling blocks to getting anything done. But today was a smart move on the part of the president. This is something that was going to inevitably happen, the debt ceiling was going to increase. The Republicans don't have enough guts to not do it. The Democrats want to do it. Trump doesn't want to be bogged down with that battle while we've got two hurricanes going on. And really more important things like true tax reform, getting Obamacare repealed and replaced, and all the other things that should be on the agenda. So this was good politics. It gives Trump an opportunity to say I'm not the guy that just blocks everything. And he knows -- also knows this, Kat. He's dealing with a bunch of incompetent Republicans who are so completely impotent that a year's supply of political Viagra would not make them capable of getting something done."

      "utterance": "Yeah. Because, I think -- and by the way, for everything I'm about to say, I'll just add on to see the former speaker on the show. Look, it's the art of the deal. Here's what we have. They were going to do this no matter what. Governor Huckabee is right. They were going to have this debt ceiling raised. We were going to see the midnight vote, we're going to see all of this play out. Now that's taken off the table. Now they can focus on tax reform, and the president is out on this. Whether it's the three easy pieces initiative that just requires a 51 vote majority. That gives us three pieces that reforms taxes for Americans. Whether it's other issues. But when it comes to health care, they're not prepared. And now he has political capital because he has something else. He has Chuck Schumer patting himself on the back repeatedly. The most partisan hack, there is no other way to say it. In the senate, on the Democrat side is Chuck Schumer, the new Harry Reid. So Trump has laid this out. And I think we're seeing the beginning of a negotiation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, BUSTLE.COM SENIOR DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Absolutely not. It's just another win. I mean, the Democrats for being in the minority, completely, right? House and senate. No presidency. Have gotten an incredible amount done, or at least stopped an incredible amount. With health care, the tax reform, plus that he had going, I think it's smart to be out there with Heidi Heitkamp. And that's something she needs to do and nine other Democrats in red states that Trump took. Also needs to be talking to him more, or at least appearing to be willing to compromise. But the Democrats have completely and utterly game the Republicans time and time again. And that's the frustration you see with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. They have the numbers. They can't get it done. Tax reform, I think more likely, numbers wise, because they all want a tax cut for individuals and corporate rate. But then you have President Trump out there talking about a 15 percent rate when Paul Ryan is actually 25 percent is what's reasonable there. And I think that you are also continuing to see the fact that Donald Trump has no interest in being part of any party. He is a party of one. And his base, that 30 or 35 percent, they don't have an allegiance either. They just go with Trump. And I don't know what that means for the Republicans in 2018 and 2020."

      "speaker": "EBONI K. WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I'll piggyback off what the governor just said. I think your frustration speaks to that of many of my Republican friends, governor. What is the GOP? What is it exactly that Paul Ryan wants? What is it exactly that Mitch McConnell wants? And what are they willing to do? What type of political capital are they willing to spend to make it happen? And I think it's very, very unclear to all people looking. In terms of what the president did today, Kat, I think -- look, pick your battles has never had more meaning. This was not a smart battle to pick. This was going to get done anyway. That one is already articulated. I do think Jessica is right. I don't think it makes the Democrats more likely to compromise. But optically, politically, to the outsiders looking in, I think it gives him a little bit more goodwill, him being the president. To say, you know what, he did give them something. He put something on the table. He deserves to get something back in tax reform. Who doesn't want it. Who doesn't need it. This is the single issue that my mother, a lifetime Democrat, went to that booth and voted for President Trump around. She is one of those Americans that want that relief particularly around the individual and small business tax rate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",

    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "It will make some difference when you have a congressional approval rating of like 9 to 13 percent depending on what pollster you're looking at. And nothing is going to make them seem like decent human beings. So the governor initial point there. And I don't use the word hack, but certainly we use the word partisan when we're talking about any of the leadership and, frankly, most of the foot soldiers. I mean, people line up and they vote with their party, and that's getting to be an incredibly complicated approach when we have 40 percent of Americans identifying as independent. As Eboni well know, I mean, you usually lean one way or the other because you came from one of the parties. But Americans don't speak in just language of Democrats or Republicans anymore. And I don't know where you go from there. What parties that only talks that way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "The representatives themselves?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Exactly. They're not answering to the people. If they were answering to the people, we would repealed and replaced Obamacare. We would already have tax reforms. We would have had multiple things that would have already happened. Why wouldn't it happen? Because they don't want to offend their handlers, the people who handle the money into their campaign coffers, and that's what's killing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "By the way, I'll add to this. You know why we really need a border wall between K-street and every building where there is a congressman? Look, Democrats shouldn't do a victory lap on this either because we know what will happen next. What we have are the optics of it. Trump has the opportunity to turn the optics because the one thing about Donald Trump that I love this about him, no matter what you say about him, he's not the whinny, squishy fish Republicans who would run for corner and say, no, I'm not, and screams about it. He stands up, looks you right in the eye, looks the nation right in the eye, and Chuck Schumer may do his pat on the back routine but he better get his arm fixed because he's not going to do that much longer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Let me make this point about, you know, these representatives. It's about who they're afraid of. And you're exactly right. They're not afraid of their constituents putting them out of office. They're afraid of those donor's checkbooks, or ink pens, rather, drying up and shriveling up, and not being able to run for reelection. And that's the problem. I think the minute that the constituents have the power again, we'll see a different Washington."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And I also think that it needs to be said because no one says it. I am concerned about the national debt. And I don't think that congressional GOP really is. I don't think they care. I think that -- I don't even really know what Republican is anymore. It's not seeming to be a very fiscally conservative type thing if this is just no big deal. At some point."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's just six year. This is a congress that hasn't done a thing in eight months. Look, I think six months is incredibly generous. I found it interesting that the states are going to sue Donald Trump because he's done this about DACA. What are they going to sue him for? Actually, respecting the constitutional separation of powers? My Lord, this is a man who actually decided to live by the law, rather than by his emotions. I'm so tired of people in all three branches of government who apparently failed ninth-grade civics. I applaud the president for having having at least exhibited some respect that the executive branch cannot just act unilaterally. Thank God for that. What happened to the other two branches? And again, I'm just baffled what the lawsuit would look like."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think if they do something that orders within the executive branch, that's what an executive order rightfully does. I did dozens of them, hundreds of them as a governor, but I never legislated with them. Lord, I took an oath, and I said that I would uphold the Constitution both of the U.S. and the state of Arkansas. I would love to have done some things without a 90 percent Democrat legislature I had to work with. It would've been wonderful if I could've just said, \"Guys, go home. I'm going to do it with a phone and a pen.\""

A lot of people giving President Obama heat for the way that he went about trying to protect the DREAMers, this executive order. We all know it was a bit flaky, because we know DAPA did not survive judicial scrutiny, and certainly, if DACA had been subjected to that same scrutiny, it likely would have failed, as well."

    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "... to do this. Where I think the issue is, is the argument that Donald Trump then took this up, because he wanted to make sure that the DREAMers got protected. I mean, that's not it. Immigration, hardline immigration is his bread and butter with his base. And he's up against not having health care, no tax reform bill yet. He's facing two hurricanes, making sure that people are taken care of in this country. And he's going back to rally his base. Jeff Sessions was also handpicked for this reason. This is his bread-and- butter topic. He's been talking about it his entire career. Kat and I before the show were talking about that new audio that came out of his interview two years ago, radio with Breitbart, where he was praising the 1924 immigration law, which was written by a eugenicist. So I think that when you say -- and I understand I've got to hand it to President Trump and I know that we're politically not aligned there. I'm glad to have these six months, and I do hope that we get a clean DREAM Act. I don't think that we will. The Democrats will then attach it to everything that they can. But the real conversation should be where is the comprehensive immigration bill that includes refuge for these 800,000 DREAMers and looks at a plan forward for dealing with these 11 million and whoever is coming in now."

Back to the civics lesson that's needed. Look, President Trump did exactly what's right. Obama said it himself. He repeated it from all the way from 2009 through 2011 about the fact that he could not do this, and then he did it. He gave no protection to the DREAMers. The Democrats, with all due respect, Jessica, have used illegal aliens or any form attachment to that as political ponds and, basically, they use them as political prostitutes when it comes to what they do with issues..."

And sometimes I mock the left and the idiocy that goes on out there, when I agree. I think we can all agree there is a serious issue about how we fix this thing in a pragmatic way. Fix the other legs of the immigration issue to actually begin some -- by the way, I take issue with the idea that if we take them out of the economy, when you have so many millions of Americans out of the workforce, or Henry Cuellar's district in Texas, which has 26,000 people out of work.

Look at what makes sense for the well-being of America. First of all, define what that really looks like from an economic and otherwise standpoint. And then talk about solutions that are both constitutional, make economic sense, and get us closer to something that feels like a respect of our laws but also, again, providing for the long-term best interests of these -- This is a bad situation.
