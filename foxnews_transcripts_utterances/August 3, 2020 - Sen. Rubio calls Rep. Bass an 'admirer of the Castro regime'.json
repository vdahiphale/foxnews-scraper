We're going to show you exactly what defunding the police looks like. Spoiler alert: think war zone. But, first, tonight, we start with Democratic majority whip James Clyburn. He is in leadership, third-highest ranking Democrat in the House, a closed Biden ally. And this weekend, well, he continued to float yet more conspiracy theories -- kind of a tinfoil hat conspiracy theories -- about Trump, Putin, Nazi Germany, Mussolini, and fascism.

And for the sake of our kids and grandkids, and the world, I pray we do. They know that Joe is weak. They know he's corrupt. They know his track record is pathetic.

I can tell you what child has accomplished in less than four. Let's start with Biden's uncanny knack for always making the wrong decision. For example, Biden opposed the 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed bin Laden. Biden also spoke out against a successful Petraeus Iraq troop surge in 2007, and Biden was an enthusiastic supporter of Obama's strategy to abandon the Middle East which, of course, left a massive vacuum that was soon filled by ISIS. Oh, yeah, and he pushed the big lie, keep your doctor, plan and save money. Millions lost their doctors, their plans. We're all paying about 200 percent more. He voted for the war in Iraq, now he says a mistake. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Biden also on the wrong side of racial integration. Let's go to NBC News, shall we? He led the charge on an issue that kept black students away from the classrooms of white students. As Biden once said, he did not want his children to grow up in a racial jungle. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Senator Kamala Harris, now a front runner we hear, who knows, maybe ahead fake for Biden's veepstakes. But just a few months ago, she had this to say about Biden's anti-integration efforts. Wow. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Pretty pathetic and by the way, Biden's horrific track record doesn't end there. A few years ago during the Barack and Joe days, there it administration, Biden was a point person for Ukraine-U.S. relations. And during that time, we already know he allowed Putin to steal Crimea, all while zero experience son, well, Hunter got filthy rich, thanks to the sketchy deal with the pro-Russian energy company all while leveraging a billion dollars of your money. Quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter. Biden also was in charge of the administration's China policy and for years, Joe -- well, he did his best to cozy up to the country's ruling communist party, all while again, Hunter -- well, he struck another lucrative deal, this time with the Bank of China. No experience anyone can find. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Flash forward to this year when President Trump signed off on the life- saving travel ban to and from China. Ten days after the first identified coronavirus case here, Biden was against the ban. He is one who called it hysterical xenophobia and fearmongering. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How many thousands of American lives were saved by the president's decision ten days after that first case in the U.S.? And, by the way, to do that, while he was also being impeached. Joe, wrong as usual. So, it's a horrific track record. Well, we sent our own Lawrence Jones, our 2020 correspondent.

The Post Office could never handle the traffic of mail-in votes without preparation. Using COVID to steal the state. We'll see you in court. Now, also already seeing the disaster of mass mail in voting, for example, right, in New York, the New York City, as six weeks later two congressional races, two, remain undecided as officials trade blame over the mishandling of ballots. And don't forget, just this summer, while in Paterson, New Jersey, local officials were among those charged in a voter fraud scheme. Recently in Los Angeles, four men were sentenced for their role in a voter fraud operation. Now, as Michael Goodwin writes in The New York Post about nationwide vote by mail, quote: Nothing like it has ever been attempted, so to assume it would go smoothly is beyond foolish. I agree. Indeed, it would be a miracle, he says, if it weren't a disaster. Here with reaction, Senator Tom Cotton.

When you vote absentee, you submit an application, you expect the ballot, you get it, you mail it back in. There's a track record at every step of the process. These states like Nevada and New York that want to move to mail-in balloting, they're talking about sending a live, real ballots to every single person who is registered, whether they wanted one or not, whether their address has been verified, whether they are alive or dead, and then they're going to allow ballot harvesting as well, which is when party activists can around and pick up hundreds or thousands of those ballots, and return them without any knowledge of what coercion may have used, what tactics they might have used to pick it up. Look, this is so rife for fraud. And in North Carolina in 2018, an entire congressional election was invalidated and had to be rerun.

When I was with the NYPD under Rudy Giuliani, again, this aggressive style of policing where we actually enforce the law, Sean, people were afraid. These gangs and people who had grievances against others are now shooting, they were afraid to carry their guns because if you are caught with an illegal firearm, there is a guaranteed minimum of time in jail. There is no anti-crime unit, Sean. Nobody is stopping and frisking anyone or they're catching in public, drunk or whatever it may be. So, everybody is like, hey, it's the wild west.

We see it every two years and every four years, and as we now march closer to the election, the three-month mark, the smear machine is only going to get worse. Prepare yourself for the greatest insanity, emotional rollercoaster -- well, you probably never seen before. What do they do every two and four years? They divide this country, old, young, rich, poor. They use racial identity politics. They have bizarre conspiracy theories. They are even getting more bizarre. And on Sunday, professional Fox stalker, we call him affectionately Humpty- Dumpty, literally comparing the president to a driver who is trying to crash his car intentionally. In Humpty's -- well, melodramatic scenario, the car represents our democracy. We are a democratic republic, if we can keep it, as Ben Franklin once warned. Now, Democrat Jamie Raskin actually accused the president of turning the GOP into a religious cult. And tonight, this kind of extreme rhetoric is not just Trump derangement syndrome. It is an intentional distraction coupled with derangement and real psychosis to keep your attention away from all things, yeah, the ever corrupt, confused and slow Joe Biden. It's also that the Democrats and their state-run socialist TV allies, they are actually scared to death that you, the American people, will reelect Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. And for the sake of our kids and grandkids, and the world, I pray we do. They know that Joe is weak. They know he's corrupt. They know his track record is pathetic. He's one of the worst presidential candidates in history. He is hiding because of it. And Pelosi, Schumer, Bolshevik Bernie, AOC's policies, if they are implemented, they will destroy what is the greatest country God has given man and put the world in great peril. Without us leading, the world is in deep trouble, which brings us to an important \"Hannity\" history lesson. So, in 51 years of public life, OK, ask yourself at home -- what has Joe Biden accomplished? I can tell you what child has accomplished in less than four. Let's start with Biden's uncanny knack for always making the wrong decision. For example, Biden opposed the 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed bin Laden. Biden also spoke out against a successful Petraeus Iraq troop surge in 2007, and Biden was an enthusiastic supporter of Obama's strategy to abandon the Middle East which, of course, left a massive vacuum that was soon filled by ISIS. Oh, yeah, and he pushed the big lie, keep your doctor, plan and save money. Millions lost their doctors, their plans. We're all paying about 200 percent more. He voted for the war in Iraq, now he says a mistake. Biden also on the wrong side of racial integration. Let's go to NBC News, shall we? He led the charge on an issue that kept black students away from the classrooms of white students. As Biden once said, he did not want his children to grow up in a racial jungle. Senator Kamala Harris, now a front runner we hear, who knows, maybe ahead fake for Biden's veepstakes. But just a few months ago, she had this to say about Biden's anti-integration efforts. Wow. Take a look."

Pretty pathetic and by the way, Biden's horrific track record doesn't end there. A few years ago during the Barack and Joe days, there it administration, Biden was a point person for Ukraine-U.S. relations. And during that time, we already know he allowed Putin to steal Crimea, all while zero experience son, well, Hunter got filthy rich, thanks to the sketchy deal with the pro-Russian energy company all while leveraging a billion dollars of your money. Quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter. Biden also was in charge of the administration's China policy and for years, Joe -- well, he did his best to cozy up to the country's ruling communist party, all while again, Hunter -- well, he struck another lucrative deal, this time with the Bank of China. No experience anyone can find. Flash forward to this year when President Trump signed off on the life- saving travel ban to and from China. Ten days after the first identified coronavirus case here, Biden was against the ban. He is one who called it hysterical xenophobia and fearmongering. How many thousands of American lives were saved by the president's decision ten days after that first case in the U.S.? And, by the way, to do that, while he was also being impeached. Joe, wrong as usual. So, it's a horrific track record. Well, we sent our own Lawrence Jones, our 2020 correspondent. He went out to the streets of New York to see if anyone could just name a single positive achievement from Biden's five decades of public life. I haven't seen this yet.

I think that's a notable accomplishment in this day and age. And, finally, Joe Biden might not activate. That will be a singular accomplishment. When people are wondering if he has the vigor to get on stage for an hour or two hours, he might say, I don't have the vigor, I can't stand on there.

No. I will tell you the one thing that his policies have pushed for which is that, for example, supporting the 1994 crime bill which led to the mass incarceration of many black Americans. And as we know, it took President Trump working with those Democrats and Republicans to push forward criminal justice reform and sentencing reform which we know has been one of President Trump's biggest accomplishments. So I think for Joe Biden, look, he's a follower. He was the one that has bad judgment after bad judgment when it came to foreign policy and not saying, look, let's go and go after Osama bin Laden. He is one who has basically said, you know, China, they're not a real threat. So, I think it's bad judgment, bad decisions coming from Joe Biden and just truly being a follower. As we know, he's now following the socialist party, which is why he has made a decision to sign and join this socialist manifesto put together by Bernie Sanders, that we know is going to lead to incredible increases of taxes here in the United States as well as really negatively impact our economy."

You know, you would think if you have the courage of his convictions, if he had strength, if he had will and fortitude, he would stand up for the things he used to believe in. But no, that was part of the whole movement of the entire Democratic Party to the left, and Joe Biden went happily along with it. So, when people think that he's a moderate, he's no moderate. The only difference now is we have the socialists -- the avowed socialist wing of the Democratic Party menu had the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Joe Biden belongs to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and he will be surrounded and buffeted by the socialist wing to which he has yielded. That's not a sign of strength. It's a sign of weakness."

And I have to tell you I think, you know, I've been traveling across the country with the Women for Trump bus tour, and when you go talk to Americans, they're saying, I am scared we're going to lose our country. The mere fact that socialism has seeped into the United States where you're seeing cities burn down, where you're seeing so many of the violence happening in these cities, where -- and these protests, it just shows that Americans are concerned. They are concerned about ensuring that we have safe communities, that we do not defund the police. As we know, many of these Democrats in the far left agreed to. In fact we know Joe Biden says we need to redirect the resources from the police and I just think that that is not a winning issue at all for these Democrats. At the end of the day, President Trump is a common sense president. He knows what it takes to help Americans get through this coronavirus pandemic as well as ensure that we maintain a strong economy and keep our communities safe."

The debates, well, they could be disaster. Although the bar is so low, I guess if he shows up, he's going to -- the mob and the media, he won. He showed up. He didn't really mess up too bad. But, of course, that bar so low, the media mob, they will cheer and applaud Biden if he doesn't make a total, complete full of himself. What's more concerning is that Biden is now controlled, as we've been talking about, the radical socialist extremists in his party, even plagiarized, as we've been saying, Bernie's economic policy, actually word for word. Put AOC in charge of implementing the New Green Deal, that's trillions of your dollars. Beto Bozo, he is the guns are, the confiscation guide. And I mention Schumer and Pelosi, and what they're trying to do, it's a very scary scenario for the future of the country if enacted.

Families divided, never able to (AUDIO GAP) see their relatives again. Others died before they could see them again. So, it's a terrible tragedy embedded in this. But I want to say something (AUDIO GAP), Sean. (AUDIO GAP) this one comment, this is not about one comment. This isn't really to be some -- she's not being sincere when she says it's about one comment. Congresswoman Bass has a long, appears to be, three to four-decade history of being an admirer of the Castro regime. It started as a student. It continued during (AUDIO GAP) during her time in government and even up into her time here in Congress. She frequently visited the island, both as the part of Venceremos Brigades that were there to participate in the revolution and be helpful to it, and as recently as a few years ago. So, this is about more than just one comment. And let me say one more thing, what she said the other day that Republicans have taken to calling every Democratic communist, that's just false. I'm the first to tell you, there are many Democrats that have worked with us on this issue, a number of them that feel strongly about it, especially in Florida, but other parts of the country.

When we come back -- well, Senator Tom Cotton weighing on the Democrats playing politics when it comes to the relief bill. The dangers about voter fraud. Has it happened in the past? We'll tell you about it. And Lawrence Jones, you do not want to miss his exclusive investigation. You want to know what defunding the police looks like?

The president tweeting, quote, in an illegal late night coup, Nevada's -- well, clubhouse governor made it impossible for Republicans to win the state. The Post Office could never handle the traffic of mail-in votes without preparation. Using COVID to steal the state. We'll see you in court. Now, also already seeing the disaster of mass mail in voting, for example, right, in New York, the New York City, as six weeks later two congressional races, two, remain undecided as officials trade blame over the mishandling of ballots. And don't forget, just this summer, while in Paterson, New Jersey, local officials were among those charged in a voter fraud scheme. Recently in Los Angeles, four men were sentenced for their role in a voter fraud operation."

Here with reaction, Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, let's -- let's talk first about this whole thing because there is a danger here and we have chronicled examples. Kevin McCarthy told me, in California, they're going to count votes cast 17 days after the Election Day? What?"

    {
      "speaker": "SEN. TOM COTTON, R-ARK.",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Sean, there is a grave danger of fraud from mail-in balloting. Let's be clear about the difference between mail-in ballot and absentee ballots. When you vote absentee, you submit an application, you expect the ballot, you get it, you mail it back in. There's a track record at every step of the process. These states like Nevada and New York that want to move to mail-in balloting, they're talking about sending a live, real ballots to every single person who is registered, whether they wanted one or not, whether their address has been verified, whether they are alive or dead, and then they're going to allow ballot harvesting as well, which is when party activists can around and pick up hundreds or thousands of those ballots, and return them without any knowledge of what coercion may have used, what tactics they might have used to pick it up. Look, this is so rife for fraud. And in North Carolina in 2018, an entire congressional election was invalidated and had to be rerun. The fact that the Democrats in places like Nevada are already trying to change the rules, it goes to show you just how nervous they're getting about this election."

Let me ask you about the COVID relief package. First, you recently said China is deeply indifferent to human life. Chinese government party, communist party is responsible for the virus. They should be held accountable. Are the Democrats trying to prevent victims of what they unleashed on the world from getting compensated when they're guilty as hell? I agree with you."

Unfortunately, that's just in keeping with too many Democrats' soft on China approach which reflects the leader of their party, Joe Biden, who has been sending factories and jobs to China for decades with nothing to show for it -- other than a job for Hunter Biden."

This is to help put out the hot spots, needed money for those people still needing economic help. The Democrats did this before. They did it twice. They want now $3 trillion but they are willing to hold up money again. OK. Why? And why $3 trillion when the president has proposed a trillion?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Well, Sean, it's because it's never enough of the Democrats. They always want more and they always want to throw it after special interest. What we need to do is distinguish between what the American people need and what Democrats want. Those who are still out of work especially in industries like restaurants and hospitality, or airlines, they need enhanced unemployment payments. Our schools need some extra money to be able to get our kids back into school safely and responsibly. We need to be able to help small businesses who depend on the Paycheck Protection Program. The Democrats want to throw away all kinds of money on the Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, and all their pet projects. It's not time for that."

I also talked with my New York City police source. He tells me that there is a debate currently going on between the mayor and the commissioner about bringing the anti-crime unit back to New York City after the pressure and seeing the skyrocketing crime rates. They are debating right now what to call it now. They don't want to call it the anti-crime unit. But, Sean, I think this is just politics as usual."

It's not hyperbole that people in this city wake up and reach a redline with a reach a frustration level where they start to vote for something different. Listen, I keep regular contact with law enforcement officials of the federal and former friends of mine at the NYPD. I am hearing two things, Sean, call them the 2Gs or whatever. The spike in homicides and shootings is largely due to gangs and grievances. Now, a lot of these prior grievances from people who would've been in jail under broken windows, relatively aggressive, not physically aggressive, aggressive policing. They would have been in jail, they're not in jail. So, now, they're outside. They have nothing to do. We have this recession because of the coronavirus nursing, and you're seeing people shooting each other. Now, these gangs come you're seeing an explosion of violence there and they say why is it happening recently. Well, there's a reason behind that. When I was with the NYPD under Rudy Giuliani, again, this aggressive style of policing where we actually enforce the law, Sean, people were afraid. These gangs and people who had grievances against others are now shooting, they were afraid to carry their guns because if you are caught with an illegal firearm, there is a guaranteed minimum of time in jail. There is no anti-crime unit, Sean. Nobody is stopping and frisking anyone or they're catching in public, drunk or whatever it may be. So, everybody is like, hey, it's the wild west. I'll carry my gun wherever I want. They run into a guy they don't like and instead of punching him in the face, they shoot him. Listen, none of this is rocking science. You can turn -- rocket science -- you can turn around tomorrow if you had a mayor with some, you can figure out the rest, who is willing to actually enforce the law."

Like that's just a fact. And, ironically, Sean, violent crime in some of these big cities, other violent crime outside of homicide and shootings, is actually down. You know why?
