So comedy is not their thing, maybe why Griffin is now embracing tragedy. What we are going to show you is disturbing, so if there are kids in the room, tell them to go get you a beer.

I suppose I can say the same about Griffin by simply pointing to the contents in any bus station public toilet. But if you are mentally stable -- unlike Griffin -- you will see this for what it is. First, it is a beheading of the president. Imagine how CNN would react if it were President Obama or Hillary Clinton, done by someone here. Brian Stelter's lip would be extra sweaty -- if that's indeed possible. But Griffin's art also mocks those murdered by ISIS. The joke is deliberately linked to those beheadings. The joke is not just on Donald's head, but on theirs as well. So sure, call it art. But we know what it is. It is a cop-out. You are milking attention through an infantile effort to enrage. So, if we get mad, you win. So we should shrug instead. I would say Kathy should hang her head in shame, but she must know what shame is first.",
