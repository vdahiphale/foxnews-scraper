Freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib makes a huge deal about wanting to go to Israel, but then says \"no, thanks\" when she's granted a visa. Victor Davis Hanson is here on that.

Israel denied Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib's request for a visa, but then she said she needed a humanitarian exemption to visit her sick grandmother. The country reversed its decision and granted Tlaib permission, only for the radical freshman to say, ah, never mind. And of course, the liberal left is going bonkers over the whole thing.

The Israeli minister who proved the non-political visit by Tlaib tweeted this, in part, \"I approved her request as a gesture of goodwill on a humanitarian basis, but it was just a provocative request aimed at bashing the State of Israel.

Nancy Pelosi dismissed the so-called Squad and said they have more votes. But remember when those 41 Democratic Representatives went to Israel, it was a news blackout. They didn't want to mention they were even inside Israel. And when we look at the failure to pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, you can see they have enormous amount of influence. And why is that true? And I think what we're seeing is a passing of the old guard. I mean, there was a time when Dick Durbin or Nancy Pelosi or Steny Hoyer or Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein represented the liberal Jewish tradition in the Democratic Party. But that's starting to fade. There's changing demography. There's a lot of identity politics that has a long history of anti- Semitism. I can't mention the names Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, the Reverend Wright without coming up with an easy, quote, and I could do it on demand of something that's terribly anti-Semitic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then there's something else going on. And that is I think this new generation of young Jewish Americans. They're assimilated. They remind me of the Greek lobby. They're not observant Jews. And they find their Jewish heritage sort of an embarrassment in the confines of the progressive movement. So a lot of this new generation is not speaking up on behalf of Israel. Some have not been to Israel. And I think we're going to see a landmark change in the Democratic Party very shortly. And this so-called--",

It appears she wanted to be allowed to go and then say no to the invitation, at least that's what happened. Here is how President Trump explained it in a tweet tonight. \"Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted, whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib's grandmother. She doesn't have to see her now!\" Tlaib and her fellow Congressional member Ilhan Omar were planning a trip to, in their words, Palestine. Israel first agreed to let them in. Then President Trump tweeted it would show weakness on Israel's part because the Congresswomen support an anti-Israeli movement called BDS that promotes sanctions against Israel for its policies in the West Bank. Then, after the Trump tweet, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government said the two weren't welcome citing Israeli law that allows the government to ban entry for those who support BDS. Next, Tlaib wrote on Congressional letterhead saying she would like to visit her grandmother and \"I will respect any restrictions and will not promote boycotts against Israel during my visit.\" Within hours of that letter, overnight last night, Israel said, OK, and then Tlaib said essentially, never mind, I'm not coming. The Israeli minister who proved the non-political visit by Tlaib tweeted this, in part, \"I approved her request as a gesture of goodwill on a humanitarian basis, but it was just a provocative request aimed at bashing the State of Israel. Apparently, her hate for Israel overcomes her love for her grandmother.\" That is a take on the quote by the late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, who said we will only have peace with the Arabs, Jason, when they love their children more than they hate us."

Nancy Pelosi dismissed the so-called Squad and said they have more votes. But remember when those 41 Democratic Representatives went to Israel, it was a news blackout. They didn't want to mention they were even inside Israel. And when we look at the failure to pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, you can see they have enormous amount of influence. And why is that true? And I think what we're seeing is a passing of the old guard. I mean, there was a time when Dick Durbin or Nancy Pelosi or Steny Hoyer or Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein represented the liberal Jewish tradition in the Democratic Party. But that's starting to fade. There's changing demography. There's a lot of identity politics that has a long history of anti- Semitism. I can't mention the names Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, the Reverend Wright without coming up with an easy, quote, and I could do it on demand of something that's terribly anti-Semitic. And then there's something else going on. And that is I think this new generation of young Jewish Americans. They're assimilated. They remind me of the Greek lobby. They're not observant Jews. And they find their Jewish heritage sort of an embarrassment in the confines of the progressive movement. So a lot of this new generation is not speaking up on behalf of Israel. Some have not been to Israel. And I think we're going to see a landmark change in the Democratic Party very shortly. And this so-called--"

And that is, when the Squad says that they're worried about occupied territories, they never talk about occupied Cyprus and Turkey. When they talk about refugees, they never talk about the half million Jews, up to a million that were ethnically cleansed from the Middle East and much less the 13 million Germans that walked back to Germany about the same time as the Palestinians were made refugees. So it's always selective. And all of the problems in the world are of no interest to Representatives Omar and Tlaib. It's only Israel, this tiny little democracy, this oasis in a sea of autocracy and dictatorship that they focus on. And the question is, why do they focus on it? And that is they have a deep-seeded anti- Semitism and a hatred to this successful country.

Look, Jason, as someone who spent years on the news side of \"The Wall Street Journal\" before I moved over to the opinion side, not unusual for leaders to task a group of reporters to focus on a particular subject. But it's usually something that they're trying to bring something to light like unemployment in a particular city or breakthroughs in AIDS drugs. The goal is to report, highlight an issue, maybe win a prize. This is entirely different. This is Baquet saying, look, basically we have a partisan and political agenda to push a narrative out there. And he also admitted, which I thought was incredibly honest and revealing, why did we do it? Well, one, because of the sentiment of reporters within their newsroom; and two - and he had a quote. He said, you know, well, the problem was our readers who really want Trump gone, they saw the results of the Mueller report and thought, oh, blankety-blank. So now we need to change focus, and we're moving on to Trump is a racist. It was incredible."

He says here - this is the Executive Editor of \"The New York Times.\" And he says, \"We built our newsroom to cover one story, and we did it truly well.\" First of all - there's so much that's wrong with that. First of all, you build the newsroom to cover a story because - and it turns out to be totally false."

Not to presuppose that Donald Trump was colluding with Russians or obstructing justice, which is, of course, their mission. And then, as you say, totally embarrassing, how can you say we did a good job when the Mueller report proved almost everything that you reported to be completely false over the past two years? The only thing that's good about this, Jason, is they've now informed us what they're going to do. The next subject is, again, Trump is a racist. And I think one of the problems that Times has is how can anyone trust any accuracy in that story given the failure in the last?"

Bryan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRYAN LLENAS, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Jason, good evening. Look, New York City's Chief Medical Examiner announcing the findings of Jeffrey Epstein's autopsy in just one sentence, \"After careful review of all investigative information, including complete autopsy findings, the determination on the death of Jeffrey Epstein is below. Cause: Hanging. Manner: Suicide.\" \"The Daily Beast\" is reporting marks found on Epstein's neck are consistent with those left by a fabric. That matches reports that Epstein hanged himself with a bed sheet off of his bunk inside of his cell in the special housing unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Epstein was found dead in his cell last Saturday morning. His autopsy was completed on Sunday. But the medical examiner said she needed further information to complete the report. And now, tonight, Epstein's defense team says it's not satisfied with the examiner's conclusions, and the team intends to \"conduct its own independent and complete investigation.\" His lawyers are demanding to see surveillance video of the hallways outside of Epstein's jail cell. There was speculation over the last couple of days about whether Epstein really did this to himself after \"The Washington Post\" reported Epstein broke multiple bones in his neck, including the hyoid bone near the Adam's apple. The hyoid can break in hangings, but experts say such a break is more common in homicidal strangulation. The medical examiner concluding this was not a homicide. Now, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Bureau of Prisons are all investigating the circumstances of Epstein's death. This, as a source, tells us, Jason, that some MCC jail staff have not been initially cooperative with investigators. Jason?"

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Bryan, thank you very much for that reporting. Joining me now is John Iannarelli, former FBI National Spokesman and former FBI Special Agent in Charge, and John Yoo, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General. John Yoo, I would like to start with you. Based on this, it's interesting to me that the counsel for the now deceased, Jeffrey Epstein, the three attorneys there are saying, hey, we're not buying it, we're not concluding that. For those of us sitting home and darked (ph) in the legal world, what does that mean when the person who supposedly committed suicide, his own legal team is saying we don't believe it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Jason, I agree. That's a very strange thing for his lawyers to do. I think maybe in part this is an effort to try to protect the estate in some way, although I don't think it really makes sense. I think what the best thing for them to do at this point is to accept the medical examiner's conclusion to stop - I think everyone should stop spreading conspiracy theories that somehow some nefarious outside forces got to him like at the end of Godfather II and got him to kill himself or got people to kill himself, and to recognize that this prison might be mismanaged. It seems like guards might have lied. There was inappropriate supervision of the employees. And to ask the Attorney General to get to the bottom of it, even the House and other bodies can get to the bottom of it. And to make sure that the public has confidence about our prison system going forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Now, John Iannarelli, you have got a perspective too. Your time as a special agent and in the FBI, there were reports that the Attorney General was wanting updates every three hours. There was something highly suspicious here. And the highest profile prisoner they probably had at the time - there are other prisoners of high profile and of vital performance. But when you see these attorneys discrediting - questioning this report, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN IANNARELLI, FORMER FBI NATIONAL SPOKESMAN",
      "utterance": "Two words come to mind. Billable hours. The reality is whether he was murdered - which he wasn't, it was a suicide - or, in fact, a suicide. He was still arrested for the crimes that are being alleged and going to be found guilty. They need to move on from that because the victims are out there and they're still suffering from having been Epstein's victims. This is all a sideshow to the fact that it's not unusual. You got a billionaire guy whose life is going to change forever. He's going to prison and not getting out. Not a big surprise in the law enforcement world that he decides to take his own life."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. I would agree with you in part. But John Yoo, what is surprising to me, and we had the brain room here at Fox News confirm this, that in the 40 years of existence of that prison, only one other time in the history of that, for 40 years, has anybody ever successfully committed suicide. So, I mean, come on that's a little suspicious, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "I completely agree with you. I can see why people are worried about this. As you say, in 40 years, there's only been one successful suicide. I there've only been three attempted suicides there. You have weird facts. There are guards there who weren't checking in on Mr. Epstein at the rate they were supposed to. You have the cells not covered by surveillance cameras. His roommate wasn't there. I don't blame people for asking these kinds of questions. In fact, the Attorney General of the United States says something funny was going on here. Usually, though, I tend to chalk these things up to incompetence rather than maliciousness. And I think that's why - as you are a Congressman and you did a good job in oversight, this is a good example of when you need outside investigation from either the top of the Justice Department, like the independent - I'm sorry, the inspector general or even House and Senate Oversight Committees over the Justice Department and let all the facts out. Let's have a transparent investigation. I think that's what the Attorney General wants to do. We need to restore confidence in the integrity of our prison system."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "No. I think government, in general, is suffering because they just don't trust them when all of a sudden, things break down and it's so suspicious. Mr. Iannarelli, before I get you to comment, I want you to hear the sounds from one of the prison consultants and their take on things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACK DONSON, FEDERAL PRISON CONSULTANT",
      "utterance": "Let's see the tapes because every federal prison has what they refer to as range cameras. So even though there's not individual cell cameras in the cells ordinarily, there are range cameras."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "What's your take on that when you hear them say that? I mean, there - every door has cameras on both sides of it so that the guards can actually see what's going on, who's coming and going. There's going to be a lot of tapes there, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "IANNARELLI",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. For your viewing population that has not been to a prison, I will tell you, it's not like walking into 7-Eleven. Doors aren't going to slide open for you. There are checks and procedures. You have to show multiple forms of identification. The reality is there's many different points. You have to identify yourself. So nobody is just going to wander in, commit a murder, and wander out. I think it's important that we shouldn't underestimate the government's ability to be incompetent and allow things like this to happen. As far as the suicides, you put more billionaires in prison, you're going to see more suicides. That's the reality. Somebody having a dramatic change in their life and deciding to take their own life as a result."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "So, John Yoo, where do we go from here? Where is this case going next?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "It's a good question, Mr. Chaffetz. Look, the prosecution is still going to go ahead because Mr. Epstein was, according to the government's view, conspiring with other people to engage in child sex trafficking. So that's still going to continue. Anybody who was helping or cooperating with Mr. Epstein, they shouldn't think this is over. Second, the government can still try to seize the assets that Mr. Epstein used where these crimes occurred, try to use that to distribute assets to victims. And then, today we're seeing news of more people coming forward, filing lawsuits against the estate. And I think when this gets this all - I'm sorry, but this is going to get into what we call probate law and trust and estates law. So a terrible thing to have to get involved with. A lot of lawyers are going to involve. But what's going to happen is that the judge is going to oversee that, hopefully will distribute the estate and try to make sure that all the victims are fairly compensated. It's not going to make up for what Mr. Epstein did, but they verily still have some chance to tell their side of the story and to get compensation for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. My take on it is the reason that three attorneys for Mr. Epstein are trying to discredit this is because they're trying to limit the liability. But as both of you have pointed out, the lawyers always make out like the bandits that they should. But I do hope there is justice for all of these particular young women who were harmed and more than harmed along the way. But gentlemen, I appreciate your expertise tonight and thank you for joining us."

      "utterance": "First off, the only think I would tell them is get out of the building, fire them. I don't know any employees want to see their companies lose millions of contracts with the federal government. They're supposed to be techie smart, this younger generation, but these people are morons because they haven't studied the issues. Study the issue, find out what ICE actually does. Do you know nine out of 10 people that ICE arrests are criminals, convicted criminals, are pending criminal charges against a United States citizen? Do you know that ICE took enough opioids off of the street last year to kill every man, woman, and child in this country twice? Do you know ICE has saved thousands of children from child predators? Do you know ICE has saved hundreds of women from sex trafficking? Do you know ICE arrested 137,000 criminals, public safety threats off of your streets to make your streets safer? And as far as Nazis, let me educate you on that too. ICE actually has an entire division that investigates and removes human rights violators. During my 34 years with ICE, we actually arrested and removed hundreds of Nazi war criminals to go back and stand trial. ICE arrests human rights violators every year, hundreds, and sends them back to their homeland to face charges. So ICE is an exact opposite operational mold. We attack human violators and we remove them and have them deported so they can face their consequences back in their homeland."

      "utterance": "Brandon, you understand how this technology works and why this contract -- first of all, Google doesn't need to bid on these contracts. There are other good companies out there that can do a lot of this, so their fight is internal. But tell people the irony of what they're -- what they're trying to -- what they're advocating for."

    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "So, these people are saying that we have to protect these illegal immigrants that are coming across the border illegally. If we can't process them, if we don't have the technology that Google can offer, then we can't process them in a timely manner and we have to hold them even longer. So what they're asking us to do is they're asking us to actually hold them in our custody even longer because they won't give us the technology in order to process them through. What makes me sick is you've had the opportunity, I've had the opportunity, I wish all of the American citizens would be able to talk with President Trump. What he wants to do is he wants to protect the American people. And because he wants to protect the American people, he gets called names and he gets vilified, when in reality, the villains are the cartels that put these people in danger when they're crossing the border illegally. And now Google wants to put even more people into the hands of the cartels because that's what invites them to come here to the United States illegally in the first place."

      "utterance": "It's absolutely disgusting. And what I see actually Google doing is bending all of the rules and trying to help out China. But they won't help out our Pentagon, they won't help our military, they don't want to help the law enforcement here in this country. Google, go ahead, stop bidding on those contracts because you have more in tune with China and what they want to do and bending your rules. It's absolutely disgusting. We had this horrific case, and, Tom, I want you to comment on it. A young 11-year-old girl allegedly raped by a 27-year-old and a 28-year-old. These alleged punks right here were under deportation orders, at least I know one of them was. But explain what your organization, what you see in law enforcement, what their role is. And, remember, there's an 11-year-old girl who was raped repeatedly, and law enforcement has to go in and take care of it, and your folks are the ones that actually do it."

      "utterance": "Actually, that's exactly right. And maybe the Google employees ought to listen to this. Now, these two subjects, one was actually arrested, went through due process, was deported back to El Salvador for re-entry into the United States, which is a felony. The other had due process and ordered to remove, but he just failed to leave. And for these people who want to see ICE and the Border Patrol fail, this is what happened. Montgomery County is a sanctuary city. Knowingly releasing a public safety threat out to the public to -- look, you have to look at recidivism rates. Half of them will commit a crime in the first year, 75 percent will recommit in five years. ICE is keeping communities safe. Again, let me throw out a number, 137,000 convicted criminals we took off of the streets of this country. So to the Google employees, to AOC and the squad, you're welcome. AOC, we arrested 5,000 criminal aliens off of the streets in New York. I've done for the safety of New York than you did. So let's stop hating on ICE and Border Patrol. These are heroes. Border Patrol agents and ICE agents have died serving this country. They strap a gun to their hip every day to protect this nation."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "You're right. We have tens of thousands of heroes, men and women who put their lives on the line to take care of those punks and get them out of the street. A federal judge ordered them to leave the country. And they didn't just pack up their bags and go. Somebody's got to go in there, put their life on the line, drag them out of here, and kick their ass out of the country. It doesn't happen magically by typing something into your Google browser. So those punks at Google have got to figure out and get a reality check, get out of your Palo Alto chairs, and go live yourself down on the border and see what these men and women do. Stop disparaging them, attacking them that they're the bad guys. If you've got a problem, you go talk to AOC, you go talk to the Democrats, you go talk to Congress, because they enforce the law. I've seen it up close and personal. I have been out there. I've been on the border. I've seen what they do. And I just come in and do it for a day or two. They do it every day. And I'm sick of these Google punks and what they're doing. I've got to take a deep breath. I've got to take a deep breath. But I've got to tell you, I appreciate what you do. We're out of time. I've got to keep going because this network sells commercials."

It wasn't the right thing to do. A lot of people don't know what the government of Greenland is anyway. And now many people actually do know. But, no, to say that on national media, it's not the right way to go. But it was a commentator, and it was a guest, and it is to be expected from the media that slants to the left."

Yes, and it seems to be a recurring trend, whether it be -- Hillary Clinton called her opponent's supporters deplorables, or Peter Strzok said the Walmart smelly people. It's never a good strategy to try to attack the supporters of the other side. You're trying to win over those voters, and it's this common theme of what I like to call the elites of Malibu and Manhattan that really don't think very highly of people of Michigan or Missouri or Montana, the middle parts of this country. And it's this condescension, is this greater than thou elitism, if you will, that I don't think is a very smart or wise political strategy."

Moving on here, I think this might be the last one, late-night show host Stephen Colbert, who bashes President Trump pretty much every hour on the hour, made this bizarre claim on CNN's Anderson Cooper last night. Watch this. STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, \"THE LATE SHOW\": I'm not going against him. I am not the resistance. This is not the resistance. This is alternative programming. What we want to do is point and laugh at what he thinks is his own unassailable dignity that he thinks he gets from that office. But that's not resisting. That's laughing. And it's not the same thing. I'm not a political figure."

They clap because he's not funny, he's a political commentator, because they used to laugh when you used go to a late night television, now everyone claps because he's saying things that they agree with. In order to have comedy, you must actually be funny, which Stephen Colbert is not. He used to be when he used to make fun of both sides, but now he just cares about hating Donald Trump."
