Alice Johnson, I mean, don't just give her a pardon. Give her a show. She was -- she is an absolute natural. And I guess she learn -- I mean, I thought that she was impressive. Dana White, you know, a tough cookie, incredibly forceful.

I thought it was an effective speech and effective week. They reignited the base and also extending a hand to other people. The framing of the fight against coronavirus as a war and America always wins wars was very effective. He really laid out what he accomplished in the last four years, basically stuffed two terms into one, which is pretty incredible. And then cast out a vision for the future, talking about untangling ourselves from China and making us the manufacturing super power, winning the race to 5G, putting a man on Mars, tax relief and war on crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It was a very uplifting message for the second term.

He said Joe wants to keep you in the dark about what he wants to do because his radical proposals are so dangerous and he is a member of a party that can't even keep the lights on in a place like California where you're seeing rolling blackouts. So, I mean, that's kind of like a management issue and Donald Trump wins that very effectively. The end the historical flourish that he brought together when he talked about the American pioneer spirit that forges a character by pushing forward into the frontier, defining us as rugged individuals with flair and style but we're successful because we kind of work together as one and kind of weaving the America first populist movement into that historical momentum and then casting out a vision for the future.

He talked about religious liberty. He talked about protecting abortion rights. He talked about increasing the economy. So, I think there were plenty of agenda items that were there. And I think that, you know, I don't think that the overall delivery was as strong as we have seen at certain times from the president. And I do wonder as I mentioned last night, if it was a great strategy to put him out there every single day because it doesn't lead to that sort of big moment when you've seen the president so many times all throughout the week. However, we do see a lot of the president in, you know, every 24 hours news cycle as was pointed out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One of the things that I thought, when you talk about the groups that they want to inspire to bring the vote out, you've the make America great vote. And then you have the black American vote which obviously they are trying to get as well, and you've the women's suburban vote. And I thought that in many he tried to appeal to all of them of course at different points, but the speech because it was very long so it hit on pretty much everybody. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But in terms of the MAGA crowd, right, one of the things that I thought was a line that was so potent that I haven't heard discussed that much. And I'm kind of paraphrasing a little bit, but he talked about Joe Biden sort of talking the talk with blue collar workers but not walking the walk. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He said he has empathy for blue collar workers but he said, then he sends your jobs to China and he sends your sons to war.",

You know, the speech that President Trump gave was long, but they very strategic in addressing every single issue.

President Trump attacked Joe Biden's record and then explained what his record is on the issue after four years in the White House and what he would do in the future on the issue. And I think one of the most effective speeches too -- speakers was Ivanka Trump.

    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, probably because there is less that you've seen of Joe Biden. So they had to check him out. You could see -- you could see Trump every single day. Basically, it's the Trump show every day. But, Joe, you know, he's basically, you know, he's like a mole. He's just living underground until he has to come up every now and then. I thought last night was amazing and how preferable, non-politicians are to politicians in terms of, I don't know, presenting ideas and being persuasive. Alice Johnson, I mean, don't just give her a pardon. Give her a show. She was -- she is an absolute natural. And I guess she learn -- I mean, I thought that she was impressive. Dana White, you know, a tough cookie, incredibly forceful. And then you have, Anne -- you know, Ann Dorn who was the voice that was neglected by the media because her story didn't fit their narrative. You know, because the media believes certain lives matter more than other lives. And it was necessary to remind everyone that she lost her husband. Because when you excuse the mob, you know, the mob grows and people die. But when you look at everybody, you look at Alice Johnson and Dana White, you look at Jack Brewer, you look at Burgess, Herschel Walker, Sister Byrne. The idea of a Republican Party as a country club, that cliche is dead. It's over. That idea of the Republican Party no longer exists. It's now the party of law-abiding Americans who want to live free. That's all it is. It was a great message."

It seemed slow at points. And even the attacks on Joe Biden from the president -- and normally he's just so -- you know, he's got punch, that guy can really stir people up -- I just thought they felt like reruns to me. So, what was your view of the speech?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "I'm very angry with the president. I told him all week to keep it ending before 11. And he kept me up until 11.30. I'm a mess today, Juan. I can barely keep my eyes open. But I'm going to just give him a pass on it. I know it was a very special night. I would disagree with you strongly. I thought it was an effective speech and effective week. They reignited the base and also extending a hand to other people. The framing of the fight against coronavirus as a war and America always wins wars was very effective. He really laid out what he accomplished in the last four years, basically stuffed two terms into one, which is pretty incredible. And then cast out a vision for the future, talking about untangling ourselves from China and making us the manufacturing super power, winning the race to 5G, putting a man on Mars, tax relief and war on crime. It was a very uplifting message for the second term. But I did think he defined Biden as someone who has been on the wrong side of history, as someone that's been on the wrong side of every trade deal, every foreign policy decision. As someone who is beholden to the far left and China. And he kind of had a rhetorical flip flop with Joe's thing, he said during the DNC as he's an ally of the light. He said Joe wants to keep you in the dark about what he wants to do because his radical proposals are so dangerous and he is a member of a party that can't even keep the lights on in a place like California where you're seeing rolling blackouts. So, I mean, that's kind of like a management issue and Donald Trump wins that very effectively. The end the historical flourish that he brought together when he talked about the American pioneer spirit that forges a character by pushing forward into the frontier, defining us as rugged individuals with flair and style but we're successful because we kind of work together as one and kind of weaving the America first populist movement into that historical momentum and then casting out a vision for the future. That's what great leaders do."

      "utterance": "All right. I get the message. All right. So, Martha, one of the lines of questioning today about the president's speech is, did he make the case for what he would do if reelected in the next four years? This is coming from lots of people who said, he never answered Sean Hannity, he can't answer the New York Times. Did he do it in the speech last night, Martha?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Well, to a certain extent, he tried to, in one of the end section of the speech. He went through a number of things. He talked creating 10 million jobs over the next 10 months. He talked about wanting to go to Mars. Putting a woman on Mars was one of the things that he mentioned at the end. So, he wants to push forward the space program. He talked about religious liberty. He talked about protecting abortion rights. He talked about increasing the economy. So, I think there were plenty of agenda items that were there. And I think that, you know, I don't think that the overall delivery was as strong as we have seen at certain times from the president. And I do wonder as I mentioned last night, if it was a great strategy to put him out there every single day because it doesn't lead to that sort of big moment when you've seen the president so many times all throughout the week. However, we do see a lot of the president in, you know, every 24 hours news cycle as was pointed out. One of the things that I thought, when you talk about the groups that they want to inspire to bring the vote out, you've the make America great vote. And then you have the black American vote which obviously they are trying to get as well, and you've the women's suburban vote. And I thought that in many he tried to appeal to all of them of course at different points, but the speech because it was very long so it hit on pretty much everybody. But in terms of the MAGA crowd, right, one of the things that I thought was a line that was so potent that I haven't heard discussed that much. And I'm kind of paraphrasing a little bit, but he talked about Joe Biden sort of talking the talk with blue collar workers but not walking the walk. He said he has empathy for blue collar workers but he said, then he sends your jobs to China and he sends your sons to war."

He knows he needs to win those states. He is behind in the polls in all of them right now. They say their polls look better but those are the polls that everybody else can look at and see. So, he's got to bring out more people that will resonate with that and he's got to prevent Joe Biden from pulling those votes away from him. And I thought that was a pretty powerful line of attack."

What do you think?"

You know, I'm not going to comment on the family members. But she was in the crowd last night at the White House on the south lawn with her family who happens to not share the same skin color as her, by the way, to listen to the president. And you don't have to be a Trump supporter to want safe communities and to want to stop people from losing their lives simply for defending the property that they have worked so hard over a lifetime to keep and to, you know, use to provide for their family. But I want to touch on another issue real quickly before we go. You know, the speech that President Trump gave was long, but they very strategic in addressing every single issue. So, whether if you are a single-issue voter, they went through basically every single topic you could imagine in that speech. President Trump attacked Joe Biden's record and then explained what his record is on the issue after four years in the White House and what he would do in the future on the issue. And I think one of the most effective speeches too -- speakers was Ivanka Trump. Because she talked about how she's been in Washington, it's a tough place and her father has forced her to look at her own convictions about the way that politics and policy affect real people. And President Trump was very effective in showing people he is trying to get to vote for him. That he is still an outsider not a corrupted Washington politician after being here for four years. And he's going to continue to keep at bay those temptations about what D.C. can do. For people like Joe Biden who, as Martha pointed out, said a whole lot of things to blue collar workers and to union workers and voted for the opposite when he was in Washington, D.C."

This is what was laughed at by people at CNN and elsewhere of this kind of idea. Just months ago, laughing at this sort of thing and the it would become political expedient to condemn violence. They will do it. Cloud research did some research and found that 12 percent of Republicans do not report about their true opinion about their preferred candidate in polls. And it's a -- it's about 11 percent independents. They call it the shy voter. This is why the mob. You cannot express -- there are people in the United States who have more freedom of speech than you do. Think about that. Think about that. If you put on that Trump hat, you're going to get your ass kicked. And people can say that's B.S. No, we know it. I've watched enough of these videos.

And here we are with the third time. Greg brings up -- Greg brings up Democrats not standing up to the mob. Look, they've actually been encouraging the mob. You had Maxine Waters in 2018 saying that you need to harass Trump supporters wherever they are and make them uncomfortable in department stores, at the grocery store, anywhere you see them make them uncomfortable. You had Kamala Harris earlier this summer when asked about the protestors. And she said they will not stop and they should not stop. They're not going to stop on election day and they are not going to stop after election day. So, it's not that they haven't -- you know, they are just cowards who don't want to address this.

Mike Pence has been traveling all over to swing states for months now talking to voters. President Trump tonight is having this rally in New Hampshire. The contrast is last week Joe Biden didn't have anything on his public schedule for the entire week after his DNC speech. And today, you had six mayors in Democrats, usually Democrat strongholds in Minnesota coming out to endorse President Trump while Vice President Pence was there campaigning.

This will not be a Tulsa-like event, remember where some of President Trump went and some of his own staff got sick and other people in the community then suffered an outbreak. So, it won't be that. And I think that when you think about it, you know, as Katie was saying, it's not too late. I mean, he's still up in the polls. His strategy is not one that is somehow, you know, terminally flawed. I think that if you think about Pelosi too, and people were talking about that, I think Pelosi is busy trolling the right-wing here. I think she's calling attention to the fact that Trump tells so many lies and saying, hey, why are we going to debate a guy who just makes things up?

She's calling attention to the fact that Donald Trump doesn't tell the truth. Oh, man, I can't believe -- who would have ever thought that before? It's the first time I ever heard that. First, I just want to commemorate something. It has been one month since Joe Biden has given a press conference. There we go. Joe Biden leaving his basement acknowledges something. It acknowledges the fact that Donald Trump's plan to defeat the Coronavirus has been successful, that now Joe Biden can safely leave his basement and safely travel and safely interact with other people, like the same thing everybody else has been doing since June, and that's one thing. The second thing is it's an acknowledgment that he knows that he can't coast until November. And where he's going is interesting. He's mostly going to blue states. So he's playing on the defense.

But what I really want to see in New York is an extension of what Jerry Seinfeld wrote about in terms of not giving up on the city. As someone who loves the city of New York, I don't understand where the campaign is. I feel like my whole life there have been these campaigns to get people out and loving their city again. The I Love New York campaign that after 9/11, all of the ideas that pull people together. And it's it feels like there's no one in charge. Like, no one is sort of leading that movement in New York right now to bring -- except for Jerry Seinfeld. So thank God for him and i and i hope it catches on and we hear work concerts like this in whatever form we can to try to generate some enthusiasm in the city again."

I think a lot of these stars are going to be tested in reality the day before they come and then they have testing procedures almost like the sports people do inside the bubble. Every day, they're going to be tested. So on that, that's the way that you bring business back, that you bring a big event back to the big city, and that's probably a good thing. So while people might say hey, it looks like hypocrisy. I think what's going on behind the scenes is these big corporations, as Jesse was saying, they take care of people in such a way that it keeps it safe."
