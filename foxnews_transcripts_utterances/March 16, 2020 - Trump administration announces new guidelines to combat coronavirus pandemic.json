They become forced compliance. So it is in the interest of young people to take this seriously, to listen to what people are saying, and to really take seriously that this isn't just about them. You had Dr. Birx talk about how this about saving the greatest generation, the millennial generation can step up and do that. And also I think it's really interesting to watch how quickly local authorities are moving as well, whether it's on the city level or the state level. You saw in New York today a number of things changed. You see in Washington, D.C., things are changing.

We lost precious time that we cannot make up, but we have to put our foot on the pedal here, go forward, and give the states and the cities what they need, because, to Katie's point, many of the things she mentioned have been in place in many other states and cities in last two weeks, in the last 24 or 48 hours, long before the federal government got to it.
