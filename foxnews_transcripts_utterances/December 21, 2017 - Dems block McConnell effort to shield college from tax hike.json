Here's what happened. In the bill, there was a tax hike on wealthy universities like Harvard, Sanford, and Yale. They would all now have to pay taxes on the gains from the enormous endowment. Harvard is 35 billion, for example. Stanford is 22 billion. But the law swept in Little Berea College in Kentucky as well -- endowment 1.2 billion. Berea is one of seven work schools in the state, tuition is free. But the students work on campus during their four years. The college president says they were a casualty of the bill. And that will be tough on students. Mitch McConnell tried in desperation to turn it around. He was not successful in doing that. Bernie Sanders said no way. Majority leader McConnell joins me now."

They work their way through as your set up piece pointed out. They are the cooks, the waiters, people who are cleaning the dorms. It's a great concept. They have built up a significant endowment over the years. It was started in the 1850's by the Appalachians and a lot of wealthy have contributed to their endowment over the years. And all of a sudden, earned the same category with Harvard and Yale. Look, we're going to fix this.

So, obviously, a big win this week for the GOP, something you worked very hard on. Is there -- you know, at some point, are you going to address spending? That becomes sort of the big next issue. And, we know on the House side, the Liberty Caucus is speaking out saying they would like to see spending addressed. Is that something that you see in terms of welfare reform, for example, in 2018?"

The last thing that President Trump and Republican leaders wanted to do after that big tax cut victory yesterday was to have a big government shut down here to divert attention from all of that. So, it's very clear that what they're doing here with this stop-gap measure is get to about January 19th, sort of kick the can down the road on some of the bigger spending decisions, go home for the holidays, deal with a lot of that next year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "This enables them to move forward on some of these key budget issues. The president signaled earlier today that he didn't want to see a big budget fight right now. Instead, he wanted to give the Republicans a chance to bask in this victory over tax cuts. In fact, earlier today, the president tweeted this quote",
      "utterance": "\"House Democrats want a shutdown for holidays in order to distract from the very popular just passed tax cuts. House Republicans don't let this happen. Pass the C.R. today and keep our government open.\" And, indeed, Democrats seem to still be smarting a little bit from the president's big win on taxes. After Obama Aide, Dan Pfeifer, tweeted this triumphant photo of the president with the Republican leaders in the oval office yesterday, and said that he'd like to see it on front pages when the president is, \"indicted\". Well, Obama official Ben Rhodes actually retweeted that with this snarky comment that the photo should also be used \"alongside the obits\", as in obituaries, \"for Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnel, and Vice President Mike Pence.\" That drew a lot of scorn today. Meanwhile, House Democratic Leader, Nancy Pelosi, went back to resisting the president's agenda. She told her colleagues they had to vote no on this stop-gap measure because it did not include a provision allowing the children of illegal immigrants to stay in American. Listen."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "The bigger point is that after the tax cut victory, remember, Democrats had been predicting that cutting corporate taxes would not trickle down to employees. And yet, you've seen Wells Fargo, AT&T, other big companies say, actually, they're giving out bonuses, some of them are raising wages. And so, what's interesting is that Democrats have kind of maneuvered themselves into voting against lower taxes, and being against right now higher wages for workers since they said that this would not happen. That's not a place that Democrats want to be, Martha, heading into next year's midterms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Ed, you can almost sense from them, when you look at those sound bites, and you read those tweets that they know that this has put them in a tight spot. And you also have to wonder if Republicans aren't really glad that this was a completely partisan vote right down party lines. They didn't work that hard to bring Democrats on board, and they probably like it that way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, you're right. Because Democrats have been banking on the idea that the public would buy the argument that this would not trickle down to employees, that seems to be blown out of the water. And by the argument that it's not going to help the middle-class. As you know, there's been study after study suggesting this is going to help the middle-class big time. The proof is going to be in the pudding. Time has to play out here. And in the months ahead, we'll see whether or not the middle-class feels it, and whether some of those poll numbers that say -- that basically say the public doesn't like this tax cut whether or not those numbers turn into Republican's favor on that one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And you're going to see it in housing numbers, you're going to see it in retail numbers. As you said, the proof will be in the pudding whether or not people have more money in their pocket, more disposable income, and put that they put that money to work in the economy. So, it's going to be very interesting to watch in 2018 as we head towards those midterms how all this reverberates. Ed, thank you very much. Always good to see you."

He was just there earlier this week, but this time he was meeting with investigators working on a joint investigation involving two house committees -- judiciary and oversight. The chairman of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees sent a letter to the Department of Justice Tuesday night, not long after McCabe finished his seven-hour testimony with the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.

Was it because of the Trump dossier that was funded by the Democrats and compiled by Christopher Steele? Did the FBI pay Christopher Steele for that dossier?

Democrats are warning that all of this is part of an effort to discredit the investigation into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election."

Devin Nunes is at the center of a lot of this story today. It came out in Politico saying that he has been huddled, you know, sort of secretly for weeks was the phrase that they use. And they're getting together to try to figure out whether or not there is corruption at the highest levels of the DOJ and the FBI. And then, you know, on the other side of the fence, Marc, you have a huge criticism of Devin Nunes, you know, asking why he's back on the scene, he removed himself from the Russia investigation. We all remember the moment when he went quickly over to the White House to sort of share with them what he knew about this dossier. So, what do you make of his involvement and these supposed secret meetings?"

      "speaker": "MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE SCHOLAR",

Look, you've had senior members of the Justice Department fired from their jobs and disciplined for improper conduct. There's an ongoing internal inspector general investigation at the Justice Department into that improper conduct. And Congress is a (INAUDIBLE) branch of government would be advocating its responsibility if it didn't look into this. None of that, by the way, undermines the credibility of the Mueller probe at all, because it was Bob Mueller -- it was Mueller, who when he found out about Peter Strzok and his virulent anti-Trump e-mails he fired him. So, he did the right thing. But he had something to fire someone for. And it's not just him, it's also Bruce Ohr, who was a senior official, who was meeting with Trump -- with the Fusion GPS, married to a Fusion GPS person. Met with Christopher Steele who is the guy behind the Clinton-funded Trump dossier, and didn't tell his superiors. He's also been disciplined. So, you've got people being disciplined. Internal investigation -- why would Congress not look into this? It would be an abnegation of responsibility."

And Juan, there are people who are currently in the FBI and people not too long out of the FBI who are so unhappy with what they have seen going on from the Clinton investigation to now. So, this idea that it impugns the integrity to even ask these questions, to even say, wait a minute, you know, is there bias involved with Clinton? Was she given, you know -- was she sort of softballed handled? And was Trump sort of jumped on before he even had a chance to get into the White House? You know, these are -- why are these questions that are not even -- we're not even allowed to ask in terms of impugning their credibility?"

We've had Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General; we've had Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, who's in charge of the Mueller probe. We've had Christopher Wray, who's Head of the FBI, all say there is nothing right now of any significance that would undermine what Robert Mueller is doing. Instead, Devin Nunes who as you pointed out, Martha, was earlier involved and had to recuse himself and now back in charge is conducting an investigation solely among Republicans, no Democrats allowed in the room. No participation. So, it's not in keeping with a true congressional investigation. This is a partisan attack."

But the problem is that you know, the testimony that you talked about, with Rosenstein, and with Andrew McCabe and Christopher Wray, that was all in front of congressional committees who can't get any information that they want. They're going to have to subpoena to get the actual information about the dossier, Marc, correct?"

And look, again, they didn't say that there was nothing wrong or there was nothing done improper, what they said was repeatedly, I can't comment on that because there's an internal investigation being done by the inspector general. So, I mean, I worked on Capitol Hill for seven years. When there is an internal investigation by the inspector general, when people have been fired and demoted for political bias and doing things that were contrary to the conduct, Congress investigates that, and there were Democrats questioning McCabe today and there were Democrats questioning Ohr today. So, this whole focus on Nunes is a distraction. There is some serious misconduct going on, and we need to get to the bottom of it, just like we need to get to the bottom if there was any kind of collusion between Trump and Russia."

But despite her, and the president's tough talk, including threats of withholding funding from the U.S. to countries who voted against, the general assembly overwhelmingly voted to condemn the United States decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move the U.S. embassy there. Ambassador Haley tweeted this, \"The vote is in -- 65 countries refuse to condemn the United States and 128 voted against us.\" And now as promised, Ambassador Nikki Haley is taking note of the non-supporters, inviting those 65 U.N. members who didn't vote for the resolution to a special reception. Here now, John Bolton who served as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and is a Fox News Contributor. Welcome, Ambassador Bolton, good to see you tonight."

You know, this little theater episode of theater wouldn't have happened, but for the stage that the U.N. general assembly provides. And it's such an insulting, meaningless exercise in international virtue signaling that I think it really -- the administration should get very serious about how we fund a whole range of U.N. activity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, it is very interesting, as you say, that just the exercise of standing up there of going through this process and saying we're doing this because this is what the American people want, and because we believe it's the right thing to do. That we should be able to put our embassy where we believe it should be. And as you point out, fascinating that there are -- there were more countries than anyone expected who abstained. I mean, you know, that's not the most courageous position in the world, but they didn't vote no. So is there -- you know, is there a movement happening as a result of the bold stance that we've seen over the course of this year by Ambassador Haley and by the president."

    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I don't think there's any question about it. I think if they have had longer to mobilize to conduct diplomacy not just in New York, but in capitals calling ambassadors in here in Washington, that they might have even gotten more to abstain. Look, what this was is an act of theology in New York. We had the French ambassador say today that international law dictates that Jerusalem, we can't recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. That's just simply not true. The New York Times reporter who wrote on the subject said, look, consensus that international law says that east Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state. That is flatly untrue as well. U.N. resolution Security Council resolution 242 says that the parameters of the Israeli state and whatever else is on the other side of it are to be determined by negotiation. That's the controling U.N. resolution and the rest of this is propaganda."

Listen, there's a huge anti-Israel bias in the U.N. We've known that for years. And there's also an undercurrent of anti-American bias. This is sort of reflective of it. I think on the table should be President Trump did it, funding for the U.N. based on their reform. I disagree with going after our allies on foreign aid. I think foreign aid should be province of our national interest. And I don't think we should let a symbolic vote like this that has no authority whatsoever to interfere with what is our true national interest with our allies."

It's a lesser case to be sure than what their primary objective is, which is nuclearizing ICBM's. And you're right. I mean, they are getting closer, according to Director Pompeo, who certainly got my attention when he said they're not years away, they're months away, and he made that proclamation about a month and a half ago. So, that means sometime in 2018, at least in the mind of the director of CIA, they will have a nuclearized ICBM capability that's functional. That means it can reenter the earth's atmosphere and it's also miniaturized so that it could work effectively on top of an ICBM. So, yeah, we're getting closer to a showdown."

So, it's not hard for them to acquire that, to buy that kind of technology from the Russians or others who have it. So, I think the CIA -- I'm just speculating. I don't talk to the CIA about something like this. Certainly has an understanding of that. And the other problem we have, we're running out of time because sanctions, Martha, takes much longer."

That coal is still being shipped to China, and China is giving them revenue for it despite China's protestations that they're not going to do that anymore. And secondly, North Korea is still receiving oil. They're transferring it out on the open sea off the coast of North Korea to a third party, which is helping to sustain the regime. There is no evidence looking at North Korea's regime that it's in any state of near economic collapse. Not happening. So, this is going -- sanctions are going to take longer. Showdown may be coming.

Look, I've spoken to a number of tech attorneys who are telling me that their clients are no longer able to attract, since the beginning of this administration, are no longer able to attract the best and the brightest and the most talented they're trying to attract. Not only has their visa process been slowed down, but if their spouses may not be able to work. The chaos the administration has already caused, particularly for the dreamers, the 13,000 who've already lost status. So that's people who -- this is the only country they've ever known. They were working and in school here legally, but now because of administrative action by this administration, they no longer have that status. That's chaos."

You know, illegal immigration and slowing that down, stopping, was part of the Trump doctrine, but also legal immigration. Martha, part of making America great again is putting America and Americans first. And there is tremendous -- there is a tremendous amount of tech talent in this country, and so Trump is going to slow down the H-1B program. He's going to slow down the immigration of people who come to America from places like India and other countries and drive down wages. Make jobs worse for Americans. This is putting American first. Companies will be forced to hire Americans. And this immigration will be slowed down. We have full employment and it will be picked back up again."

I do want to get your thoughts on this before I let you guys go. A student at the University of California, San Diego, is being labeled a racist tonight. Gregory Lu hung 150 of these posters with the face of Kate Steinle, and on the bottom it said she had dreams, too. You'll recall that Steinle was killed in San Francisco. The accused gunman was recently acquitted. The posters were quickly ripped down. The UCSD College Democrats even going so far to post on their Facebook, we refuse to let racist statements pass to ignore slights to the immigrant community and to let our everyday conversations devolve into threatening hateful swill. The student that hung the poster was later contacted by the school office of prevention and harassment -- meeting about discrimination. We reached out to the school, and they said they conducted a review and sent this statement. In this particular case no formal investigation has been planned at this time. Nonetheless, the posters came down. A student was called racist for saying she had dreams, too. What could possibly be wrong with that, Emily?"

So, what does this movement towards keeping Christmas in the holiday season mean for the country? Here now, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. He met with the president just last week to offer counsel on religious issues. Tony, good to see you as always. Tell us about your meeting with the president on religious issues.

He said, hey, Merry Christmas. You know, we can say Merry Christmas again. And as you said, the White House has made it very prominent in all of their displays. The -- not only the decorations, but as you pointed out the Christmas card that the White House sends out, which has been absent in the last 8 years. You know, we've moved away from the political correct happy holidays to Merry Christmas. And I think, Martha, very important to understand this is about a lot more than just, you know, some assault on Santa Claus once a year. This is about an ongoing attack on religious freedom in the public square, and when the president made this a center point of his campaign, as a candidate, the media kind of went what's this all about? But it was a very clear message that the president understood that the ability to express your faith in the public square was under assault. And he was going to be pushing back on that."

We have the card from years past which said season's greetings from the White House. I don't think it means anything really to anyone. There was also a ceremony for Hanukkah, a menorah ceremony for Hanukkah that was at the White House as well.

And two thirds of those recognize and believe the biblical story of Christmas that Christ was born as a child in a manger in Bethlehem. He came to be the savior of mankind. It was announced by angels. And so, most Americans believe that. But you are right in terms of people feel relieved when you say Merry Christmas. I've tried this, many stores.

And we have this cultural creation of conflict over Christmas because it seen as a religious expression, because most Americans see it as a religious holiday. So, the president coming to the forefront and saying, look, we're going to say Merry Christmas again. It is a signal to say, you know what? It's OK to express yourself on religious issues in our culture. And his policies have followed that. We're going to the executive order on religious liberty. We're hearing from federal employees, career employees that are saying you know what? We've never seen this before. They're calling us all in and saying, hey, this is Christmas time. Feel free to say Merry Christmas. Enjoy this time with your family and friends. And this is a breath of fresh air.

That's a pretty good deal being the pastor of First Baptist in Bethlehem. But they're under intense pressure, a majority Arab-Muslim culture. And they're saying pray for us.
