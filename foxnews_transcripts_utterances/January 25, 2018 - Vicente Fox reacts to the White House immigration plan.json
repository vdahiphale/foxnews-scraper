      "sentences": "Everybody, welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington, an evening of major breaking news on both sides of the Atlantic and we have it all covered for you. You don't want to move, President Trump at Davos in Switzerland and he's explaining to world leaders and business honchos why his America first policies are actually going to be good for a lot of other people, as well. Back in Washington the White House drops a bombshell immigration plan and they do it ahead of schedule of President Vicente Fox might actually like this plan. That is scary to me. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } People on both sides of the aisle are up in arms and in moments I will take on frequent Trump critic, and former president from Mexico, Vicente Fox, on the details of that immigration plan and a lot more. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, we have five months of those missing text messages between the FBI's lovebirds and they have actually been found.

The global elite gather once a year in a small town nestled in the Swiss Alps to discuss political, economic and humanitarian challenges facing the world. As a businessman, Trump actually never made the guest list and he is the first president to go to Davos since Bill Clinton, who only attended his last year in office. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Though, it's a conference where your net worth is described with Bs and not Ms, and where people with Trump's populist views are considered persona non-grata. World leaders from business to politics issued a series of dire warnings in advance of Trump's appearance at Davos, and I'll bet they made the editorial writers at the Wall Street Journal giddy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Everybody, welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington, an evening of major breaking news on both sides of the Atlantic and we have it all covered for you. You don't want to move, President Trump at Davos in Switzerland and he's explaining to world leaders and business honchos why his America first policies are actually going to be good for a lot of other people, as well. Back in Washington the White House drops a bombshell immigration plan and they do it ahead of schedule of President Vicente Fox might actually like this plan. That is scary to me. People on both sides of the aisle are up in arms and in moments I will take on frequent Trump critic, and former president from Mexico, Vicente Fox, on the details of that immigration plan and a lot more. Plus, we have five months of those missing text messages between the FBI's lovebirds and they have actually been found. We asked, and they have been found. We are going to tell you what the investigators have uncovered thus far. But first, Trump takes on the elites in Davos, that is the focus of tonight's Angle. The global elite gather once a year in a small town nestled in the Swiss Alps to discuss political, economic and humanitarian challenges facing the world. As a businessman, Trump actually never made the guest list and he is the first president to go to Davos since Bill Clinton, who only attended his last year in office. Though, it's a conference where your net worth is described with Bs and not Ms, and where people with Trump's populist views are considered persona non-grata. World leaders from business to politics issued a series of dire warnings in advance of Trump's appearance at Davos, and I'll bet they made the editorial writers at the Wall Street Journal giddy."

      "utterance": "That is a bad poster. They were really stretching. Well, once again, Trump has to fight expectations and is surprising the world. The president crashed their swanky globalist party today and though, the world leaders continue to hit his policies on trade as protectionist, they are taking notice. Elites scrambled to take selfies with him and they could not stop talking about him. They were elbowing each other out of the way along that stairway or escalator to get close and there was substance from the president as well. It wasn't just they wanted a photo, they wanted to hear what he had to say and sitting next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump threatened to withhold aid to the Palestinians unless they return to peace talks. And then, this is important, he challenged Netanyahu."

      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Israel says they want to make peace. They are going to have to want to make peace too or we will have nothing to do with them any longer. They never got past Jerusalem. We took it off the table. You will win a point and give up points later in the negotiation if it ever takes place. I don't know if that will ever take place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Wait a second, I don't think we talk about that. I think that's a gutsy negotiator working for a deal in real time, you see it all play out. Then the president sat down with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, who still suffering from the post-Brexit blues. And it has been reported that she has had a very strained relationship with President Trump."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, at the conclusion of the meeting, it was announced that the president's trip to the U.K. is back on track, it will happen within the year. It will be a working trip, we don't know, but is a win, nonetheless. And contrary to all that hyperbole coming from the \"we are the world\" types, Trump will not stop trading with other countries. He is not itching to blow up the world and he is not going to stop all immigration into the U.S. In fact, we have a lot of news later in the show about what will be specifically offered and the president's deal on immigration. What president Trump will do is he'll pursue changes in policies that have been detrimental to U.S. workers, manufacturing and importantly, U.S. wages. Now what does that mean? That means America will no longer tolerate being taken advantage by freeloaders or cheated in international trade deals or have its intellectual property stolen by rivals. Those days are over. Whether you are an ally like South Korea or an adversary like China, our president has put you on notice that the old days of practicing globalization on the backs of the American people are also over."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We sing the American anthem. He has not president of the world, he is president of the United States. Though some of these world leaders continue to deride his policies and shied him from the sidelines, they are taking notice. And if you listen closely, it is hard to miss how Trumpism, the pragmatic approach to issues like asylees and refugees and immigration is maybe transforming the way other leaders think about these issues. This is the German Chancellor Angela Merkel from today."

      "speaker": "ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator)",

That's what we are all about, independent free nations with unique identities standing up for their own interests and working with others. That is what Trump is all about. That's what Trump is actually doing here. We are taking our own destiny into our own hands and we are not allowing some far-off bureaucracy to decide our future for us. After seeing Trump's leadership on border enforcement and immigration in the U.S., Ms. Merkle might be seeing a little bit of the light herself."

      "utterance": "It's no wonder. In Germany in 2016, the crime rate among migrants and refugees skyrocketed by more than 50 percent. According to \"The Telegraph,\" migrants committed nearly 175,000 suspected crimes in Germany. Suddenly, President Trump's law and order approach at the border is looking pretty good, isn't it? So, the elites still snipe, though, at Trump for his dismissal of their climate change dogma as the French president did today or they bristle at his decision to renegotiate NAFTA or stand up to cheating and intellectual property theft by China and other nations. He is, undoubtedly, shaking up the world order and reshaping the global debate in a very positive way, and though, it might not make him any friends at Davos, Trump's America first philosophy is reviving our economy at home and its positioning us to lead from a place of strength and it's about time, and that is the Angle. Joining me now is former president of Mexico and frequent Trump critique, Vicente Fox, the author of a brand-new book just out, \"Let's Move On: Beyond Fear and False Prophets.\" He is an author and have been chatting about a lot of things. It's great to see you. How are you?"

I mean, you have said everything from compared him to Hitler, an ugly American, rude, racist, going to start a war, not a real leader. One year into the Trump administration, the American economy is thriving. Manufacturing is up. Wages in some sectors are up. Confidence is at an all-time high. African-American unemployment 17-year low since it was recorded. So, many great barometers, but you really have nothing positive to say about him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOX",
      "utterance": "No. But let me tell you, it is good that the economy moves. We all knew the world economy before Trump and with Trump is getting close to 5 percent growth. So, it is dynamic and growing. The (inaudible) of 80 percent of the economy of the global economy outside of the U.S. So, yes, there might be a something to recognize that Trump with the economic activity pretty much depends on expectations. So, we are still waiting to see that all of this becomes true and then the economy will keep going."

Those 50,000 a year would go toward the people now waiting in line to come legally, and keeping the nuclear family together but extending the family chain migration. It's 1.8million people given amnesty."

    {
      "speaker": "FOX",
      "utterance": "Yes, 1 million more than what he said last week, but 1 million from what he said two weeks ago. I hope he gains credibility. Everyone doubts it will happen. My only concern is that it is conditioned to getting $25 billion from Congress so that makes me happy because then Mexico is not going to pay for it. So, the U.S. Congress and taxpayers will pay for that wall. Number two, it doesn't make me happy because to exchange one young, dreamy person that is facing the future for himself, for $1 I would not change it. So, 25,000 I would not exchange it. So, I don't know why you have to tie up together these two things. Let's get those kids really supported. They want to stay here and if not, we welcome them in Mexico, we would love to have them. They have university degrees and they are great human talents. On the case of the 25,000, how many good things you can do with 25,000 --"

Satisfying their need to be safe from criminals so they flee your country and come to our country.

Vicente Fox has spent the past five years urging the United States to upgrade the status of millions of illegals from Mexico. Meanwhile, his own government has given legal status to only 15,000 foreigners without papers. You deported 140,000 in 2003 and deported 120,000 in 2002 and from 2002 to 2006, the number of the detainments and deportations was up 74 percent. So, you are trashing the U.S. for deporting Mexicans and other people from our country, we don't do that much, and meanwhile, you are deporting plenty of people and lots of problems with the way immigrants were treated in the early part of your tenure."

That news was first reported by The New York Times earlier tonight. Let's explore that and a lot else with the former Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz in Miami, and in Orlando, Congressman Ron DeSantis, Republican from Florida, and here in studio, my friend, attorney, and Democratic strategist, Scott Bolden. All right. We have a lot to get through. Professor, let's start with you on this \"New York Times\" report that the president wanted to ax Mueller and McGahn said, can't do it.

On the other hand, it would have been very unwise, politically, and it would have sounded like an admission of some kind of guilt. He is so much better off following his current lawyer's advice, as well, which says, look, be nice to Mueller, say you have nothing to hide, be willing to sit down and be interviewed by him under oath and have nothing to lose when you do it under oath. This is just as much a crime to lie not under oath as under oath, and respond to the questions and try to wrap up the inquiry. That is the best advice that he possibly get."

Let's move on to the missing texts that were discovered, and a lot of people thought you had to go to the NSA for these texts, but they found them including one interesting text in particular. Strzok and Page discussed via text how many personnel from DOJ and FBI would be included in the Clinton investigation and they said one more thing, she might be our next president. The last thing you need is us going in there and loaded for bear. Do you think she is going to remember or care that it was more DOJ than FBI? Strzok says agreed. I called Bill and relayed what we discussed. He agrees. I will email you and (redacted) same. Does that indicate more of a kid gloves treatment to Hillary in that one text or are we making too much of that, Ron?"

I mean, we have the whole investigation and how it was conducted and all the inflection points, they were bending over backwards not to make a case against Hillary. Writing the memo two months before they interviewed her and changing grossly negligent, which is criminal culpability to extreme carelessness. So, I think it's one more data point that these two folks in the FBI did have a political bias. But I also think, you know, the FBI said and DOJ, we cannot fight these things and just like the IRS with Louis Lerner's e-mails. They did not even really look for them and hear the inspector general gets them in the next two days. So, I want to know who is responsible for sending that response to Congress saying they were deleted because that was not true."

Sounds like a Jeff Flake plan to me when we come back."

A path of citizenship, for now 1.8 million illegal immigrants, who arrived as children, much more than the 800,000 currently under just the DACA protection. $25 billion for border wall and security. And elimination of the visa lottery program and an end to chain migration, they call it protecting the nuclear family. That's how they're describing that. But how will this fly with the Trump base and also my reaction from my guests to that interview I just did with Vicente Fox. I'm joined by Fox News contributor, former congressman, Jason Chaffetz from Phoenix. And here in studio, former Obama state department official, David Tafuri. Great to see both of you. Before we get into this immigration plan, David, you are watching Vicente Fox, former president of Mexico for six years. What were your thoughts on that?"

But I thought it was interesting his take on the wall. You don't see -- I think his opposition to the wall and building a fence is the fact that it'll actually work. I think people like Vicente Fox are actually OK with human trafficking. I think they're OK with the moving of drugs because it's good for the economy of Mexico and the fact that the wall -- fact of the matter is the wall works. They don't actually want to solve that problem."

It's not something -- if I were still in congress that I could vote for and support, I'm OK with the legal status, but I don't see them. I think they should get in line like everybody else. And you know who were not serving the people that are forgotten? The people who weren't willing to break the law. The people who are trying to come here legally and lawfully. The people who have been waiting in line, those are the people we have been failing. I don't think they should get a special pathway to citizenship. Not one person, let alone 1.8 million of them."

Oh, great. \"The 50 percent cut to legal immigration, the framework and the recent announcements to end temporary protected status for central Americans and Haitians are both part of the same cruel agenda. They are part of the Trump administration's unmistakable campaign to make America White again.\" Oh, isn't she lovely? I think we need to update that photo to make it more recent, by the way. What's your reaction to that? Come on, 1.8 million from Donald Trump and she's calling it like a white supremacist proposal? She's off her rocker meds or whatever it is. I don't know what it is."

Some Democrats are not going to like it clearly, as you heard from Pelosi and other leaders. Some Republicans, hardline Republicans don't like it either. The compromise that they reached is they're going to have a pathway for citizenship for Dreamers. That's important. In exchange, they're going to have a lot of money for the wall and border security. Some Democrats don't like that. But that's a reasonable thing for Democrats to give up in exchange for the Dreamers. Now, there are 803,000 Dreamers right now, as you pointed out, 1.8 million could get into this program, but they have to apply, so they're not all immediately going to become on the pathway to legal citizenship under this deal. They have to apply. But it is interesting that Trump has extended, almost expanded the ability of people in the Dreamer program. That was unexpected. But this is the trade-off. Democrats aren't going to like that. I'm saying this. But I think it's a good deal."

But for Nancy Pelosi to call it basically white supremacist, you just lose all credibility on that completely.

Here's what the author wrote, a few days ago in the Hollywood Reporter. \"Donald Trump is taking his presidency as he did his election, on nothing less than destroying the credibility of the news media and the media are determined to do the same to him. Only one side can achieve victory, to a stunning degree, the press is falling into the president's trap.\" We're delighted to welcome the writer of that piece, Howie Kurtz, the host of \"MediaBuzz\" on Fox News and the author of a soon to be huge New York Times, \"Media Madness: Donald Trump, the Press, and the War Over the Truth.\" Howie, there's so many nuggets in here we've got to get to and I love your piece of the Hollywood Reporter. I found this element from John Martin, Jonathan Martin from the New York Times that you captured in your book to be stunning. \"Weeks before the convention, an RNC staff member called Martin one night to challenge one of his stories. The reporter shot back, you're a racist and a fascist. Donald Trump is a racist and a fascist. We all know it and you're complicit. By supporting him, you're all culpable. Spicer called the top Times editor and unloaded about Jonathan Martin's behavior. Half an hour later, Martin called Spicer and demanded, how dare you go behind my back. What are you doing calling one of my editors? Excuse me, Spicer replied, you call one of my people and say this and I don't have the right to complain?\" Jonathan Martin is one of the top writers at the New York Times. HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, \"MEDIABUZZ\": Yes. He's a good reporter but I have four sources with first you know, including the RNC staffer that had this conversation. There's actually two conversations, had confirmed this for me and obviously -- Jonathan Martin is disputing it since the book came out. He says he can't imagine saying such a thing. But Spicer, Sean Spicer went on the radio show today and confirmed on the record that my account is accurate."

They said bonuses ranging from $500-$2000. The company will also spend a total of $250 million on pay hikes and increased benefits. Great news. And the day before, Mickey Mouse said it will spend $125 million on $1,000 bonuses to its 125,000 U.S.-based employees. That's a lot of fun in the land of fun. And J.P.
