And it also woos blue-collar and middle-class voters. He already cut their taxes. Now he's going to spend money. And he's forcing the Democrats to say are you going to vote with Crying Chuck and Nancy or are you going to vote in the interest of your people. And the same thing with immigration that's split the Democratic Party too, because they have on the one hand middle-class people whose wages go down through open borders, and I think a lot of union people also want the wall built. But then you have very loud Hispanic activists that are going to donate a lot of money and they're probably going to tie themselves to bulldozers on the borders to stop the wall. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the Republicans are on the box too, because on the one hand they want to end chain migration and the lottery system, but because of big business or ideology that some of them aren't crazy about the wall and some of them do or don't want to protect dreamers, but Trump has the Trump card because he has the leverage and can delay the deferment over the dreamer deal for six months and pull the rug out. So, I guess the wild card is either Mueller or crazy weather or some foreign affairs crisis. But I think 2018 is going to be pretty good.",

He did all he could executively this past year, and the two big wins at the end came through help from the legislature. Infrastructure is what he wants and, naturally, real estate tycoon and developer, he's going to obviously take a huge interest in it. It's not going to be like the Obama stimulus plan where it was a trillion dollars for shovel ready projects that were never shovel ready. Trump has always been known as someone that's going to do things on time and under budget. So, the asset here for him as he gets to leave the White House and campaign for these things in swing districts. And the pitch is going to be dumb politicians have wasted trillions in the sandbox in the Middle East with nothing to show for it. Let's rebuild this country. And it also woos blue-collar and middle-class voters. He already cut their taxes. Now he's going to spend money. And he's forcing the Democrats to say are you going to vote with Crying Chuck and Nancy or are you going to vote in the interest of your people. And the same thing with immigration that's split the Democratic Party too, because they have on the one hand middle-class people whose wages go down through open borders, and I think a lot of union people also want the wall built. But then you have very loud Hispanic activists that are going to donate a lot of money and they're probably going to tie themselves to bulldozers on the borders to stop the wall. But the Republicans are on the box too, because on the one hand they want to end chain migration and the lottery system, but because of big business or ideology that some of them aren't crazy about the wall and some of them do or don't want to protect dreamers, but Trump has the Trump card because he has the leverage and can delay the deferment over the dreamer deal for six months and pull the rug out. So, I guess the wild card is either Mueller or crazy weather or some foreign affairs crisis. But I think 2018 is going to be pretty good."

But it was Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator who came in and was like -- here's the five reasons that we should actually get out and laid it out and he was persuasive and he listened to him.

President Trump says, the people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their pockets. The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching.

They're more interested in Obama's false legacy than the actual victims and the brave people out there. This also illustrates the disgusting deception of Sharia apologists like Linda Sarsour, who was lauded by Team Vogue who claims that wearing hijab is some kind of feminist choice when it's by force. The silence American feminists in America, should say it's kind of redundant, should be stewing in their own shame for not saying anything about this, for remaining silent, for basically saying that American impression and Iranian impression is the same thing. Me Too should be called them too, and they should be supporting those women over there. If you want to look at pictures before the revolution, the essence of modernity among women, it was there. Now, these are women dressing as black ghosts by force.

And people have been critical of President Trump and his strategy here as it relates to Iran and cutting off some funding, but when you think about it, look directly, follow the money in terms of where those funds were going. They weren't going to help the lives of the Iranian people, and the economy, and for specific cost of living expenses.

Yesterday, Georgia started the year off very well for them, because in double overtime, the won. Final score was 54-48. Georgia's now headed to face Alabama in the national championship, and it hasn't beat Alabama since 2007. So I'm actually going to stay up and watch that game. I'll bring you play by play."

He really wanted to go to the Rose Bowl, so he wrote college football's greatest legal motion. OK? And his name is attorney J. Patrick Connell. And he's a huge Georgia Bulldogs fan. He had tickets to go to the Rose Bowl game with his brother, but the trial date was in the way. I hate it when that happens. So he wrote an epic emergency motion for continuance of trial, and argued the historical relevance of the game, that he would be traveling back home today and would, quote, \"be unable to appear at the bench trial.\" The judge had a good sense of humor, Superior Court Judge Michael Karpf, also a Georgia dogs fan, played along and agreed to move the court date, then jokingly added if Georgia lost, Patrick would have to show cause as to why they should not be held in contempt."
