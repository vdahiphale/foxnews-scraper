Nevada Dems abandoned a similar app instead opting to use Google software. But tonight, the state party sent a memo to campaigns saying they're ditching that plan too and instead relying on a phone-based system. The DNC trying to manage expectations, not committing to release any results on the day of the vote and saying, accuracy is more important than speed. This year they also have to factor in 75,000 early votes is the first time in history a caucus state has allowed early voting. Tomorrow's make-or-break for Democratic candidates who underperformed in the first two voting states and their hope is Nevada's diverse electorate will produce different results. Latinos make up nearly a third of the population and all the candidates are courting their support especially after the powerful Culinary Union, whose membership is more than 50 percent Latino declined to endorse a candidate. Today, Elizabeth Warren is hosting an event at a popular Las Vegas taco shop. Meantime, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg trying to shake off criticism following a shaky debate performance where he declined to release women who accused him of sexism from nondisclosure agreements. Today, he agreed to release three women. And Senator Bernie Sanders is hosting a rally in a couple of hours after he slammed reports of Russian efforts to help his campaign. But the candidate who stands to gain or lose the most is former Vice President Joe Biden, who has been relying on a firewall of black voters in South Carolina to bring his campaign back to life. But if he doesn't perform well here in Nevada, it could shake that support. Harris."

Good to see you this evening. Thanks for being with me. Let's go right there. I'm curious with Joe Biden right now as he tries to walk into Nevada and South Carolina and scoop up a more diverse electorate and hopefully get people of color behind him. What is his pitch to people of color? Why should they vote for him?"

And let's not forget that Barack Obama picked him pf all of the people to be his Vice President, because of that record. And so, I don't think he has much to say. I think it's pretty clear and he's also going for a diverse population like we have here in my district, not just Hispanics, but Asia Pacific Islanders, black voters, labor unions, seniors, a lot of people here are supporting Joe Biden."

One, let's start with the diversity issue and the tightening in some of the polling that shows that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are only running a couple of points behind or between each other. Joe Biden with about 31 percent, Sanders is about 29 percent, support of some black and Latino voters. How do you account for the speed and kind of the growth in popularity in that demographic for Bernie Sanders and what should Joe Biden do about it?"

      "speaker": "TITUS",

I was at Abby Debbie (ph) last night, a lot of people I was in Chinatown, 500 people at a restaurant at the door. Those are just poll numbers and polling in Nevada has never been very accurate. So, let's see how the vote turns out."

You know Biden's legislation that he was part of, in the 1990s with Bill Clinton that crime bill getting criticism as well as he is talking about what he can do with criminal justice reform. President Trump already gaining some ground on that. What are your thoughts?"

    {
      "speaker": "TITUS",
      "utterance": "Well, let's remember that the criminal justice bill that passed the Congress was nothing like when the President put forward, that was championed in the House by Democrats and was much revised version that came out, but it was a good step forward. And you can look at the stop and frisk issue for Bloomberg. That was a big issue in the debate. And he apologized, but--"

    {
      "speaker": "FAULKNER",
      "utterance": "I'm going to step in just one second. The act that Biden was part of that 1994 crime bill contributed to the mass incarceration and imprisonment and prison overcrowding that became a legacy point for that. One last one for you, Congresswoman. Vice President Joe Biden tonight talking about an arrest that happened in South Africa as he was trying to help win the freedom as others were as well of Nelson Mandela giving a lot of backlash on that this evening. Why do you think that is? Does he need to say that he was arrested trying to get a South African leader out of prison?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TITUS",
      "utterance": "Well, he wants to make his record clear and it goes back a long way of what he has done for African Americans and I just go back to the point that his record was such that Barack Obama, the first African American President, he was accused by Donald Trump of not even being a citizen chose him of all the senators, all the governors to run with him and he trusted him as his Vice President gave him the Medal of Freedom and said, it was the best decision he ever made."

A lot happened since the last few hours that we met at 1 PM Eastern today on overtime. So, let's get into it for Joe Biden. This - and you and I said it earlier, this is a big moment as we head into the Nevada caucuses for him, because he'll face an electorate now that he thinks he can connect with more. You heard me talking with the congresswoman. He's pulling out. I was arrested trying to get Nelson Mandela freed. I'm not sure if that's a one-on-one match for African Americans."

His problem is that Klobuchar, Buttigieg and most of all Bloomberg have hovered up this support from Biden who's been a weak front runner the whole time. Then he says, I'm going to deliver because I'm going to connect in these states with large minority populations and Nevada has much as the Democrats across the country do, a 40 percent nonwhite population in their electorate. That's about the expectation. This is a bad time to be involved in a controversy around a claim that's unsubstantiated that he was arrested trying to get Nelson Mandela freed from prison in South Africa. He never mentioned it in his books about it. He never talked about it before."

Flipside for Bloomberg, the emphasis comes off of him for a minute, it's on Bernie Sanders, it's on Joe Biden, they're both having a hard time - Bernie Sanders especially with now the revelation that Russia is rooting for him in this process.

My next guest within that classified briefing and says no one is going to believe this garbage. Congressman Devin Nunes, Ranking Member of the House Intel Committee is with me now. Good to see you. Let start with what happened inside that meeting and what we now know was this narrative that the President apparently would benefit from a Russia push, but then now late tonight so would Bernie Sanders."

      "speaker": "REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA)",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, look, the most concerning part about all this is that we can't talk about what happened in that meeting. So, if anything in the Washington Post story or the New York Times story is true about either Bernie Sanders or Putin's plans and intentions or anything else, nobody that's on the committee or that seen this classified information should be talking about it. Now it gets worse when you have The Washington Post claim that I went to the White House. Remember this story, didn't we hear this like three years ago that I was you know sneaking into the White House. I went to the White House to tell the President really bad things to get him to fire Maguire. Now look, I don't know what planet The Washington Post is on, but they'll have an opportunity in federal court in the next couple of weeks to explain who their sources are because I'm going to have to take them to court, because I didn't go to the White House. I didn't talk to President Trump, Harris. So, this is the same garbage. And the only way to get these guys to stop, I don't know where they build a narrative. They plant the narrative. They write fake stories about it of things that shouldn't even be talked about. You know this classified information and then they run these stories. Who the hell is leaking this if indeed it is true?"

In 2014, 2015 and even the spring of 2016 when I warned about and that was at the same time that the whole Russia gate started, and they started illegally spying on the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016. I was the one who warned about the Russia problem. Now, the Republican report that came out two years ago now, the Republican report was very clear.

And one of the things is - what you were introducing about the calls for Bloomberg to quit the race, Bloomberg brought all this on himself on the morning of the debate, his strategist released a memo calling on Biden and Buttigieg and Klobuchar all to just drop out of the race, just leave it to Mike. And people thought wow that's kind of arrogant sounding. He better do really well in this debate tonight and of course he did not do really well. And now they're getting back at him."

You know, the man came up with a high-tech method of providing financial information that people wanted. He provided a benefit to people. He benefited others tremendously, he benefited tremendously. If he can get out there and start defending free markets and say, look, I'm a liberal who understands the economy. I want to defend free markets. He can distinguish himself from the part of the pack.

Then you've 12 strangers who get together on this jury, that is going to become complicated. But what happened today is after chaos in the courtroom, everybody thought that the verdict was not going to come then they thought it was going to come, the jury sent a note to the judge and what the note said was basically asking for more information.
