Comey concluded the investigation before interviewing Hillary or her top aides. Clinton e-mails were hacked. Foreign agents penetrated Clinton e-mails. One of those e-mails was deemed secret, high level national security stuff, and Comey downplayed this. Hillary actually e-mailed with President Obama from her unsecure private account while in a territory of and foreign adversary and Comey covered that up. FBI officials leaked regularly. The place was a faucet. And when Hillary's e-mails were discovered on Antony Weiner's laptop, FBI agent Peter Strzok slow walked them and the FBI sat on them for a month -- very suspicious. Probably one of the worst revelations from the report was a text message from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page which said this. Lisa Page, \"Trump's not ever going to become president, right? Right?\" And Peter Strzok says, \"No. No, he won't.

You haven't had a firing, you haven't had a nuclear test in eight and a half months. You haven't had missiles flying over Japan.

It hasn't even been ratified by the Senate or anything like that, but there is a commitment to peace, and the political will and the spirit is there, I believe. And we'll have to let the deputies hammer out the details. But the process, it looks like the arc is probably better than it's ever been when it comes to diplomacy on the peninsula. Yet, the haters can't accept that. Where do you see the Singapore summit playing out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",

Starting from the insults to Kim Jong Un calling him rocket man and saying he's got a bigger button than he does. I mean, all the things that everybody said, it is going to lead to war. But, one thing I think we've all come to realize, Donald Trump has instincts that are different than ours, but 99% of the time, they tend to be better than ours and they tend to work. What we saw this week was a historic moment where you have Kim Jong-un, in principle, giving up the nuclear weapons. But here is the fundamental difference. Donald Trump hasn't given up the maximum pressure. The sanctions are still on. The big difference between what Donald Trump is doing and what previous Presidents have done, Kim Jong-un knows one thing. Donald Trump is not a guy to be played, and If he tries to do it, he will find himself on the receiving end of that bigger button that Donald Trump talked about. I think that's one thing he's got to know."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So, far the only thing that America has given up, we suspended a military exercise that was planned for the fall, but that can get right back up there the minute he starts monkeying around, little rocket man with some of these negotiations. Right now, we haven't shipped a boatload of cash over there. We haven't released any hostages like they did in the Bergdahl trade, they haven't brought the sanctions down like they did in Iran. They haven't done any of those things, yet the press is acting like this guy is Neville Chamberlain or something like that. Meanwhile, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George Bush -- they did literally nothing. So, let's just try this new strategy and see what works. Let's get into something you and I were talking about before you came on. They called little Bob Corker, the Senator from Tennessee and he's not going to be in office much longer, but he is really going out with a bang. He said that people that support Donald Trump, people that are running for office that support Donald Trump are in a cult. Listen."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, he looks like a sad, defeated little man. Second of all, I don't remember a lot of Democrats running against Barack Obama for the last eight years. And what's wrong with sharing the same principles and ideals as the President who over 60 million Americans voted for. Donald Trump understood and tapped into the sensibility of the American people. And if other politicians are tapping into that same vibe, that doesn't make them a cult follower. That makes them in touch with the folks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "It's a pretty big cult, 60 million people. The nonsense of that is that, you know, Donald Trump got more votes in the Republican primary than any other presidential candidate in history including either of the Bushes, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, any Republican ever. To say that that is a cult is to insult the overwhelming majority of Republican voters and then the overwhelming numbers of people who voted for him and gave him a crushing Electoral College victory. But, Jesse, here's something else, when Bob Corker came to Nashville where I am sitting now and he showed up at a Donald Trump rally, he was booed out of the arena. That's how popular he is because statements like that where Corker has become uncorked, it's not winning him friends. People are not agreeing with his assessment. And I frankly think that maybe he has got hurt feeling that he wasn't picked to be Secretary of State -- a job that he really wanted, but aren't we glad he didn't get picked?"

The focus was how the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation was handled. The answer, it was handled severely. Here are the takeaways. Jim Comey was a loser. He mishandled the investigation, violated FBI policy and process, severely damaged the credibility of the investigation and the credibility of the FBI itself. Comey used personal e-mail for FBI business. Isn't that what kind of got Hillary in trouble? Comey changed the law to exonerate Hillary. Comey concluded the investigation before interviewing Hillary or her top aides. Clinton e-mails were hacked. Foreign agents penetrated Clinton e-mails. One of those e-mails was deemed secret, high level national security stuff, and Comey downplayed this. Hillary actually e-mailed with President Obama from her unsecure private account while in a territory of and foreign adversary and Comey covered that up. FBI officials leaked regularly. The place was a faucet. And when Hillary's e-mails were discovered on Antony Weiner's laptop, FBI agent Peter Strzok slow walked them and the FBI sat on them for a month -- very suspicious. Probably one of the worst revelations from the report was a text message from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page which said this. Lisa Page, \"Trump's not ever going to become president, right? Right?\" And Peter Strzok says, \"No. No, he won't. We'll stop it.\" The IG said Strzok's decisions were impacted by bias and he showed a willingness to take official action to impact Trump's electoral prospects. The president weighed in on the report yesterday."

The report is crystal clear that they could not make the determination that Peter Strzok's willing necessary to investigate Russian collusion over the Clinton probe which was pretty conclusive that there was some criminality. They said that they could not determine he was free from bias. That is in the report, Page 3 -- I don't have Karl Rove's whiteboard, but I have my own notebook right in front of me. Page 398."

So, I think that part of the IG report is just not credible. What this does though is this is just one of many IG reports. We are going to have another one on Clinton emails and then we're going to get the big kahuna, we are going to get the IG report on how the Russian collusion investigation was handled, and that looks like it is going to be an absolute catastrophe."

You know, if people want to talk about somebody being on the back of the bus, what about the illegal aliens that come in, in a back of a truck like a cattle and they are not doing anything about that because they are okay with them crossing the border. Or about illegal aliens being in kitchens working for slave wages, and they are not certainly thinking about that. I think we already know that they can't use black people so the next people they are trying to use is people-- illegal aliens as the new slaves of the Democratic Party. So, we are going to ignore them and he needs to worry about his party, his self and how they only give you enough to keep you quiet, but not enough to make a difference."
