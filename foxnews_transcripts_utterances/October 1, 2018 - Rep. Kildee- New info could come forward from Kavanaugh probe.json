And there has been some push back and forth. I can tell you, I can actually back that up based on at least some of what I heard over the weekend. You may have heard Lindsey Graham in his conversation with Maria Bartiromo say explicitly this thing could be wrapped up in a few days, say, on Tuesday, maybe midweek. So, keep that in your hat, even though I think politically it might be indelicate, frankly, to maybe to push it that quickly. That said, as you pointed out, the president today in the Rose Garden was very clear he wants this to get over with.

And, you know, it's not like he was choking off the thing that is, you know, a huge story, what's going to happen with Kavanaugh. And he made news on that as well, as you noted, in terms of expanding the scope of the FBI investigation.

All right, speaking of public sentiments on this issue, there's a new Quinnipiac poll that shows about 50 percent of Americans think that Judge Kavanaugh is the target of a politically motivated smear campaign. Democratic strategist Cathy Areu, The Weekly Standard's Kelly Jane Torrance. Kelly Jane, that was interesting. Within a subset of another poll, you found a majority of Democrats thought the Democrats on that committee and approach were doing a fine job. Republicans thought Republicans were doing a fine job as well. So, it is still very deeply divided, still half-half kind of a nation.  What do you think?",

But no matter who you are, you cannot deny that those -- those hearings on Thursday were a partisan circus. I mean, maybe some people would disagree with the circus part. But there's no question that this got partisan. And I think that poll is very interesting. We have seen -- we have been hearing from Democrats that, oh, Judge Kavanaugh has very low approval ratings for a Supreme Court justice nominee. Well, now we are seeing how many people think that he is the target of a political smear campaign. So, I do wonder if the Democrats' actions are backfiring against them.

And there has been some push back and forth. I can tell you, I can actually back that up based on at least some of what I heard over the weekend. You may have heard Lindsey Graham in his conversation with Maria Bartiromo say explicitly this thing could be wrapped up in a few days, say, on Tuesday, maybe midweek. So, keep that in your hat, even though I think politically it might be indelicate, frankly, to maybe to push it that quickly. That said, as you pointed out, the president today in the Rose Garden was very clear he wants this to get over with. He wants them to move forward.  He wants them to go ahead and do their investigation. But here's the thing. Just how far and in what direction that supplemental FBI background investigation will go, Neil, is still anybody's guess. The White House is adamant it doesn't want this to turn into some prolonged fishing expedition, as you put it. Now, for his part, this is the seventh background pro for Judge Kavanaugh.  Still, the president says, look, I want the bureau to do its job, but quickly."

It just matters whether Flake and Murkowski and Senator Collins as well can defend this process and take a vote on Friday, and in an investigation that they deemed credible, especially those two women who are not retiring from the Senate, like Senator Flake. They are up against a national force of division, people who support Kavanaugh and want them to vote yes, people who oppose him and want them to vote no. They are under a lot of pressure. And they did not -- the Republicans didn't have their vote on Friday. That is was why they agreed to this probe. These two women will have to be able to say on Friday, this was a thorough enough investigation for me to vote yes."

Is there a sense that you have from those same senators or their people that they would be nervous if it all wrapped up tomorrow, which, again, seems very unlikely?"

      "speaker": "STODDARD",

That's why I think it's not likely, because it wouldn't indicate a thorough enough of process, and obviously we all spent Sunday seeing conflicting reports about how much the political interests of the White House and the Senate majority was -- were succeeding in limiting the investigation. You and I, we're not FBI agents, but we know that at the end of every interview, they say, is there anyone else I should speak to?"

And I think those senators that were talking about expect to be able to tell their constituents that enough of a broad range of witnesses were spoken to, enough of the allegations were explored, that it was a credible process. And I do think, if it just ended tomorrow, it would be very tough for them to make that case."

At the end of last week, the story was Canada is out.  This isn't going to happen. The weekend goes by. We get to Monday morning. We have got a deal. The problem for people watching this too often is they pay close attention to what he is saying, not what he is doing. He wants to get these deals done. That's abundantly clear. He wants China to come to the table. And what he is really saying to them is, you are isolated. Everybody else is coming on board. We have identified a problem with you. You need to solve your intellectual property problem. If you can do that, we can get a deal. And right now China is just treading water trying to figure out how to respond."

But the president went one step further. I want pretty much the bulk of the questions initially to be on this historic trade agreement. That's his prerogative. But no other president has done it quite like this before him. He did take questions and he did make news on that and later on, of course, on the Brett Kavanaugh situation and whether he is trying to manipulate this FBI investigation. He said no. They can talk to anyone and everyone they want to say. The read on all this \"MediaBuzz\" Howie Kurtz. Howie, what did you make of that?"

But the press is far more interested in the controversy and the debate and the emotion surrounding the Kavanaugh nomination. I think it would have been a better look for the press corps to let a few more questions go by bye on trade. Take the economy seriously. So many people affected by this. And then get to Kavanaugh. You know he is not running out of there. You know he's going to answer, unlike other presidents, the most controversial questions about his embattled Supreme Court nominee. But it was fascinating to watch the way he tried to dictate the timing and the pacing of the thing."

One of the things I found interesting was the fact that he did not say he was not going to take questions on Kavanaugh, all the drama around that.  Just not right away. I'm wondering if what he tried here, because it was a first for him, I believe. You follow it more closely in the media than I do. He might try this again in the future. Like, he does another press conference, even a - - one of these ones where he is getting off Marine One or getting back on Marine One, that this might be sort of like the model."

      "utterance": "I think what happened last week at the U.N. where he went on for about 80 minutes, some people said, oh, he was rambling, whatever, but he was having a good time. He was kind of playing with the press, criticizing, sometimes praising. I think he really enjoyed himself. I think the people around him would like to see the president do more of that. So, this went on for quite a while. There has been some grumbling in the press corps, Neil, here in Washington about, why aren't there more White House press briefings? And I think there should be a lot of press briefings. But it's so much better to hear from the leader of the free world and for journalists to have the chance to push back. And, you know, it's not like he was choking off the thing that is, you know, a huge story, what's going to happen with Kavanaugh. And he made news on that as well, as you noted, in terms of expanding the scope of the FBI investigation. So, this is a president who was a reality show guy, who loves fencing with the press, who knows he has got to provide not just one storyline, but two or three storylines a day, and we saw that all on display in the Rose Garden today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so when he mentioned Kavanaugh, which was eventually the story he would get to at his own timing, and said that he was not trying to rig or limit this FBI investigation, and said if they wanted to talk to Julie Swetnick, the Michael Avenatti client, have at it, is that likely to be deemed the case? Or will the media still beat him up on these now new fears that it could all wrap up tomorrow, not enough time to get to all of these people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, the press wants a longer, more complete investigation. The Democrats are obviously moving the goalposts. Originally, it was one week, limited to, you know, just the witnesses and Christine Ford. I think this was probably inevitable. I think the president doesn't want to be seen as sort of choking this off unfairly if it takes another week. But obviously the clock is ticking, and the more the investigation goes on, the more new questions could be heard. So, yes, I think you have a collision here between a president and his party who wants to get this done so they can get Kavanaugh on the high court and many Democrats and some in the media who say, no, no, no. It's not fair unless you talk to this person and this person and this person. And, remember, it's not a criminal investigation, it's a background check."

I don't think there is clearly -- clearly isn't time before the midterms.  And I don't think -- if the Democrats were to win the Senate, for example, you wouldn't want a lame-duck Senate.

If Mitch McConnell was more or less telegraphing, no matter what we do, no matter what the final report is, no matter who it includes and covers, even, you know, all of those who have charged inappropriate behavior or worse on the part of Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats will still move the goalposts, still complain.

I think if Flake really thought he was trying to build a bridge with the Democrats, it was built on sand, because they were never going to be satisfied. Look, their M.O. here all along has been, we must kill Kavanaugh. We must keep this seat open, because if there are five reliably conservatives -- constitutional conservatives on the court, that really screws up the Democrats' entire game plan, which is big government things that you can't get through Congress, but we can get them imposed on the nation by the court. It's been that way for the better part of 60 years going back to Eisenhower. This is a real change. This will be a Supreme Court, if Kavanaugh gets affirmed, confirmed, it will be a Supreme Court, Neil, like we have never really seen."

All right, speaking of public sentiments on this issue, there's a new Quinnipiac poll that shows about 50 percent of Americans think that Judge Kavanaugh is the target of a politically motivated smear campaign. Democratic strategist Cathy Areu, The Weekly Standard's Kelly Jane Torrance. Kelly Jane, that was interesting. Within a subset of another poll, you found a majority of Democrats thought the Democrats on that committee and approach were doing a fine job. Republicans thought Republicans were doing a fine job as well. So, it is still very deeply divided, still half-half kind of a nation.  What do you think?"

And so maybe that's because I'm not partisan.  I don't belong to either party. But I think Americans are seeing -- you know, obviously the Democrats are going to agree with Democrats. But no matter who you are, you cannot deny that those -- those hearings on Thursday were a partisan circus. I mean, maybe some people would disagree with the circus part. But there's no question that this got partisan. And I think that poll is very interesting. We have seen -- we have been hearing from Democrats that, oh, Judge Kavanaugh has very low approval ratings for a Supreme Court justice nominee. Well, now we are seeing how many people think that he is the target of a political smear campaign. So, I do wonder if the Democrats' actions are backfiring against them. If they had stuck to his qualifications, his judicial philosophy, that seemed to actually be working better for them than this stuff."

If it doesn't find anything, Democrats and their allies will say that it wasn't thorough, it wasn't long enough. If they find just allegations of drinking and people saying stuff, then the Republicans are going to say, well, the Democrats found these people. They put them up to it. They got into the FBI. You guys are not focusing on the right thing. And, yes, it is really disappointing."

Any company that is totally reliant on one guy whose future and he is the innovator, he's everything to that company, that's not a good bet. I mean, GE Has the same market cap, a little less actually then Tesla, something like $50 billion. Tesla's at $53 billion. Yet GE makes $10 billion a year in profits and produces 10 million cars a year, some astronomical amount of cars. Tesla makes no money, loses money."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so, what are we, five weeks away from the midterms?  And a lot of people wonder, well, how much impact will this back and forth on Judge Kavanaugh have? Who better to ask than bestselling author, historian, UVA Center for Politics Professor extraordinaire Larry Sabato? Larry, good to have you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What do you think? How much of an issue is this? The reason why I ask is, I think it defines each party and their rage. And I see this one poll that shows the majority of Republicans think Republicans are handling this fine. Majority of Democrats think the Democrats are handling this just fine. What's the reality?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "The reality is that midterm elections see lower turnout. Turnout falls pretty dramatically from the presidential year, though this year it may fall less than usual. And I think the Kavanaugh hearings and the event actual outcome of the Kavanaugh nomination will be one reason why turnout may be higher than it usually is for midterms. Our favorite word, Neil, is anger. Anger always produces more votes than happiness or satisfaction. That's human nature. Maybe it shouldn't be that way. But that's human nature. So the side that loses this confirmation battle -- and who knows which side it will be at this point -- the side that loses will get a bump up, I think, in enthusiasm and turnout."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I just find it offensive, as an Italian American, much like yourself, to assume that our favorite word is anger. It just seems offensive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Neil, I know you personally. It is your favorite word. Don't lie on television."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. What do you mean by that? All right, so let's stop back and look at this, because while you are here, I did want to get your reaction. You are a great historian. The president in this press conference in the Rose Garden where he was fielding questions wanted to focus on the Canadian trade pact with the Mexicans and said, we will get to these other issues on Kavanaugh, but I want to some questions on this first and then we will get to these other issues. I don't think I have ever seen anything like that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Well, actually, it was an improvement, because, as we all know, the president often steps on his good news, on whatever story he is trying to promote at the time, whether it's in a tweet or it's in a press conference or it's in a rally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Well, he tried not to do that this time. He says, hey, we are here for this trade agreement and I want to talk about that. And I want you to report on it. But then, of course, the press conference drifted into all the controversial things that will be the headlines now tomorrow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Perfectly fine to take those questions. I guess -- and here's where you can enlighten us historically. Whether it was John Kennedy or others, if he wanted to focus on a series of questions over the announcement of the day, let's say, I don't know, like tax cuts or whatever, but they were invariably going into other issues. It's rare to see a president then step back and say we are going to keep the questions on this and then I will get to some of these other issues in that order. And I'm wondering whether a precedent was set here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Probably. A lot of precedents are being set by this president. So, that wouldn't be unusual. And, look, it's not a bad thing as long as the president really does move along to the other subjects and doesn't just say, well, that's it. I'm sorry I didn't get to your other questions. And he didn't. I mean, it was an hour-plus. That was a long press conference. And he covered lots of subjects. I think the press would be somewhat amenable to that, believe it or not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, I think you are right about that. Real quickly, the president going to be speaking in Tennessee today. He's going to be stumping for a lot of candidates. He wants to keep the House.  He feels that he could be the magic to make it happen. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Well, he might be, but he is right to focus more on the Senate races."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Because this year, really by accident, more Senate seats that are competitive are showing up in deeply red states. When the president comes into a state that he carried by 20, 30, 40 points, he creates a bubble for that candidate of three, four, five additional percentage points. The key is, though, it disappears after two, three, four days. So what I'm looking for, Neil, is where the president goes on the Saturday, Sunday, and Monday before Election Day, November 6, because he could actually create additional votes in those states for those Republican candidates."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK. See, neither of us got angry at each other. So, touche, Professor. Always fun, my friend."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "I didn't show it. I didn't show it, Neil, but I'm angry. Yes, I'm angry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Is he done? Is he done?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Professor, thank you very, very much. All right, in the anger and all of this back and forth, bottom line, we had a great day at the corner of Wall and Broad.
