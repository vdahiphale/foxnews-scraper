When he takes their side -- of these people that went into the bathroom to film or -- first of all, never have conversations on a bathroom on your phone ever. Don't ever sneak a phone into the bathroom. It's just horrible. I don't think she'll forget it. So, he can go to Michigan and he can try to maybe help a little bit for Elissa Slotkin for example. She is one of the congresswoman there that's in a very tough swing district and will probably will face a pretty good competitive Republican.

So that tells everybody on the left that is so mat at Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin that you are validated. So go ahead and go after them. So, I don't necessarily think it helps him get their votes, no. And I also think it was a huge mistake. It's like a deplorable moment.

If he had the cajones to stand up to them this would be a different story. But he's terrified of the twitter mob. And that was the twitter mob in physical presence. Look, the obvious question for me is, if all of what Democrats want is so good, why must they be so coercive about it? Why chase people? Shouldn't the sell be really, really easy? So why do you -- why are the coercion tactics somehow getting worse every single year, getting in people's faces, shouting at them, saying there is no sense of dialogue? It's like socialism in general. If this is something that is so good for us, why do we find it so repulsive? Why does it need to be rammed down our throat if it's something that is so utopian and so wonderful? So I want to get to my next point, which is a far larger point.

If the people you hate want to leave, you should be ecstatic! So why are you so filled with hate about the people who just want to get out of there? You should just let them go! So I have a solution for this. We are in a stage of a marriage where one spouse needs to walk out, right? And it's not for a divorce. It's a trial separation, right? Because right now the politicians are letting us down. We have no more law enforcement in major cities. The crab is going to hell in a hand basket. We need a trial separation for two years. One of the states has to take -- have the guts and go \"I'm first. I'll step out,\" right, Texas? And then somebody else will -- we do it for two years, trial separation. See if it works.

President Biden spoke a little bit about what would happen with the Hyde Amendment. That is somewhere where Joe Manchin is going to be non- negotiable and the progressives in Congress to say that that's incredibly important to them, perhaps a sticking point. But what is interesting is there is behind the scenes negotiations going on. It just came out overnight that Joe Manchin and Biden have been talking privately. Manchin has now shifted to $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion. And Congresswoman Jayapal has said I could talk about $2.5 trillion. Suddenly you are in the Nancy zone, right? You're somewhere where you can make progress with that and Kyrsten Sinema, the big difference between her and John McCain, certainly on voting record, but John McCain loved talking to people. He loved talking to constituents and he loved talking to the press and to the cameras. And I think that she really needs to start explaining herself more publicly. Joe Manchin has for his part been on every Sunday show saying these are my problems, these is what I think is good. And I think it would behoove her to do more interviews about it so that we can hopefully get to a place of conciliation.",

She's a member of that community obviously. This just underscores why the progressive left's logic is missing, if at all. And I think the issue here as well is the fact that there is zero accountability for those that are rallying the troops against her. If that had been a progressive member of the left, they would have been a homophobic, misogynistic attack. But instead, twitter is allowed to rally the troops. They have a policy specifically prohibiting encouraging incitement and encouraging bullying for a specific individual. We are now seeing that for a sitting senator because of the incendiary quality of all of these righteous social warriors who haven't read the bill themselves and who just want the dopamine hit on the video.

And I'm excited for the next 25 years because we'll all be here, right? Yes. I also want to just highlight a fantastic new book. It just hit the shelves. It's really important book. It's called No Way To Treat A Child. It's by Naomi Riley. And it takes a look at the American child welfare system. She is an expert and this is a must-read. So, congratulations to you.",

When he takes their side -- of these people that went into the bathroom to film or -- first of all, never have conversations on a bathroom on your phone ever. Don't ever sneak a phone into the bathroom. It's just horrible. I don't think she'll forget it. So, he can go to Michigan and he can try to maybe help a little bit for Elissa Slotkin for example. She is one of the congresswoman there that's in a very tough swing district and will probably will face a pretty good competitive Republican. But the other thing is that if you think just back when you had the Democrats encouraging the harassment of people like, remember Maxine Waters?"

So that tells everybody on the left that is so mat at Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin that you are validated. So go ahead and go after them. So, I don't necessarily think it helps him get their votes, no. And I also think it was a huge mistake. It's like a deplorable moment. If you look at these 72 percent of independents who are like \"I don't like what's going on here.\" That kind of thing, chasing people into a bathroom and saying it's just part of the process, they don't like that."

And I think what we're seeing what we don't like about Joe Biden is that he throws everybody over the side for the radicals because he doesn't understand their presence or their power. If he had the cajones to stand up to them this would be a different story. But he's terrified of the twitter mob. And that was the twitter mob in physical presence. Look, the obvious question for me is, if all of what Democrats want is so good, why must they be so coercive about it? Why chase people? Shouldn't the sell be really, really easy? So why do you -- why are the coercion tactics somehow getting worse every single year, getting in people's faces, shouting at them, saying there is no sense of dialogue? It's like socialism in general. If this is something that is so good for us, why do we find it so repulsive? Why does it need to be rammed down our throat if it's something that is so utopian and so wonderful? So I want to get to my next point, which is a far larger point. It's going to take about an hour."

If the people you hate want to leave, you should be ecstatic! So why are you so filled with hate about the people who just want to get out of there? You should just let them go! So I have a solution for this. We are in a stage of a marriage where one spouse needs to walk out, right? And it's not for a divorce. It's a trial separation, right? Because right now the politicians are letting us down. We have no more law enforcement in major cities. The crab is going to hell in a hand basket. We need a trial separation for two years. One of the states has to take -- have the guts and go \"I'm first. I'll step out,\" right, Texas? And then somebody else will -- we do it for two years, trial separation. See if it works.

So I went back and I looked at what's actually in the bill and it's a lot, a lot of things obviously including, you know, universal Pre-K, child care, Medicare expansion, child tax credits, drug prices. President Biden spoke a little bit about what would happen with the Hyde Amendment. That is somewhere where Joe Manchin is going to be non- negotiable and the progressives in Congress to say that that's incredibly important to them, perhaps a sticking point. But what is interesting is there is behind the scenes negotiations going on. It just came out overnight that Joe Manchin and Biden have been talking privately. Manchin has now shifted to $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion. And Congresswoman Jayapal has said I could talk about $2.5 trillion. Suddenly you are in the Nancy zone, right? You're somewhere where you can make progress with that and Kyrsten Sinema, the big difference between her and John McCain, certainly on voting record, but John McCain loved talking to people. He loved talking to constituents and he loved talking to the press and to the cameras. And I think that she really needs to start explaining herself more publicly. Joe Manchin has for his part been on every Sunday show saying these are my problems, these is what I think is good. And I think it would behoove her to do more interviews about it so that we can hopefully get to a place of conciliation."

She's a member of that community obviously. This just underscores why the progressive left's logic is missing, if at all. And I think the issue here as well is the fact that there is zero accountability for those that are rallying the troops against her. If that had been a progressive member of the left, they would have been a homophobic, misogynistic attack. But instead, twitter is allowed to rally the troops. They have a policy specifically prohibiting encouraging incitement and encouraging bullying for a specific individual. We are now seeing that for a sitting senator because of the incendiary quality of all of these righteous social warriors who haven't read the bill themselves and who just want the dopamine hit on the video.

So, there is no way you can deny it. It's like you're not me so I could say I feel threatened.

We're not ignoring the fact that we have seen these spikes certainly during the last year and a half or so. So, I'm just looking forward to it. But it is genuinely scary that you don't know when or where it's going to happen. It used to just be contained into bad neighborhoods and it's not."

      "utterance": "Well, in New York, they've got to bring back the anti-crime unit. They disbanded that 600 officers. These are the guys in plainclothes undercover. They're in every housing unit in the Bronx, every corner, every precinct, and they jump out at people. And they do foot pursuits and they take illegal guns off the streets. And a lot of the shooters wouldn't carry guns back then because if you get arrested and you're a felon in position of a firearm, you could go to jail for a very long time. And now they don't have those guys jumping out anymore, and these criminals basically own these streets. So, they have to bring that back. Eric Adams says he's going to bring it back. NYPD admitted they made a mistake in disbanding that. And even the residents of the Bronx are begging for these plainclothes officers to get back on the streets to help them out."

I mean, I think that you could -- this conversation cannot include what President Biden has done in terms of uh hiring pro- crime, anti-enforcement, people at the Department of Justice filling the roles of the U.S. attorney's office with people who refuse to enforce the laws. And so, yes, she might be charged with attempted murder, but then it should be out the next day because of bail reform that they want to do. I mean, the police have -- in order for this to actually turn around, the question that you asked Jesse, if I could answer that one as well, is they have to be funded, supported, protected, and empowered. It's easy actually. This -- it wouldn't be hard if the priorities were in order, but they're clearly not."

People are getting murdered, getting beaten, robbed by thugs who escape punishment, but we're chasing parents and we're chasing Trump voters or a guy in a Viking hat or whatever. Whatever -- whoever they are, they aren't doing this. And I wonder where the feminists are since many of these victims are women, a lot of them in New York are Asian -- are Asian elderly women. A man, to the -- to the point of the feminist, a man in Virginia was released after beating his wife because of what you were talking about, lenient DAs, progressive DAs, Soros-funded DAs. And what does he do? He murders her, you know. So, I think it's time for the left -- you know, the left talks about like identity and how proud they are of diversity and of women. Where the hell are they? The people are just -- they're attacking women on the street and yet you turn a blind eye. It's a shame."

And then it's just stuck, and then she actually believed they were serious she was America's sweetheart. She's not America's sweetheart. She's America's gremlin. By the way, TV makes people weird.
