He gave a one-hour speech to them, a stark contrast to Joe Biden's quieter approach in the advance of his big night. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, live in Washington, D.C. And this is “The Story.” The Wall Street Journal making the case that the president may be in better shape than the polls now show. This Wall Street Journal NBC poll found 11 percent of undecided voters say they have a positive image of former Vice President Joe Biden, compared with 22 percent of in-play voters who say they have a positive outlook for President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, the Journal writing that these up for grabs voters also say that they prefer a candidate who will confront the Washington establishment, which they write is a hallmark of Mr. Trump's pitch to voters over one who makes an appeal based on competence and compassion, which were key themes during the Democrats convention last week.

Is there anything that you looked at and you wanted to change because of what you saw last week? MERCEDES SCHLAPP, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Well, I've got to tell you, the DNC doom and gloom convention was definitely not the right message that I think the American people wanted to watch. And clearly that's going to be in stark contrast with what we're doing this week, where President Trump is focusing on this great American story, the fact that it is about American greatness. And we're going to highlight those forgotten men and women that didn't get any help from the past administration of the Obama-Biden administration. And they're going to be able to tell their stories about how President Trump's policies have impacted their lives, have changed their lives. And tonight, we see the land of promise, which is that of the promises made, promises kept by President Trump. And of course, so many of these stories are just amazing. I take Natalie Harp, who had bone cancer and because of the experimental drug she took, because of the right to try legislation that President Trump championed, she was able to survive cancer.

And this is “The Story.” The Wall Street Journal making the case that the president may be in better shape than the polls now show. This Wall Street Journal NBC poll found 11 percent of undecided voters say they have a positive image of former Vice President Joe Biden, compared with 22 percent of in-play voters who say they have a positive outlook for President Trump. So, the Journal writing that these up for grabs voters also say that they prefer a candidate who will confront the Washington establishment, which they write is a hallmark of Mr. Trump's pitch to voters over one who makes an appeal based on competence and compassion, which were key themes during the Democrats convention last week.

I'm not sure why the scramble came so late since obviously there was going to be something before then. But I'm wondering what the Trump team learned from the Democrats convention. Is there anything that you looked at and you wanted to change because of what you saw last week? MERCEDES SCHLAPP, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Well, I've got to tell you, the DNC doom and gloom convention was definitely not the right message that I think the American people wanted to watch. And clearly that's going to be in stark contrast with what we're doing this week, where President Trump is focusing on this great American story, the fact that it is about American greatness. And we're going to highlight those forgotten men and women that didn't get any help from the past administration of the Obama-Biden administration. And they're going to be able to tell their stories about how President Trump's policies have impacted their lives, have changed their lives. And tonight, we see the land of promise, which is that of the promises made, promises kept by President Trump. And of course, so many of these stories are just amazing. I take Natalie Harp, who had bone cancer and because of the experimental drug she took, because of the right to try legislation that President Trump championed, she was able to survive cancer.

So, this is a great way to kick off the RNC convention, having the president there with the delegates. I've got to tell you; the enthusiasm is great. The unity in the Republican Party is great. And I think that's just a stark contrast again, to what we saw last week with the DNC convention, which they were more focused on the anti-Trump hate message than they were in presenting a vision for America, which we even saw some of the liberal outlets said, they had no economic vision for American workers."

Look, I've been always very impressed with what President Trump has done, despite all the claims that he is a racist and he hates black people, so on and so forth. One of the big things that he's done in this country was to sign the First Step Act, which was a criminal justice reform effort that has allowed 3100 predominantly black prisoners who are locked up for nonviolent offenses to get out of jail, go back to their communities or turn to their families and their loved ones. And this is something Black Lives Matter wanted, that they scream for this under Obama and Biden, they didn't get it. And under Donald J. Trump, they did. And he gets zero credit from that on the Left. There's something that Left wanted. And he actually had a bipartisan group. Democrats and Republicans came together. He signed into law, and they ought to be thankful for that. Instead, he just got the constant lies and nonsense about him being anti- black and hating black people. If he did, he would be very happy to keep all these promptly black former prisoners locked up, which he did not do."

And that is expected to be one of the more interesting speakers that we look forward to hearing this week. With regard to the discussion about homicides, about the rising crime rates, I looked at numbers in New York City this morning that said that black victims, the number of black victims of shootings has risen 177 percent. This is a story that we did not hear much about at the Democratic National Convention. And you would think, if Black Lives Matter, this is something that would have been also brought up, Deroy."

But you've got, as you say, scores, if not hundreds of black folks who have died since the George Floyd killing. The number of shootings has climbed. The number of murders and homicides also has climbed. And a lot of these are black victims. These are generally not white victims. These are generally black and Hispanic victims. And you think black lives matter, ANTIFA, you think they have something to say about this that had nothing to say about this. The Democrats said nothing about this at all. And in fact, they had a speaker. One of the folks they had on the podium was a woman by the name of Donna Hylton. That's H-Y-L-T-O-N. She actually was convicted for a second-degree murder and kidnapping involving a man who was tortured, who was sodomized. His testicles were attacked with pliers. She and her and the people with whom she worked basically kidnapped him. He ended up dead in a steamer trunk. And this woman, who was, again, 27 years in jail for double for, I should say, second degree murder and kidnapping, was one of the speakers at the Democratic National Convention."

And we know the president here has a strategic and appropriate policy, which is protecting the vulnerable. We know who's at risk here. It's not everybody. It's not about all the cases that's the most important metric. It's about saving lives by protecting the vulnerable, by preventing hospital overcrowding, which we are really doing well, and by opening up the economy, opening up the schools.

And part of that is that we are much better, of course, at treating patients. One third of length of stays, one-half the mortality if you are hospitalized, less need for a ventilator, less need for an ICU, and we also realized who is not going to get sick or severely ill. And that is young people. And we know the data. We know that even JAMA Pediatrics studied 46 -- pediatrics in North America and said, quote, \"the risk of a severe illness from COVID-19 is far less for young people than from seasonal influenza.\" We have to really understand what the actual science shows. No one knows that there's going to be a second wave.

And the entire premise of two years wasted on the Russia witch hunt was in large part because of his failings as the leader of the FBI. I think that, you know, he has a lot of talk about investigation after investigation. We spent over two years wasting time because they refused to report the results of the 2015 elections. The people that actually asked for this investigation weren't Republicans. It was Brennan. It was Comey, it was Obama, it was Biden. Because, again, they failed to accept the results of the 2016 election and they were part of one of the biggest political scandals we have ever seen and that we have ever had. And they tried to take down a duly elected president. And I think each and every one of them should be held to the fullest extent of the law for whoever was involved. Last week, we heard a lot of rhetoric from the Democrats about democracy. The only people we have seen to be unwilling to really support democracy in this country were the Democrats who participated in this illegal political scandal that we have learned more and more about over the last several months due to the Durham investigation and some of the congressional hearings that have taken place."

I think we'll see a lot of that come from Nikki Haley. She is a very strong conservative woman. And to hear her opinion, I think is going to be very important. Senator Scott is somebody who's worked with the president on opportunity zones, HBCU funding, as well as a number of other things. And I think he will probably highlight some of those.

So, I think if you look at his record and what he has been all about for so many years, he's a creature of the Senate. He knows how to compromise. He knows how to work across the aisle and I'm confident he'll do that in the future."

You know, does that surprise you? And do you think that someone who is more willing to be a bully in a China shop as the president has been, is what's resonating with Americans ultimately or do you think that they want, they want, you know, someone who is more, you know, copacetic and calming like a Joe Biden?"

But as you get closer to the election and realize that if you want policy legislation laws that actually endure, they need to be bipartisan. There needs to be some buy-in from both parties. So, I think you'll see both parties tucking a bit to the center."

We passed the bipartisan immigration bill that appropriated $40 billion for border security. That was when President Obama and Joe Biden were in the White House. We did that in the Senate. So, they are different policies and I've been supportive of many of the things that the president has pushed, the (Inaudible) reform, regulatory reform --"

      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, he just told you why. The coziness of the swamp. He talked about Joe Biden who is a creature of the Senate, bipartisan, working with people in the swamp to make sure the American people get left behind. That's not what President Trump is about, obviously. He is about standing up for the American families. He told you he was against the president. new NAFTA agreement. The new trade deal that he is working on. He told you he is against the president's administration policy. Decided that we actually need a border security wall to protect this country from the illegals who are crossing who were bringing drugs and trafficking, human trafficking. So, I think Senator Flake told you why he is against the president. What I know is the American people support what this president has done in his first term and I think he is going to get re-elected in a big way in a few months."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, you know, I know that you want to talk a little bit about the personal side of the president. We heard a lot of the personal side of Joe Biden last week. It was clearly the whole issue of being a decent person and being a man of character, which I would say really the backbone, the cornerstone of what they talked about over the last four days of their convention. What point do you want to make on that tonight? And what will we hear from you?"

    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the president said it best last night on your network on Steve Hilton show. He talked about the amazing potential of the American people. That's -- that's who he is fighting for. Doing what he said he would do. That's why the American people so appreciate this president. He is doing what he said. He's fighting for them. Not the swamp. Not the swam who wants to limit where American families their goals their dreams. Not the mob out there who wants to stop Americans from achieving the goals and the dreams that they have. So, I think that's going to be a key theme throughout this convention. The amazing potential of the American people. And you are going to hear from a wide, from Alice Johnson to Dana White. You are going to hear from them in this convention. Those amazing American people who the president has been fighting for and delivering for."

He wouldn't even say President Trump's name. A close freedom caucus ally of yours. So, boy, what changed? I mean, you all totally changed your opinion about President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "No, no, the freedom caucus was formed. We talked about the countless number of American people, our mission statement. The countless number of American people who feel like this town is forgotten and not fighting for them. So, our mission has been the same as the president's. We're here to do what we told the American people we were going to do. Fight for the forgotten men and women of this great country. Those families out there who are fighting every day, this president is fighting for them. We know -- and I think they see clearly. It's evidenced by the independents and the polls, CBS poll which showed that independents are moving now towards the president, because they now see this contrast where the Democrats, the cancel culture mob where they want to go with. We'll not denounce the mob that's attacking people in our cities. We'll not denounce this crazy policy of defunding the police. They see the difference between what the president has done and how he's fighting for American families where the Democrats and the hard-left want to take this country."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, just one last thing before I let you go. You know, when you look at -- look ahead in this whole thing, you know, do you think that this is going to be tight. Obviously, all the polls showed Joe Biden ahead in most of the battlegrounds. Real quick. Ten seconds if you can."
