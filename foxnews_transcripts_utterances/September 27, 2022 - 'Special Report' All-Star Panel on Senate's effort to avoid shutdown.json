Now, I would also say, too, of course, it's liberal policies that are creating this crime surge, whether it's on incarceration, whether it's on policing, whether it's on addiction, on homelessness.

But when Democrats are talking about crime, as you pointed out in the polling. They know it's a problem. They are trying to pivot and say Republicans don't care about crime because look how they handled January 6th. Or crime is a problem because of the way that there is enough not control about access to guns. And so they are pivoting.
