He may yet depending on how this thing turns out. Lindsey Graham has become the chairman of the department explaining political science to Democrats and to the public. And he explained to the Democrats today that if you win elections you get to pick the nominees to the Supreme Court. Sorry, guys, we won this election. But another lesson today, which is that if you win the Senate by only one or two votes, you have to be able to count and you have to be willing to do things like this week. I don't think much damage will be done provided its limited. I can't imagine the will ask for an extension for Professor -- yes, right. I think it's OK. I only feel badly for the judge. Another terrible week for him, and there will be some craziness."

That said, it is going to help the Senate, it's going to help the court, it's going to help Judge Kavanaugh, and it's going to help the country if this concludes in a cleaner, more comprehensive way, a less divisive process. And I just think an FBI investigation could have been concluded by now if it was permitted 10 days ago. So I think it's the best way to swear him onto the bench of the Supreme Court if that's what the outcome is going to be. He needs this removed from him before his tenure there."

But there is no problem with having an FBI investigation at this point. And there were many things that happened that are good for people who would like to see Brett Kavanaugh seated on the Supreme Court. It got out of committee today. That was huge. And it got out of the committee with Jeff Flake saying he is going to vote yes pending the return of this investigation. And the FBI investigation itself actually has fewer investigatory tools than the Senate has. They are not able to compel testimony. We already know who all the players are. They have already given statements. It should not take long. It only took a couple days to investigate the Anita Hill situation. It only took a couple days to investigate Anthony Weiner's laptop. It certainly is not going to take more than a couple days to find out what's going on here. And I think the public appetite for this delay, delay, delay -- oh, I can't fly, oh, we can't comply with this -- is gone. So, it just has to happen now. And when it comes back, I think we can move forward."

Just to give you an idea of the bad faith that the Democrats are arguing in here, shortly after -- almost immediately after the Republicans agreed to an FBI investigation, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat senator, tweeted this. He said of course there should be an FBI investigation, but whatever they find doesn't change the fact that Kavanaugh, especially after his performance yesterday, is the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of our lifetime. Democrats have already come out and said a week? How can we get this done in a week? This is not about seeking the truth, Bret. It is simply to ride out the clock here, to run out the clock."

Trump won North Dakota by 35.7 percent, West Virginia by 42.2 percent. They are looking, obviously, at races, maybe more Heitkamp than Manchin, but how does this play not only with this delay but also for women who do look at Dr. Blasey-Ford and say I see someone who came up and told her story?"

If nothing else comes out then I expect to only things that will come out will be some more craziness out of the woodwork, then I think she may well support him as will Manchin. I think it's possible this could heal to some extent, what A.B. said. But it's also at the same time on the part of the Democrats a ruse. But what does one week get them? I don't know what one week gets them. Again, they would have to extend this further, wouldn't they?"

And I just want to reiterate what Jason said, which is women are not some monolithic block. We all have different ideas about things. Just because we are women does not mean we don't care about the constitution or due process or rule of law. And we also just care very deeply as people who love men, who love our husbands and our fathers and our brothers and our sons.
