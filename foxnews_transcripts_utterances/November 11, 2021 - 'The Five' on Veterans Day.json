      "sentences": "Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is THE FIVE. THE FIVE is outside on Fox Square for Veterans Day paying tribute to all of our heroic men and women who've served. We're going to be honoring veterans on set later in the show. But first, the United States of America is the greatest country in the world. A place where you can do anything and you can be anything. A place where a better tomorrow is not just a hope but a guarantee. But freedom isn't free. And on Veterans Day we must pay tribute to those who sacrificed so much so we here at home don't have to sacrifice at all. Millions of brave men and women have fought to protect our nation. They come from all different backgrounds and creeds. They put themselves in harm's way without question, without prejudice, without terms, knowing full well the dangers they face may cost them their lives. Yet they answer the call. They wear their uniforms proudly and put country over self. They stand strong to defend our flag ensuring our liberties remain intact. Our veterans who time and time again find themselves in the midst of impossible situation proved that anything is possible. When things got bad in Afghanistan, it was veterans groups that rallied together to keep their sacred promise to never leave anybody behind. They refused to give up and they got people out when no one else would. Our veterans showed compassion during chaos. They prove that no act of kindness is too small and exemplify what it truly means to be selfless. The courage of our veterans cannot be forgotten. We must honor them. We must respect them. We must thank them. We must always remember them because our veterans are not just the best of America, they are America. Greg Gutfeld, your thoughts on Veterans Day.",

You know, maybe we should have affirmative action for veterans. I don't care what color they are. I don't care what nationality they are. They are the ones who put their lives on the line. They are the ones who decided, you know, that they come back with maybe one or two limbs or three limbs less than fewer than when they started. And in fact, I'm sitting here now, I'm wearing my dad's pin from the Navy. And it says obedience, zeal, and I don't know what the third one is -- oh, fidelity. And it has his name on the back.

Veterans know how to work in a team in an increasingly isolated culture where people are kind of out for themselves or not thinking about your neighbors or someone who you'd be working with. And the skills that veterans need to be thought when they go into employment in the civilian world are no big deal. You can teach them to program. You can teach them to do whatever it is that you need. The stuff that they have learned before is far more valuable. And one thing that's really nice about Veterans Day and just talking about the subject, is it's unifying across the political aisle. There was a new study out from YouGov that showed everybody over 70 percent says we don't do enough for our veterans when you think of what they suffer for mental health crisis, the homelessness crisis. Making sure that they got great health care that they deserve after serving, it's nice to all be on the same side.",

For some reason, many of them don't think that they have skills that could be useful in the private sector. So we're telling the employers hire veterans. What we should also say to you, you do have the skills. And just reach out to one of these groups that can help you figure out how -- basically, if you figure out how to prevent a bombing of a major sensitive unit, then you can actually pretty much do anything in the private sector.

THE FIVE is outside on Fox Square for Veterans Day paying tribute to all of our heroic men and women who've served. We're going to be honoring veterans on set later in the show. But first, the United States of America is the greatest country in the world. A place where you can do anything and you can be anything. A place where a better tomorrow is not just a hope but a guarantee. But freedom isn't free. And on Veterans Day we must pay tribute to those who sacrificed so much so we here at home don't have to sacrifice at all. Millions of brave men and women have fought to protect our nation. They come from all different backgrounds and creeds. They put themselves in harm's way without question, without prejudice, without terms, knowing full well the dangers they face may cost them their lives. Yet they answer the call. They wear their uniforms proudly and put country over self. They stand strong to defend our flag ensuring our liberties remain intact. Our veterans who time and time again find themselves in the midst of impossible situation proved that anything is possible. When things got bad in Afghanistan, it was veterans groups that rallied together to keep their sacred promise to never leave anybody behind. They refused to give up and they got people out when no one else would. Our veterans showed compassion during chaos. They prove that no act of kindness is too small and exemplify what it truly means to be selfless. The courage of our veterans cannot be forgotten. We must honor them. We must respect them. We must thank them. We must always remember them because our veterans are not just the best of America, they are America. Greg Gutfeld, your thoughts on Veterans Day."

They have a -- they keep a routine that begins early in the morning. Anybody who does that succeeds. They have impeccable personal grooming. I don't know one sloppy veteran. They have manners and they have discipline which is on short supply these days and they appreciate hard work. They're not scared of it. So in this era of like the TikTok generation it's hard to come by these qualities but the veterans has it in spades."

You know, maybe we should have affirmative action for veterans. I don't care what color they are. I don't care what nationality they are. They are the ones who put their lives on the line. They are the ones who decided, you know, that they come back with maybe one or two limbs or three limbs less than fewer than when they started. And in fact, I'm sitting here now, I'm wearing my dad's pin from the Navy. And it says obedience, zeal, and I don't know what the third one is -- oh, fidelity. And it has his name on the back. It says Nasser Leo Ferris, 1945."

I believe in veterans. I believe in America.

Veterans know how to work in a team in an increasingly isolated culture where people are kind of out for themselves or not thinking about your neighbors or someone who you'd be working with. And the skills that veterans need to be thought when they go into employment in the civilian world are no big deal. You can teach them to program. You can teach them to do whatever it is that you need. The stuff that they have learned before is far more valuable. And one thing that's really nice about Veterans Day and just talking about the subject, is it's unifying across the political aisle. There was a new study out from YouGov that showed everybody over 70 percent says we don't do enough for our veterans when you think of what they suffer for mental health crisis, the homelessness crisis. Making sure that they got great health care that they deserve after serving, it's nice to all be on the same side."

For some reason, many of them don't think that they have skills that could be useful in the private sector. So we're telling the employers hire veterans. What we should also say to you, you do have the skills. And just reach out to one of these groups that can help you figure out how -- basically, if you figure out how to prevent a bombing of a major sensitive unit, then you can actually pretty much do anything in the private sector. So, just take heart and look forward to great opportunities when you return."

But they should have been in jail or an institution. Kyle's victims, the two dead guys deserved better from the government. But they didn't deserve better from Kyle. He did the right thing. He did what the government should have done, which was to make sure these dirt bags, these violent disgusting dirt bags weren't roaming the streets. It is clear. They were looking for blood. One of them -- Joy Reid saluted them. She said, oh, they were heroes out. She tweeted this -- she left out conveniently the part that one of them shouted the \"N\" word while twisting a chain and that he had abused four to five kids. And the other one was beating women. She just left that out. So your point about the fact that the media has to leave these things out because if they did include it, their narrative would be gone. So the bottom line is, all Rittenhouse did was fill the void that the government left open. Those two people never ever should have been on the street. And it forced citizens to become the police.

Between the Fed and Congress, you're going to have high gas prices. When you stretch the supply chain all the way across the Pacific and to China, you wonder why there's like an armada of cargo ships sitting outside the port.

And there are a bunch of moderate Democrats have gone out talking about this. Like, Abigail Spanberger was on The Daily talking about how we need a new message, we didn't hire Joe Biden to be FDR, etcetera. What has been interesting though is Larry Summers who's been very critical of the President actually defended Build Back Better saying that it wasn't going to add to the inflation problem.
