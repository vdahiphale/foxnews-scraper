And that's why you saw the minute the man was sworn in, more continuation of Russian collusion, and Trump Tower, and what kind of nexus was there between anybody working in his campaign and the Russians, everything to then get shifted to the next chapter, which was to delegitimize the American presidency, which is, of course, also playing into the hands of the Russians.

And as far as I can tell, people that have watched that show, that's the first time on television that they've actually heard practical solutions. From the most vocal sides of this debate, you don't hear practical solutions. The reason is -- and I go back to this -- the trust quotient. If you say sensible gun laws, the others say, \"You're taking my guns.\" If I say, \"I want my gun rights,\" you call me a killer. So I think the protests are real, and they're symbolic. There is a rational reason for them. However, going back to the trust quotient, you've got to be aware if other groups co-opt your protest.

And it could have been stuff that they did. I would say, there's another reason for President Trump to be mad at the Russians. Not only did they attack the country of which he's now the president. Even if he hadn't won, I think that everybody should be mad as Americans that this happened on our soil. But it's also because of what's Putin's -- Putin's actions here have worked to undermine President Trump's presidency. And if I were President Trump, I'd be mad about that. That's reason enough alone to try to take action against Putin."

What the Russians replicated on the small scale is what we do to ourselves daily. So all they did was they came out -- they saw -- what they saw are our team sport politics. I am more worried about bigger threats. I'm worried about our banking and our power grid. And I think that's the stuff that's really -- like that's the stuff that we survive on. We can live with trolls, even though they're a pain in the neck. We can live with trolls. You have me on The Five. But the bigger problem here is that political party leaders don't care about threats unless they're a threat to their power, right? It's not so much a threat to the United States, but, you know, how does it affect our election. And I think that's what bugs me most about Democrats is that they really aren't that ticked off about the Russians until emotionally they were affected by the loss of Hillary Clinton. That's what is driving their anger and that Trump won. That's why they're mad at the Russians. I don't think it's about the country as much as is that they lost."

There really isn't specific empirical evidence in that to suggest that in fact it had an impact on the outcome of the election. We certainly know there's no evidence to suggest that there was tampering with the election results. The suggestion is that these bots were operating and that they were doing this whole thing to try to create chaos within the American political system, within the election cycle and disrupting in that way. But there isn't any evidence to say that it actually affected the outcome. It was out there, and some of it was, you know, is out there but it wasn't in such a way in large-scale force that I think it would have an ultimate effect. So now everyone is like whining about it.

Had nothing to do at that point with the Russians. But here we are today, and we're having a discussion as if, oh, no. President Trump isn't distorting the news and isn't misquoting President Obama. We treated like it's serious. He's the president, so we have to have this discussion. But I mean, even over the weekend, you just go back and you stop and you think, he's attacking McMaster, his own national security advisor for saying the Russians definitely interfered in the election. You come forward and say why isn't he's imposing sanctions? He's not taking it -- you say, oh, he's doing more than Obama? Obama not only threw out 35 diplomats, he closed down two Russian diplomatic estates in the United States and imposed sanctions, and yet we're having discussions that he did more than Obama? He's not doing anything?"

But if Hillary had won and the Republicans had reason to believe that the Russians were trying to help Hillary win and make Trump lose, what would we be saying every day? So, I think that they're doing what they're going to do. But at the same time, they've spent so much time on Russia that now the Democrats, you can see it in the polling, they're starting to realize that they actually might be on their heels when it comes to these midterm elections because the tax reform piece has moved forward. And there was a quote from Jonathan Swan on Axios from the Democratic retreat -- Democratic pollster were saying that the Republicans have the wrong message but Democrats have no message. So that actually, I think -- while we're talking about Russia, the president has moved forward and the Republicans have helped him move forward on policy, and the Democrats have seeded that ground hoping that this would be their saving grace."

Decades ago when the right fiercely challenged the USSR, the left aided the Soviets, leading the anti-anti-communist charge. Meanwhile, communist influence helped repel American protests at rallies, backing every left-wing cause, charming every dumb celebrity on the left. They didn't mind at all. Better to be on Joe Stalin's side than Joe McCarthy's. So now they're mad about the Russians? Screw them.

So today, they go -- OK, pro-Trump, tomorrow they go anti-Trump because they want everything in total disarray. So that's the bottom line. But again, I go back to the point which is I think the media was very complicit in this because they seized upon it like a mouse with cheese trying to like gobble up because they like the idea because it fit their narrative that they already have built in with their bias towards President Trump, now, at the time candidate Trump. And that's why you saw the minute the man was sworn in, more continuation of Russian collusion, and Trump Tower, and what kind of nexus was there between anybody working in his campaign and the Russians, everything to then get shifted to the next chapter, which was to delegitimize the American presidency, which is, of course, also playing into the hands of the Russians.

That hasn't panned out so far. But it's also true that he could take the heat on this from the right if he chooses to lead on it. The bump stock thing is, I think, is a little strange. I mean, that was October 2. That was that shooting. And Justice Department, his Justice Department, has said that they can't do anything about it until there is action in Congress. So I think the direction today, unless something has changed, was a little bit misplaced."

We sat here and we offered at least six practical solutions that I think everybody could agree on. And as far as I can tell, people that have watched that show, that's the first time on television that they've actually heard practical solutions. From the most vocal sides of this debate, you don't hear practical solutions. The reason is -- and I go back to this -- the trust quotient. If you say sensible gun laws, the others say, \"You're taking my guns.\" If I say, \"I want my gun rights,\" you call me a killer. So I think the protests are real, and they're symbolic. There is a rational reason for them. However, going back to the trust quotient, you've got to be aware if other groups co-opt your protest. When far-left groups get involved with other groups, and it becomes more of an activist meme, a resist meme, it becomes something about Trump and not about this kind of violence."
