You can hate both whack packs and still see Jack run to the left. This admission is key in the era of fake news accusations. What Trump's been doing is what we've been doing for decades: Sitting in front of the TV, shouting at the bias merchants, at those big networks, as they delivered shoddy claims on climate change, gun control, tax cuts, and God knows what else. We screamed until somebody listened. Yes, the huge success of fair and balanced shows that you were only getting half the story before, the half that's imbalanced and unfair. Because that half of the story is no story, it's fake news. It's just what we said it was. But Trump just crunched the complaint into two handy words. Instead of it being shouted at the TV, it's now coming from the TV. Before the rulers of the airwaves could mock Mr. and Mrs. Jones on Main Street for their anger, it's hard to do that, now that the guy in Pennsylvania Avenue has become the Jones' spokesman. So it's no wonder new media is confessing its sins to cable's nosey neighbor. The know the jig, once again, is up. Dana, was it hardly surprising that - what he said?",

And you had to decide each time are you going to assert privilege, which is why in the New York Times article Bill Burke said that he went back to the president's initial lawyers and said, are you sure that the president doesn't want to assert any privilege on this? They're like, no, fine. But remember, the other thing is, the first lawyers are overheard at a steak house, shooting the breeze and talking about how they're going to hang it all on Don McGahn if it all goes bad. And McGahn says, well, I actually didn't think it was a good idea in the first place, but Trump says go talk to Mueller, do ever what you have to do. I don't think it matters, 30 hours. I actually think what -- if I were at the White House you might think, well, he was there for 30 hours, he answered all of their questions. McGahn has been there ever since doing the work of the president, doing the good work for him. Presumably, if he felt he couldn't work for the president he would have left because he's a principle person. So I don't think -- I think this is much ado about nothing at this point."

There's going to be some mayors, governors, senators, and then, probably, she said some outsiders candidates, and they're all going to be looking for a way. Andrew Cuomo benefits right now because where does President Trump love to fight? In the New York tabloid media. That's where Andrew Cuomo loves to get beat up or to beat up on Trump.

So, what they have to do is they have to - they have to rely on tribalism, go after them and the head of the tribe which is Trump, he's evil.

Because that half of the story is no story, it's fake news. It's just what we said it was. But Trump just crunched the complaint into two handy words. Instead of it being shouted at the TV, it's now coming from the TV. Before the rulers of the airwaves could mock Mr. and Mrs. Jones on Main Street for their anger, it's hard to do that, now that the guy in Pennsylvania Avenue has become the Jones' spokesman.

The issue is when we talk about Alex Jones and all those technology companies, all of a sudden the why now, why did they dump Alex Jones at that one point? It raises the issue of these companies have gotten way too big, that the government stood by particularly with Facebook, with the acquisition of Instragram and WhatzApp, they've gotten too big and they're asking to be broken up quite frankly.
