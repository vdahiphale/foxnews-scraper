I guess the whole regular order thing is just gone. That was a fiction or a fantasy. And then there will be a fight I think within the Democratic Party about what do they do. Do they plant a flag, filibuster and threaten to shut down over this, or do they say we've got still well over a month. Let's continue this negotiation in good faith. I would point out 18 Senate Democrats voted for the last continuing resolution in December and they came under some heat from the left. I think I would be surprised if they get back to 18 again. But I would also be surprised if the Democrats actually push the button on a shutdown fight at this stage."

But I do think it's worth stepping back for a minute. We now have a Republican president, a president with a party that is against amnesty here, who has come I would say a great distance towards the middle and offered to come up with some sort of deal that will grant amnesty, maybe not citizenship, but a pathway to regularization, which is amnesty, for hundreds of thousands of illegals now in the country. That's a huge step in that direction. And I think that what we are seeing right now is basically the fallout of that extra ordinary meeting, three extraordinary meetings ago, last week in the White House where you actually had the president there, you had Democrats, you had Republicans all hashing this stuff out. And when Democrats went back to the Hill, they got killed from their lobbyists and people that do not want them to budge on the security stuff because -- and they want them to stand firm on amnesty only."

LIASSON: Right. And Graham even makes a distinction between the president at 10:00 a.m. on Thursday and the president at noon on Thursday because he says he had a conversation with the president on the phone, seemed pretty positive about what he and Dick Durbin and others were working on. Then he comes up at noon, and he described something that sounded like a conservative intervention. In other words, before he could get there, all of a sudden Goodlatte and other hawks on immigration, Cotton, were in the room, which he didn't expect."

If you're going to grant an amnesty to the Dreamers, which I am in favor of, and if you're going to allow some sort of legal status to their parents as well, which apparently was --"

And to counterbalance that you have to have meaningful border security and enforcement. And I think that what was being discussed at least based on the reports was insufficient on that point. The outlines of a deal to me are obvious. They are not there yet."

And I think he is calling their bluff on it. And we'll see how that shakes out. But I think that if he is going to go toe to toe with them over that issue, I think that Republicans have a pretty good hand. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.
