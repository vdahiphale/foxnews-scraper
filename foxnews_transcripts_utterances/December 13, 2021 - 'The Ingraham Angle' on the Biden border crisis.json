Plus, Dr. Jill steps in to save her husband and Kamala's inflation era redecoration. Raymond Arroyo explains that in Seen and Unseen. But first, the walking dead. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, a political party, like a company, or maybe a sports team, or school should always have a succession plan. It's about preparing for the foreseen and unforeseen. Who could step in as the next CEO, or the next head coach, or the next school principal? How about the next Speaker of the House of the Senate Majority Leader? Now, the Democrats have no such plan for their creaky leadership at the top, and they have a very shallow bench. Now, consider their leadership lineup. It looks like a new version of cocoon, this time set in Washington. A faltering debilitated 79-year-old president, who would be 83 at the start of his second-term.",

She has real power, whether or not she's in the majority. But having a wealthy soon to be 82-year-old woman from the failing city of San Francisco leaving the Democrats after what I believe will be a 2022 GOP wipe-out, will also seem really out of touch. Don't you think? Americans know that these dinosaurs should be lumbering off into the sunset. Now, at least Trump was only in DC for four years.

But they will not do the hard work necessary to build their party back better. Afraid of the squad's primary challenges perhaps, they abandon the middle and it went way radical. The results for them, politically, at least, are devastating. Biden's lost two-thirds of Americans in the inflation issue. Only 54 percent in his own party now approve of his handling of that issue. And he hit the skids among independents, a 71 percent disapproval rating. Trump would win in a landslide if the election were held today. Look, you can't build a national movement with a woke ideology that believes in open borders, business killing regs, high taxes, coddling criminals, gender bending, racial fearmongering, anti-American hatred, and unending COVID mandates, and a partridge in a pear tree. Can't do any of that. Now, none of this is working. None of it. The people rejected in Virginia, and almost did so in New Jersey. The blue states are being left behind, but most don't even care at this point. Even as California is losing business, they're losing population and more congressional seats as a result. Liberal Gavin Newsom reinstituted an indoor mask mandate today. Ditto for New York Governor Kathy Hochul. I mean, this is complete madness, and it's going to hurt their economies. But they want to control their people period, no matter how unpopular it is. Both Newsom and Hochul have eliminated themselves from national office. So who else is on the Democrat bench? Well, Cuomo's gone, but Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan; J.B. Pritzker in Illinois, both have failed spectacularly as governors. With their track records, neither would last a month in Pritzker's family business, the Hyatt hotel chain. Hyatt it would be firing an overnight manager in Cleveland just for being rude to guests, let alone the kind of track record those two governors have. Now, as for the Democrat governors with terrific records really aren't any, certainly not compared to the Republicans. There's Ron DeSantis in Florida who will join me later in the show; Greg Abbott in Texas; Bill Lee in Tennessee; Pete Ricketts in Nebraska; Kim Reynolds in Iowa, and many more. The GOP may have an aging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But it also has a slate of younger-elected officials who are energetic, conservative and smart. Whether or not Trump decides to run again, the main point is that the GOP actually has a very deep edge. The Democrats are trying to put a good face on all this, but they know they're going to need to replace Biden. And they know that running Kamala Harris would be like getting a root canal without Novocaine, only you lose the tooth at the end.",

Now, remember, the Democrats field was super weak in their 2020 primaries, a half lucid Biden, who bombed at every debate, barely even campaigned, lost Iowa and New Hampshire, still wiped the floor with every other Democrat running. When I thought about that today, it's like, wow, I kind of forgot that. The only stars are the squad members, but they become kind of their own side show. More interested in brand building than in governing. And it may not be as fun for them, frankly, with the GOP majority. The one Democrat governor who's shown some sense is Jared Polis of Colorado.",

But if that's the future of the Democrat party, it tells you everything that you need to know about what - where they want to drive this country.

But this one hit me to my core. Last Saturday morning at 11:30, (ph) Carmen Sosa and (inaudible), mother and daughter, 59 and 21, were sitting in the car to stop sign. Little did they know that the minutes before some wild crazy smuggler was racing through stop signs and red lights in the town of Mission right on the border. And when they pulled out from that stop sign, Laura, as you said they were T-boned and they were killed instantly. The flame of their life put out in a moment. Their future going forever. Their family grieving. Did I see any comment from the White House? Did I see a condolence and prayers from either Biden or Kamala Harris or Mayorkas? No. Nothing. They don't care about American lives. The blood is on the hands of the president. And Laura, this is a strong thing for me to say. But I believe it in my heart, if these policies don't change, these won't be the last people to be killed. They don't care about the smugglers and the gang members who killed innocent Americans. They don't care about law enforcement who are killed by illegals. They don't care about the flood of drugs coming in. Mayorkas, I'm asking you to resign tonight. Tonight. If you won't resign, and if, Mr. President, if you won't reach out to the family, then you have to look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, do you care at all about them? Laura, he should come to the funeral or send Kamala Harris and look this family in the eye and say, We were wrong. We're sorry. But nothing from this White House. Nothing, not a word, like he doesn't know.",

He doesn't care about Americans left behind in Afghanistan, he doesn't care about what inflation is doing to the American family. He just doesn't care. He's put these radical policies of the left and open borders on the line. And people are paying a price. You know, Laura, when our soldiers are killed in line of duty, the federal government reaches out to the family, offers condolences. Sometimes the President will go to Delaware, see the coffins, come back in. Well, I would argue that these people on the border are on the front line, Mr. President. And they deserve the same dignity from your office. So at least call that family, Mr. President. Ask Jen Psaki tomorrow at the press conference, if the President even cares, if he knows. Carmen Sosa 59, her daughter Vera Deanna 21. They were probably sitting there at that stop sign a moment before their death by this 18-year-old smuggler racing at 70 miles an hour.

And now with Omicron I feel that we'll do the same thing. If we need to change our early treatment, we will do that.

But they will not do the hard work necessary to build their party back better. Afraid of the squad's primary challenges perhaps, they abandon the middle and it went way radical. The results for them, politically, at least, are devastating. Biden's lost two-thirds of Americans in the inflation issue. Only 54 percent in his own party now approve of his handling of that issue. And he hit the skids among independents, a 71 percent disapproval rating. Trump would win in a landslide if the election were held today. Look, you can't build a national movement with a woke ideology that believes in open borders, business killing regs, high taxes, coddling criminals, gender bending, racial fearmongering, anti-American hatred, and unending COVID mandates, and a partridge in a pear tree. Can't do any of that. Now, none of this is working. None of it. The people rejected in Virginia, and almost did so in New Jersey. The blue states are being left behind, but most don't even care at this point. Even as California is losing business, they're losing population and more congressional seats as a result. Liberal Gavin Newsom reinstituted an indoor mask mandate today. Ditto for New York Governor Kathy Hochul. I mean, this is complete madness, and it's going to hurt their economies. But they want to control their people period, no matter how unpopular it is. Both Newsom and Hochul have eliminated themselves from national office. So who else is on the Democrat bench? Well, Cuomo's gone, but Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan; J.B. Pritzker in Illinois, both have failed spectacularly as governors. With their track records, neither would last a month in Pritzker's family business, the Hyatt hotel chain. Hyatt it would be firing an overnight manager in Cleveland just for being rude to guests, let alone the kind of track record those two governors have. Now, as for the Democrat governors with terrific records really aren't any, certainly not compared to the Republicans. There's Ron DeSantis in Florida who will join me later in the show; Greg Abbott in Texas; Bill Lee in Tennessee; Pete Ricketts in Nebraska; Kim Reynolds in Iowa, and many more. The GOP may have an aging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But it also has a slate of younger-elected officials who are energetic, conservative and smart. Whether or not Trump decides to run again, the main point is that the GOP actually has a very deep edge. The Democrats are trying to put a good face on all this, but they know they're going to need to replace Biden. And they know that running Kamala Harris would be like getting a root canal without Novocaine, only you lose the tooth at the end."

Today, she's worth $200 million. So why not keep doing it? It's awfully lucrative. But the fact of the matter is, Nancy Pelosi is older than my grandma. I love my grandma. Joe Biden is the same age as my grandma. I don't believe my grandma is capable of leading this country. She's not capable of certainly even filing my taxes. But if that's the future of the Democrat party, it tells you everything that you need to know about what - where they want to drive this country. A very wise businessman in my district often tells me that you shouldn't put 80-year-old people in a position to make 20, 40, 50 year old - 50-year decisions for a business or for our country. And that's what the Democrats are trying to do."

So they're all octogenarians or septuagenarians and they're not going to retire, Laura. What else would they do? They've been in politics their entire life. They know they've driven the Democratic Party over the cliff. If they retire now, they're going to take a big beating in 2022-2024. They're going to be blamed for it. They got on this left-wing tiger, and they got on the back of it. The squad, as you said, AOC, the BLM and even Antifa, they (inaudible) audit out. and they can't get off that tiger. If they were to (ph) re-run tiger and jump off, who would take their place? Some crazy people, and they know it. And they've wrecked the Democratic Party, because they didn't have a graduated retirement. They didn't bring in new people, because they were narcissists and egotist and they thought they could stay there forever. And now they've been sabotaged or hijacked by the hard left, and they're never - all they have now, as you've reviewed, is they have January 6; Donald Trump is a monster; lockdown forever; and they've got a new one that Hillary is heading out. And they've all got Adam Schiff that if the Republicans win in 2022 or 2024, we're going to have an autocracy, a dictatorship, the end of democracy. And all that means is that the polls are against them now. Right after the election, when Biden won, they were saying the system has been redeemed, democracy is fresh, and then they had 10 months.

The suspect was speeding away from police, while trafficking six illegals into the United States. All seven of them have been arrested. Joining me now is Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.

Little did they know that the minutes before some wild crazy smuggler was racing through stop signs and red lights in the town of Mission right on the border. And when they pulled out from that stop sign, Laura, as you said they were T-boned and they were killed instantly. The flame of their life put out in a moment. Their future going forever. Their family grieving. Did I see any comment from the White House? Did I see a condolence and prayers from either Biden or Kamala Harris or Mayorkas? No. Nothing. They don't care about American lives. The blood is on the hands of the president. And Laura, this is a strong thing for me to say. But I believe it in my heart, if these policies don't change, these won't be the last people to be killed. They don't care about the smugglers and the gang members who killed innocent Americans. They don't care about law enforcement who are killed by illegals. They don't care about the flood of drugs coming in. Mayorkas, I'm asking you to resign tonight. Tonight. If you won't resign, and if, Mr. President, if you won't reach out to the family, then you have to look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, do you care at all about them? Laura, he should come to the funeral or send Kamala Harris and look this family in the eye and say, We were wrong. We're sorry. But nothing from this White House.

But when it comes to these border crimes, and sadly, this is just one of hundreds, if not thousands of violent - thousands and thousands of violent acts against Americans.

Her sister has retired from law enforcement and her brother-in-law. This President - this President shows that he doesn't care. He doesn't care about Americans left behind in Afghanistan, he doesn't care about what inflation is doing to the American family. He just doesn't care. He's put these radical policies of the left and open borders on the line. And people are paying a price. You know, Laura, when our soldiers are killed in line of duty, the federal government reaches out to the family, offers condolences. Sometimes the President will go to Delaware, see the coffins, come back in. Well, I would argue that these people on the border are on the front line, Mr. President. And they deserve the same dignity from your office. So at least call that family, Mr. President. Ask Jen Psaki tomorrow at the press conference, if the President even cares, if he knows. Carmen Sosa 59, her daughter Vera Deanna 21. They were probably sitting there at that stop sign a moment before their death by this 18-year-old smuggler racing at 70 miles an hour. He never hit the brakes when he hit them. And they were probably talking about Christmas and family and the new year ahead.

And we had a few weeks ago, one of those people that (inaudible) but for Biden's recklessness. And so our view is, if they are going to be dumping, we want to be able to facilitate transfer to places like Delaware. And so we have $8 million in my new budget to be able to do that. But we also look to these carriers that the federal government's contracting with, and we're going to pass legislation that says, If you are facilitating Biden's policies, which is effectively a mass human smuggling operation, you are not going to be eligible to do business with the state of Florida, or other local governments. And we're going to charge you restitution for each individual that you're bringing, because, yes, they're drugs, they're crimes. But you also have things with health care costs, education, all these services that get taxed because of Biden's reckless policies. And so, we have a responsibility to fight back.

I know you won't be surprised to hear this. \"Ron DeSantis is paving his path to the White House on the backs of vulnerable migrant children\" You're laying the groundwork to kick vulnerable migrant children out of Florida shelters. Not about public safety, it's about matching other presidential hopefuls' performative cruelty to immigrant children.

So in Florida, if you house a foster child in Florida, you get paid a lot less than what the federal government pays for bringing people from the southern border from foreign countries. So my view is, let's use our resources to help kids who need help in the state of Florida, American kids, Floridians. Let's not be a repository for people coming from all over the world, illegally through the southern border, and then brought to the state of Florida. So, focusing on your citizens first, I think is common sense. And we want it to be, we do not want to facilitate Biden's reckless policies in any way, shape, or form. Their policies are wrong and if the States band together and do things like Florida is proposing to do, it would be more likely that they're going to have to reverse course.

What's your reaction tonight to both Newsom in California and Hochul in New York going back to mask mandates with this Omicron, which seems to be, thankfully, so far, a mild virus -- and that's the data we have so far on that -- what's your reaction to the blue states' reaction to this?"

They are going to take a mile, they are going to restrict, they are going to mandate, they are going to lock you down. And we cannot accept that. Obviously, in Florida we do not accept it. So there's no reason to be restricting or mandating anybody throughout our country. And the fact that this is still going on in these blue states and may even intensify over the coming weeks and months, it just shows you if you value your freedom, in 2022 if you are in those states, you can make your voice heard and you've got to do a change of direction, because I fear that they're going to continue to do this until they suffer at the ballot box."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Spoiler alert, Fauci and friends will almost certainly push yearly boosters, but of course he's ignoring the latest science. A new CDC analysis of 43 Americans, that's a small group, but that's what we have, they were infected by the Omicron variant, found that 34 of them were fully vaccinated. That includes 14 individuals who were fully vaxxed and boosted. Meanwhile, only six people with natural immunity caught the variant. Why is that? And Oxford University study published today found that two dose COVID-19 vaccines generate a lower antibody response against the Omicron strains, suggesting that the variant could lead to more infections among the fully vaccinated. Joining me now is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford School of Medicine professor, and Dr. Kirk Milhoan, pediatric cardiologist. Dr. Milhoan, is this a stunning study, or is it too small to really tell us much?"

      "speaker": "DR. KIRK MILHOAN",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think it's stunning or too small. I think this is early in the state of a new variant, and we are seeing some interesting data, which is what you would expect. You would expect as there are now 30 mutations of the Omicron variant, you would imagine that a vaccine that was prepared against the legacy, pre-Delta coronavirus, that you would expect it to not be as successful. What it would have liked to see in that U.K. study is that they would have actually tested the serum of those who have been previously infected and see how that did against the Omicron variant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, they didn't do that, and they tend not to do that, as we have discussed before, because they don't want to really look at the natural immunity question. But Fauci hit the Sunday show talk circuit, Dr. Bhattacharya, to continue to push the vaccines on kids. Watch."

The number of cases of children, now well over 2 million children from five to 11 have been infected. There have been over 8,000 to 9,000 hospitalizations, and well over 100 deaths."

      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, children, thank God, have been relatively protected from the severe disease from this virus, even without a vaccine. There's a thousandfold difference in the risk of severe disease and death from children to old age, older people being much, much, much more affected by this infection. He is playing on a straw man. He's saying that children can be infected. No one ever doubted that. The issue is, do they respond to this infection with a severe outcome? And the answer is they don't. He's fearmongering again to parents for reasons I do not understand. We should be assuring parents that, compared to other things like the flu or many, many other risks that children face, COVID is not among the most severe that children face. They should be getting back to normal life."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Watch. ELIE MYSTAL, JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NATION\": A monstrous thing that we have to wrestle with is a country is that allowing people to die COVID was a policy choice by Donald Trump. It is now a policy choice by the Republican Party. We are now getting into the realm of crimes against humanity."

      "utterance": "I'm not sure what this all means, but if I consider a crime against humanity, I would consider that we haven't explored other ways and promoted early treatment of those who are infected. I see hope in our medical creativity in this situation. We've had almost two years -- we've almost had really a year of vaccines, but for those of us who are going and seeing patients in their homes and seeing them in our clinics, with the legacy we tried one thing, much from Dr. McCullough's work and Dr. Zelenko's work, and then as Delta came, we shifted some, changed the doses with success. And now with Omicron I feel that we'll do the same thing. If we need to change our early treatment, we will do that. But I think the concern for me is that the only hope that seems to be coming out of a lot of the medical community is vaccine. What about early treatment, helping these people? I go see these people all the time, and they were sent home with no treatment. Some of the basic things I use our basic asthma meds."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And we've talked about this before, but it bears repeating, Dr. Bhattacharya. From the very beginning when we were fighting on this issue back in March of 2020, we were having frontline docs tell us is a vitamin d deficiency in most of these patients, zinc deficiency. They were using things from hydroxychloroquine, then ivermectin, steroids. There was a whole range of treatments that were either banned or summarily discounted. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BHATTACHARYA",
      "utterance": "I don't know the answer to that question, Laura. But I can tell you there are now early treatment that are not controversial. For instance, Governor DeSantis, who you had on the show earlier, promoted the use of monoclonal antibodies, which are, you know, NIH -- FDA approved, NIH documented. So I think that kind of thing should have been part of our toolkit from the beginning. The NIH actually has a trial they are doing on ivermectin that's due to be completed in March of 2023. It should have been an all-hands-on- deck effort to evaluate these treatments from the very earliest of the epidemic."
