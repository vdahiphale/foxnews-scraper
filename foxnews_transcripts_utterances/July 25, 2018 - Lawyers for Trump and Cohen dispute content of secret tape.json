Meaning, if you hand out straws at a children's birthday party, which I often do, you can do more time than your average felon. Now, I can understand this law if you didn't have any other stuff to worry about. If you didn't have dramatic rise in disease, crime, homelessness, maybe you can go after the straws. But your state is teetering on the edge of Armageddon, you nitwits, which may be why politicians are focusing on evil straws. The concern over straws is really just a denial of far worst problems. Straws, get this, they make up only 0.02 percent of the plastic that ends up in the ocean. You'd find more plastic in the faces of certain coastal politicians, who I won't mention. What also hurts this narrative? America is responsible for less than 1 percent of the waste in the sea. Most of these plastics trash comes from other countries, but if you can't blame America, then I guess it's no story. But here's where you really see the consequences of such phony concerns: Who needs straw most -- straws most? The disabled, who can't drink without them. Good job, Santa Barbara.

And in order to make headlines, you have to have -- the hyperbole has to increase with everybody that's going out there. Cory Booker is not helping the Democrats keep the seats that they have in the Senate right now. He's certainly not trying to increase their majorities. Because the ten Senate Democrats that are running, many of them in states where Trump won by double digits, 60, 65 percent of the people there say, \"We want Kavanaugh confirmed by the midterms.\" It makes it so much harder on them. It's like -- it's just thinking through the game and the strategy is difficult. If his goal is to get some headlines out there so that he can be a front runner in 2020, that's one thing. But there are consequences and fallout for that.",

What right did she have to say where and if the story runs? You got paid. It doesn't matter. I've paid for stories and I've killed stories. That's not against the law, so that's baloney. Also, Cohen's lawyer is Lanny Davis. He worked for Hillary. He's a housecoat henchman. I mean, this is revenge. So that in itself is collusion. Also, it's a sad day in America when you can no longer trust hush money. I mean, the fact is, it is called hush money. You've got a slimy lawyer. You've got women that are -- that had sex and were paid for it, and consensually. I just find it so ridiculous that people are screaming about the fact that a billionaire real estate developer in Manhattan who has been thrice married, known as a womanizer, might have paid a woman to not talk about an affair.

It is also something to be said that Lanny Davis is actually willing to go on TV and defend his client. And so, Rudy Giuliani has been out there basically kind of by himself except for Avenatti was out there, but on a different case, whatever. I'm not sure about the strategy of releasing tapes because what's the long-term goal? What is the new cycle that you want to achieve? I don't think that if the southern district of New York is looking into Michael Cohen's activities that this is not going to get the southern district of New York off their back. So what is the goal? Is the goal to try to embarrass the president, to get a news cycle? To say that there are other tapes means that they better be better tapes than that one, right?"

So the question then becomes, oh, so maybe Michael Cohen is now cooperating with prosecutors looking into President Trump. But what strikes me about this is you guys are so dismissive, the wet cigarette butt. I mean, on so many levels. I mean -- well, first, I guess it plays into what Trump was saying yesterday to the vets about don't believe anything you here. Don't believe anything you read. Just listen to me.

So, I think the media is suddenly being alert is really refreshing. I think Lanny Davis was a good choice though because he's very media savvy. Talking before, I've done a lot of TV with him. I think this is an issue that he knew there may not be something illegal going on here, that may not be something like that, but we want to sway the public opinion on Donald Trump.

And I thought Marco Rubio actually did a great job when he -- he listed out all the policy reasons that the United States has been strong on Russia, kind of reminding people that what you see in the media about, you know, oh, the media doesn't like the way Trump responds to Putin in a press conference. Look beyond that and look at what the administration has actually done. And if you look at that, you see that they've been much stronger than the prior administration. And he laid out very specifics and I felt that it was a very empowering moment for people to see and kind of get their head on straight as to the fact that this administration, actually, has been quite strong.

He talked about how tough the administration has been on Russia, and how ready now NATO is to counteract any Russian aggression. And Rand Paul made a really good point. He said President Reagan, when he met with his Russian counterpart, he never went up there and shook his fist and threatened the Russian counterpart, and never blasted him to his face.

Number two, how many hearings does this make? This is why I keep saying that Trump is the most educational presidency ever, because when Trump burps, they have a hearing on what he ate. Mr. Secretary, did he have chipotle or did he have Wendy's chili when he -- this morning. That's what they're doing. Like every time Trump does something, there is a hearing. So, because of that, we are all forced to learn more and more about governing. This is the most transparent agency ever. I have a theory, though. Maybe you'll tell me I'm crazy. I think there's already change shifts going on with Russia and Iran already in terms of Syria. I think that Russia is looking at Iran as their high school girlfriend, or let's say high school boyfriend. And America is the college quarterback. And they just dumped Iran for America. Do you think that's a good theory? You're going to see Iran, kind of, on its own with Syria, and you're going to see that they're going to be, kind of, like having a back away because Russia is no longer going to support them."

Meaning, if you hand out straws at a children's birthday party, which I often do, you can do more time than your average felon. Now, I can understand this law if you didn't have any other stuff to worry about. If you didn't have dramatic rise in disease, crime, homelessness, maybe you can go after the straws. But your state is teetering on the edge of Armageddon, you nitwits, which may be why politicians are focusing on evil straws. The concern over straws is really just a denial of far worst problems. Straws, get this, they make up only 0.02 percent of the plastic that ends up in the ocean. You'd find more plastic in the faces of certain coastal politicians, who I won't mention. What also hurts this narrative? America is responsible for less than 1 percent of the waste in the sea.

Cory Booker is not helping the Democrats keep the seats that they have in the Senate right now. He's certainly not trying to increase their majorities. Because the ten Senate Democrats that are running, many of them in states where Trump won by double digits, 60, 65 percent of the people there say, \"We want Kavanaugh confirmed by the midterms.\" It makes it so much harder on them. It's like -- it's just thinking through the game and the strategy is difficult. If his goal is to get some headlines out there so that he can be a front runner in 2020, that's one thing.

But I mean, when it comes to -- if you don't want to meet with someone of the opposition party, that's up to you. People do it on both sides. I think it's a bad idea when it happens on both sides, but it happens. But this language to me, I'm always inclined to take the high road and say, \"Why are we doing this?
