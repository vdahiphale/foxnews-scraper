And January is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, and our government found an amazing way to help fight against online child sexual exploitation. So the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative, or HERO program, is designed for wounded, injured, and ill transitioning service members and veterans. So they receive extensive training, high-tech computer forensics, law enforcement, to assist federal agents in the fight to protect children. And a spokesperson for the program says, quote, \"When it comes to hunting those who prey on the innocent, who better than our nation's most highly trained military veterans?\" I love this program.

And they send it back to you to actually review by the proper standards, et cetera. So, there shouldn't be a difference because it's the same mechanism by which he is actually putting this forward, just like President Obama did. But because they object to him doing it, they're going to find fault with it but where they wouldn't otherwise with President Obama. And I think this is what he finds to be particularly frustrating and as it relates to the conservatives on the right. I believe, Greg, yesterday you're saying that Ann Coulter would be none too pleased by this order."

This is the most non-partisan politician you're going to see and Ann Coulter is the proof. The angrier Ann Coulter gets, the more Liz Warren should be happy because he's moving away.

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Right. So if you give the dreamers the ability to vote, that would be a big problem for a lot of people. I would have a problem with it. That might not be even part of the deal. But a lot of people say 800,000 dreamers now voting, probably, 700,000 are going to vote for the Democrats. They're not going to like it. But if you look at the big deal as a whole, border hawks are getting a lot done. Not only are they getting funding for the border wall. They're getting more border agents, more immigration judges. They're getting rid of chain migration which is basically my cousin Vinny. You know -- yeah, you know him? Your cousin, your uncle, come on in. That's ridiculous. The lottery system, they're getting rid of that. When you don't have a party, you don't have people coming through a lottery. Why are we having people come into the country through a lottery? It doesn't make sense. They're moving toward a merit-based system. I think conservatives, especially border hawks. If they would take any of these items and put them into a group and say, you know what, we've got to legalize some dreamers, you don't punish the son for the sins of the father, they'd take it. In any deal, you're not going to be happy with 100 percent. I say on the whole it's pretty good."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And today, this morning, Juan, I don't know if you saw Dana Milbank in the Washington Post was taking about how some on the far left that represents dreamers are actually asking for too much from Democrats and that they should just be supportive of the deal that they're going to get."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a little different. He's saying that united we dream has been attacking Democrats because Democrats have been willing to negotiate. For example, they've approved the extension of the budget deal which is now going to come up against January 20th, but over the Christmas-New Year holiday, and the dreamers objected to that and said, wait a second, you promise you were going to stand by us. We shouldn't be a bargaining chip. So they have directing their ire at Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and the Democrats for not being more vociferous, more aggressive in taking on the president on this issue because as you heard them say it was the president's decision last December to end DACA, and from the DREAMers perspective that created an artificial crisis. We could be having a discussion about the dreamers without the idea of a March deadline when they would be forced out technically. And of course, when you stop and think about that, it's true. Now the problem here I think is twofold with this decision. One, I disagreed with you leading my most honorable witness. I just couldn't believe it. You know I want to stand up for her. Because, in fact, the court didn't speak to whether or not there was any legitimacy to an executive order. This was about Donald Trump's tweets. Donald Trump said in a tweet that dreamers are good, educated people, accomplished young people. They have jobs. They're in the military. Why would we kick them out? The judge in San Francisco then says, well, that sounds like the chief executive whose job it is to make a judgment here, think this is in the public interest. It's up to the congress, the congress to set the law. But as we say now, we think the public interest is served by what the president said. Mr. President, you get your wish. Don't kick out the dreamers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Perhaps what this all does is force the congress to actually -- not just have to worry about the presidents deadline, but there's now a court situation. So, you have Republicans and Democrats, Kimberly, who came together yesterday, and now, maybe, there's more pressure on them to actually get it done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And I think that's what we're talking about here, you know, yesterday as well. Just negotiating and being able to try to come together. This is something that President Trump excels at. He wants to put a little bit of pressure, a little bit of a foot on the panel, give it a little bit of gas to make sure the Democrats are also going to try to engage. It's fascinating because you see -- like you said, Dana, the people on the right getting very upset about some of this is too much of a giveaway. (INAUDIBLE) You have vocal opponents on this side, like we saw. And then, you have some Democrats who still don't seem to be happy enough with allowances that he's making that in fact are in direct accordance with what they were supporting. So, if he's going to get the deal done and the objective of this is to get a deal done, whether it's immigration or anything else, you know, DACA, dreamers, whether it's on taxes, whether it's on health care. He wants to get it done. So what can he give and pressure to try to get them over to this level?"

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "The funny thing about a compromise, the evidence of a compromise is when everybody is unhappy about a deal, right? That means that they didn't get everything -- if nobody gets everything they want, that means somebody gave up something. So, that's what you're seeing. You're seeing Ann Coulter on the hard immigration side, and you have the Democrats. And everybody is ticked off about something. That's what happens in a negotiation and a deal. However, I don't go for deals for the sake of a deal. I mean, we've talked about that with taxes. He just wanted a tax deal, but we didn't -- initial stages. We weren't pleased with it because it just felt like he wanted a deal. But now, it's kind of happening. You know, Bannon is gone. He's got more room to play."
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, we'll see. I mean, right now, there's lot of concern that, in fact, you know, Bannon's acolytes in the White House continue to block the deal but by insisting on the wall.

Remember he said he wanted the NATO members to pony up, everyone said, oh, he's going to pull out of NATO. What happened? They ponied up. So, the tax cuts too, remember this was only going to be for the rich. Now, millions of people get a $1,000 bonus come Christmas time. So, the workers did benefit. So, I wish the media would be fair.

If you cite facts about what's going on. He thinks we're in this dystopian hell. Things have never been better, but he can't see that.

The machines are going to crowdsource information and find out if you've got something on your face that might not be healthy. Humans are so fallible. Humans are. There's no emotion that clouds your - - a machine's mind. You know the judges, their decisions on parole are affected by their appetites. This never happens with machines. Machines should be judges. Machines can crowdsource information. This is just another part where A.I. is going to capitalize on our insecurities. By the way, we don't need a mirror to tell us how we look. We have Twitter.

And this is a really unique program that takes those that have been highly trained and skilled and have served this country. It's the HERO Veteran Program that combats child sex trafficking. And January is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, and our government found an amazing way to help fight against online child sexual exploitation. So the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative, or HERO program, is designed for wounded, injured, and ill transitioning service members and veterans. So they receive extensive training, high-tech computer forensics, law enforcement, to assist federal agents in the fight to protect children. And a spokesperson for the program says, quote, \"When it comes to hunting those who prey on the innocent, who better than our nation's most highly trained military veterans?\" I love this program. It's innovative; it's changing lives. And it's putting away bad guys."
