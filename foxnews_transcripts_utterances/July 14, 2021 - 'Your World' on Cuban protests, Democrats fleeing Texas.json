We are keeping our eyes on the Capitol right now, not the one in Texas, the one in Washington, D.C., because those dozens of Democratic legislators who bolted Texas over that push for a voting reform bill are now making their presence known and we're told will be meeting later this hour with the vice president United States, Kamala Harris. It has been a crazy day. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" My thanks to my colleague and friend Sandra Smith for filling in for me yesterday. Today, here is the big story, this voting rights measure they want to undertake in Texas. Here's the problem, though. They don't have a quorum to do that. That is because the Democrats have all left, or most of them. We hope to be speaking to one of them holed up right now inside the U.S. Capitol. They have been leading with Democratic leaders, who are praising their move here and saying it was brave and forceful and clear. We will be speaking to Democratic Congressman James Clyburn, the House majority whip, what he makes of all of this. First to Mike Emanuel, what's going on in the Capitol and how long it could go on -- Mike",

This legislature that's meeting right now in special session, this is coming on a veto of the legislative branch by the governor which defunds, he intended, every single legislative vendor or state senator or state representative, and over 2,000 state employees that work for nonpartisan offices, such as the Legislative Budget Board and the state auditor's office. And this was the governor trying to force us to face his legislation and pass it. That's what this special session is about. It's about him. Once he got caught with our petition showing you cannot do that, based on the Constitution of Texas, now he's starting to back off. But I think he knows that what he's doing is wrong, but he was caught. And he was forced to call the special session anyway. What we're talking about here with this specific bill, though there are other very bad bills that the governor called for us to just try to decide, is, he knows he has the raw numbers to get these through. The problem right now with the state legislature is that it's not acting like it normally does. The House and the Senate are proud bodies that normally stand up to any person, whether they're a Democrat or Republican, if they sit in the governor's chair. We should all work together because we're a co-equal branch of the government.",

In fact, this past election, in 2020, the state -- the secretary of state which the governor appointed clearly stated more than once that the elections in Texas were fair, they were secure, and, on top of that, they were actually pretty fast.

Unlike the local Little Havana demonstration behind me with its blaring bullhorns and honking of horns of the cars and trucks, in Cuba, the streets were mostly quiet yesterday, as well as last night. Definitely, more police were on the street, as the authoritarian communist government regained control firmly of everything in Cuba. Around Havana yesterday, a notably beefed-up military presence and government loyalists on the streets. The Internet and social media platforms were largely shut down and remain so today, the government freezing dissidents' ability to coordinate and gather. Still, there were a few demonstrations in Cuba Monday, which were quickly quashed by police. Arrests were reportedly made. And Cuba's president addressed the country on state TV, saying the illegal protesters got the punishment they deserved. For the second straight night in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, hundreds of Cuban Americans came out to support the Cuban people and demand change in Cuba, which Miami Cubans have been doing for 50 plus years, resulting in no change at all. They want the U.S. government's intervene, which the U.S. has declined to do since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. On Sunday, thousands of Cubans marched in a dozen cities, demanding freedom, an end to food shortages, decades of a rotten economy, chronic of widespread poverty, and calling for government change.",

And just a couple of weeks ago, when Joe Biden was asked about the Olympian who was disqualified for her use of marijuana, it was very controversial, what was Joe Biden's response? He said, well, rules are rules. Everybody knew what the rules were going in. And so here you have the president of the United States, who is a by-the- book individual, who is sort of being forced to contend with people who are going off the rule book to make their point. And I'm interested to see how he might -- he might greet them. But, look, whether the White House wanted this or not, it's a national referendum now.",

We are keeping our eyes on the Capitol right now, not the one in Texas, the one in Washington, D.C., because those dozens of Democratic legislators who bolted Texas over that push for a voting reform bill are now making their presence known and we're told will be meeting later this hour with the vice president United States, Kamala Harris. It has been a crazy day. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" My thanks to my colleague and friend Sandra Smith for filling in for me yesterday. Today, here is the big story, this voting rights measure they want to undertake in Texas. Here's the problem, though. They don't have a quorum to do that. That is because the Democrats have all left, or most of them. We hope to be speaking to one of them holed up right now inside the U.S. Capitol. They have been leading with Democratic leaders, who are praising their move here and saying it was brave and forceful and clear. We will be speaking to Democratic Congressman James Clyburn, the House majority whip, what he makes of all of this. First to Mike Emanuel, what's going on in the Capitol and how long it could go on -- Mike"

    {
      "speaker": "DOMINGUEZ",
      "utterance": "I think the most important thing to consider here is not any one aspect of the bill, but rather the entire tenor of this bill and a number of other bills that the governor has forced us to consider. This legislature that's meeting right now in special session, this is coming on a veto of the legislative branch by the governor which defunds, he intended, every single legislative vendor or state senator or state representative, and over 2,000 state employees that work for nonpartisan offices, such as the Legislative Budget Board and the state auditor's office. And this was the governor trying to force us to face his legislation and pass it. That's what this special session is about. It's about him. Once he got caught with our petition showing you cannot do that, based on the Constitution of Texas, now he's starting to back off. But I think he knows that what he's doing is wrong, but he was caught. And he was forced to call the special session anyway. What we're talking about here with this specific bill, though there are other very bad bills that the governor called for us to just try to decide, is, he knows he has the raw numbers to get these through. The problem right now with the state legislature is that it's not acting like it normally does. The House and the Senate are proud bodies that normally stand up to any person, whether they're a Democrat or Republican, if they sit in the governor's chair. We should all work together because we're a co-equal branch of the government."

There is no testimony anywhere, none of us have offered any amendment to the contrary. That's just pure nonsense. We're not asking to change our laws. The laws that we have on the books in regards to elections in Texas are fair, they're safe, and they have been -- they have been vetted for decades. In fact, this past election, in 2020, the state -- the secretary of state which the governor appointed clearly stated more than once that the elections in Texas were fair, they were secure, and, on top of that, they were actually pretty fast. This is the governor's own secretary of state. There is no evidence of any widespread voter fraud in Texas. And on top of that, I believe Trump even carried the state of Texas. I'm not sure what problem they're trying to solve."

We have allowed for a budget to be considered without any one person being able to threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America. I think we ought to do the same thing when it comes to constitutional rights. If you want talk about a legislative issue like building a wall, how high it should be, how wide it should be, those are legislative issues that has got nothing to do with the Constitution.

What I spoke about was allowing an I.D., a picture I.D. of a hunter's license to be good, but of a student activity card to be no good. That's the kind of voter I.D. law that I'm talking about that's unfair. I have said that all of my life. I don't know why you guys keep misrepresenting what I said. I have never said that you should not have voter I.D. What I got my voter registration cards, I keep them in my wallet. And when I go to vote, I presented that every time. And I said to them, I am Jim Clyburn. This is my I.D., and I want to vote. I have always had voter I.D.

But I will take you at your word right now that you certainly are now not going to make that a central issue.

How can you say that you are going to have an election and people present themselves at the polls? Why do you think they have polling people there checking off the list?

Any one of those would be adequate. Are you OK with that feature?"

But that seems to be the crux of where there's a divide here. I also wanted to get your thoughts real quickly, Congressman, while you're here. You had said not too long ago that this defund the police movement by Democrats is a nonstarter. And now, with the election of Eric Adams in New York, likely the Democratic nominee for mayor and maybe, given the heavy Democrat presence in New York, the next mayor, he isn't keen on that. He was elected or nominated on that. Are you telling Democrats who say otherwise that it's a mistake, they should stop it?"

Burn, baby burn destroyed our movement back in the '60s. I don't want to see defund the police destroy the movement that is going great for Black Lives Matter today.

Therein would lie the 50 votes you need, and with Kamala Harris breaking the tie, the only means open to Democrats at a federal level to change and reinforce these policies that they hope to overturn from aggressive Republican measures they say are popping up in better than a dozen states, including, as we speak, Texas.

Unlike the local Little Havana demonstration behind me with its blaring bullhorns and honking of horns of the cars and trucks, in Cuba, the streets were mostly quiet yesterday, as well as last night. Definitely, more police were on the street, as the authoritarian communist government regained control firmly of everything in Cuba. Around Havana yesterday, a notably beefed-up military presence and government loyalists on the streets. The Internet and social media platforms were largely shut down and remain so today, the government freezing dissidents' ability to coordinate and gather. Still, there were a few demonstrations in Cuba Monday, which were quickly quashed by police. Arrests were reportedly made. And Cuba's president addressed the country on state TV, saying the illegal protesters got the punishment they deserved. For the second straight night in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, hundreds of Cuban Americans came out to support the Cuban people and demand change in Cuba, which Miami Cubans have been doing for 50 plus years, resulting in no change at all. They want the U.S. government's intervene, which the U.S. has declined to do since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. On Sunday, thousands of Cubans marched in a dozen cities, demanding freedom, an end to food shortages, decades of a rotten economy, chronic of widespread poverty, and calling for government change."

So we really don't know what is going on, on the island. But it is being reported that the people are being beaten, that some protesters have disappeared. And there's been a crackdown by this communist regime that historically has beaten, jailed and killed dissidents, people who have spoken out against the government. What I would like to see President Biden do is be very strong and say unequivocally that we stand with the Cuban people against a communist dictatorship, and that we want to see freedom. We want to see a move toward free and fair elections, allowing the Cuban people to determine their future. But, certainly, for the short term, we also want the Internet access to be put on, allow the people to protest without being attacked and abused by government officials and allowing them to speak their hearts and minds at this moment.

There's an effort in Florida -- Congresswoman, there's an effort in Florida among a lot of Cuban exiles and those who are sympathetic to these protesters' plight that they would let -- and push a flotilla to come and pick them up and bring them to the United States. I would not imagine that would go down well with Cuba. What are your thoughts on that?"

    {
      "speaker": "MALLIOTAKIS",
      "utterance": "Well, it would be nice if President Biden tried to help arrange for this to happen. Look, you can't send money to Cuba, because the regime takes it. If there's a way that we can send humanitarian aid, food, medicine, those necessities, soap, toilet paper. If there's a way you can send that to Cuba and allow for that to be given to the people, that would be a major step in the right direction. What I'm concerned about is him doing exactly what President Obama did, which was give away the store, make all these concessions, and get nothing in exchange. And, remember, to Bernie Sanders' point, blame -- he's blaming the United States of America. They do business with everyone around the world, Cuba, yet nothing has changed in 60 years. So what difference would it be if the United States were to lift the embargo? We need to get concessions. We need to get some change."

He is going to be Joe Biden's next ambassador to Turkey. He was among a number of Republicans, Republicans for Biden, who had supported then candidate Joe Biden running for the presidency. He will be the first prominent Republican, to my measure, who will have a key post, ambassador to Turkey. We will have more after this."

In fact, in the latest government report, with the consumer retail inflation advancing about 5.4 percent, that is that the fastest spike we have seen since going back to 2008. Tiana Lowe joins us right now from The Washington Examiner, as well as our own Charlie Gasparino. I don't know, Tiana. This is not looking transitory. This looks like it has more traction. This is the third significantly up retail inflation report. And it keeps getting more pronounced in terms of energy and what have you. It's not passing. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIANA LOWE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "I mean, this was to be expected. Combine a decade of near zero interest rates, despite being in a period of prolonged economic growth, with a $6 trillion spending bonanza during COVID, and you have the perfect monetary and fiscal storm for this sort of inflation. You will hear a lot of inflation doves say, oh, just take out energy and gas and food, because those are volatile, not like those are the bulk of most Americans' budgets, and you still have 4.5 percent inflation. Look, the fact is, during a global pandemic, when you were stuck at home, Zoom schooling your kids, life got more expensive at the same time it got harder. Unless if you were lucky enough to work for one of the companies that could have given -- that could have afforded to give you a raise, the average American has taken an effective 5.4 percent pay cut."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, if you think about it, Charlie, it's not going away. Whatever political views you have, the fact of the matter is this is not just a passing fad. It seems to have some, as I said, traction to it. I guess the question for the markets, the economy, even for Washington is how long it lasts. And what do we do about it, if anything?"

    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, I want to -- I want to disagree a little bit with your last guest. I mean, we had a pandemic-induced recession that was incredibly narrow, OK? It was narrow on -- and I'm not dismissing it for people that it hit. But it was restaurants, leisure activities, the stuff that was really shut down by the lockdowns. For a lot of people and maybe most Americans, they did pretty good. And they did pretty good because they can save money, they can work from home, they got stimulus checks. So then, all of a sudden, think of it this way. You have a -- you're flush with cash. A lot of people have cash, except for those people in those narrow industries. Again, not dismissing it. On top of that, you have everything reopening. On top of that, you have massive amounts of government stimulus, fiscal stimulus. On top of that, you have the monetary stimulus. You couldn't write a better recipe for inflation, because the best stimulus obviously were the vaccines, right?"

      "utterance": "So, when you throw everything else on top of it, this is really bad. And you know what's scary about this is how the Biden administration is kind of spinning it. And they're spinning like, oh, if you take out used cars and -- so I think they had something out there like pandemic-related expenses, whatever that means. They never explain what that means."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, but, to Tiana's point, even if you take out food and energy, the thing is still running up at a 4.5 percent clip. So, Tiana, the question then becomes, would Americans stop buying? And so far, they expect, in a separate, survey inflation to remain a problem that maybe to see prices up about the same come next year. So they're prepared for it. But are they really? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWE",
      "utterance": "So, I mean, the issue here is no, I don't think that the few one- time stimulus checks to Americans are going to be able to get us out of the rut to come. Everyone knew that the Fed under Obama and under Trump was playing with fire by keeping interest rates this low for this long. And Jerome Powell is already committed to keeping them like this throughout the rest of the year. That gives the economy a lot of time to overheat. And it's not clear how this gets solved. You look at things like milk up 5 percent, shoes up 6 percent. Men's pants that you need to buy after you gained your 15 pounds of COVID weight and are now going back into the office up 11 percent. This is -- I mean, people are just going to have to start getting a lot more thrifty. And, unfortunately, there's not..."

All right, all these Texas legislators who bolt in Texas, right now, they're being greeted as rock stars in our nation's capital. But whatever your politics, ask yourself why. They left their job. They bolted from their job. Is that brave? After this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, those Texas lawmakers who bolted the Lone Star State over the Republican push for a voting reform bill that they said doesn't reform anything, it makes things worse and is downright racist, they are going to be meeting shortly with the vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris, in the Capitol. Phil Wegmann has been falling all this very, very closely, Phil, of course, with RealClearPolitics. I'm wondering, though, whatever their notoriety in Washington, whether this is resonating for constituents back home, Phil. I mean, after all, they left rather than fight the fight back home. So how is that sorting out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS",
      "utterance": "This isn't the first time that Texas Democrats have left to deny Republicans a quorum in the state House there. A couple years back, they actually went to Oklahoma. But what's different this time is that they have come to Washington, D.C., because they're trying to force this into a national referendum. That raises some uncomfortable ironies, though, because at a moment when you have Texas Democrats who are obstructing the Republican counterparts back in the state, you also have Democrats here in the Senate leaning on Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin going after them to undo the filibuster. And so it's going to be difficult for the vice president to explain the difference between the obstruction in Texas, which the White House agrees with, and then the obstruction in the Senate, which they disagree with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It is interesting, too. Mitch McConnell didn't waste a nanosecond commenting on just that irony that now Democrats in Washington are concerned about the views of the minority party. Having said that, I'm wondering what greets these lawmakers again, I mean, why this can't be fought at the ballot box. And if you don't get your way, you look childish, for whatever your passions, taking your marbles and bolting, because, as you said, this has happened a number of times. And I'm wondering if the signal back home is as receptive as the signal they're getting in D.C.?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEGMANN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm curious about that also, because people are learning about this during the workday. People are looking at those tweets from the Texas delegation about how they're having their first meal as a fugitive. They're looking at those tweets. They're following the news while they're at work, while their elected representatives are not. And I think that this is interesting, because it comes at a moment when you have Joe Biden just in Philadelphia today saying that our democracy is at its greatest peril than since the Civil War. And so I think that kind of explains the rock star treatment that this delegation is getting, because, in a way, Democrats can make the argument that they are fighting for democracy, that these extreme measures are necessary. And if you read the Texas bills, they're not as perverse as some might make them, but, overall, the national conversation here is one where Democrats can point to any reforms that the Republicans want to any of these different states, tie them all together, and then point to what happened on January 6. And, frankly, that's a powerful exclamation mark."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, obviously, the administration has made it clear it sides with these bolting Democratic legislators. Kamala Harris is meeting with them as we speak. I don't know what Joe Biden's plans are down the road. But the real message here is that people are putting up money for their two private planes that got them here. I don't know who's going to put up funds to have them stay in the Washington area. Presumably, that is where they're going to stay until they see this ironed out, because they will be arrested if they come home, we're told. This is a mess."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEGMANN",
      "utterance": "It really is a mess. And I'm actually curious about the reason why they're not going to be meeting with Joe Biden in the Oval Office. And, instead, they're getting an audience with the vice president. And I'm a little bit curious, because, look, Joe Biden is a product of the Senate. He talks about this all the time about being someone who understands and appreciates rules and decorum. And just a couple of weeks ago, when Joe Biden was asked about the Olympian who was disqualified for her use of marijuana, it was very controversial, what was Joe Biden's response? He said, well, rules are rules. Everybody knew what the rules were going in. And so here you have the president of the United States, who is a by-the- book individual, who is sort of being forced to contend with people who are going off the rule book to make their point. And I'm interested to see how he might -- he might greet them. But, look, whether the White House wanted this or not, it's a national referendum now."

      "utterance": "It is, indeed. Phil Wegmann of RealClearPolitics. And Jim Clyburn, who was on the show a little earlier, folks, as you might have heard, is pushing the president to drop the filibuster for legislation like this, where you need a simple majority. He isn't for just junking it altogether, but on issues of the Constitution, Jim Clyburn telling us a little earlier, at least from his perspective as the House majority whip, this is worth it. You can decide how you feel about that -- after this."
