I mean, everybody knows that the entire country was shut down for the second quarter. And I don't know what they were expecting other than numbers like that. The question is really what happens in quarter three. And we have had reporting that -- from, Politico showing that Democrats are very fearful of an economic recovery, because they think that will help President Trump's re-election chances. And so I think people should be focused on that as well. As for this freak out over this tweet, I frankly think it was ridiculous. It was particularly ridiculous given the lack of coverage about all of the problems caused by mail-in balloting. I mean, New York is still waiting for results of an election that was done by mail-in balloting in June. We have -- or at least it's heading into months here now.

And what they're trying to replace the current voting system with is a mail-in -- a universal mail-in voting system that is completely rife with the potential for fraud, cheating. And we see example after example of this, whether it's in New Jersey, where they had to kick out 20 percent of the votes because they couldn't be verified; 100,000-plus votes not counted in California. We still don't know who won a congressional seat, a primary actually, in New York, from a month ago, because of this type of system. It is fraught with so much trouble and so much danger. And the media know this. They just don't want to report it. And I remember a great story, actually, on FoxNews.com, where someone's cat got a ballot in the mail to vote.

It was Governor Cuomo himself who left New York open seven days after everyone else shut down and then inexplicably sent nursing home patients with coronavirus back into the nursing homes.

It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the election until people can properly, securely, and safely vote.

This is a story that seems to have been going on for years and years. President Trump talks about elections being rigged and then the media freak out about it. What I think is crazy about it is we have had people refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election for three and a half years. And then they complain about tweets like this.

This is, to me, when you look at the timing of the tweet, 96 days before the election, and minutes after it was reported that we have the worst economic contraction at that time, minutes later. I don't think the president perhaps really knew that constitutionally he didn't have the power. I think after the tweet people, you know, rushed in or called in and then he back peddled. That's what I truly believe. Look, at least we've got bipartisan support here, Howie. We have Democrats and Republicans going, no, the Constitution is clear. Congress will set the date for the election. But he also helps Democrats not look so paranoid about him maybe kicking and screaming if he loses going out the door."

And the questions about whether or not our country is prepared, all 50 states to do a massive mail-in ballot. We've never had anything like this and it should be addressed. However, the Wall Street Journal had an op-ed that basically said, well, it is a bridge too far. The president saying they were going to delay it. That's not going to happen. However, the issue itself needs some focus and it needs to be hashed out. And I think you're going to hear a lot more about it. However, I will give Leslie some kudos. You know, it was certainly going to be headline on many of the president's critic's shows to talk about those economic numbers. Instead, they've talked about the outrageous tweet."

Molly, since Griff pointed out, I do want to read you from that Wall Street Journal editorial page. It was the editorial board saying because there's been a lot of criticism of this on the right. If the president believes the election will be rigged, quote, \"he should reconsider his participation and let someone run who isn't looking for an excuse to blame for defeat.\" Also, National Review, calling the president's election, quote, \"grotesque and un-American.\" So it's not just the liberal media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "First off, I just want to make a point about those second quarter numbers. They were very bad, but they were far less bad than a lot of people predicted. I mean, everybody knows that the entire country was shut down for the second quarter. And I don't know what they were expecting other than numbers like that. The question is really what happens in quarter three. And we have had reporting that -- from, Politico showing that Democrats are very fearful of an economic recovery, because they think that will help President Trump's re-election chances. And so I think people should be focused on that as well. As for this freak out over this tweet, I frankly think it was ridiculous. It was particularly ridiculous given the lack of coverage about all of the problems caused by mail-in balloting. I mean, New York is still waiting for results of an election that was done by mail-in balloting in June. We have -- or at least it's heading into months here now. New Jersey had a recent mail-in ballot election where they had one in five ballots deemed fraudulent. And this massive rush to go into mail-in balloting, which is clearly something the media very much want to do, they are not giving consideration for all of the obvious problems that will result from it. And particularly, since the media are pushing mail-in balloting, I think it is incumbent upon them to be thinking about some of the problems that are going to arise. Some states have tried this already, but they have many years of practice at it. Other people are rushing into it in a matter of months. It is really bad to not cover something that has to be one of the biggest election issues of the year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think that it is a legitimate issue to be covered and debated. By the way, the one and five disqualified ballots was in Patterson, New Jersey. But Leslie, let me turn this to you. The broader point here, at least according to a New York Times news story, and others have this point, is that Trump was trying to tell Americans they should not trust their own democracy. But he would say he's trying to protect democracy from what he sees as the threat of fraudulent mail-in ballots."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "You know, it's kind of crazy, Howie, because for seven years there are 25 (ph) states now that have passed laws that make it harder to vote. And now, we're in the midst of the pandemic. And this is actually nothing new for Republicans. It's not just the president and his administration and his followers. Four years ago, 7 and 10 Trump supporters didn't like voting by mail-in and we didn't have a pandemic. But interestingly, if you look at the numbers in 2016, Howie, Donald Trump actually benefited from mail-in voting, from the military and senior citizens, specifically. So Republicans thinking this is going to be an unfair advantage for Democrats, which it seems. It's just not the case and hasn't been the case. The bottom line is the study show that voter fraud is really rare. And what happened in Pennsylvania points to something that I feel is failing within the Trump administration. And that's helping rather than demonizing the Postal Service. If you make it harder for people to do their routes, if they can't have overtime as an example, they're not going to be able to get the mail to its location and they (Inaudible) Pennsylvania that was a key issue with those ballots."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me jump in. Griff, so we heard Sean Hannity say earlier that the president was trolling the media with the -- shall we delay the election talk with the question marks. But if his goal was to prod or pressure the press into focusing on this very issue we're talking about now because it could be unprecedented amount of mail ballots in the November election. Did it work?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "I think it did work. Let me tell you. The Atlantic, on July 24th, wrote a piece about what Mollie was talking about. He called -- The Atlantic called it the Chaos in New York. It's a warning for what's coming. You have Carolyn Maloney in a more progressive -- Patel running against (Inaudible) entirely Democratic primary. And there are lawsuits galore already in that, with 100,000 plus ballots being discounted or invalidated. And so it's certainly a warning once you talk about widespread universal mail-in ballots that we really have not tested. There's only five states, Howie, in the country that have it, so the other 45 haven't don't this before."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, the media have absolutely downplayed the riots and violence in cities across the country. And in Portland, in particular, I think they did a horrible job of explaining what federal law enforcement was doing there since there were attacks on federal properties, such as the Mark O. Hatfield courthouse. But Portland, in particular, is a city that the media have not covered well. Antifa, which is very much located in Oregon, has had kind of a strangle hold on Portland for many years, if not decades. It was two years ago that they had to cancel the Rose Parade in Portland, which is a very important parade, because Antifa wrote a letter to the city threatening violence because a GOP organization was allowed to march in it and the city caved. The city just doesn't have control over the radical elements there, and it doesn't need to have an entire city inflamed to say that there's a very destabilizing, threatening element in that city."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. I'm a little short on time, so I need quick answers here. Leslie, I happen to agree that the violence itself has been made kind of a backburner issue by the media. But does the New York Times go too far in putting this headline on a column by Michelle Goldberg. Trump's occupation of American cities has begun?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's sensationalistic and it certainly gets people to buy papers or read the articles online. There's -- if it bleeds, it leads, or you know, if it's titillates, it leads, right? And that's exactly what this does. Look, there are people that are in various cities, such as Portland or Seattle that look at any, you know, by the federal government coming in. Let's look at Portland specifically. Federal government coming in prior to last month at the end of June, the incidences of violence actually decreased and have been largely peaceful protests. And when the feds came in and then you have those unmarked vans and people being picked, people reacted and many of them not in good manner, a violent manner, but that certainly was not the majority of individuals. So I think it's fair, because I think it's what media does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. On the point, Griff, you know quick answer. The New York Times, to its credit, also said in a news story that some of the peaceful protesters in Portland still supported the violent actions of those who were injuring police officers, using lasers, using fireworks, setting fires. You've covered these three protests. Is it difficult to access the right tone when you have some peaceful and some thugs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "That's right. And time and time again, it's peaceful protesters by day, and then by night, around midnight, it gets violent, different element comes out. Just a quick final thought, though, on the -- what the media has covered this. Listen, the quote, \"occupation\" as the New York Times says is different in Chicago, in New York City where you're looking at a possible surge of federal authorities to get the violence. Not related to protests, under control as opposed to Portland and Seattle where it is purely protester or agitator-driven."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

And it's just -- it's so sad to see how many people have died from this. They are not altogether that unthinkable if you compare it to what happened in 1957 with the Asian flue. The equivalent of 220,000 or so Americans died in that pandemic. In the Spanish flu in 1918, it was like 1.6 million Americans who died from that. And there's no evidence that Woodrow Wilson had even said anything public about it. In 1957, there was some moderate reaction to it, as in schools might close for a few days here or there. But you didn't see this kind of nationwide panic inducement that you're seeing with the coverage of this, where they are almost, like, rooting for the virus to win over and against America. We have a tough virus. The whole world has a tough virus to deal with. But I don't see enough in the media coverage about how much is going well and how capable we are to handle it. It seems they want to keep everything shut down, business, schools, churches, everything, but mass protests and riots."

He should care about numbers, numbers that are surging in the state that I live in, numbers that are surging in Texas and Florida, the three largest states in the United States of America, three of the largest states in the United States of America. That should be a concern. He should be leading this country. This is not and should not and cannot be a political issue. I live in a household with a man who has to get tested constantly for Coronavirus, because now, the surge you're seeing in his office and patients with his partners that he didn't see before. It's not just about the death rate. It's about this virus attacks the human body and the cells in the human body differently than those viruses that Mollie spoke about. This is not political. Look, the reason other countries have been able to look at this their rear-view mirror for the most part, Howie, is because they didn't make it political.

There are people who say -- and I think this is very valid that it doesn't do anything for patients who are hospitalized or near death. There are other people, including quite a few doctors, who think is good as a very early course of treatment. Certainly not harmful, possibly having good benefits. The hysteria about Hydroxychloroquine has actually prevented the development of clinical trials, particularly for that early stage of treatment. Again, it is not shown to be particularly helpful if you're already at the point of hospitalization. And I don't understand why the media are so intent on shutting down discussion of this, and the way that tech companies actually removed this video. I think it actually gives more power to people who think that this is helpful. And if they want to -- if they truly, genuinely think for some reason that this shouldn't even be discussed, they should do a better job of managing that debate."

He'd already Fox Corporation, which includes Fox News and whose CEO is his brother, Lachlan Murdoch, after its entertainment assets were sold to Disney. James Murdoch said in a statement my resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions. That stance came little as surprise to industry insiders as James Murdoch has made climate change a major cause, once criticizing coverage of the issue by Fox and News Corp.

He now says he was trying to prod the \"dishonest lamestream media into covering the issue of mail-in voting.\" But, as you know, this was widely condemned, including by the conservative National Review and Wall Street Journal editorial page. Was that tweet a mistake? HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: No, absolutely not. The president was clearly pointing out the fact that Democrats are trying to absolutely and completely and totally change the way we conduct elections in this country three months before election day. It's absolutely insane. And what they're trying to replace the current voting system with is a mail-in -- a universal mail-in voting system that is completely rife with the potential for fraud, cheating. And we see example after example of this, whether it's in New Jersey, where they had to kick out 20 percent of the votes because they couldn't be verified; 100,000-plus votes not counted in California. We still don't know who won a congressional seat, a primary actually, in New York, from a month ago, because of this type of system. It is fraught with so much trouble and so much danger. And the media know this. They just don't want to report it. And I remember a great story, actually, on FoxNews.com, where someone's cat got a ballot in the mail to vote.

But when the president says it could work, when the president says some scientists, including the doctor at Yale, pointed to the fact that it could possibly help out with coronavirus, he gets pilloried for it up and down all day long. It's absolutely insane. The -- the hypocrisy the media has with the way they cover this president versus the way they cover Joe Biden is just astonishing. I mean, he has taken leadership in this role. He was the one calling for shutdowns from flights from China and Europe early on, while Nancy Pelosi was out in Chinatown, without a mask, mind you, telling people to go out and enjoy themselves. It was Governor Cuomo himself who left New York open seven days after everyone else shut down and then inexplicably sent nursing home patients with coronavirus back into the nursing homes. I mean, you're talking almost 40,000 deaths in the State of New York, and the media point to Cuomo as the right way to do things. It's absolutely insane. So the fact they attack this president, who early on listened to his medical experts and health experts, talked about masks on March 31st. April 3rd he and the CDC came out and gave the guidelines. And one more point, it was a month and five days later before all of the press corps wore masks inside the briefing room.

And when he does pop up out of the hidey-hole, he gets questions in the media like, \"Why did you choose Delaware to have this wonderful press conference? Tell us why Donald Trump is so bad?\" He doesn't get asked questions about why he has kowtowed to China for the better part of 30 years. He gets no questions about Hunter Biden and Burisma. None of those things get talked about as it relates to Joe Biden with the media because they share the same radical left agenda. And he's an empty vessel at this point, no question. He's being filled by the -- the far reaches of the party, the Ilhan Omars, the Rashida Tlaibs, the Bernie Sanders, the Socialist wing.

But the fact is it's Joe Biden who lied, for example, about even knowing anything about Michael Flynn, but it was he himself who wanted to use the Logan Act to try and frame and get Michael Flynn. It was a systematic effort. So the lies that the -- the previous administration, you know, engaged in were never covered by the mainstream media, as you know.

He prefers to talk to OANN which as you know is not exactly the most balanced organization out there. But more importantly Joe Biden has been doing press conferences, he did one two weeks ago, which even Hogan Gidley just acknowledged. And while he doesn't like the questions, I think, if I remember correctly, there was a Fox reporter in the audience who asked a question, pretty tough, about Joe Biden's cognitive ability. So I don't understand what it is Hogan Gidley wants. Does Hogan Gidley want to go himself and ask a question? Then he should.

If he doesn't trust the Postal Service to do this properly, he's in charge of the Postal Service. He appointed the person who runs it. He could say this is what we have to do. The Republicans in the Senate, starting with Mitch McConnell, have turned down hundreds of millions of dollars to go into the budget to ensure the security and the integrity of our election.

Yesterday we had the MLB commissioner, Rob Manfred, telling ESPN that hey, right now, we're going to play but the players have got to be better, talking about the behavior of the players, whether it's the Marlins or the Cardinals or any others. We learned a week ago, Howie, that Marlins tests came back and we are only three or four days into the season, right? We learned of these tests now. I think what Commissioner Manfred is doing is laying the groundwork, if we get another slew of tests today and we will get them because games are being played all across the country today, in just a few hours, if we get that, it will be very difficult for Manfred not to consider shutting things down, and that would be a really tough time. Just an example of the strains, though, you've got the Nats, our Nats are postponed because they're in Miami, supposed to be playing the Marlins."

      "utterance": "Right. Well, some players are accusing MLB of not caring about players' health. I'm sure the NBA and the NFL are carefully watching this. I don't know what the television networks would do if baseball goes away. I am also wondering whether it was wishful thinking, we have about half a minute, to think that 30 baseball teams could pull this off and maybe it's an omen for all the thousands of schools that may or may not reopen."

Perhaps there is lesson there that the MLB didn't do as the NFL tries to figure out whether they're going to have a football season."
