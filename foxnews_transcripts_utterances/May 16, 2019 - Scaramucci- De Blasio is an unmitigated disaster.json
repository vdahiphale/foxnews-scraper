      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". We're glad you're with us. All right. Tonight, a lot of breaking news, brand new developments surrounding James Comey, James Clapper, John Brennan, we have got a monumental new report from Solomon about real Russian collusion in the Clinton campaign. We'll break it wide open. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And truth and justice as we promised is now beginning to cascade down. No one in the deep state is safe. They're all in fear this very night, because they're all facing real legal consequences. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But we start with another huge discovery from Judicial Watch tonight. They just obtained scores of heavily redacted documents featuring communications between Bruce Ohr and his wife, Nellie Ohr. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, remember, Bruce, the fourth highest ranking Justice Department official, Nellie Ohr working for Fusion GPS, doing op research on Donald Trump, then candidate. One e-mail chain from 2016 shows Ohr's planning a meeting about Russian organized crime with the first secretary at the German embassy. Now, in the last message, Nellie Ohr writes, quote: Thanks. I'm now deleting these texts. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I wonder if she used Bleach Bit? Now, why were those e-mails deleted? Now, keep in mind, Nellie Ohr working with Christopher Steele, working at Fusion GPS, her husband, Bruce Ohr, maintaining constant contact with Steele as well during his time as high- ranking DOJ official. And now, both deep state actors are organizing a meeting with the foreign government, and then deleting the evidence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Judicial Watch president Tom Fenton is calling it disturbing. He will also join us tonight exclusively with the details. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, we have another bombshell from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. He's been on fire the last few weeks. As it turns out, there might have been actual real Russia collusion in the 2016 election. By the way, does the media care about collusion, or only getting Donald Trump? Interesting question. This collusion involves a prominent Ukrainian lawmaker who was reportedly feeding anti-Trump dirt to the Clinton campaign. And according to Solomon, the shady figure is being investigated for taking bribes from Russia in 2016, the very same time that he was actively working with Democrats on a smear campaign for the Trump campaign -- or against the Trump campaign. So, think about it, if the media mob really cared about collusion as they claim, this story would be every second, every minute, every hour of every day on every network on the front page of every newspaper. We're going to have more of this monologue in a moment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, joining us with more on this breaking report, he is the investigative report and, of course, editor at \"The Hill\", John Solomon. John, a lot of details, you have been on fire. I'll let you put it in your own words tonight.",

And since that time, we've learned lot of information. We learned that in December, the Ukrainian courts ruled that Serhiy Leshchenko, the parliamentary member that you just mentioned, had wrongly interfered in the U.S. election. This is a court ruling. He wrongly and illegally interfered in the U.S. election by leaking documents about Paul Manafort designed to smear the Trump campaign. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then a few weeks ago, we got Nellie Ohr's testimony from Congress, and we learned that same Serhiy Leshchenko, that same parliamentary member was the one feeding Trump dirt to Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele and Nellie Ohr's firm. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tonight, we can report that in the time frame when he was doing both of those things, leaking the documents about Manafort, providing information to Fusion GPS for the Clinton campaign and DNC, he was receiving money, that's the suspicion, and Ukraine prosecutors say, from a Russian oligarch, then ended up buying a very expensive apartment, just a few days after Paul Manafort was forced to resign from the Trump campaign. So, this is a beginning of an investigation in Ukraine. It's been announced the prosecutors told me today they are looking at whether that Russian money had something to do with Serhiy Leshchenko's dealings on the Trump campaign, the Clinton campaign, and, of course, Paul Manafort. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Only the colleges will see those numbers, which is a point of contention, especially in the wake of the college admission scandal where we now know that students have been cheating on SAT exams for years. One high school counselor told our corporate cousin, the Wall Street Journal, the focus on diversity is already high and this will only magnify that, quoting, \"Do I feel minority students had been discriminated against?

We'll break it wide open. And truth and justice as we promised is now beginning to cascade down. No one in the deep state is safe. They're all in fear this very night, because they're all facing real legal consequences. But we start with another huge discovery from Judicial Watch tonight. They just obtained scores of heavily redacted documents featuring communications between Bruce Ohr and his wife, Nellie Ohr. Now, remember, Bruce, the fourth highest ranking Justice Department official, Nellie Ohr working for Fusion GPS, doing op research on Donald Trump, then candidate. One e-mail chain from 2016 shows Ohr's planning a meeting about Russian organized crime with the first secretary at the German embassy."

And now, both deep state actors are organizing a meeting with the foreign government, and then deleting the evidence. Now, Judicial Watch president Tom Fenton is calling it disturbing. He will also join us tonight exclusively with the details. But, first, we have another bombshell from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. He's been on fire the last few weeks. As it turns out, there might have been actual real Russia collusion in the 2016 election. By the way, does the media care about collusion, or only getting Donald Trump? Interesting question. This collusion involves a prominent Ukrainian lawmaker who was reportedly feeding anti-Trump dirt to the Clinton campaign. And according to Solomon, the shady figure is being investigated for taking bribes from Russia in 2016, the very same time that he was actively working with Democrats on a smear campaign for the Trump campaign -- or against the Trump campaign. So, think about it, if the media mob really cared about collusion as they claim, this story would be every second, every minute, every hour of every day on every network on the front page of every newspaper. We're going to have more of this monologue in a moment. But, first, joining us with more on this breaking report, he is the investigative report and, of course, editor at \"The Hill\", John Solomon. John, a lot of details, you have been on fire. I'll let you put it in your own words tonight."

And since that time, we've learned lot of information. We learned that in December, the Ukrainian courts ruled that Serhiy Leshchenko, the parliamentary member that you just mentioned, had wrongly interfered in the U.S. election. This is a court ruling. He wrongly and illegally interfered in the U.S. election by leaking documents about Paul Manafort designed to smear the Trump campaign. Then a few weeks ago, we got Nellie Ohr's testimony from Congress, and we learned that same Serhiy Leshchenko, that same parliamentary member was the one feeding Trump dirt to Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele and Nellie Ohr's firm. Tonight, we can report that in the time frame when he was doing both of those things, leaking the documents about Manafort, providing information to Fusion GPS for the Clinton campaign and DNC, he was receiving money, that's the suspicion, and Ukraine prosecutors say, from a Russian oligarch, then ended up buying a very expensive apartment, just a few days after Paul Manafort was forced to resign from the Trump campaign. So, this is a beginning of an investigation in Ukraine. It's been announced the prosecutors told me today they are looking at whether that Russian money had something to do with Serhiy Leshchenko's dealings on the Trump campaign, the Clinton campaign, and, of course, Paul Manafort."

      "utterance": "Yes, Sean, good evening to you, in the capital city of San Salvador. I came down here to talk about MS13 and gangs, which he did all day. His schedule was chockfull of that and you're going to hear a lot more about that tomorrow on \"America's Newsroom\". I think the clip that you just heard is perhaps the most telling aspect of what his job is now. We found out this past week that federal prosecutor had been appointed weeks ago, now, to start looking into everything that was happening during the campaign of 2016, the summer of 2016, and possibly, Sean, even prior to that. He took the job on Valentine's Day, February 14 this year, just three months ago. He said he kept asking questions, but the answers did not make sense to him. And that's where that phrase you heard, don't hang together, that's the thing that he remembers the most, based on his experience thus far. He's trying to get to the bottom of this, including in the interview there you heard that he's not quite sure where it goes. That's part of it now, and you get the rest of that conversation tomorrow. In addition, it talks about James Comey, question about John Brennan, and James Clapper. Not a lot of detail or information on that, but it's clear they're looking at the Trump Tower meeting with Comey in January of 2017. I would say also, Sean, things to listen to tomorrow are his feelings about being called a liar, how he's defending himself on obstruction, whether there was witness tampering and how he considered that in a legal sense when judging the Mueller report. There's a lot in this thing, Sean -- his conversation with Nancy Pelosi yesterday on Capitol Hill. You get the sense from Bill Barr that he knew he was going to be a target and he did not care. Now, where does this go and where does it lead, we're not quite sure. But you're going to find out more when you see that tomorrow."

And while the Attorney General Barr searches for truth and justice, well, the Democrats on Capitol Hill predicatively busy wasting your time, other people's money, still advancing a hoax, still advancing lies and conspiracy theories. For example, Jerry Nadler is now demanding the attorney general revealed grand jury information in the Mueller report. Nadler actually wants the attorney general of the United States to commit a crime or he's going to be handcuffed by the sergeant of arms. Really? As law professor Jonathan Turley has pointed out, it is Nadler who is in for a world of hurt if he continues this. Watch this."

When senators ask me, why won't he commit to releasing the full, unredacted report? I said, because that would be a crime.

But in an effort to be transparent as possible, Barr has expanded access to most unredacted, the most unredacted version of the Mueller report, so that Democrats, if they just take the time, they can see almost all of it. No word by the way if any Democrats will bother to take the time to look. One sentence and seven partial sentences removed, everything else remains. Meanwhile, as we just heard, Barr's legitimate investigation into the deep state is well underway, so is the Horowitz probe into FISA abuse and the Huber report investigating leaking. And just this week, we learned about the John Durham investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. The once powerful, high ranking members of this deep state that we've been talking about and exposing for two years, they are tonight all running scared and they're now turning on each other. As we reported last night, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, they're putting all the blame right on then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Comey is trashing Strzok and Page on national TV. Rod Rosenstein is being trashed by James Comey, and he's now trashing back. They're both attacking each other's character. Then, of course, there's Brennan and Comey, they're blaming each other for promoting and pushing the dirty Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier. And Comey's general counsel, James Baker, just revealed he was, quote, quite worried that his boss, Director Comey of the FBI, was literally blackmailing Donald Trump with Hillary's dirty Russian dossier.

That, sir, we have this information, it came to us in a particular way, the press has it, it's about to come out, you should be alerted to that fact.

But it was something that we were obligated to deal with and obligated to assess, given what we understood, what I understood to be the source of the information, Christopher Steele at that point in time.

If you didn't take the Hillary bought and paid for Russian dossier seriously or literally, why did James Comey in October of 2016 swear, it says at the top of the FISA application, verified? Why did he swear that the contents were true and accurate in the first FISA request? Why was that request marked verified at the very top? Now, did James Comey lie then or did he lie in January of 2017 when he said to then President-elect Trump, it's salacious but not verified. He is at the center what was a multi-year effort by the most powerful unelected bureaucrats clearly first to rig an investigation into their favorite candidate when the evidence was overwhelming and incontrovertible. Hillary Clinton, the Espionage Act, Hillary Clinton, obstruction of justice, the intent was clear -- destroy the evidence, and that's why you delete 30,000 subpoenaed e-mails, that's why you'd use Bleach Bit, that's why you'd have an aide take a hammer and bust up all your devices and remove all of the SIM cards. That would be intent, something they tried to pin on Donald Trump when there was no underlying crime. Four investigations including the Mueller report, no collusion. By the way, it's over.

And the subject line reads, you know, analyst Russia organized crime. Nellie writes, thanks, I'm deleting these e-mails now. So, you've got, looks like Russia related e-mails being deleted, at the request of Bruce Orr, Justice Department material, and certainly it could be possibly relevant to the Russia-gate hoax targeting President Trump and the investigation generally. As you quoted me, it's mightily disturbing that you've got Justice Department officials, A, sending material to their spouses who are working for a candidate for president, and then, B, telling them to destroy these set of documents."

So, now, you've got nefarious characters, Comey, Brennan, and Clapper, who are now pointing the fingers of blame at each other, the circular firing squad as you say.

The attorney general at the time, Loretta Lynch, is never going to indict Hillary, the evidence is overwhelming, the evidence on obstruction overwhelming, so they save her. Then they use her dossier to spy not only on citizen Carter Page, but backdoored their way into all things Trump campaign, all things Trump transition, and then, of course, to bludgeon and destroy his presidency. And I'll add to that, they used Hillary's dirty Russian dossier that the \"New York Times\" now suggests probably was Russian disinformation as the foundation to get these warrants.

All of this took place. And it's pretty -- step into the president's shoes. You don't know Clapper, you don't know Brennan, you don't know Comey. The three come in to give you a briefing as president-elect about the government's most cherished secrets, in a choreographed moment, two of those three leave, leaving Comey behind. Comey to share something so sacred with the president, and it turns out to be the Steele dossier, which the president himself would know was true or wasn't true. So what is he to conclude?

Race is not considered, instead the scores are based on 15 factors like crime rates and poverty rates in local schools and neighborhoods. That information will come from public records like the U.S. Census. But the college board won't reveal how they weigh the factors or calculate the scores, and the students won't be told their adversity score. Only the colleges will see those numbers, which is a point of contention, especially in the wake of the college admission scandal where we now know that students have been cheating on SAT exams for years. One high school counselor told our corporate cousin, the Wall Street Journal, the focus on diversity is already high and this will only magnify that, quoting, \"Do I feel minority students had been discriminated against? Yes, I do. But I see the reverse of it happening right now.\" 150 schools will use adversity scores this fall, and most schools by 2021. Sean."
