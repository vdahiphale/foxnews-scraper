It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Some breaking developments tonight, there is a report that the FBI wiretapped former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort both before and after the election. For more on this stunning story, let's bring in chief national correspondent Ed Henry in Washington. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Good evening, Dana. The leaks just keep on coming. In fact tonight, not just about the possibility of an indictment coming from former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort but also new information raising questions about whether President Trump was correct about his claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped by the Obama administration. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First The New York Times breaking fresh details about Special Council's Robert Mueller's raid Manafort's Virginia home in July. They say agents picked the lock to Manafort's door as he was sleeping. The Times also reporting that Manafort in his legal team were told he is likely to be indicted. Not necessarily shocking to the Trump legal team. People close to the President have told me they've been expecting potential charges against Manafort and retired General Mike Flynn who today announced the creation of a legal defense fund. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But a source close to the President told me tonight, we should pay close attention to the second leak to CNN claiming Manafort was wiretapped based on secret court orders before and after the 2016 elections. The first wiretapped we should note dating as far back as 2014 before the campaign. But this source tells me, the second wiretapped after the election came after the FBI embraced some of the details on the Russian dossier of then President-elect Trump that has been discredited. I'm hearing that the judges who approved this court order at the FISA court, the foreign intelligence -- that court, are privately miffed that this wiretap of Manafort was tied to what is now a discredited report. So tonight, the plot thickens. Not just on whether Manafort and others in the Trump orbit will face indictment but the plot thickens on whether the President was correct about his claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped and this was a witch-hunt. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The President's critics laughed that off but remember, we've been told Manafort also owned a home, yes, in Trump Tower. CNN is reporting that Manafort was wiretapped during a time period where he was still in phone contact with President Trump. So, there's a lot developing tonight and we are still digging on the facts -- Dana.",

He's joking. But once healthy, now eight months into Trump's presidency, he's really sick. So, is it Trump's fault? Of course it is.

      "utterance": "Good evening, Dana. The leaks just keep on coming. In fact tonight, not just about the possibility of an indictment coming from former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort but also new information raising questions about whether President Trump was correct about his claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped by the Obama administration. First The New York Times breaking fresh details about Special Council's Robert Mueller's raid Manafort's Virginia home in July. They say agents picked the lock to Manafort's door as he was sleeping. The Times also reporting that Manafort in his legal team were told he is likely to be indicted. Not necessarily shocking to the Trump legal team. People close to the President have told me they've been expecting potential charges against Manafort and retired General Mike Flynn who today announced the creation of a legal defense fund. But a source close to the President told me tonight, we should pay close attention to the second leak to CNN claiming Manafort was wiretapped based on secret court orders before and after the 2016 elections. The first wiretapped we should note dating as far back as 2014 before the campaign. But this source tells me, the second wiretapped after the election came after the FBI embraced some of the details on the Russian dossier of then President-elect Trump that has been discredited. I'm hearing that the judges who approved this court order at the FISA court, the foreign intelligence -- that court, are privately miffed that this wiretap of Manafort was tied to what is now a discredited report. So tonight, the plot thickens. Not just on whether Manafort and others in the Trump orbit will face indictment but the plot thickens on whether the President was correct about his claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped and this was a witch-hunt. The President's critics laughed that off but remember, we've been told Manafort also owned a home, yes, in Trump Tower. CNN is reporting that Manafort was wiretapped during a time period where he was still in phone contact with President Trump. So, there's a lot developing tonight and we are still digging on the facts -- Dana."

Carry your own burden because he realizes the United States is not going to be able to pay for this and do all this stuff forever. Just like he did with NATO. Now, the Security Council has been more useful to the President than the House and the Senate to a certain extent. He doesn't have a lot legislatively done. He's got two unanimous U.N. Security Council resolutions through, sanctioning the North Koreans. So, I think Trump does well in the world state because he's used to dealing with CEOs and executives. Not legislature where it's really hard to come together with a big coalitions.

Right? So, we've got to do something. I think people are ready for it. And I think they feel that President Trump is the man to get the job done. So, I like kind of coalescing the interest and resolve towards that common goal. And I think today what we heard with the President, you want to talk about in a second but it really shows like Jesse said, he is very comfortable on the world stage in dealing with world leaders who he sort of interacts with like CEOs of major companies. It fits his business model and his mind-set versus like the desperate people and, you know, the legislature et cetera, that he can't quite get a grasp on. He likes when he's one-on-one.

Well, of course, everybody then said, well, exactly, the GDP, the percentage of GDP, actually the United States and other countries are paying up but he wants them to pay more and he has seen some of the countries then pony up more money. So, it did have some effect, and I think that similarly tomorrow, you know, people have trouble with Trump with rocket man or this weekend, the business about, you know, re-tweeting the image of a golf ball hitting Hillary Clinton in the back and her stumbling. People think, this is -- but tomorrow, it's hard to look at him as something less than a world leader standing in front of the U.N. And speaking about something that the entire world is concerned about which is North Korea. I mean, that is what is front and center. There are other issues and we will going to get to some of them later in the program dealing with Iran or the Paris climate deal. But tomorrow, he's got an audience that wants to hear from him. That wants to support him, wants to see leadership in terms of dealing with Kim Jong-un."

Whenever identity politics insert itself, by its very nature, it's divisive and everything implodes. I mean, you brought up ESPN. They are in decline, the Emmys are in decline.

The dude must be a blast at a picnic. Volleyball? Nope, too many eye injuries. Tug-of-war? Nope, all of those rope blisters. Bobbing for apples? A child in New Zealand drowned once. But I wonder if you would have been so panicky under President Obama? Remember, he rode bikes in mom jeans. He went hand gliding. He body surfed and casually smoked. I'm pretty sure that is all riskier than a once-in-a-lifetime grass cutting. But in the Trump era, everything is extra harmful to your health. Including Donald Trump. Washington Post writer Dana Milbank details a physical where he reports suffering from chest pains, headaches, high blood pressure and blames, quote, \"Trump hypertensive unexplained disorder\" or what he likes to call THUD. He's joking. But once healthy, now eight months into Trump's presidency, he's really sick. So, is it Trump's fault? Of course it is. But the bright side for Milbank, the president helped him craft a cheeky piece out of tired, predictable whining. As thanks, Milbank should trim the White House hedges.

The United States of America has actually reduced its carbon emissions over the last 10-15 years. Meanwhile ECU countries are predominantly E.U. countries have increased their emissions. So we've had this debate already. The United States as a leader in reduction of carbon emissions. We don't need to do this.

I have a feeling that this is what he has been doing. I've been watching this for the last nine months. Send them all back. He doesn't send them all back but he creates a discussion where people have to move towards him. Kill their family. No, we just go and kill ISIS.
