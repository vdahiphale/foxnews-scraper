And low unemployment, fantastic for everyone. And the tax cut has delivered a $2,600 cut to every family in this country. But there are areas of concern, the wages dipped a little bit the last quarter. They're still up 2.8 percent, where under Obama they were flat. And the trade deal is tough because, you know, you see some places like we're talking about, you know, you have steel companies closing, and then you have aluminum companies opening up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what he did with the E.U. was actually very smart.

We still have the auto tariffs in play which isn't good for Michigan and South Carolina. But, all in all, you know, the farm subsidies I think are good politics but bad economics.

There's two members there, Republican, they are in very bad shape, and he wanted to go and help shore them up. He'll probably return to those places. The other thing I would say is -- that Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, all of his numbers there are really bad. And so, where these tariff issues should help should be there. They're not helping so much. So he's got to figure out how to turn that around.

What I've noticed is that -- we might be entering the second part of a political cycle that's been going on since the '60s. The Republicans come in and they fix things, and that allows the Democrats to come in and break things because there're things to be broken, and then you get the Republicans back into fix things because the Democrats broke things and then the Republicans fix things, and then, the public say, oh, now we can sustain more Democrats. So they come in to break things. And this goes back and forth. So Republicans fix, Democrats break. Republican fix, Democrats break. This has been going on since the 1960s.

I think Trump needs to focus like a laser on the economy, and law and order, and judges, and keep hammering Democrats as socialist freaks who kneel during the national anthem. There are great headlines coming out of the economy. We're supposed to get an enormous GDP number tomorrow, maybe 3, 4, 5 percent. We've had three straight quarters of 3 percent GDP economic growth. And low unemployment, fantastic for everyone. And the tax cut has delivered a $2,600 cut to every family in this country. But there are areas of concern, the wages dipped a little bit the last quarter. They're still up 2.8 percent, where under Obama they were flat. And the trade deal is tough because, you know, you see some places like we're talking about, you know, you have steel companies closing, and then you have aluminum companies opening up. And what he did with the E.U. was actually very smart. I think what he did is he's saying for short term pain, we want long term gain. So he raised some tariffs and they came back begging yesterday. And they have a verbal deal and they're going to now drop the tariffs on nonindustrial goods, they're going to drop the tariffs on liquefied natural gas. We still have the auto tariffs in play which isn't good for Michigan and South Carolina. But, all in all, you know, the farm subsidies I think are good politics but bad economics. But it's just showing the trade partners, listen, we're going to soften the blow because you're not going to inflict any pain on us. And, in order to eventually bring down all trade barriers, and that's the goal, free and open and fair trade."

They didn't actually agree to anything yesterday. They just agreed to stop fighting in public and to deal with the issues, and that's great because we need to fight as allies against countries like China. I think that the president is smart to get out of town. In the early years of the Bush administration, that first term, the economy was great. You could not get a lot of media coverage around it. Obviously, we are at war as well. The great thing for the president, if he wants good headlines is he had to go to these places, and watch where the president goes. He's to places where he can help vulnerable Republicans members. He went to Iowa today and Illinois. There's two members there, Republican, they are in very bad shape, and he wanted to go and help shore them up. He'll probably return to those places. The other thing I would say is -- that Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, all of his numbers there are really bad. And so, where these tariff issues should help should be there. They're not helping so much. So he's got to figure out how to turn that around. And by being conciliatory towards the E.U., he might be able to do that."

They're like those old, strange men on the beach with metal detectors, you know, that are walking too close to you. Yeah, hoping to find something, except they're misery detectors and they can't find any misery so they have to invent misery. In this case, Liz Warren wants to raise tax rates to 50 percent for people, for some people, and rollback the tax cuts. She's essentially a success extinguisher. She's looking at the economy like it's a fire and she wants to put it out. That's what she's doing. Here's what I worry about is that it might achieve something. What I've noticed is that -- we might be entering the second part of a political cycle that's been going on since the '60s. The Republicans come in and they fix things, and that allows the Democrats to come in and break things because there're things to be broken, and then you get the Republicans back into fix things because the Democrats broke things and then the Republicans fix things, and then, the public say, oh, now we can sustain more Democrats. So they come in to break things. And this goes back and forth. So Republicans fix, Democrats break. Republican fix, Democrats break. This has been going on since the 1960s. So now, Trump has fixed a half a dozen things, and everybody is going, and you know what, let's give those Democrats another chance. Let them break some stuff."

And so, I think his message to them, both with the farmers and the steelworkers, is I'm with you. I was with you because you were the forgotten men and women who President Obama left behind, and I'm standing with you now and I'm fighting for you. And so, I think it's really critical time for him to be sending that message, and also to be touting the fact that we have seen hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs added under President Trump.

So, I think, let's start with the Rosenstein situation, Dana. I think what they're asking for are the original documents that existed to justify the opening of this Russia-Trump probe, and they have not been able to find any of those documents.

And so, I think the point of this is to stir some sort of action, to put pressure on leadership, put pressure on the DOJ and Rod Rosenstein. Look, you've got to have the numbers for impeachment and they don't have that in the house. You're not going to have it moving forward if anything happened in the house to the senate.

In high school, I couldn't join the boys' chorus, because I couldn't sing. And I couldn't join the girls' chorus, because I went to an all-boys school. I could only sing in the shower, often by myself. It was pure hell, but I managed. But the irony of forcing inclusivity on clubs is that inevitably, clubs go away. It's not worth the trouble. Society is now in a gender panic where it's scandalous to say that boys and girls are different and that they like different things. I've yet to run into a single male who likes Maroon 5."

Yes, that's the biggest man-made waterfall in the world, and it's streaming off the side of a 22-story skyscraper. The waterfall plunges from the top floors of the building. And this isn't cheap.

This is actually a donkey, and there is a zoo in Egypt that tried to pass a donkey off as a zebra. The photo has gone viral. Now the zoo is trying to deny it.
