      "utterance": "Listen, we have seen it from day one with this administration. No matter what is important to the American public, if there's a smidgen, if I may borrow that word from the administration. There's no urgency or we never get the answers. They bring the guys in, they are arrogant and pompous. Someone on the panel, usually Elijah Cummings, is blocking and tackling. This weekend, call Gruber and try to associate them with Romney. It's ridiculous. We haven't gotten answers on anything."

      "utterance": "It gets scary. After what we went through, they are desperate. First time home buyers, are doing different things. 620 Fico scores. This isn't the problem. Young people and other people don't believe in the American dream anymore. They don't believe in investing in the future. They are living in a moment because they lost faith in it."

      "speaker": "Dagen McDowell",
      "utterance": "There's a bigger problem with them. Controlled by the government, the profits go straight to the treasury. They have spent a quarter of a trillion dollars into the U.S. Treasury. It's $38 billion more than the bailout. They paid that back plus 38 billion dollars. You know what? Here is the thing. These are revenue sources for congress, for lawmakers."

    {
      "speaker": "Charlie Gasparino",
      "utterance": "What actually got us in trouble in the first place is the government inducing people to own homes. My old man put down 20% on a crappy house, but put down his 20%. People don't do that anymore because we have low interest rates, banks handing money to everybody. I have no problem with the treasury getting money from Fannie and Freddie. 46% OF CFOs THINK MILLENNIALS ENTER THE WORKFORCE FEELING \"ENTITLED\""

I think it's a characteristic of young Americans to be very spoiled but there are plenty that work very, very hard, and it very much depends on the person I don't think you can generalize."
