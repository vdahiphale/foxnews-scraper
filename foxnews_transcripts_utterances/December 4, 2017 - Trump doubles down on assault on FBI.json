It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" President Trump is lashing out at the FBI after reports that special counsel Robert Mueller fired a top FBI agent in August from his Russian investigation team because of anti-Trump text he may have sent. The president tweeting yesterday, after years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation and more, running the FBI, its reputation is in tatters. Worst in history. But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness. This morning the president doubled down calling out the hypocrisy between how the agency has treated Michael Flynn versus Hillary Clinton."

Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, and nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life. I think it's a shame. Hillary Clinton on the Fourth of July weekend went to the FBI not under oath. It was the most incredible thing anyone's ever seen. She lied many times. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and it's like they ruined his life. Very unfair."

He might have been part -- may be an advocate, we're about to find out because he would not commit to an interview with the house intelligence committee to Fusion GPS and making that part of the investigation. So this guy is a main part of it. Now he said you're in resources, which is interesting. People call him up and asked how many sick days they have left. So how can you possible go to human resources with an investigative background? It's bizarre what has happened and I'm wondering if he is the only one."

But the more we learn about how the Clinton email investigation was handled, the dirtier it looks. If you look at the web surrounding the investigation, whether it's this guy who was part of it and was an anti-Trump, pro-Hillary person, sending these texts to someone he was having an affair with."

Then on top of it, you add in Loretta Lynch who told Comey to call this a matter, not a criminal investigation. And then you go back to Comey and what he said when he exonerated Hillary Clinton saying that, yes, we have evidence a potential violations with statutes, but nobody is really going to press this case. And then we find out that he wrote the exoneration of Hillary Clinton months ahead of time. The more we learn, the dirtier it is, and it seems like they need to look at it again"

      "utterance": "Pretty bad. He's anti-Trump, and he is the lead investigator of Trump. He interviewed Flynn himself and didn't even warn Flynn that he was coming to interview him. Put him under oath. Flynn didn't even know he was under oath. Flynn didn't have a lawyer present during the interview. So you have that. Then, also, led the Hillary Clinton email investigation and, apparently, he was one of the ones that changed the language that Comey said from grossly negligent to extremely careless. And as you know, that's the statute, grossly negligent, which would have triggered the indictment. So, you also have the FBI director, McCabe, whose wife donated to Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe, didn't tell us about that. And now we're learning that McCabe is the point of contact from the Clinton-funded fake Russia dossier which we haven't heard anything about from the FBI yet. And they're stonewalling on the documents from the tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton in Loretta Lynch. And we now know from the documents that we have seen they were frantically trying to cover it up. And the Mueller team stacked with Democratic donors. Mueller is Comey's professional mentor, and it looks like Comey's now probably guilty of removing FBI documents after he was fired and illegally leaking them. The whole thing looks really bad, and I really don't trust the integrity of the investigation anymore."

There's one aspect that's not been brought up yet, and that is why for the longest time, as McCabe as well as this guy, Strzok, didn't know his name, ducking the request to have them come in front of the house intelligence committee. Now they finally acquiesce to Devin Nunes and will come in and speak. Although, McCabe says I have a conflict with my schedule. I wish Mike Flynn had a conflict with his schedule when he was told by Strzok that he had to go under oath and answer that question."

And when you have this long list of conflicts of interest, people do question why Hillary Clinton got up past when a number of other people who did far less than her did not.

President Trump slammed the fake news, tweeting, people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of ABC News, he has been suspended, should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused many millions of dollars.

The problem here, to me, given my background as a reporter, it seems to me like he's not even saying the source got it wrong. It seems to me like he jumped to a conclusion that the contact between Flynn and Trump -- Trump saying go contact the Russians was during the campaign, not during the transition.

The thing is that fake news, the mainstream media, has been trying to get out of their fake news hole since President Trump classified them that way and they just keep digging deeper. And of a time when audiences are shrinking, they really have a lot of credibility mending to do and they're not really helping themselves. And they have people like Brian Ross -- who by the way has a habit of jumping to conclusions. Ari Fleischer said, to add to Kimberly's point, that during the Iraq war he claims that Saddam Hussein was the one who sent anthrax to Washington, D.C., or (INAUDIBLE) that was previously.

So what do you do, because it was supposed to be temporary, but then what it does is it establishes future precedent if then they were going to go to try to employ it again and implement it. So what I think here, though, I want to touch on the sanctuary cities, having been a prosecutor in San Francisco. You know, you really see just the flagrant disregard for the law. It's not just the juries that accept crazy defenses like the Twinkie defense that they accepted for Mayor Moscone; but it's the judges not allowing and keeping out evidence that would be probative for a jury to hear to make the right decision. And this, to be honest with you, is a slam dunk case. A felon in possession, it's a felony murder.

But as soon as -- if they hired him even as a backup -- he left the 49ers, OK? He wanted to go out. If he got hired in Texas, that team seems to emulate his style, it would have been over. He wouldn't be getting this award. He also said, \"If I get hired, I'm standing.\" So what was your point? If you get hired, you're standing. Yet nothing's changed. We give you $90 million, you still don't want to get up. Or his followers don't. I don't -- my mind can't get around it."
