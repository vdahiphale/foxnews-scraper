But I also think that this deal, this -- whatever we want to call it, the committee for foreign investment in the United States, it is nine different departments, all looking at something, so it wasn't as if Hillary Clinton just signed it, just did it herself. I am curious about this informant. This is unusual for a gag order like this to be lifted. And apparently it's directly from the president and the speaker putting pressure on the FBI, who comply. And so we don't know this person's identity yet. I understand it's a male, so we'll call him a man. But hopefully we'll find that out soon.

It's really helped dictate kind of the course of his life, his conduct, and the choices that he's made, that he's really stuck too, listened to the advice of his brother. They were extremely close. And the loss of his brother really deeply affected him. Very saddened by it, very hurt and distressed. So this is where you get to see, sort of, peel back the layers of President Trump, you know, bravado and the larger-than-life figure to say this is the heart. This is a family man in there who really -- he was pained at the loss of his brother. I believe, honestly, that's why he really wants to do this and champion this cause, and put this forward so that other families that are dealing with substance abuse or Polly-substance abuse don't have to suffer in the way that his family did.",

So I think it's great that we're going -- we're trying to solve this. There's a lot of people dying, but I think it has more to do with creating drug delivery devices that one can handle, and also the knowledge of how to use these drugs, but also addressing the fundamental vacuum in our society where people can't find fulfillment.

I think the other thing I would add to the concerns about the criminalization piece that Greg mentioned is that President Trump said something today that's very important. He's directing the NIH, the national institutes of health to do this massive public-private partnership to try to find new drugs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So basically, it's like putting a man on the moon. He's asking America's scientists and achievers of the world to get together to find something that will address pain that doesn't come with the addictive properties of opiates. And that actually -- that can be achieved in addition to trying to tell kids you don't need to do this in your life.

Let me just say, the real news here was we all expected he was going to declare this to be a national emergency. And that would have meant more money going into trying to help people. And by the way, I think it's much more mental health services, therapy and things like that, giving people a sense of purpose and mission in life that Greg was talking about. That money is not there with the national health emergency right now. It's not a national emergency, period. And the second thing, he's got so many openings. He's got openings at the office of drug control, office -- secretary of HHS, Tom Price is gone, remember. DEA, open slot. So all the various agencies will be coordinated right now, they're missing anybody who can be in control.

While accomplishing nothing, hopefully this comical eruption of pathetic desperation will make them feel better. Everyone could use a good cry now and then. And I salute them, for with their screams, they admit the roots behind their rage: pure emotion no longer tethered to rational thought. This action reflects the broken, fragile psyche of the modern adult toddler, appearing physically fully grown but emotionally stunted.

An FBI informant working undercover at the time of the controversial uranium one deal is now free to talk. The justice department's has lifted a gag order so he can tell his story to lawmakers who want to know more about the Obama administration's uranium deal with Moscow, and about the cash that flowed to the Clinton foundation amid the deal.

Usually with a special investigation you like basically say we'll let the justice department handle it, but we're on a different, sort of, world right now. And I think anything that the White House can do to suggest that there was a problem on the Democratic side if it comes to Russia that probably benefits them politically because it just makes everything super confusing and looks like everybody is bad. I mean, I can't believe how many people in Washington were dealing with Russia. But I also think that this deal, this -- whatever we want to call it, the committee for foreign investment in the United States, it is nine different departments, all looking at something, so it wasn't as if Hillary Clinton just signed it, just did it herself. I am curious about this informant. This is unusual for a gag order like this to be lifted. And apparently it's directly from the president and the speaker putting pressure on the FBI, who comply. And so we don't know this person's identity yet. I understand it's a male, so we'll call him a man. But hopefully we'll find that out soon. And then, I don't know if he'll have any additional information or if it will be more part of an ongoing investigation. I don't think it will be determinative of any sort of wrongdoing."

I want to hear how the Russians were trying to curry favor with the Clintons. I'd like to know when this foreign committee on investments, if they were made aware of this. If they weren't made aware of this, why not. If members of the committee who voted to approve the sale had any idea there was bribery going on with the Russians. So all those things I think are going to lead to very interesting explanations. I want to do a little fact-check on Juan. I'm going to play the ombudsman for the show, because yesterday he was saying all this money flowed into the Clinton Foundation way, way before any of this happened. Not true, Juan.

And by the way, let me just tell you, a huge Democratic lament, Obama. Obama knew something was going on, never said a word. And People were like, oh, so you assumed Hillary was going to win? Who's to blame here? But I just want to pick up on something that comes of this, which is to me we have two separate worlds. You know its Venus and Mars, men and women, Republicans and Democrats. And it's like two different stories. So much so that now in the senate judiciary committee, they've even stopped working together. And Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat from California said I'm going to do my investigation. And Charles Grassley, the Republican chair of the committee from Iowa says, I'm going to do my investigation and we'll get together when we come back to Trump and Russia, but for now we're going out -- separate ways, same thing in the house, all these communities. Devin Nunes, I thought he was gone. Now he's back again working as what looks like a stand-in for President Trump.

But remember, most people are getting their news now from social media. The majority of people get the majority of their news from social media. So it does get a little polarized on both sides.

I learned myself. I had a brother, Fred. Great guy. But he had a problem. He had a problem with alcohol. And he would tell me don't drink. Don't drink. He would say it over and over and over again. And to this day, I've never had a drink. And I have no longing for it. I have no interest in it. If we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it's really, really easy not to take them."

And if you've heard him, you know, speak about his brother and the impact it had in his life, you really see that this is something that was such a formative experience for him. It's really helped dictate kind of the course of his life, his conduct, and the choices that he's made, that he's really stuck too, listened to the advice of his brother. They were extremely close. And the loss of his brother really deeply affected him. Very saddened by it, very hurt and distressed. So this is where you get to see, sort of, peel back the layers of President Trump, you know, bravado and the larger-than-life figure to say this is the heart. This is a family man in there who really -- he was pained at the loss of his brother. I believe, honestly, that's why he really wants to do this and champion this cause, and put this forward so that other families that are dealing with substance abuse or Polly-substance abuse don't have to suffer in the way that his family did."

Jordan Peterson, I interviewed him yesterday, made a key point, his a clinical psychologist, deals with a lot of patients. The question isn't why there are so many people on opioids. The question is why aren't all of us on them? This drug directly affects your pleasure centers. It creates the same sensation you get from great achievement for falling in love, from success."

      "utterance": "Yeah. It's dopamine. So no wonder that people are easily addicted to it. But if you demonize this because people are looking at this to fulfill their lives because they're not getting a fulfillment where they are. And if you demonize this drug and you criminalize it, you're going to do three things. You're going to punish people who are legitimately in pain, the cancer patients that need these drugs. You create a police record for a lot of men and women who now can't get real jobs and fulfillment, so instead they just take more drugs, and you drive addicts to the streets. So I think it's great that we're going -- we're trying to solve this. There's a lot of people dying, but I think it has more to do with creating drug delivery devices that one can handle, and also the knowledge of how to use these drugs, but also addressing the fundamental vacuum in our society where people can't find fulfillment. And so, where do they find their joy in life in a lot of these towns is this drug because they're not getting it out of their job. They're getting out of this pill. And those pills are great."

I don't even run errands, so I don't know that really. But I thought that speech was direct and detailed. It was inspirational and aspirational. I think the other thing I would add to the concerns about the criminalization piece that Greg mentioned is that President Trump said something today that's very important. He's directing the NIH, the national institutes of health to do this massive public-private partnership to try to find new drugs. So basically, it's like putting a man on the moon. He's asking America's scientists and achievers of the world to get together to find something that will address pain that doesn't come with the addictive properties of opiates. And that actually -- that can be achieved in addition to trying to tell kids you don't need to do this in your life. You can have all the fulfillment you need without it, and don't even go down that road. I think the ad money -- it could be well spent possibly, but I think that him directing the NIH to do that is probably the most effective part."

      "utterance": "I don't think so because of a lot of things that Greg said, which are, you know, that the emphasis on criminalizing this behavior. It's just going to put more people in jail. You know, people in the black, Latino community know how devastating this has been. So I don't think this is going to help. Let me just say, the real news here was we all expected he was going to declare this to be a national emergency. And that would have meant more money going into trying to help people. And by the way, I think it's much more mental health services, therapy and things like that, giving people a sense of purpose and mission in life that Greg was talking about. That money is not there with the national health emergency right now. It's not a national emergency, period. And the second thing, he's got so many openings. He's got openings at the office of drug control, office -- secretary of HHS, Tom Price is gone, remember. DEA, open slot. So all the various agencies will be coordinated right now, they're missing anybody who can be in control. What my big concern, I think that we have to realize that say no to drugs did not work for most of America, and the idea of criminalizing drug activity, I think it's a self-inflicted pain."

These are really bright kids. I had a great time. So you should be on the lookout for Sophia (ph), Carolyn (ph), Samantha, Jennifer, Caitlin (ph), Zoe, Melanie, Nicole and Reba (ph).
