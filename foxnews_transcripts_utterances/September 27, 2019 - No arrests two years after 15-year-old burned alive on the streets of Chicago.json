It is easy to forget the crisis unfolding on America's streets and the problems being ignored as we retreat in our political corners. Well, we were here in Chicago a year ago and at that time we promised the people in these communities and our office in general that we'd be back and not let the issues go. And tonight, we're here to fulfill that promise. We returned to assess how life has changed or not for the violence-plagued neighborhoods and whether the relationship between the communities and law enforcement, whether it's improved or worsened. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The city was brutalized by gun violence and bloodshed and what are political leaders doing about it? Last year, Democrat Rahm Emanuel was finishing his final year as Mayor and now Mayor Lorie Lightfoot is facing a number of serious challenges, a looming teacher strike, unacceptable level of gang and drug violence, and a city running out of patience. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We'll explore all of it with our live audience and expert panels.

We're also seeing a large influx in the number of kids who have learning disabilities. We don't talk about that in terms of how people get attracted to what brings them to the gang.

It is easy to forget the crisis unfolding on America's streets and the problems being ignored as we retreat in our political corners. Well, we were here in Chicago a year ago and at that time we promised the people in these communities and our office in general that we'd be back and not let the issues go. And tonight, we're here to fulfill that promise. We returned to assess how life has changed or not for the violence-plagued neighborhoods and whether the relationship between the communities and law enforcement, whether it's improved or worsened. The city was brutalized by gun violence and bloodshed and what are political leaders doing about it? Last year, Democrat Rahm Emanuel was finishing his final year as Mayor and now Mayor Lorie Lightfoot is facing a number of serious challenges, a looming teacher strike, unacceptable level of gang and drug violence, and a city running out of patience. We'll explore all of it with our live audience and expert panels. But I want you to understand what's happening in the area we are broadcasting from tonight. We're here at New Beginnings Church and it's situated in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on Chicago's Southside. Do you see the red circles on that map? Well, those are the homicides that have occurred just this year alone. And children are too often the victims of the violence here in Chicago as our own Raymond Arroyo found on the south side of town."

But for the people in these at-risk communities, the statistic, they don't mean all that much. They're suffering from unacceptable levels of routine violence. Joining me now is Tony Robinson, Former Chicago Police Officer in the Violent Crimes Division, Former Homicide Detective, Joseph Moseley, and a Former Homicide Detective and 30-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department, and Anthony Williams, Pastor and Activist here in Chicago. Tony, I want to start with you. It's hard to watch that story. The facts, the promise of a young girl cut short needlessly.

They don't want to talk to the police. We need to back our programs that we used to have on the police department like \"Officer Friendly\", \"The explorer scouts\". Take the youth, give them something to do. We have to really be involved with our community and our youth. When I worked there for 29 years, everybody that knew me knew I was a good cop. And I worked my butt off. I continue to volunteer, go to the academy, talk to our young recruits. Policing is a state of mind, not a state of being. You can't just put someone off of the street and say you're the police. They complain about training. You know something? Do what you were trained to do. And everybody wants to yell about oh, we need more training, no. Do what you were trained to do. Treat people with empathy. Be fair and understand that just because someone lives in a project or a torn-down neighborhood, they don't have that mentality.

The system of violence is overwhelming. We all as citizens must deal with this --, the issue of violence is everyone's fight. History shows us that in America, where you want to come at justice on evil legislation. We can't legislate ourselves of this, police ourselves out of this, but we need civility right now.

You can't delegate your way out of it. However, we have to take a more holistic approach. Understand that this is a mental health crisis. Understand that we're looking at another group of second generation crack babies, looking at learning disorders. So we have to look at this from a holistic approach and say what else do we do? And understand that a lot of police officers have a big misunderstanding of what their job is. We are social workers. For all intents and purposes, for all of the rhetoric that you hear, we don't get out of the car with the gun out. You're supposed to get out there to help people. Plain and simple -- serve and protect not to protect and serve. And I think that message gets convoluted. The other problem is that we have to have a paradigm shift within the police department.

In the River's District hours earlier two other Chicago police officers were injured after being dragged by a fling vehicle outside of White Counsel near the city's Brownsville neighborhood his female partner was hospitalized in serious condition, with two collapsed lungs and fractured ribs. I want to return now to the current leader of the city, Mayor -- excuse me, Lori Lightfoot. We invited her to be part of this Town Hall. We would have loved to have her here; the City Hall is just a few miles from here. I know she's very busy but she declined our invitation. That's okay. But especially with the impending teacher strike, there's a lot going on. I do hope that she join us on the show another time back in Washington. The door is open. She has an open invitation. Yesterday Mayor Lightfoot did take time out of her schedule tough to assail U.S. Immigration officials.

A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump Administration from holding migrant children and their parents in detention indefinitely. The judge ruled that the administration cannot end a decades-old policy that holds children for more than 20 days. The Justice Department will appeal and the Supreme Court could weigh in. Meanwhile, 35 people have been charged in a massive Medicare scam targeting seniors involving kick backs and bribes to doctors who then send patients to expansive genetic testing companies. The tests were unnecessary and many clients never received their results but their Medicare accounts were billed. The Justice Department says the scam cost the Medicare program more than $2 billion in bogus charges. I'm Jackie Ibanez, now back to “The Ingraham Angle,” for all of your headlines, log on to foxnews.com."

Now, many in the city feel that that kind of deflection from Mayor Lori Lightfoot doesn't do a lot to help the continued scourge of gun violence and end it. As we mentioned earlier, we asked the mayor to appear, but like her predecessor, Rahm Emmanuel, she declined. But that doesn't mean the folks of Chicago won't seek solutions on their own, and two of them looking to flip the political script in this city and in the state join me now. Jesus Solorio is the state chairman of the Hispanic Republican Assembly of Illinois. He's also running for Republican Ward Committeeman. And Dr. Willie Wilson, a Chicago businessman who is running against Dick Durbin for the Senate. Dr. Wilson, it is great to see you. And Jesus, thank you so much for being here."

You've worked your tail off, incredible work. But your son, Omar, was tragically shot and killed within 24 hours of being released from prison. Now, you didn't even want to bail them out, but eventually you relented. He was released from prison, 24 hours later he was dead. You named your business after him, Omar Medical Supplies. And you're here today to tell us what can we do and what can you do and others in the business community to try to give these kids a way out of the life of drugs and gangs?"

      "utterance": "I think what you have to do is that we have to bring economic development, jobs, contracts, things of that nature. We have to put our family, our kids first. The city has made an investment, but they haven't made the investment within the African- American community or Latino communities as they do other communities, right? It you changed this whole situation around, it would be different. Now, I have nothing against sanctuary cities or nothing like that, but if you're going to invest in a sanctuary city, invest into your city you have right now today with black folks and Latino folks."

They're not going to help. That does not help Chicago. I have to take issue with you, but that's not helping make life easier for police or the people. They have enough problem with gangs. They don't need any more problems."

General crime has gone down in the state, as it has in the country since about the 80s, but crime is disproportionately affecting the minority communities. And I think Dr. Wilson is getting at that as well. What could be done, what could you do as a Latino, a Republican, wants to get to politics -- this is a Democrat state, run by Democrats, it's been run by Democrats for decades and decades in Chicago."

And what I would like to encourage the new mayor is to come and speak to us, right, because we are in these communities, we're being affected by crime -- we're being affected by the high taxes and the corruption that's going on. We may be a small number, but we are a constituency that have ideas, right. We believe in limited government, we believe in low taxes, like Dr. Wilson said. We need economic opportunities. And I think that's what's been missing from the Democratic platform. We need jobs."

It landed us in prison, but there's a lot worse things than prison, like an early grave. I want to be the solution and not the problem when I return back to society.

And so our programming begins with the idea that re- entry begins prerelease. And Pastor Winston started with this declaration that we're going to turn jails into boarding schools. And so we've taken that concept and with that marshaled all of the resources at Living Word Christian Center Prison Ministry and Living Word Christian Center has and taken them into the jails. So it's not just our ministers that go in. It's also professionals that have expertise that go in and teach business and leadership, financial literacy, critical thinking and decision-making skills, to a population that is oftentimes left out, misunderstood, and deemed to be lost.

When you hear about it out when you're not really focusing on this issue, you might think, these are convicts. They have to do their time. We're babying them. But I think what you see, those two men, very well spoken. They don't want kids to get in the cycle of violence, and citing fatherhood, men, and what our previous guests said, to learn to be a man today. Where are you learning your skills? All of us, those types of skills, to be a woman, to be a man, who is your role model? That's inspiring."

In our society, we need to have individuals who are incarcerated who are being inspired, not only being inspired, but also inspiring others to live a better life. It's important that we have mentors that are coming alongside. It's important we have churches like our church that is trying to minister to the marginalized. We have a not-for-profit called Project Hood, helping others attain a destiny. And it's all about focusing on individuals, making sure that they get jobs and not going to jail. Making sure that they replace their guns with hammers. Making sure that they get jobs and opportunities and contracts, because we believe when individuals have those opportunities, they can turn their lives around.
