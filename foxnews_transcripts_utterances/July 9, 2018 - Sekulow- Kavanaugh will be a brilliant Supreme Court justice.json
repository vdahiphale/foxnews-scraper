Court of Appeals. John Roberts was from the D.C. Circuit, as was Antonin Scalia, Judge Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Warren Burger, so many famous Supreme Court justices come from the D.C. Circuit. A lot of people thought, maybe it won't be Brett Kavanaugh because he is an alumnus of the George W. Bush White House, and, of course, the Bush family and the Trumps don't particularly get along. But George W. Bush sent a note out tonight on the nomination to the Supreme Court saying, President Trump has made an outstanding decision in nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Brett is a brilliant jurist. He has faithfully applied the Constitution and laws to his 12 years of the D.C. Circuit. He's a fine husband, father and friend and a man of the highest integrity.

They will start, and it's already started, the smearing, besmirching and fear-mongering and assassinating the character of Judge Kavanaugh. You saw him and his family tonight.

For now the second time in less than two years, President Trump has selected a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. And just moments ago, the president picked Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace the outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Of course, this was not a surprise. In an unprecedented move, Judge Kavanaugh was selected from a previously released list of 25 originalist justices, making this just one more example of how this president is most transparent president in history and also keeping a clear promise to the American people. Now, clearly, this was not a decision that the president took lightly. Now, President Trump -- in many ways, there's political aspects to this and he had to thread a political needle. And by the way, he has to think about senators like Collins and Murkowski, and then on the other side, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky. In other words, pick a judge with a very narrow margin in the U.S. Senate who could also successfully maneuver through confirmation hearing and garner the votes from a majority of senators. Without a doubt, Justice Kavanaugh is an extremely good candidate. Educated at Yale, Kavanaugh clerk under Justice Anthony Kennedy, just like Neil Gorsuch in the 1990s. He served as an associate counsel for Ken Starr, that of course during the investigation into then President Bill Clinton during that time. It's interesting Kavanaugh did push a controversial opinion that Bill Clinton had in fact obstructed justice by sometimes making false public statements or sending surrogates out to do such about Starr's investigation. Judge Kavanaugh in a very interesting piece that he talked about in 2009 he did changed course, and he publicly changed his opinion on the issue of obstruction in what was a very powerful article that was in the Minnesota law review. We'll go over that in more details. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In 2006 he was appointed by George W. Bush to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit, where he amassed a lengthy record of very key important decisions. It's considered one of the most important courts in the land including multiple opinions against the overreach of then President Obama's EPA. Other opinions that in fact, bolstered our Second Amendment rights. One point of concern was Judge Kavanaugh's mixed track record on one issue, Obamacare. But after years on the D.C. court of appeals, what is his originalist and constitutional's track record is fairly extensive and fairly robust. And by the way, to all of you never-Trumpers out there all across America, you tried so hard to prevent the Trump presidency. Are you happy tonight at all? Can you admit you're wrong at all? Are you happy about let's see. Tax cuts, promises made and promises kept? Are you happy that this was not Hillary Clinton tonight appointing a judicial activist or a left-wing activist to the Supreme Court? Are you happy you don't have too radical justices on the Supreme Court? Would you rather have Hillary Rodham Clinton making this decision tonight? Now in moment we're going to give more analysis of Judge Kavanaugh. It is also important to review the extreme measures that the left in America will take in order to besmirch the reputation of Judge Kavanaugh and also his family that you saw tonight. It's a story as old as time, for decades, every single solitary nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court by a Republican president has been met with the same destructive tactics from the Democratic Party. Now regardless of who was nominated, regardless of what their qualifications, regardless of their track record, even an adherence to the U.S. Constitution, the foundation of our laws in this, of course, republic that we live in, a constitutional republic. You have the left, you have Democrats and their friends in the media that their echo chamber always conducting what was a malicious campaign to impugn the character of good people, the track record of good people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Frankly, anybody that President Trump would have nominated to the Supreme Court. The language gets downright apocalyptic and this time is no different. Let's just go back, let's take a look at how the left was treating President Trump's nomination before the announcement tonight. It is really bordering on insanity. Watch this.",

Most Democrats will never accept that they lost the election and that President Trump is appointing somebody who believes in infidelity to the Constitution, that believes in separation of powers, that interprets U.S. law based on the clear and written intent of our founders and the clear and written law, as written by a separate branch of government. In other words, the legislative branch. And values and alienable rights in our Constitution. Above all else, someone that believes in these very important constitutional principles, separation of powers and co-equal branches of government. Instead the left, what do they want?

Now my advice to the American people, they are going to lie to you, that's what they do. You have to listen to your own heart and mind, do your own research. We will be presenting as much information as we can on this program. The Democrats trying to lie for political gain and as always, an originalist, a constitutionalist, an appointment such as this to the Supreme Court strengthens the foundation of this country, the original intent of our founders and of our framers. The world is not coming to an end, just as it did not come to an end after the successful appointment of Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito, or Neil Gorsuch. We will have much more analysis coming up in the show. Now let's turn to the deep state. I want to tell you about two breaking stories that will blow your mind. Trump hating former FBI lawyer Lisa Page has officially been subpoenaed. She is going to appear before a closed-door congressional hearing this Wednesday. And by the way, after days of legal hedging, Lisa Page's one-time boyfriend, the disgraced Trump hating FBI agent Peter Strzok he will testify. You will get to see it before the House judiciary and oversight committees. That will be live right here on Fox this Thursday. It will be public and it will be explosive. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And of course, Strzok is the high ranking agent at the heart of this effort to clear Hillary Clinton of all charges, all while opening up a subsequent witch hunt into Donald Trump and so-called Trump-Russia collusion. So now this Thursday, also Strzok will be forced to answer for his extreme bias and more importantly, be force to answer questions about the culture of the FBI and what role political prejudice played in the FBI decisions in 2016 and beyond. By the way, one other note, the show is hitting the road later this week to cover all the breaking developments with the president's trip to Brussels, and London and then of course Helsinki, and of course the important negotiations with NATO and meeting Vladimir Putin. We'll get to all of that. But joining us, first we want to check in.

It's not complicated but it's profound and worth repeating. The judge's job is to interpret the law, not to make the law or make policy. Read the words of the statute as written. Read the text of the Constitution as written mindful of history and tradition. Don't make up new Constitutional rights that are not in the text of the Constitution. Don't shy away from enforcing constitutional rights that are in the text of the Constitution. Changing the Constitution is for an amendment process and changing, by the way, policy within constitutional balance is for the legislative branch. Remember, that the structure of the Constitution, separation of powers and federalism are not mere matters of etiquette and architecture, but are at least as essential to protecting individual liberty as the individual rights guaranteed in that text. And remember, that courts have a crucial critical role when a party has standing and enforcing those separation of powers and federalism limits. Simple, but profound. And then he went on to talk about the 10 principles. As he says, separation of powers. The system is to be an umpire as a judge and it means to follow the law, not remake the law and to be impartial about how we go about doing that. A good umpire should not be making up the strike zone as he or she goes along. Judges likewise should not make up the rules as they go along. We see this in statutory interpretation. A good judge sticks to the established test and tenants of construction that help guide us and interpreting ambiguous texts. And he talk about Scalia's view of that. Your reaction.",

Circuit Court of Appeals. So, as they open the doors here of the East Room, with the Cross Hall in the background, we expect to see the president, as well as judge and, soon to be, if the president gets his way, Justice Brett Kavanaugh walk up. He is a veteran of the D.C. Court of Appeals, often called the farm team for the Supreme Court. So many different I have to get down here, so many different justices, current and past, from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. There are a lot of people who thought that this was maybe too much of an establishment choice, that maybe he should have gone with Amy Coney Barrett, but the intelligence that I've been getting all day today, Sean, is that Amy Coney Barrett might have been a difficult confirmation this year. The next time around, if another justice steps down while the president is still sitting in the Oval Office, Amy Coney Barrett would likely be his next choice -- Sean."

We have folks on all sides of every issue out here jostling, demonstrating and chanting and not reacting to the pick that we have come Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He actually was a clerk for Justice Kennedy, actually a co- clerk with the man who is now the new justice, Neil Gorsuch. So, they may serve on this bench together now. He's a graduate of Yale. He's been on the bench, the federal bench for 12 years or so because now there's going to be a very long record for people to go through, sifting through his opinions, his decisions, his majority opinions, his dissent, and he's weighed in on a number of tough issues. One area to watch for a possible Republican objection, Senator Rand Paul, because this judge has ruled that bulk metadata collection does not violate the Fourth Amendment. That's something that Rand Paul expresses concern about, but he's got to win the 50 votes. He's got to make the rounds. He's going to start that on the Hill tomorrow. This is a guy who has run the Boston Marathon twice and so, he actually knows about running the gauntlet. Endurance, he's going to need getting through this because there are plenty of objections from the left, from folks who said from the beginning they would object to anyone this president nominated. So, now, we have the name. He will begin the gauntlet tomorrow. It is Brett Kavanaugh. He's got detractors on the left and right. He's got plenty of supporters. He's been vetted by the Federalist Society and Heritage. They say that they are confident in his conservative credentials. And so, we'll see, as he goes through the process. Sean, back to you."

I think there were a lot of people who thought that he was the perfect person for the job, with a long history, one of the most powerful circuit courts of appeal in the United States, the D.C. Court of Appeals. John Roberts was from the D.C. Circuit, as was Antonin Scalia, Judge Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Warren Burger, so many famous Supreme Court justices come from the D.C. Circuit. A lot of people thought, maybe it won't be Brett Kavanaugh because he is an alumnus of the George W. Bush White House, and, of course, the Bush family and the Trumps don't particularly get along. But George W. Bush sent a note out tonight on the nomination to the Supreme Court saying, President Trump has made an outstanding decision in nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Brett is a brilliant jurist. He has faithfully applied the Constitution and laws to his 12 years of the D.C. Circuit. He's a fine husband, father and friend and a man of the highest integrity. He will make a superb justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He's got an interesting story that the president really likes. Love the fact that his daughters call him Coach K. Now, they are on to the nomination -- now they're on the confirmation process, rather, Sean, and you know that is going to be a bruising one."

Donald Trump carried that state by 41 points, not by 10 or 20, but 41 points. Now, Joe Manchin is facing the voters in that same state. A couple quick points. The left is going to oppose this nomination. They're going to come out hard. They already are. I know Father Ensler, who is mentioned, John Ensler, that Judge Kavanaugh mentioned in Washington, D.C. He runs Catholic Charities. Judge Kavanaugh is somebody with a beautiful family. He works with Father Ensler to feed the homeless. And, oh, by the way, he noted that he was hired to teach at Harvard Law School by Elena Kagan who is one of the most liberal Supreme Court justices we've ever seen. So, my point is twofold. One, Judge Kavanaugh, a great family, strong Catholic faith, he's feeding the homeless with Father Ensler. He's hired by Elena Kagan, a liberal justice to teach at Harvard Law. Nonetheless, the left will still find ways to go after his credentials. Number two, this president likes people, nominee is out of central casting. He needed a defense secretary. He said to get me Mad Dog Mattis. He didn't like Tillerson at first, get me Mike Pompeo. He's my vision of the secretary of state. In this case, notice the president said, he teaches at Harvard, Yale and Georgetown -- central casting. It's going to be very hard to beat. Final point, the president has been telling people in recent days, Amy Coney Barrett is not out of the running. She's 46. Kavanaugh is 53. Give her a few years on the bench. If this president --"

This is now the second time in 18 months the president will have and has the opportunity to send a judge to the highest court in the land. This is a lifetime position. This is a move that will shake the makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court now for decades and, frankly, generations to come. Now, all throughout the night, we will analyze the background, the judicial philosophy, which is so important, of Judge of Brett Kavanaugh, and we'll also show you all the ways predictably that the Democrats will try to obstruct, once again, the president's -- what is his constitutional duty. They will start, and it's already started, the smearing, besmirching and fear-mongering and assassinating the character of Judge Kavanaugh. You saw him and his family tonight. You heard him in his own words tonight. We have over 300 opinions that he has written. He's considered a brilliant judicial mind. And also tonight, we have the biased, corrupt, anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok. We're just giving you a preview of what's coming up. This is one of the busiest news weeks we will have. Strzok will testify in public on Thursday. Also, Lisa Page behind closed doors on Wednesday. And we also, as the president now heads to Brussels and London, and then, of course, Helsinki to meet with Vladimir Putin. We will be in all three locations and covering all of it for you. This is going to be one of the busiest news cycles in years, so we hope you'll set tuned. But first, tonight's breaking news -- yes, we have a new Supreme Court justice nominee. Monologue is straight ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. We're going to talk to Jay Sekulow, the president's attorney, the chief counsel to the American Center of Law and Justice. Besides making a call, a president to send American troops into harm's way, this is now the most important decision a sitting president can make. For now the second time in less than two years, President Trump has selected a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. And just moments ago, the president picked Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace the outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Of course, this was not a surprise. In an unprecedented move, Judge Kavanaugh was selected from a previously released list of 25 originalist justices, making this just one more example of how this president is most transparent president in history and also keeping a clear promise to the American people. Now, clearly, this was not a decision that the president took lightly. Now, President Trump -- in many ways, there's political aspects to this and he had to thread a political needle. And by the way, he has to think about senators like Collins and Murkowski, and then on the other side, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky. In other words, pick a judge with a very narrow margin in the U.S. Senate who could also successfully maneuver through confirmation hearing and garner the votes from a majority of senators. Without a doubt, Justice Kavanaugh is an extremely good candidate. Educated at Yale, Kavanaugh clerk under Justice Anthony Kennedy, just like Neil Gorsuch in the 1990s. He served as an associate counsel for Ken Starr, that of course during the investigation into then President Bill Clinton during that time. It's interesting Kavanaugh did push a controversial opinion that Bill Clinton had in fact obstructed justice by sometimes making false public statements or sending surrogates out to do such about Starr's investigation. Judge Kavanaugh in a very interesting piece that he talked about in 2009 he did changed course, and he publicly changed his opinion on the issue of obstruction in what was a very powerful article that was in the Minnesota law review. We'll go over that in more details. In 2006 he was appointed by George W. Bush to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit, where he amassed a lengthy record of very key important decisions. It's considered one of the most important courts in the land including multiple opinions against the overreach of then President Obama's EPA. Other opinions that in fact, bolstered our Second Amendment rights. One point of concern was Judge Kavanaugh's mixed track record on one issue, Obamacare. But after years on the D.C. court of appeals, what is his originalist and constitutional's track record is fairly extensive and fairly robust. And by the way, to all of you never-Trumpers out there all across America, you tried so hard to prevent the Trump presidency. Are you happy tonight at all? Can you admit you're wrong at all? Are you happy about let's see. Tax cuts, promises made and promises kept? Are you happy that this was not Hillary Clinton tonight appointing a judicial activist or a left-wing activist to the Supreme Court? Are you happy you don't have too radical justices on the Supreme Court? Would you rather have Hillary Rodham Clinton making this decision tonight? Now in moment we're going to give more analysis of Judge Kavanaugh. It is also important to review the extreme measures that the left in America will take in order to besmirch the reputation of Judge Kavanaugh and also his family that you saw tonight. It's a story as old as time, for decades, every single solitary nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court by a Republican president has been met with the same destructive tactics from the Democratic Party. Now regardless of who was nominated, regardless of what their qualifications, regardless of their track record, even an adherence to the U.S. Constitution, the foundation of our laws in this, of course, republic that we live in, a constitutional republic. You have the left, you have Democrats and their friends in the media that their echo chamber always conducting what was a malicious campaign to impugn the character of good people, the track record of good people. Frankly, anybody that President Trump would have nominated to the Supreme Court. The language gets downright apocalyptic and this time is no different. Let's just go back, let's take a look at how the left was treating President Trump's nomination before the announcement tonight. It is really bordering on insanity. Watch this."

And by the way, he was never confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court in large part because of what was lying and fear mongering and just frankly, smearing, by people such as Senator Ted Chappaquiddick Kennedy.

      "utterance": "It has already begun right now, by Democrats, to Judge Kavanaugh and to his family. As we speak, it didn't matter who the president would have picked. And by the way, if you ever want to read a fantastic book, \"My Grandfather's Son,\" it was written by Justice Thomas. Amazing book. An amazing family. Amazing life story. And as we speak, you have this all-out effort to Bork Judge Kavanaugh in full swing. Most Democrats will never accept that they lost the election and that President Trump is appointing somebody who believes in infidelity to the Constitution, that believes in separation of powers, that interprets U.S. law based on the clear and written intent of our founders and the clear and written law, as written by a separate branch of government. In other words, the legislative branch. And values and alienable rights in our Constitution. Above all else, someone that believes in these very important constitutional principles, separation of powers and co-equal branches of government. Instead the left, what do they want? They prefer Hillary's choices. Judicial activists, people that will legislate from the bench. People that would even go as far as not rely on the Constitution but even use international law to justify their activist decisions, superseding our own Constitution. Activist justices often creating law instead of interpreting the law and interpreting the Constitution. And given their Democratic friends, well, perfect cover for having to vote on many controversial left-wing issues that they would never get at the ballot box or legislatively. Now because Judge Kavanaugh is not Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Justice Sotomayor. Get ready, hold tight, buckle up. Democrats are about to tell you, as they have been saying for 12 days now, the sky is going to fall. The world as you know it is going to end. And they want you to believe. They will lie to you. They want you to believe Judge Kavanaugh is going to lead, OK, just like Republicans. The dirty air, the dirty water, the rise of, let's see -- racism, sexism, misogynism, et cetera, et cetera. And by the way, that America will cease to exist as we know it. Now my advice to the American people, they are going to lie to you, that's what they do. You have to listen to your own heart and mind, do your own research. We will be presenting as much information as we can on this program. The Democrats trying to lie for political gain and as always, an originalist, a constitutionalist, an appointment such as this to the Supreme Court strengthens the foundation of this country, the original intent of our founders and of our framers. The world is not coming to an end, just as it did not come to an end after the successful appointment of Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito, or Neil Gorsuch. We will have much more analysis coming up in the show. Now let's turn to the deep state. I want to tell you about two breaking stories that will blow your mind. Trump hating former FBI lawyer Lisa Page has officially been subpoenaed. She is going to appear before a closed-door congressional hearing this Wednesday. And by the way, after days of legal hedging, Lisa Page's one-time boyfriend, the disgraced Trump hating FBI agent Peter Strzok he will testify. You will get to see it before the House judiciary and oversight committees. That will be live right here on Fox this Thursday. It will be public and it will be explosive. And of course, Strzok is the high ranking agent at the heart of this effort to clear Hillary Clinton of all charges, all while opening up a subsequent witch hunt into Donald Trump and so-called Trump-Russia collusion. So now this Thursday, also Strzok will be forced to answer for his extreme bias and more importantly, be force to answer questions about the culture of the FBI and what role political prejudice played in the FBI decisions in 2016 and beyond. By the way, one other note, the show is hitting the road later this week to cover all the breaking developments with the president's trip to Brussels, and London and then of course Helsinki, and of course the important negotiations with NATO and meeting Vladimir Putin. We'll get to all of that. But joining us, first we want to check in. He is the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, he is also counsel to the president, and one great attorney that I know from personal experience. Jay Sekulow is with us.

      "utterance": "The president and his appointee took our time. But I want to read this to you. This was in 2006. This is by Judge Kavanaugh. And he actually said this, and I think it goes to the heart of judicial philosophy. And he said there was a conference at George Mason law school. He said, what Justice Scalia, what did he stand for as a judge? It's not complicated but it's profound and worth repeating. The judge's job is to interpret the law, not to make the law or make policy. Read the words of the statute as written. Read the text of the Constitution as written mindful of history and tradition. Don't make up new Constitutional rights that are not in the text of the Constitution. Don't shy away from enforcing constitutional rights that are in the text of the Constitution. Changing the Constitution is for an amendment process and changing, by the way, policy within constitutional balance is for the legislative branch. Remember, that the structure of the Constitution, separation of powers and federalism are not mere matters of etiquette and architecture, but are at least as essential to protecting individual liberty as the individual rights guaranteed in that text. And remember, that courts have a crucial critical role when a party has standing and enforcing those separation of powers and federalism limits. Simple, but profound. And then he went on to talk about the 10 principles. As he says, separation of powers. The system is to be an umpire as a judge and it means to follow the law, not remake the law and to be impartial about how we go about doing that. A good umpire should not be making up the strike zone as he or she goes along. Judges likewise should not make up the rules as they go along. We see this in statutory interpretation. A good judge sticks to the established test and tenants of construction that help guide us and interpreting ambiguous texts. And he talk about Scalia's view of that. Your reaction."

      "utterance": "Well, look, Brett Kavanaugh is a brilliant lawyer. Judge Kavanaugh has been and continues to be a brilliant judge and he is going to be, Justice Kavanaugh, a brilliant justice of the Supreme Court. I have had the privilege of litigating cases before the Supreme Court for three decades including the time that Anthony Kennedy was on the bench until his retirement. And I've known Brett Kavanaugh both in private practice on cases and as a judge. And the president has just nominated not only a well-qualified and brilliant jurist, but someone as you just said, Sean, that understands the role of the judge. And that's critical. If you understand the Constitution you understand the three branches of government, but you also understand the role of the judge. Brett Kavanaugh has lived that out in his life both in his practice and as a judge and he will be an excellent addition to the Supreme Court. And Sean, you heard it tonight in his brief statements that Brett made. The fact of the matter is, they are going to come after him, because that's what they do. They won't lay a glove on him. This is guy that has been ready for this moment for a long time. He's not only well-trained, not only brilliant but he's also someone that understands as I said his role as a textualist as what the Constitution requires of a judge. He's going to call them as he sees them. He's not going to come in with preconceived notions but he's also had 300 opinions. He's heard a lot of cases and made a lot of decisions. So I'm very optimistic and very pleased with this selection."

      "speaker": "SEKULOW",

Look, any judge is not going -- if they are doing their job correctly will not prejudge the outcome of a case that is likely to come before them. And Judge -- Justice Ginsburg was right when she said it, you shouldn't be answering those questions. What they want to know from a nominee is where they stand on their view of the Constitution and their role as judge. And Brett Kavanaugh understands exactly what role he has under article three of the United States Constitution. As I've said, you know, Justice Scalia famously said, a good judge will sometimes come to a conclusion although he doesn't agree with the result, but understands the application and he is required to follow the law even if he would rather see it go in different way."

Democratic presidents never get it wrong, they always get the judicial activists. There is, I think -- I loved what I read, the words of Judge Kavanaugh, and I loved what I heard tonight.

Is that for some reason they think that the United States Supreme Court is not about the Constitution but instead, you know, they see it as a place as a political court, where they are overreaching, or they are activist judges should be able to make the law the way they think it should be.
