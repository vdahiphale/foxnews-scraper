Now, have you heard the name of Pierce Corcoran? On December 29, he was killed by a suspected illegal immigrant driving without a license, without insurance and on the wrong side of the highway. Pierce was only 22 years old.

How many of our fellow citizens have been murdered because of unsecured borders? Now, if that's not a national emergency, I don't know how he would ever define one. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, this emergency is taking place on both sides of the border.  Here are the facts: 60,000 inadmissible or illegal immigrants are turned away from our borders every single month. A record number of migrants are overwhelming American detention facilities causing them to be dangerously overcrowded and one out of every three migrant women, those who try to make the trip to our southern border sadly, tragically, evil occurs and they are assaulted sexually. And last month alone, 20,000 children were smuggled or traffic right here into the United States and thousands more have died on that arduous, difficult, hard journey across the border. President Trump was long warned about this incredibly serious situation but, what was Nancy Pelosi's reaction to devastating facts? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to the Fox News during a briefing with our Homeland Secretary Nielsen, Pelosi said, I reject your facts, to which Nielsen responded, quote, these aren't my facts, these are the facts, during recent border negotiations. All right. So, this weekend, the vice president Pence, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, well, they didn't bother to show up for the vice president.  Instead, Nancy and Chuck, they were too busy. They sent their aides to negotiate with the vice president of the United States. That's how seriously they are taking what is now a deadly issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, of course, arrogantly offering, oh, we'll give you a dollar for the border wall. Well, if that's their attitude, Nancy Pelosi's, is she going to offer the families who lost loved ones any financial compensation?  Is that how we now define compassion and that liberalism? What does she have to say to all the angel moms and angel dads and kids? What will she say when Officer Singh's son is 16 years old or looking going into college? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We showed you the numbers. Drugs are pouring across our borders, leading to even more death and more destruction. This is not about the 98 percent of people that want a better life, because they come from countries of poverty and want opportunity and freedom that we all take for granted. We are not worried about them. We are just asking that they come legally.  It's about the 2 percent, those that are committing crimes, human trafficking and drug trafficking, violent offenders. But even the thousands of good honest immigrants coming across our border because they do want a better life are -- they trafficked themselves.  Human trafficking, assaults happened, even killed during that dangerous trek all through Mexico. Without a doubt, this is a national emergency, it's time to build the wall. The president is right to fight to protect American lives. But how do you negotiate with people? They won't even sit down. They send their aides to negotiate with the vice president. People who won't even recognize that the problem that exists, people who reject truth and simple facts and care more about political optics than the lives and the well-being of Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And while Democrats try their best to ignore very real, serious crises, continue to obsess about one of their favorite fantasies. All they want to talk about, Donald Trump, impeachment, Donald Trump, impeachment, which is we explained last week is not going to happen. Now, in the Senate, they won't get two-thirds of Republican senators. All they will do is distract and divide the American people and they won't be serving their constituents. As to one day after being sworn in, freshman Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib went on a vulgar grant vowing to impeach the MF-er, the president. Over the weekend, she doubled down on her idiotic remarks, once again calling for his impeachment, said that Trump has, quote, \"met his match.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The radical far left, and the new Congress is off to a great start. Their new rising star, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is continuing to try and sell America on this far left, radical vision for America, portraying socialism as some sort of path to paradise, arguing that we should let facts get in the way.

Comments including, quote, kick his cane, snipe his ass. Wow. And now following that incident, Congressman Scalise tweeted, quote, well, happy to continue this debate on the floor of the people's house, but it's clearly not productive to engage here with some of your radical followers.  #Stayclassy.

What they've been telling us for the past two years, the Hollywood left, is that the reason they've stooped so low, the reason they're so vulgar, the reason they're so hateful, is because of Donald Trump.

Now, in the past two years alone, criminal aliens -- they have been responsible for approximately, look at this number -- 235,000 violation or less of the law, including 4,000 homicides, 30,000 sex crimes and get this, over 100,000 violent assaults. In just 2018, 17,000 individuals with criminal records, they were apprehended at the border and the crisis goes much, much deeper. In towns and cities all across the country, we know about the opioid crisis, 300 Americans are killed every single week from heroin, 90 percent of that heroin is flooding across our southern border, and that death toll by the way is equal -- think about this -- to the number of American troops killed every week in Vietnam during the year 1968, that was the war's deadliest year. And over a ten-year period, total Americans killed from illegal drugs coming across the southern border will be nearly three times higher than the total number of U.S. troops killed in Vietnam. There is your crisis, by any definition. But don't expect to see this on any other network. Of course, Donald Trump wants something and they are just against it. Instead of reporting facts and truths, they seem content with just trashing Trump voters, blaming us for seeing the truth.

This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure. Now, we know the story of Officer Singh. He was gunned down by an illegal immigration just after Christmas. He was just put to rest this weekend.  His 5-month-old son -- he will never know his father. That's life and death. And the person responsible for that heinous attack had a criminal track record. He should have been turned over to ICE. He should have been deported. But in California, well, they have sanctuary cities, but the whole state is a sanctuary state, and those policies prevented that from happening. Government policies are now literally aiding and abetting lawbreaking and paving the way for future crimes. Why do you think the government would act and aid and abet criminals?

Tonight on this show, his parents will join us right after the opening monologue. Also tonight, the American people and the public need to start asking some really important tough questions. How many of our fellow citizens have been murdered because of unsecured borders? Now, if that's not a national emergency, I don't know how he would ever define one."

      "speaker": "And by the way, this emergency is taking place on both sides of the border.  Here are the facts",
      "utterance": "60,000 inadmissible or illegal immigrants are turned away from our borders every single month. A record number of migrants are overwhelming American detention facilities causing them to be dangerously overcrowded and one out of every three migrant women, those who try to make the trip to our southern border sadly, tragically, evil occurs and they are assaulted sexually. And last month alone, 20,000 children were smuggled or traffic right here into the United States and thousands more have died on that arduous, difficult, hard journey across the border. President Trump was long warned about this incredibly serious situation but, what was Nancy Pelosi's reaction to devastating facts? According to the Fox News during a briefing with our Homeland Secretary Nielsen, Pelosi said, I reject your facts, to which Nielsen responded, quote, these aren't my facts, these are the facts, during recent border negotiations. All right. So, this weekend, the vice president Pence, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, well, they didn't bother to show up for the vice president.  Instead, Nancy and Chuck, they were too busy. They sent their aides to negotiate with the vice president of the United States. That's how seriously they are taking what is now a deadly issue. And then, of course, arrogantly offering, oh, we'll give you a dollar for the border wall. Well, if that's their attitude, Nancy Pelosi's, is she going to offer the families who lost loved ones any financial compensation?  Is that how we now define compassion and that liberalism? What does she have to say to all the angel moms and angel dads and kids? What will she say when Officer Singh's son is 16 years old or looking going into college? We showed you the numbers. Drugs are pouring across our borders, leading to even more death and more destruction. This is not about the 98 percent of people that want a better life, because they come from countries of poverty and want opportunity and freedom that we all take for granted. We are not worried about them. We are just asking that they come legally.  It's about the 2 percent, those that are committing crimes, human trafficking and drug trafficking, violent offenders. But even the thousands of good honest immigrants coming across our border because they do want a better life are -- they trafficked themselves.  Human trafficking, assaults happened, even killed during that dangerous trek all through Mexico. Without a doubt, this is a national emergency, it's time to build the wall. The president is right to fight to protect American lives. But how do you negotiate with people? They won't even sit down. They send their aides to negotiate with the vice president. People who won't even recognize that the problem that exists, people who reject truth and simple facts and care more about political optics than the lives and the well-being of Americans. And while Democrats try their best to ignore very real, serious crises, continue to obsess about one of their favorite fantasies. All they want to talk about, Donald Trump, impeachment, Donald Trump, impeachment, which is we explained last week is not going to happen. Now, in the Senate, they won't get two-thirds of Republican senators. All they will do is distract and divide the American people and they won't be serving their constituents. As to one day after being sworn in, freshman Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib went on a vulgar grant vowing to impeach the MF-er, the president. Over the weekend, she doubled down on her idiotic remarks, once again calling for his impeachment, said that Trump has, quote, \"met his match.\" The radical far left, and the new Congress is off to a great start. Their new rising star, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is continuing to try and sell America on this far left, radical vision for America, portraying socialism as some sort of path to paradise, arguing that we should let facts get in the way.

Over the weekend, Congressman Scalise - - he was hit with a wave of extremely disturbing comments from supporters of Ocasio-Cortez during a Twitter exchange on tax reform. Now some are sending violent messages about, remember, the attempted assassination of a GOP congressman by a far left radical James Hodgkinson in 2017, Scalise was shot, nearly died, seriously injured. Comments including, quote, kick his cane, snipe his ass. Wow. And now following that incident, Congressman Scalise tweeted, quote, well, happy to continue this debate on the floor of the people's house, but it's clearly not productive to engage here with some of your radical followers.  #Stayclassy. Congressman Scalise will join us later in the show. Now, of course, this is all part of the Democratic Party's hard turn to the left. A lot of this now is based on hatred. A lot of it is now obsession, fixation, every second, every minute, every hour of every day. Hate Trump. One of the champions of the far left, Elizabeth Warren, she is now seeing her 2020 presidential hopes with her right before her eyes. During a visit to Iowa over the weekend, the progressive hopeful from Massachusetts was again pressed on her now infamous DNA debacle and she has now come up with a brand-new excuse for her Native American lies, telling the audience, quote, \"tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry.\" Senator, just stop while you are ahead and admit it, you were caught deceiving voters, your employers and your friends and everybody else. Now, even your own congressional colleagues, they seem to be taking notice. New report from \"Politico\", Democratic senators, they are keeping their distance and withholding any endorsements, especially as a former vice president, crazy Uncle Joe Biden, is reportedly on the verge of making his final decision on 2020. We'll have a lot more later in the show on all this. But, first, we turn our attention back to the heart wrenching out of Tennessee. Twenty-two-year-old Pierce Corcoran senselessly killed by a suspected illegal. And joining us now are Pierce's parents, DJ and Wendy Corcoran. I don't know -- I've met many angel moms, dads and families in the course of the show. This is all fresh to you. Wendy, we'll start with you. I don't know how any parent deals with this."

And one of the things -- the illegal immigrant in that case had been in the criminal justice system. When you hear that not only are they here illegally which is one thing, but then they were in the justice system.  Then in the case of Officer Singh, they have sanctuary policies that protect them when they are in jail from being handed over to ICE to be deported, then they commit other crimes.

These are just the terror suspects that we know about who reach our borders, and thousands of terror watch list individuals transit our hemisphere each year, including last year, where DHS encountered more than 3,000 special interest aliens, individuals with suspicious travel patterns who may pose a national security threat. Here to discuss, we have Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, and Secret Service agent Dan Bongino. You know what, Geraldo, you and I -- we've come to areas of agreement on this. Border wall, you agreed with me. Finally, I got you to agree. We didn't agree in the beginning. But Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer can't show up for a meeting for the vice president, they think it's funny to offer a dollar for the wall? What are they going to say to these parents of Pierce Corcoran that I just interviewed? And their son is dead. Or the people that also aid and abet these people with their sanctuary cities and their sanctuary states, criminal aliens in our custody that are not handed over to ICE.

We shouldn't tolerate either side, our friends or our enemies in a political debate to encourage or incite a violence against another person. And so, look, I was having a good debate about whether or not they should confiscate 70% of people's taxes at a marginal tax rate that I think is ridiculous and it's beyond. She talks about Sweden and these other socialist countries. Sweden, I think, has the highest European rate and theirs is about 61%. She doesn't think that's enough. She wants to go to 70%, and probably wouldn't stop there. And I thought it was an important debate to go back and forth on and then you saw some of that stuff. And I said, look, I'm not going to - I'm not going to engage in that kind of violence."

And Nancy Pelosi - well, she didn't seem to care very much about it. Then you have Congressman Hank Johnson comparing the President to Hitler and then you have other people on Hate Trump TV, \"he needs his diaper changed\". Look, I'm not offended by words like so many others feign to be. But when it talks about violence, it gets to a line that, I think, we have a responsibility to call out."

There are limits. And when you incite violence against someone else, that's not the way we act in this country. And so, if you want to debate the merits then go ahead, that's what's great about this country. Frankly, if you're losing the debate, that's when you usually have to resort to name-calling and that's why so many on the left want to call names to Donald Trump, as opposed to try to argue whether or not we should have a secure border. They don't want secure borders, but they don't want --"

People that want to come here legally, there are a lot of legal ways to come here, and we still are the most generous nation in the world in letting people come to this country legally. But you also see there's a dark side of people who want to bring drugs into our country. Last year ICE agents saved 900 children from human trafficking and sexual assault. It's really going on. We need to secure the border. And by the way you saw Chuck Schumer for this in 2006 when Donald Trump wasn't President. Now he's President--"

They do this like every other week at this time of year. It was the 76th Golden Globe Awards, tinsel town's finest managed. They finally managed to avoid directly attacking the President at the ceremony. But actor Christian Bale, oh, he thanks Satan in his acceptance speech for inspiring his role as Dick Cheney and the movie \"Vice\" that nobody really went to. Take a look."

And now with reaction, we have Conservative Commentator, Allie Stuckey, and The Hill's Joe Concha. Allie, let me just go down the greatest hits.

Well, I think that Christian Bale's statement really - what it typifies what Hollywood feels about conservatives and about religion, especially Christianity. They think it's laughable. They mock it, and they also hate it. And I think it also shows that their hatred, their vulgarity really has nothing to do with Donald Trump. What they've been telling us for the past two years, the Hollywood left, is that the reason they've stooped so low, the reason they're so vulgar, the reason they're so hateful, is because of Donald Trump. He has lowered the level of discourse. But this movie \"Vice\", which was completely historically inaccurate in mocking George Bush and Dick Cheney, shows that the hatred of conservatives has lasted a long time. And I know we say this a lot, but that is quite literally why Trump won."

He could go up there and talk about his craft or talk about a charity that maybe he supports. I don't know why we always have to go in this direction. But here's the thing, you talked about hate. It's also repetitive as well, Sean's. At a point where people are tuning out, this Golden Globes telecast on NBC, ratings were down from the previous year. Now what makes that remarkable is the fact that they had the Eagles, Bears NFL playoff game as a lead-in, which will get me nightmares until Easter, given the way that game ended. I'm a Bears fan. But you know that 45 million people were watching the end of the Eagles/Bears game, how many stuck around for the Golden Globes? 18 million. In other words, 27 million people after the game said - saw the Golden Globes come on and said, \"I'm not watching, because there's a predisposition that they're probably going to be insulted\". And look, this has been happening for a while now. I'll give you one more number that really puts this all in the context. 1998, The Oscars, how many people tuned in for that? 57 million. And how many tuned in last year 26.5 million. 30 million people gone, because--"
