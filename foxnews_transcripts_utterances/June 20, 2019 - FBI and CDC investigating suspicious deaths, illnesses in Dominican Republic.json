It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Fox News alert, a high stakes meeting with President Trump and congressional leaders just wrapping up at the White House as tensions escalate between the U.S. and Iran. Less than one week after the U.S. accused Iran of using mines to attack oil tankers, Iran now admitting it shot down an unmanned U.S. navy drone last night. Iran claiming the drone violated its air space. The U.S. adamant it was flying over international waters. President Trump not mincing words when asked about it earlier."

I find it hard to believe it was intentional, if you want to know the truth. I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it. This is a new fly in the ointment what happened shooting down the drone, and this country will not stand for it."

It's one thing -- earlier in the week they sabotaged some oil tankers of other -- not U.S. ships, but it still U.S. interests as the president was saying today. So you escalate that when you hit a U.S. drone, $180 million, and that's real money. It was unmanned."

We've been here before with Iran, going back even to Ronald Reagan days, operation praying mantis. I don't know if you remember that, but I actually knew a little bit about it. The difference between then and now is we have something -- we've talked about the show before, but we don't actually -- you're not able to see this weapon and that is cyber, cyber capabilities. Iran is actually pretty good, and we are better. So it could be -- when the president asked how you respond, he says you'll soon find out. I wouldn't be surprised if the United States had in some way already responded but in a way that you can't see. In a way that might be crippling to some part of the -- like send a message."

Because we don't want war, but you can't do this to us. But still someone did it."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes. And someone has to be held accountable. Juan, so we've already hit Iran with crippling sanctions, the Trump administration really knocked out their banking sector as well, their exports of oil, I think, off about 50 percent. Their economy is shrinking. So you think they're just lashing out at the United States to try to divide the Europeans from America just to try to create some sort of wedge there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, this is an important point that you're making, Jesse, because we need the allies at this juncture. Remember, the allies stayed in the Iran deal when the United States, under President Trump, withdrew. And right now a lot of those allies blame the United States for having created this crisis by putting so much pressure on the Iranians that we no longer control the levers of pressure, as we can't up the sanctions because the sanctions are already at a maximum point. Now, the problem today is the president, I think, is in an intriguing political position. The politics of this is he ran as an American first guy."

Others might say he's looking for America's interests first and he's been very clear, enough with these wars and America getting involved with wars, and America intervention. We already have a war in Afghanistan as Nancy Pelosi said. You say it on the side. She said you know what? There's no appetite on the part of the American people for another war. And I think President Trump is in that company. But I'm not sure about John Bolton, his national security adviser. I'm not sure about the Pentagon. When you hire generals, you know, it's like hiring a hammer to ask you what to do with the nail. It says hit the nail."

And in the other hand, he comes out and said, well, it could have been just somebody made a mistake. And so I think lots of people here dissident ideas about what's in the president's mind."

You know it's been going on since 1979, nothing ever changes. And I'm going to steal my talking point from our prompter operator who said as I was leaving. This is now just a video game. And I think that's good news. We're now in a time where it doesn't matter how large your population is because the population is no longer expendable in war. It's now about the machines that you have. Drones are now replacing bones, Jesse."

And if we have the stuff up there, doesn't matter what they have down there. We control them. If we have a sky of drones -- so then, how do you retaliate, right? How do you retaliate to something that isn't human? Like, you know, they took $160 million worth of machinery from us. We have to do that, which means either hitting some parts of their navy or refineries or whatever. You retaliate with machines. But I think it's good news, because I think we're moving away from hurling bodies at bodies. That's a good --"

      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "We should all be deeply concerned at the audacity of this. This drone, obviously, is almost a $2 billion platform. It's also not stealth. It is the size of a 747, which means that their argument, oh, it was in our airspace, absolutely not, because it isn't stealth. So, of course, it was in international airspace because otherwise it would be totally obvious. Clearly, they're escalating their message internally, they're provoking us, and they probably don't think that we're going to respond with strength. And there's many ways that we can do so. Obviously, Dana outlined the cyber capabilities, which is crucial because that kind of trigger the international media exposure, which is so important in these kinds of responses. But there's also the treasury department, they can ramp up their capabilities of choking off the elicit financial mechanisms that support the IRGC. And that's the biggest point here, by the way, is the IRGC. And also, it would behoove us to utilize our support network in Yemen and Syria, and those neighboring countries in terms of -- any type of actions up to aggressive action to kind of targeting those supported networks."

And I think -- and you've got to understand, there's concern that the U.S. would use Saudi Arabia, which is the Iranian's enemy, local enemy, as a proxy in that war. But, of course, the Saudis had used our technology to bomb innocent people in Yemen and others, and the Saudis have a problem with the assassination of Khashoggi. This is so complicated and it's so explosive."

Look everyone, even Spartacus knows what Joe actually meant, that he can work with anyone, even people who held terrible ideas. That's the point. Because, eventually, progress gets made and the proof is they aren't around anymore. But such truths don't matter. If there's one thing we can learn from the Dems and their media overlords, power lies in misinterpreting words in their very worst light. Meaning if I can twist what you say into something evil, you bet I will. That's why everything you say is magically taken out of context and recast as negative and awful. It's why jokes are taken as literal facts. And a patriotic message on a red hat is called hate speech. It's where voicing a need for a border makes you a Nazi because Nazis are now just historical conveniences. Thanks to the modern smear machine, anything you say can and will be used against you, not in the court of law, but in their own twisted court of public opinion. But I don't feel too bad for Joe. He did the very same thing when he smeared Trump in his campaign launch video. Remember that? And now Biden's own party is doing him in. It's no surprise. If the leftist wing can casually smear anyone, then karma is always a stench. Wanted to use the other word but I didn't. I said stench. In case you forgot, Joe has done this to other people. This is what he said about Republicans."

And it's been hard for the other Democrats to figure out how can we take him down. They're finding their moment, and you can bet that this is going to be a big topic next week. And he's got to keep answering things like this over and over again. His pitch for himself is that I am the experienced one, I have the temperament that you want, and I am a moderate deal cutter.

And you can't do that. And I don't doubt the sincerity of Kamala or Cory, but it looks kind of opportunistic. It looks like a cheap shot. And as you said, this is going to be a fight for black voters in the Democrat Party. They make up 25 percent of Democrat primary voters. So it's no surprise that those two people are trying to peel away the black support. But I don't it's going to hurt him with black voters. He just got a slew of endorsements in South Carolina today.

And I think, if anything, it does continue to relay the fact that he's out of touch with current times even if you can argue why are we imposing today's morality on 1972 or 76, or whatever, because it's relevant. And quick secondary point, that I think it's really telling that his staffers are coming out after the fact and anonymously reporting to multiple news sources, ah, we're telling him not to say those gaffes and like, we're telling him not to say these things.

Meanwhile, the FBI is reportedly analyzing alcohol samples from at least one hotel mini bar from a popular resort in the country to see if tainted booze is to blame for a string of tourist deaths. OK. So you guys, government officials are using the hashtag be fair to D.R. to combat this, what they call as I've just said, hysteria.

And the media, I think, can help by shining a spotlight but they can hurt, because the early stages of all this -- nobody knows what's going on, so I sympathize with the Dominican Republic in that.
