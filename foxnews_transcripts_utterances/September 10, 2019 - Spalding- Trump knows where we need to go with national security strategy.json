President Trump is really impatient for results and he's going to change personnel as necessary to achieve them.

He believes that given the fact that the U.S. economy now represents about 20 to 25 percent of the global GDP, we need to maximize our leverage wisely. Trump actually considers how much military missions cost, cost our taxpayers of course their hard earned money and whether they make our life here better and safer at home. Again the Bushes very patriotic people, we honor their service in government but they didn't spend a lot of time worrying about those details. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So looking back on it, is that approach more moral than Trump's when our citizens here drive on roads and bridges that are falling apart. Most voters think we should fix our schools and our airports before we try to fix Syria's.

President's fine with that but then you get on board with whatever he decides, not your decision and if you cannot do that, then step aside for someone who can. Everyone understand? And that's THE ANGLE. All right, here to respond is Retired Brigadier General Robert Spalding and Lieutenant Colonel James Carafano from the Heritage Foundation. James, do you believe that Bolton was actually promoting Trump's America first policies but if that was the case, why is he gone? Well, first of all, my heart's broken here.

In tonight's Judging the Judges segment, we return to the scourge of these nationwide injunctions. Yesterday Obama appointed Judge Jon Tigar defied a federal appellate court to reimpose a nationwide injunction against Trump's new rule for asylum-seekers. This further underscores what Attorney General Barr warned about over the weekend, that \"The framers rejected the idea that the courts should act as a council of revision with sweeping authority to reach beyond concrete controversies and rule on the legality of actions taken by the political branches. These days virtually every significant congressional or presidential initiative is enjoined,\" that means an injunction, \"often within hours, threatening our democratic system and undermining our rule of law.\" That's why we love Bill Barr, by the way. Joining me now is John Yoo, former deputy assistant attorney general. John, what can the Trump administration do to rein in these judges and to push back on these nationwide injunctions, specifically, what can be done?",

The Supreme Court can bring this to a stop right away. In fact, this very case you mentioned coming out of here in San Francisco that's blocking the new asylum rules is actually a perfect vehicle for the Supreme Court to take the case and an end nationwide injunctions. Justice Thomas and the travel ban case in Hawaii versus Trump called on the court last year to do exactly that. And the Trump administration, too, not just seeking emergency review of the district court, they could say, look, we think these district judges are overreading their powers. It's not what the framers intended. And what we are not going to do is we're not going to obey a nationwide injunction outside the territorial boundaries of the court itself, so that means, OK, Judge Tigar here in San Francisco, or even the liberal Ninth Circuit which thought he had gone too far, will obey the rules.

He says the former and released this terse resignation letter dated today to prove it. Trump said he asked for the resignation. Translation fired him last night. But who cares which it was, it was long overdue. Trump allegiance isn't to any particular process or any particular cabinet member but to the people who elected him and to the country at large. He's a true maverick because he came like a freight train at the old GOP foreign policy establishment that had gotten us bogged down and two costly wars as China grew basically unchallenged. Trump promised to bring our troops home from Afghanistan and yet the military and national security officials have mostly resisted him every step of the way on that goal. This frustrates the President to no end. He knows that most Americans don't just want our troops back home but they don't even think the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were with fighting. But the old Bush team of course, they won't take no for an answer despite Obama's election, then Trump's election of course, Obama came in 2008, then Trump in 2016 which represented a bipartisan and total repudiation of the Bush doctrine."

Look at it. 62 percent say Iraq wasn't worth fighting. 59 percent say Afghanistan wasn't worth fighting. So look, contrary to being a sign of chaos, the Bolton news, I think shows a commitment to principle and efficiency. Anyone who can't produce results and anyone who can't get on board with the President's agenda shouldn't be inside working to oppose them or undermine him. H.R. McMaster was canned after some thought he bumbled as national security adviser. Tillerson was a colossal failure at the state department. Price was fired, a very nice man at HHS after making no headway on drug prices. Kirstjen Nielsen was gone when she couldn't manage the border crisis. Sessions was shown the door at DOJ after myriad mistakes including one that lead to the appointment of a Special Counsel. Gary Cohn quit when he lost the debate on tariffs and let's not forget, Scaramucci, he was out of the 10 days as Press Secretary when it became too much mooch and not enough MAGA. President Trump is really impatient for results and he's going to change personnel as necessary to achieve them. I'll take that any day over someone who cavalierly coast on the status quo or doubles down on failure with a swagger. Trump's foreign policy is best described as prudent realism. He believes that given the fact that the U.S. economy now represents about 20 to 25 percent of the global GDP, we need to maximize our leverage wisely. Trump actually considers how much military missions cost, cost our taxpayers of course their hard earned money and whether they make our life here better and safer at home. Again the Bushes very patriotic people, we honor their service in government but they didn't spend a lot of time worrying about those details. So looking back on it, is that approach more moral than Trump's when our citizens here drive on roads and bridges that are falling apart. Most voters think we should fix our schools and our airports before we try to fix Syria's. And right now, Trump has a stellar team in place just to name a few, Secretary of State Pompeo, Attorney General Bill Barr, Bob Lighthizer at trade, never been a trade rep better than he. Steve Mnuchin, at treasury, Alex Azar at HHS, phenomenal. Mark Asper, Acting Secretary Defense, terrific. They all understand their role is to advance the President's agenda, that's the way it works. Sure, you offer your advice and sometimes you debate. President's fine with that but then you get on board with whatever he decides, not your decision and if you cannot do that, then step aside for someone who can. Everyone understand? And that's THE ANGLE. All right, here to respond is Retired Brigadier General Robert Spalding and Lieutenant Colonel James Carafano from the Heritage Foundation. James, do you believe that Bolton was actually promoting Trump's America first policies but if that was the case, why is he gone? Well, first of all, my heart's broken here. I mean, this is like the Captain and Tennille breaking up. I mean I love the Yin and the Yang of Bolton and Trump.

In tonight's Judging the Judges segment, we return to the scourge of these nationwide injunctions. Yesterday Obama appointed Judge Jon Tigar defied a federal appellate court to reimpose a nationwide injunction against Trump's new rule for asylum-seekers. This further underscores what Attorney General Barr warned about over the weekend, that \"The framers rejected the idea that the courts should act as a council of revision with sweeping authority to reach beyond concrete controversies and rule on the legality of actions taken by the political branches. These days virtually every significant congressional or presidential initiative is enjoined,\" that means an injunction, \"often within hours, threatening our democratic system and undermining our rule of law.\" That's why we love Bill Barr, by the way. Joining me now is John Yoo, former deputy assistant attorney general. John, what can the Trump administration do to rein in these judges and to push back on these nationwide injunctions, specifically, what can be done?"

It is seeking to take these cases where a single judge, as you said, is blocking policy throughout the country, usually in districts or cities that are unfavorable to President Trump, and they are seeking emergency review at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court can bring this to a stop right away. In fact, this very case you mentioned coming out of here in San Francisco that's blocking the new asylum rules is actually a perfect vehicle for the Supreme Court to take the case and an end nationwide injunctions. Justice Thomas and the travel ban case in Hawaii versus Trump called on the court last year to do exactly that. And the Trump administration, too, not just seeking emergency review of the district court, they could say, look, we think these district judges are overreading their powers. It's not what the framers intended. And what we are not going to do is we're not going to obey a nationwide injunction outside the territorial boundaries of the court itself, so that means, OK, Judge Tigar here in San Francisco, or even the liberal Ninth Circuit which thought he had gone too far, will obey the rules. I know, it's hard to believe that he went too far for the liberal Ninth Circuit."

He enjoined the policy nationwide. The Ninth Circuit, very liberal circuit, I think it still has something close to a two-to-one majority of Democratic appointed judges, maybe a little less now, sent it back to him and said you can't issue an injunction nationwide. So Judge Tigar just this week said no, the Ninth Circuit is wrong. Actually, I can because there are some groups here in this courtroom of mine that are in multiple states in the country. One is even in Mexico. So therefore I can issue an injunction nationwide. I expect if the Ninth Circuit doesn't slap him down again, this actually will be a case the Supreme Court will take and say no judge has the power to bring the whole government --"

So I hope, kind of like with climate change, although I desperately want these issues to be attacked, I hope you and others keep talking about how silly it is for anybody to tackle gun control, because I think through now and by the 2020 election, that's only going to get suburban educated women are going to be totally turned off."

So women, Richard is right on that, women are more likely to be in favor of gun measures, gun control measures. But we have women who are out there advocating for gun rights now as a result of what's happened as well. I want you to listen to Shannon Watts, what she said."

Women are the largest, fastest growing demographic of gun owners in this country. The thing that they say about wanting to purchase a firearm is because they want to have self-defense for themselves. You saw that story just this week, last week in Houston of a woman, six men trying to shove her into a trunk. She had a gun, defended herself, and saved her life. We have seen that gun-control proposals are actually very elitist, and they target poor women. They target single woman. They target single mothers. They make it expensive and they put them in dangerous situations. We've seen waiting periods for concealed carry permits get them killed as their violent offender husbands or ex-boyfriends gets out of prison and end up assaulting them or killing them."

But Californians, well, I've got to tell you there's hope on the horizon, because the Trump administration is preparing a sweeping plan to get the homeless off the streets of Los Angeles and other cities. It's all part of the president's push to renew urban America. It's music to our ears, and even places, by the way, that didn't vote for him. He's the president of all the people, right? Here with me now for more on this and some other interesting stuff that was happening at the White House, it got no coverage, Ben Carson, secretary of the Housing and Urban Development. Dr. Carson, what can you tell us about what the president's passion here is, and what is his ultimate goal?"

And if you go out there and you see some of those people on the street and you talk to them, many of them simply are not capable of taking care of themselves, and we have to take some responsibility here. Generally, it's the responsibility of the locality, of the city, of the municipality, to take care of people. But if that's not happening, it devolves to another level. So if the city and the state are not taking care of it, the federal government is obviously going to have to do something. And the president is very passionate about doing something about --"

What we really have to do is get to the root cause of the homelessness situation and deal with it. And as I've said before, Tokyo, which has more people than New York City, has no homelessness. One of the left-wing organizations came out and said Carson said there is no homelessness but there's actually 0.019 percent -- they found the two people who were homeless. But we actually have to be serious about dealing with these problems, and it can be done. It's a matter of taking advantage of the tremendous technology we have, removing the barriers --"
