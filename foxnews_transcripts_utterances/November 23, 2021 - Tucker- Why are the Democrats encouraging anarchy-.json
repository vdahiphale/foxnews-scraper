Instead, the media and local authorities have decided to speak for him, and the main thing they want you to know is that these killings had absolutely nothing to do with the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict just two days before. Nothing whatsoever. The timing is just one of those amazing coincidences. Quote: \"There is no evidence that this is a terrorist incident,\" announced Waukesha's Chief of Police. But if indiscriminately murdering women and children at a Christmas Parade isn't terrorism, then what exactly is it? Well, it's a vehicular mishap. Here's how Twitter's in-house news team described it, quote: \"Five people dead and more than 40 injured after car drives through parade.\" \"Car.\" It's the fault of the red SUV. Other news organizations had another explanation handy. It turns out they told us that Brooks was fleeing from a knife fight. And the implication, of course, was that he got spooked and drove through the parade by accident. You know, as you do. Then MSNBC took this theory a step further and suggested the police had somehow goaded Darrell Brooks into driving into people by firing a gun at him. Watch.",

Or they may get cut themselves if it's a knife fight, and they often run with the bloody knife. So, this guy might have been in the car with a bloody knife, blood all over him. He saw the police barricade at the parade route and busted through it. The officer fired and then he was going to do anything he, or they, to get away when he ran over these band members in just an act of really cold- blooded murder.",

Eyewitnesses, many eyewitnesses described Brooks zigzagging down the street trying to murder as many innocent people as he could. These killings were absolutely intentional. And no, Brooks was not being chased by the police. That's a lie. So much for that theory. So the question remains why did Darrell Brooks commit mass murder in Waukesha? The media don't seem interested in finding out, not even a little bit. So they've decided to ignore the story completely. And they are. Subpoenas to Roger Stone from some fake congressional committee are apparently more important than six deaths. Like the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, as far as the national media are concerned, it's simply not happening. The more we learn about Darrell Brooks, the easier it is to understand why the media don't want to talk about him. Brooks's social media feeds are full of racist and Black nationalist propaganda. In one of his rap songs, he includes lines from Malcolm X justifying race-hate against whites. He posted a picture of a fruit bowl arranged to display the letters BLM with a raised fist. And not insignificantly, Brooks also criticized the jury's verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse case. On Facebook, one BLM activist was happy to connect the dots here. He describes Brooks's mass murder, as retaliation for the Rittenhouse acquittal watch.",

So if it turns out those lies, and they are lies, got six people murdered, they will probably be the last to tell us that.

A few weeks ago, probably not surprisingly, he was charged with punching the mother of his latest child in the face and then running her over with his car, so he should have been in jail for that. But the Milwaukee County District Attorney, a radical called John Chisholm, released Brooks on a $1,000.00 bail. So $1,000.00 for beating and running over a woman. Why? Well, because John Chisholm believes that bail is racist. A few years ago, Chisholm acknowledged that letting violent criminals out of jail was certain to cost innocent lives. But, he explained, it's still worth it, because equity. Quote: \"Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into a treatment program, who is going to go out and kill somebody? You bet. Guaranteed. It is guaranteed to happen. It does not invalidate the overall approach.\" In other words, the deaths of innocents, old ladies, small children are a small price to pay because the principle of equity is so beautiful and so important. That is a diseased way of thinking. It's how cult leaders and dictators think. It is not a Western worldview, but suddenly it's a mainstream position within the Democratic Party.

In Italy, in Greece, in France, across Europe, there are massive, massive protests. There has been some violence aimed at protesters in The Netherlands, but tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Europeans are up in arms, saying, you know, we are a free nation, a free continent, we are a free people, and we will not allow these tyrannical measures to be enforced against us. It's not the end of the story, though, because unfortunately, these -- you know, as we've seen in history, when protests have a violent response from the police, that can end or break the back of a protest movement.

I was just at a massive rally to honor first responders who are resisting the vaccine mandates in New York City. This was last Saturday, 15,000 to 20,000 people. In New Hampshire, Melissa Blasek, representative there and her colleagues got a bill out of committee to ban President Biden's vaccine mandates in the State of New Hampshire. Kansas just issued another kind of decision to ban Biden's mandate -- sorry, and you're seeing working people across the country saying no. Truckers are walking off the job. Pilots are grounding flights. They said no. Unions are standing up and saying no, and dozens and dozens of lawsuits have been filed by citizens, by unions, by elected officials, by Attorneys General in over 10 states against the Biden administration. But when you step back, you know, I think you've got to notice that there's a bigger picture here. Never in my lifetime did I imagine that a President would first declare there would be no mandates, right? President Biden said that to us. Dr. Fauci said it. And then, you know, guess what? He didn't mean it. In September, he said there would be forced vaccination with an experimental substance, right? That clinical trials are not over until 2023 in to people who don't want it, right? Including those who might freely choose it. People who have religious objections, people who have health conditions, people who have natural immunity already. And not only am I seeing the President say I'm going to go ahead and force people to be injected against their will, but he is also doing it in an un-American way.

Nothing whatsoever. The timing is just one of those amazing coincidences."

      "utterance": "\"Five people dead and more than 40 injured after car drives through parade.\" \"Car.\" It's the fault of the red SUV. Other news organizations had another explanation handy. It turns out they told us that Brooks was fleeing from a knife fight. And the implication, of course, was that he got spooked and drove through the parade by accident. You know, as you do. Then MSNBC took this theory a step further and suggested the police had somehow goaded Darrell Brooks into driving into people by firing a gun at him. Watch."

    {
      "speaker": "JIM CAVANAUGH, FORMER ATF",
      "utterance": "The report from NBC reporters is that maybe he was in a fight -- a knife fight, an altercation or a stabbing. Well, I've been to stabbings and I'm telling you they're very bloody events. And the perpetrators or the participants often have blood all over them -- even if it's coming from a victim they stabbed. Or they may get cut themselves if it's a knife fight, and they often run with the bloody knife. So, this guy might have been in the car with a bloody knife, blood all over him. He saw the police barricade at the parade route and busted through it. The officer fired and then he was going to do anything he, or they, to get away when he ran over these band members in just an act of really cold- blooded murder."

Eyewitnesses, many eyewitnesses described Brooks zigzagging down the street trying to murder as many innocent people as he could. These killings were absolutely intentional. And no, Brooks was not being chased by the police. That's a lie. So much for that theory. So the question remains why did Darrell Brooks commit mass murder in Waukesha? The media don't seem interested in finding out, not even a little bit. So they've decided to ignore the story completely. And they are. Subpoenas to Roger Stone from some fake congressional committee are apparently more important than six deaths. Like the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, as far as the national media are concerned, it's simply not happening. The more we learn about Darrell Brooks, the easier it is to understand why the media don't want to talk about him. Brooks's social media feeds are full of racist and Black nationalist propaganda. In one of his rap songs, he includes lines from Malcolm X justifying race-hate against whites. He posted a picture of a fruit bowl arranged to display the letters BLM with a raised fist. And not insignificantly, Brooks also criticized the jury's verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse case. On Facebook, one BLM activist was happy to connect the dots here. He describes Brooks's mass murder, as retaliation for the Rittenhouse acquittal watch."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"This has to do with the verdict.\" That's the obvious conclusion. Is it true? Again, we have not confirmed it, but we can be absolutely certain that the national media will spend zero time trying to find out. Why? Because they're implicated. News organizations spent more than a year telling us that a case that had precisely nothing to do with race was somehow a referendum on the civil rights of Black people and the rise of White supremacy. So if it turns out those lies, and they are lies, got six people murdered, they will probably be the last to tell us that. We do know that Darrell Brooks never should have been on the street in the first place, he was a thoroughly loathsome person. Want evidence? Well, watch him here brag about pimping his 16-year-old girlfriend."

A few weeks ago, probably not surprisingly, he was charged with punching the mother of his latest child in the face and then running her over with his car, so he should have been in jail for that. But the Milwaukee County District Attorney, a radical called John Chisholm, released Brooks on a $1,000.00 bail. So $1,000.00 for beating and running over a woman. Why? Well, because John Chisholm believes that bail is racist. A few years ago, Chisholm acknowledged that letting violent criminals out of jail was certain to cost innocent lives.

And what we're seeing now as a result of these screwed up priorities, Tucker, is anarchy, chaos and people getting hurt and loss of life on our streets, and this is a -- you know, you've given a few of these really key examples here and how crazy it is that we have people who are guilty of maybe are accused of petty crimes who pose no threat to the community, locked up in jail, then you have violent felons who are let out. Whether it's a bale of 500 bucks or $5,000.00 or $50,000.00 -- it doesn't matter the amount, they are let out onto our streets continuing their terror sprees. It's crazy."

And then he said he had 2E (ph) letter from the State Attorney, and we weren't able to ask him the tail number so we can submit our FOIA request, which are still being appealed right now so we can get the complete version of that night on the drone video. He wouldn't give us the tail number. We weren't able to ask him what the tail number was because of the 2E (ph) letter that we got the day he testified that, supposedly disappeared from Attorney Natalie Wisco, another great attorney's e-mail.

And then finally, of course, he was well-treated by his own lawyers, the ones he eventually tried the case for him. They did a good job clearly, and he thinks highly of them. But what about the jailers who had him in what was supposed to be the better jail, the one he described as being, you know sort of like a downscale motel, but no running water to the point where he couldn't bathe for the time he was in there. His skin was falling off and he smelled so bad he was apologizing to people who gave him a lift to -- you know, who transported him. Oh my God.

No President should talk like that in a situation like this.

Tony Lyons is the President and publisher of Skyhorse, which is bravely publishing this book. He joins us tonight. Tony, thanks so much for coming on.

Rising freight distribution and operating costs all factors in the change according to the company. Now, the very same factors -- I should point this out -- are also dogging the economy as a whole, and yet the White House insists it's doing all it can to alleviate pressure on consumers, many of whom, as you know are now girding for soaring Thanksgiving Day costs."

That 50 million barrels by the way coming after the government reported that consumer prices surged at their fastest pace in more than three decades back in October.

In Austria, they are trying to lock unvaccinated people into their homes. In Australia, they are taking people to mandatory quarantine camps and threatening, you know, even more draconian measures. Germany is indicating it's going to follow suit, which we've certainly, you know, we've certainly seen bad outcomes when totalitarianism takes hold in that part of Europe in the past -- and Europeans are not having it. In Italy, in Greece, in France, across Europe, there are massive, massive protests. There has been some violence aimed at protesters in The Netherlands, but tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Europeans are up in arms, saying, you know, we are a free nation, a free continent, we are a free people, and we will not allow these tyrannical measures to be enforced against us. It's not the end of the story, though, because unfortunately, these -- you know, as we've seen in history, when protests have a violent response from the police, that can end or break the back of a protest movement.

I was just at a massive rally to honor first responders who are resisting the vaccine mandates in New York City. This was last Saturday, 15,000 to 20,000 people. In New Hampshire, Melissa Blasek, representative there and her colleagues got a bill out of committee to ban President Biden's vaccine mandates in the State of New Hampshire. Kansas just issued another kind of decision to ban Biden's mandate -- sorry, and you're seeing working people across the country saying no. Truckers are walking off the job. Pilots are grounding flights. They said no. Unions are standing up and saying no, and dozens and dozens of lawsuits have been filed by citizens, by unions, by elected officials, by Attorneys General in over 10 states against the Biden administration. But when you step back, you know, I think you've got to notice that there's a bigger picture here. Never in my lifetime did I imagine that a President would first declare there would be no mandates, right? President Biden said that to us. Dr. Fauci said it. And then, you know, guess what? He didn't mean it. In September, he said there would be forced vaccination with an experimental substance, right? That clinical trials are not over until 2023 in to people who don't want it, right? Including those who might freely choose it. People who have religious objections, people who have health conditions, people who have natural immunity already. And not only am I seeing the President say I'm going to go ahead and force people to be injected against their will, but he is also doing it in an un-American way. He's ignoring two courts that have ruled that this is -- that he must stay his hand and he is going around them, and he's using OSHA, which is not a law. So it is a tyrant's move."
