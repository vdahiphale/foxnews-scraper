    },
    {
      "speaker": "NATTER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they're certainly focused on Syria. Their concern is, obviously, the sustainment of a leader that is stooping to use outlawed weapons of mass destruction against innocent civilians. It's more complicated by the fact that the Iranians are there, the Russians are there. The Turks have different objectives than we do there. So this is, to say the least, a quagmire. And I think that our approach to this -- because it is in our self-interests to have our interests protected there - - is appropriate."

Security Council in response to the use of chemical weapons by Bashar Assad just as tensions with fellow Security Council member and Assad ally, Russia, are increasing. So how will Russia and Iran respond to the allied action, and does the Trump administration have a larger strategy for Syria? Let's ask 'Wall Street Journal' columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist Bill McGurn. So let's start with just the basic first question, was this strike appropriate and necessary? Necessary? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, I think we can conclude that, Paul. It most certainly was necessary. It was a chemical attack, it was a god-awful chemical attack. Chemical weapons have been abhorred since World War I. We have conventions against it. And it was necessary to hit those three sites. But what we have to understand is the administration, I think, has made crystal clear at this point in time the pretext for this was only the chemical weapon attack. Not anything else that has been going on in Syria in the civil war or the adjacent regions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK. But is that by itself enough to justify such an action? Are chemical weapons so abhorrent and such a violation of norms that it's worth this kind of one-time attack?"

    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think they are that abhorrent. And I think what the president has said, if they use chemical weapons again, Assad runs the risk of another attack by the United States.

If President Trump is so concerned about stopping the use of chemical weapons, he's also in the same breath acknowledging that Assad might use them again, suggesting he still has them. If he cares so much about the CWC, that arms control treaty, then we should have gotten rid of all of these facilities. It should have been a much larger strike."

Why are we so afraid of Russia? Putin can't afford to lose men and material in Russia.

But, look, we talk about Syria, Syria is now basically a protectorate of Iran and Russia. They are significantly there. The Israelis are very upset that Iran is starting to establish Syria as a military base to attack Israel. So there is something more that has to come out of this. Now, let's go back to Secretary of Defense Mattis. There was reporting several days ago that the president was upset with him because he was not offering more robust options, and the reason was that General Mattis did not think there was a strategy after the strike."

All it is, is a personal complaint about Donald Trump. Nonetheless, James Comey is doing interviews on every media outlet in this country. And, you know, Trump is in a blood war with the mainstream media. We know that. And they are now setting up Mueller as his primary opponent for the moment. And the game is entirely political, Paul.

The left's hatred of Donald Trump and some on the right is that he's a vulgarian and so forth, and this is going to feed that. So he's useful to the anti-Trump narrative.

And listen, these are guys who will represent anybody. And so the president, I think, is becoming dangerously isolated as the probe gets tighter and tighter. He's only got two or three people working for him in Washington. His personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is now off the table and talking to the prosecutor.

I'm sorry the Republicans in the Senate didn't take it up. We always knew that it was going to be difficult to get it done there. But they got it through the House, and that was his principle responsibility. And the pressure will be on in the years ahead. We're going to look back, in my opinion, 10 years from now and find that we have made reforms and entitlements in this country that spring from the work that Paul Ryan patiently did on the Budget Committee and the Ways and Means Committee and as speaker.

And I thought it was good for the country and good for the party and, frankly, good for President Trump to have Paul Ryan speaking his mind in a candid, thoughtful and respectful way when he did disagree with the president. For example, in the days after Charlottesville. I think the president terribly mishandled that issue, but I thought Paul Ryan helped set him on the right course, and we began to see some of the things that Paul was saying and the tone that he was adopting to be reflected in some of the comments from the White House. But, look, there's always a tension between responsibilities of a party leader in the Senate or the House leadership and the relationship they have with the president.

And we wouldn't have gotten tax reform had we not had that kind of leadership, because he was asking -- with Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee -- they were asking their colleagues to do difficult things and to go home and explain them, and they did.

But that leaves us with one new person as speaker rallying support for the fall. I'd rather have what we look like we're going to have, which is Paul Ryan as speaker, still able to go out there and ask people for money and support for our candidates, but also at least one, if not two contenders in the form of Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise for his replacement. Let them show what they can do. Let them show their chops. What can they do to help their colleagues win re-election? How can they rally financial support, political support, enthusiasm and message discipline that will help our candidates win? I'd rather have three people, Ryan, McCarthy and Scalise, than just one."

If you remember how we got into the Ryan speakership in the first place, it was because Kevin McCarthy -- who would now like to be speaker -- dropped out because he was not able to command a majority. And the reason for that is because the House Freedom Caucus was peeling off 30 or 40 votes. We wrote in a time in an editorial called the Republican crack-up - - -- that the Freedom Caucus might be able to deny McCarthy or anybody a majority and give the Democrats more leverage, which ultimately is the story."

He took it out of obligation. He did a good job. And, look, people -- you know, one of the criticisms of Paul Ryan is he's become a Trumpian Republican. I think the reverse is really true. To the degree Donald Trump has had big successes, it's more because of when he's adopted Ryan-esque-type programs, not just the tax cuts, but the deregulation and so forth and a growth-oriented thing. That came from more traditional Republican sources, primarily Paul Ryan."

The big question though is whether he has that kind of unified support out there in the Trump base. I mean, there are a lot of populists, and they do have the representatives in the media who think we should not be involved, that this violates Trump's America first dictum and that we should pull the troops home, as he said he was going to do about a week ago. That's what they want. And the question is, are -- how many of those people, we know there are spokesmen, but how many people on the ground in the Trump electorate are going to be upset at this strike. My guess, Paul, is not that many. Most of the people, Trumpians out there would support a president taking action."
