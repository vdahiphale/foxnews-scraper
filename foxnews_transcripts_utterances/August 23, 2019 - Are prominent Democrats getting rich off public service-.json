They add this, there is no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body, no further treatment is needed at this time. Now, this marks the fourth time that Justice Ginsburg has faced cancer. She has previously dealt with pancreatic cancer, another instance with her colon, and late last year, the discovery of lung cancer after she fell in her office and broke three ribs. This latest discovery was made because she does undergo routine blood test, which, of course, is going to continue, along with periodic scans. Every indication is that she is working this summer, as all the justices do, handling emergency petitions. There was one of execution last night. They're all gearing up for the fall term as well. Oral arguments start to begin October 7. But the work of reading briefs and preparing for the term starts long before that. She has also been making public appearances. She did this just a few weeks ago at Georgetown Law Supreme Court Institute where she talked about serving on the nation's highest court."

Clearly honesty is not something valued by fake news CNN. Joining us now with reaction is Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz and former U.S. Attorney Brett Tolman. Thanks guys for joining us. Congressman, I will go to you first. While we are on the McCabe thing, at the end, what better way to reestablish credibility at a network that's promoting this debunked, disgraced collusion holds for two years than to hire one of the key figures in it who is actually under investigation for lying?

Back in 2005 and 2006, I was chief counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee and he brought to us inside information about manipulation I was going on in Wall Street. It turned out that it was accurate and it was investigated and it became part of a much larger investigation. So my experience with him is a very fascinating because while he's eccentric, he has been accurate historically with me and with others.

When asked about Patrick Byrne who made some -- levied some serious charges, I agree with you, by the way, Brett, I found them to be credible, too, and also based on some sourcing I have. McCabe said -- McComey, talk about a Freudian slip -- McCabe that is not simply the sort of thing that the FBI does. Well, let's go down the list of the sort of thing the FBI did under Comey. Again, I'm talking about the management, not the rank and file agents. Comey they stamped unverified information. They claim they knew about Russian sources when they interviewed Russian sources or from what I am told her my sources in January, they found out they were entirely not credible. They were desperate to authenticate this dossier, using sources targeting a political campaign. I mean, the things they did were clearly unprecedented, so that's not much of an excuse anymore that they don't operate that way."

That is precisely what the FBI was doing at this point in time and when we ask those questions to try to get to the origin of this corrupt investigation, you even saw Mueller unwilling to stand by that work. That's why what Attorney General Bill Barr is doing important stuff right now because he will uncover the extent to which there is a corrupt motive that underpinned all of these various efforts. I don't know if Patrick Byrne was telling the truth or not, I do know -- it seems pretty to odd to me that he had this relationship with Maria Butina where they only met up once every six weeks. I don't know about most relationships, but every person I ever dated, if you don't text back in six hours, you better have an alibi and if you go six days, you better have hospital records that you were somewhere, but apparently, he had arrangement where he only had to show up and see Ms. Butina every six weeks. Pretty interesting."

If Butina, Maria Butina's lawyers, who had been is arrested, prosecuted, and has been charged, and I believe is serving a prison sentence now, if they asked for Brady material here and material that there was a C.I., confidential informant working against, say Patrick Byrne was in fact an informant working for the government, does that material have to be provided to Butina's lawyers?

I worked on investigations and undercover investigations, and when a source comes to you and says, hey, I have a relationship with so-and-so, that seems to be a source of information I could be valuable, does the FBI say, hey, go back and divide us information and continue to develop that relationship? They do it all the time."

And it seems like each time they come up with a big donut, nothing. And now we see another source surfacing with the same story being asked as the alleged fire and law enforcement to approach people on this collusion thing. I mean, what are we going to get to the bottom of this and searches state the obvious that this looks like it was apparently some kind of a set up?"

But you see time and again, you have the folks leading the deep state so unwilling to accept the will of the voters to have Donald Trump your president that they were out trying to cede scandals. They were out trying to stir up and set up any possible circumstance where they could link someone with the Trump campaign even tangentially to something related -- to something related to Russia, and time and again, that failed. Now you see I think the American people demanding to know why we ended up in this circumstance in the first place, and that's why we are going to support the attorney general's good work to put the people who started this corrupt investigation behind bars."

Whether it'd be at the CIA, at the upper levels, or are at the FBI, Comey, McCabe, we had Baker, Strzok, do see any legal liability for them? I mean, it's clear there was at this point some malfeasance going on. But there's a difference between bad behavior and illegal behavior. Do you see any legal liability for them, may be in leaks or some kind of criminal potential charges after Durham is done with his probe?"

Horowitz, for example, releases his report and it has recommendations for a criminal investigation, my understanding is that Durham right now who does have a grand jury subpoena ability is in communication with Horwitz. They do have overlapped and if we are going to get to accountability, if you are going to hold someone like Flynn or others accountable for their statements to the FBI, do we not hold them -- the FBI at an even higher level of accountability? So I hope that they will treat it seriously, that they will look at criminal charges if they apply."

They're their words, not mine, on their own 302. What is going on here?

One, Jeff Sessions wasn't really in charge of the Justice Department, so you sort of had it the inmates running the asylum over there. And then second, Paul Ryan, speaker of the House, wouldn't support our efforts when we were the majority to get subpoenas and force the people like Clapper and Brennan and other folks from the Obama White House to answer tough questions about their involvement in these circumstances. So, those forces together have delayed justice, but I think now, we will get the justice we need because we have a series attorney general. And look, I mean, only one of two things is possible. Either Patrick Byrne is telling the truth or he's lying. If he's telling the truth, it's more evidence of criminal scandal and if he's lying, maybe he's got a future as a CNN contributor."

Obviously, you having worked for the government no there is a federal and investigator on the other side, the investigative side of it. There's a paper trail for everything. It you go get a paper clip coming up to sign something. We have this woods file where McCabe, Comey, higher-ups at the DOJ clearly said the information they had gotten from Christopher Steele was verified according to their own procedure. There is a paper trail there. Can that paper trail then be used against them in some kind of proceeding in the future to show that they were being disingenuous in front of the court?"

Along with \"Relatable\" podcast host, Allie Beth Stuckey, and \"Washington Examiner\" senior campaign reporter, Kerry Picket. So, Charlie, I will go to you first. What I find comical about that AOC little home-video she did there is she is a member of the House of Representatives which is the branch of the Congress allocated by population.

So, for her to be ignorant on this is pretty disturbing. But I say to her, welcome to the discussion 200 years late and, of course, if she went back to a civics class like in elementary school and learned about this, she would learn that the whole point of this debate and the wisdom of our Founders was to create a system that gave states enough power to balance out, to be a counterweight to the federal government. And when you look around at our country today and you look at all the problems with our government, the problems aren't in state governments usually. The problems are with the federal government. And if anything, what we need more of is more power given to those governments to act as a counterweight to the federal government. But all of that goes over her head apparently."

You know, there are farmers in Wisconsin and, as I said last night, citrus farmers in Florida who don't want to be voted out on a strict population direct democracy votes, and she seems to have missed that entirely, yet she's one of the more prominent members of U.S. Congress now and one of the biggest Twitter followers. ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, \"RELATABLE\" PODCAST HOST: Well, she seems to miss a lot of classes apparently. Civics class, economics class, you could probably go on. But you're absolutely right. What I love is how transparent they are. They talked about abolishing the Electoral College, getting rid of the Senate because that's not fair, maybe even making the case of getting rid of the Supreme Court and we know what the theme is in all of that. Republicans controlled the Senate right now in the Electoral College got elected Donald Trump and the Supreme Court has conservative justices on it. So, we know exactly what their motive is. It's not because it's racist. That's actually the narrative that she was pushing on her Instagram story where she had millions of followers as well but it is actually a racist scam. But we know what's really behind now. It's because they want control paid she is perfectly fine with people in L.A. and San Francisco and New York City ruling over the rest of the country because they have the same ideology that she does and, of course, AOC knows best."

Now, keep in mind, this is sort of the cry of an individual who lost the last election and you know, this isn't really unusual.

What does Biden do with AOC and the \"Squad\"? I mean, how does he handle that? Does he distance himself?

But my goodness, I think they are destroying their own Democratic base because there are a lot of rank and file regular Democrat voters out there, and these are the people that you see registered in the polls favoring Joe Biden who don't support -- these Democrats now, they are people who don't like Donald Trump and they can give you legitimate reasons for not liking him. Hence, they have nothing to do with Russia or racism. They have to do with other policy positions. And they are completely not represented by any of these loons in the Democratic Party who are racing toward the left who give free health care to illegal aliens, and Bill de Blasio wants to give New York City housing to illegal aliens. There are a lot of ranking Democrats who look at that and say this is not for me and I think Donald Trump picks up a lot of those people become general election, but before that, in the Democratic primary, I think it hurts the party."

They have stolen our intellectual property at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a year and they want to continue. I won't let that happen.\" Today, Beijing said it would impose tariffs of 5 and 10 percent on $75 billion of U.S. goods. And when the markets closed, President Trump fired right back, raising the rates on existing and planned tariffs of Chinese goods by 5 percent. The President also directed U.S. companies to find alternatives to doing business with China.

It's part of their plan of \"spread the wealth around.\" But what about the wrong wealth? Several Democratic candidates are multi-millionaires, yes, themselves. For example, Elizabeth Warren, who's worth an estimated $12 million, owns a $3 million Victorian home in Cambridge, Massachusetts; and Joe Biden has reportedly made around $15 million since he's left office. Isn't that nice? And don't forget what Barack Obama had to say about wealth. Take a look."

I'm actually surprised by how much money I've got. And let me tell you something. I don't have half as much as most of these folks or the tenth or a hundredth. There's only so much you can eat. There's only so big a house you can have."

That's right. Here for reaction to all of this hypocrisy is Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs and Fox News Contributor Doug Schoen. Congressman, I'll go to you first. I find this particularly infuriating about the left. I'm proud to be a conservative because what we believe in for us, we believe in for everybody else we believe in. It's economic liberty, education liberty in school choice, health care liberty, health care freedom, the right to defend yourself, but not just for us, for other people, and we live by the code. Yet the left swears they believe in 90 percent tax rates and all this other stuff and share the wealth. And yet, they don't live by that code at all. It's embarrassing."

      "speaker": "REP. ANDY BIGGS, R-ARIZ.",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is. And it's blatant hypocrisy, number one. But it's actually worse than hypocrisy because it's the cultural or more relativism of the progressive left. And that is to say they believe in, for instance, intolerance. We're going to tolerate everything unless you disagree with us. And then all of a sudden, you're not part of us anymore and so you deserve to be castigated and outcast. It's platonic elitism. They believe that some people deserve more and are better than others. And thus it's - to them, it's not hypocrisy. So when you hear Biden has made $15 million since he left office, my first thought is, you know, here's a guy who never really did anything in the private sector, but somehow he is a multi-millionaire coming out of it, and he's going to be critical of people who are wealthy and have earned that wealth. Barack Obama and his wife now worth about $140 million are the reports. They're buying a $15 million mansion. I don't begrudge people making money."

I never got this. If the Democrats' platform is giving additional money to the government, 40, 50 percent tax rates is in net (ph) good, will improve society, then why don't groups of Democrats in Congress, former Presidents like Obama and Biden get together, show us their tax returns where they make voluntary donations to the government?

The Clinton era levels of spending as a percentage of GDP in conjunction, by the way, with the Republican Congress - let's give credit all around were it was due - I would make that trade any day of the week. But the Democrat Party has gone so far off the deep end, Bill Clinton would be like a conservative Republican now running for office in his party today."

I mean, President Clinton was a master at triangulation and they managed to work together with the Republicans who controlled the legislative branch. And they didn't have the out-of-control spending that we saw in the Obama administration and so far, quite frankly, in this one. But you know what? The bottom line is, what we're seeing is a group of people who say, \"You know what, we're going to go after the rich, but we're going to be rich. We're going to take from corporations, but corporations are evil. We're going to protect ourselves with bodyguards who have guns and we're going to tell you that you can't have guns. We're going to send our kids to private schools and elite schools. We're going to say you can't have parental choice because you're not somehow the same elite that we are.\" That's the discrepancy, and that's the radicalization of the Democrat Party today."

After talking with U.S. authorities today, prosecutors in France, as you mentioned, where Jeffrey Epstein also owned property, opened a preliminary investigation into the scandal, including allegations of rape, sexual assault of minors, and criminal conspiracy. Several people in France have come forward saying they are either victims or witnesses to sexual violence. The French model scout, Jean-Luc Brunel, who Epstein accuser say provided young girls to the financier, is not believed to be part of this French probe. Meantime the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT says the university received about $800,000 in donations from Jeffrey Epstein. The money went to media lab, which is an MIT elite research center. And apparently, much of the money was accepted after Epstein pled guilty to soliciting a minor for sex and after he was labeled a sex offender. The MIT President has apologized for, quote, \"a mistake in judgment,\" saying it led to shame and distress and that the university will try to make amends. Dan."
