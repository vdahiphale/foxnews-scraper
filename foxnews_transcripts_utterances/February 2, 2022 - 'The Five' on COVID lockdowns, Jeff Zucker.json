A devastating blow being delivered to Democrats who cannot get enough of COVID lockdowns. It turns out they all made us suffer for nothing. A brand new evidence shows shutting everything down did little to stop COVID deaths, and instead wreaked havoc on every single aspect of our lives. Johns Hopkins out with a bombshell study that shows restrictions only reduce deaths by .2 percent. At the same time, those lockdowns devastated our economy, our education system, and damaged our mental health. All the while fueling major political unrest. But many of us were never given an option. Remember President Biden and top health officials told us lockdowns were our only choice.",

The human -- human beings can actually understand the context of the information, whether it's a conversation or something they read in the back of a pillbox. So, this is such a nonstory. All of these actions, these shutdowns and everything they were driven by fear. But not fear of the pandemic, fear of litigation. And also, insurance claims. Right? The impact of litigation actually scared more people than the pandemic. We aren't stopping massive theft, because the stores don't want the insurance claims to go up, so they let insurance take care of it. Employees are still masking up because they fear malingering employees might sue. We locked down basically over lawyers. We didn't want to be sued. I'm not done. A lot of people aren't going to let go, and that's fine. If you want to hide, go for it. If you want to mask up outside, go for it. But it's now should be regarded strictly as a preference. It has to be regarded as a preference. You can't tell me what to do, I won't tell you what to do, and that's the way it should be.

The last point I will make is in all the campaign issues you are going to see in 2022, I just flashed back to something that Trump said in 2016. Do your remember the applause he got when he said this country is too politically incorrect? And it's a huge -- he had huge applause. He's onto something there.

Even today, doctors are still prescribing hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin. Still doing it. He didn't get on the phone. He didn't create a hotline to these doctors that were on the front lines during the pandemic. Hey, what's working, what's not working? He didn't do that. He just said wait for my vaccine and stay six feet apart. What he did to the entire world was even worse. This plunged like 300 million people into poverty, starvation, malnourishment. What he did to our kids, what he did to the supply chains, alcoholism, drug addiction, child abuse. And think about all the small businesses that he shut down.

I didn't get my first shot until mid-March, and got my second shot early April. I appreciate studies like this because it gives us an opportunity, to Dana's point and everyone's point a time -- a chance to look back and understand what went right, what went wrong. Robert O'Brien, who was the national security advisor to President Trump at the time, told President Trump this is bad. This is going to be the worst thing you deal with as president. Was he lying? No. It was the worst thing the president dealt but he didn't get reelected because the country felt like he didn't handle it correctly. I think the takeaways from me, I'm a father of two young children, there's no doubt they have been impacted over the last year or two. Remote school, in school, remote school, now in school. But I look at the economy, and I look at the country, I hope that two or other three things come out. We need to reform our health agencies, and reform the way we look at how we -- or part of the WHO and how we take part in studies around the globe, how we take part in efforts to strengthen the public health system. Two, we need to not be so reliant on supply chains overseas. The fact that, I think one of the most important things that President Biden and the administration did in the last week was to make a $20 million public- private partnership investment in Columbus, Ohio for Intel to begin to make semiconductor chips there. We have to modernize our ports. That ought to be the most important thing we do in terms of infrastructure. Without question, we'll have more studies like this. And I applaud John Hops and I hope my alma mater spend in Michigan and do some as well. But I think the real thing here is, let's look at the overall takeaways. And even though it was only 0.2 percent, if you look at the numbers, that's 1,800 families that would not have had a loved one die. We can all debate whether it's worth it, but I got to tell you, I'm glad my dad who got it last in March of 2020 -- that he was not one of those families and mine was not either. And I'm praying for that none of us around the table and many of my other friends were not either. So, look, a lot to learn from, and there will be a lot of chest pounding here.

Perhaps, it's a violation of some kind of thing in human resources, but it's nothing compared to the hazardous waste that drips out of CNN every night. I mean, think about bad. He should have been fired. How -- when you think about how bad CNN got under Zucker. It is a left-wing station that now Tucker Carlson has more Democrats watching his show. This show gets more Democrats watching than CNN does. He literally drank their milk shake on their home turf. That's humiliating. So, this obviously is about Chris Cuomo exacting revenge.

So, you know, when powerful people know things about other powerful people and you come after me, well, you just better careful because I also know what's in your backyard. And that's what happened.

The rules don't apply to me. And that's what I think we are seeing now.

Either she is an idiot or she thinks we're all idiots, that somehow, we can't tell the difference between a three-and-a-half-hour podcast in which the host is high and a spokesperson for the CDC. The human -- human beings can actually understand the context of the information, whether it's a conversation or something they read in the back of a pillbox. So, this is such a nonstory. All of these actions, these shutdowns and everything they were driven by fear. But not fear of the pandemic, fear of litigation. And also, insurance claims. Right? The impact of litigation actually scared more people than the pandemic. We aren't stopping massive theft, because the stores don't want the insurance claims to go up, so they let insurance take care of it. Employees are still masking up because they fear malingering employees might sue. We locked down basically over lawyers. We didn't want to be sued. I'm not done. A lot of people aren't going to let go, and that's fine. If you want to hide, go for it. If you want to mask up outside, go for it. But it's now should be regarded strictly as a preference. It has to be regarded as a preference. You can't tell me what to do, I won't tell you what to do, and that's the way it should be.

Even today, doctors are still prescribing hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin. Still doing it. He didn't get on the phone. He didn't create a hotline to these doctors that were on the front lines during the pandemic. Hey, what's working, what's not working? He didn't do that. He just said wait for my vaccine and stay six feet apart. What he did to the entire world was even worse. This plunged like 300 million people into poverty, starvation, malnourishment. What he did to our kids, what he did to the supply chains, alcoholism, drug addiction, child abuse. And think about all the small businesses that he shut down. And it's like the biggest transfer of wealth in world history. He takes $4 trillion away from workers, and then about $4 trillion goes to billionaires.

I didn't get my first shot until mid-March, and got my second shot early April. I appreciate studies like this because it gives us an opportunity, to Dana's point and everyone's point a time -- a chance to look back and understand what went right, what went wrong. Robert O'Brien, who was the national security advisor to President Trump at the time, told President Trump this is bad. This is going to be the worst thing you deal with as president. Was he lying? No. It was the worst thing the president dealt but he didn't get reelected because the country felt like he didn't handle it correctly. I think the takeaways from me, I'm a father of two young children, there's no doubt they have been impacted over the last year or two. Remote school, in school, remote school, now in school. But I look at the economy, and I look at the country, I hope that two or other three things come out. We need to reform our health agencies, and reform the way we look at how we -- or part of the WHO and how we take part in studies around the globe, how we take part in efforts to strengthen the public health system. Two, we need to not be so reliant on supply chains overseas. The fact that, I think one of the most important things that President Biden and the administration did in the last week was to make a $20 million public- private partnership investment in Columbus, Ohio for Intel to begin to make semiconductor chips there. We have to modernize our ports. That ought to be the most important thing we do in terms of infrastructure. Without question, we'll have more studies like this. And I applaud John Hops and I hope my alma mater spend in Michigan and do some as well. But I think the real thing here is, let's look at the overall takeaways. And even though it was only 0.2 percent, if you look at the numbers, that's 1,800 families that would not have had a loved one die. We can all debate whether it's worth it, but I got to tell you, I'm glad my dad who got it last in March of 2020 -- that he was not one of those families and mine was not either. And I'm praying for that none of us around the table and many of my other friends were not either. So, look, a lot to learn from, and there will be a lot of chest pounding here.

But this relationship doesn't register in my brain. Perhaps, it's a violation of some kind of thing in human resources, but it's nothing compared to the hazardous waste that drips out of CNN every night. I mean, think about bad. He should have been fired. How -- when you think about how bad CNN got under Zucker. It is a left-wing station that now Tucker Carlson has more Democrats watching his show. This show gets more Democrats watching than CNN does. He literally drank their milk shake on their home turf. That's humiliating. So, this obviously is about Chris Cuomo exacting revenge. It was -- this was -- this is the -- this is like a relationship version of mutually assured destruction. So, you know, when powerful people know things about other powerful people and you come after me, well, you just better careful because I also know what's in your backyard. And that's what happened. This was a sure takedown from Chris Cuomo, which somehow makes it a little sad for me to enjoy it because I wanted him to be fired for the crappy product that he creates, because it is a terrible, awful product that hurts so people.

So, who knows when it started? I don't really care. But this is something that was totally an open secret.

I think whenever you apologize for something and you're sincere, especially if it has to do with gender and race and culture and you say, you know what, I didn't realize I was talking about a race, that race was actually part -- I'm glad the Anti-Defamation League had called her and explained to her that. I actually believe she was telling the truth. Now, she learned cancel culture has to end, and I hope not only The View, but every show. James Carville has said this over and over again particularly to my party, those progressives in my party and others who had any slight want to fire someone, not only want to fire them, want to banish them from ever being able to have a voice or presence again.

But here's the bottom line. I seem to recall that the Clinton Foundation failed to file financial records, and it's kind of I guess what big charitable organizations do. I don't know.
