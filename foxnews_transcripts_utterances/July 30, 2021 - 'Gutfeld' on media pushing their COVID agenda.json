      "sentences": "Well, I guess it isn't CNN when you're on. In The Atlantic, Frum also says that since Biden's America produces 70 percent of the wealth than they should decide when it's had enough of Trump's America who are putting people medically at risk. Yes. Trump's America. Last night I pointed out that many of the unvaccinated are people of color who are skeptical of a healthcare system that screwed them over. There are also tens of thousands of city workers and undocumented immigrants who also aren't getting the job. Add to that, the wait in Sears who are gauging the responses to the vaccine. Yes, I'm willing to bet that's not Trump's America, but it doesn't matter for broken sidelined losers like Frum to remain relevant, he must paint the image of an orange spray tan straw man leading a group of redneck anti-vaxxers mouth breathers. He must see conflict under every rock, including the one he's been living under for the last 20 years. In the New York Times, experts blame Americans who are unvaccinated. At least I think that's what it said. It's hard to read something covered in parakeet (BLEEP) but even as the -- but even as the Times admits, only a third of the unvaccinated are eligible. And they say the vaccinated are now mad at the unvaxxed which they get from interviewing their pals. Yes. The Times quotes the political director of the hard left Daily Kos saying real anger is brewing among the vaccinated toward the unvaccinated. You got to love how the media operates. You know, so I wonder if the vaxxed are mad at the unvaxxed. I'll just ask someone who agrees with me to supply a quote. You know, it's like a mean girl spreading a rumor about another mean girl hitting on another girl's boyfriend just to start a fight in the cafeteria. From Cuomo, de Blasio, the Times, there are mean girls in drag. And they're framing COVID like a teamsters' strike. And in this case, the unvaccinated they're the scabs. It's weird watching people make the same mistake over and over again while claiming they're just trying to help. It's like my wife watching me load the dishwasher wrong thinking I'm helping her out, never works out. But they don't want to -- they don't really want to help vaccine holdouts. They just enjoy the conflict too much. It makes perfect sense though, if you think about it, because all good theater starts with conflict. And that's just what T.V. news has become. Good theater. So how can intimidating people and insulting them persuade anyone? Didn't the Democrats always call that bullying? Yes, you can't morally impugn shoplifters, looters, violent drug addicts who assault cops, transients or junkies pooping on your porch. That would be so insensitive and yet so reasonable. But those rubes scared of a novel vaccine. They have it coming. They're the criminals. Fact is, these media bullies just want to impugn the people who've caused them emotional turmoil over the past four years. This sort of turd swirling virtue signaling is actually therapy for them. They should really call it Dr. Drew. As Matt Taibbi points out, it's a brand new kind of snobbism. Allowing elites to look down at the unschooled underclass, stressing the affluence of their voters as an indication of their moral superiority. Listening to them though, is as harmful as French kissing a cave dwelling bat in Wuhan. I can't wait to see what they do next, and watch it blow up in their unmasked faces.

      "utterance": "Well, I guess it isn't CNN when you're on. In The Atlantic, Frum also says that since Biden's America produces 70 percent of the wealth than they should decide when it's had enough of Trump's America who are putting people medically at risk. Yes. Trump's America. Last night I pointed out that many of the unvaccinated are people of color who are skeptical of a healthcare system that screwed them over. There are also tens of thousands of city workers and undocumented immigrants who also aren't getting the job. Add to that, the wait in Sears who are gauging the responses to the vaccine. Yes, I'm willing to bet that's not Trump's America, but it doesn't matter for broken sidelined losers like Frum to remain relevant, he must paint the image of an orange spray tan straw man leading a group of redneck anti-vaxxers mouth breathers. He must see conflict under every rock, including the one he's been living under for the last 20 years. In the New York Times, experts blame Americans who are unvaccinated. At least I think that's what it said. It's hard to read something covered in parakeet (BLEEP) but even as the -- but even as the Times admits, only a third of the unvaccinated are eligible. And they say the vaccinated are now mad at the unvaxxed which they get from interviewing their pals. Yes. The Times quotes the political director of the hard left Daily Kos saying real anger is brewing among the vaccinated toward the unvaccinated. You got to love how the media operates. You know, so I wonder if the vaxxed are mad at the unvaxxed. I'll just ask someone who agrees with me to supply a quote. You know, it's like a mean girl spreading a rumor about another mean girl hitting on another girl's boyfriend just to start a fight in the cafeteria. From Cuomo, de Blasio, the Times, there are mean girls in drag. And they're framing COVID like a teamsters' strike. And in this case, the unvaccinated they're the scabs. It's weird watching people make the same mistake over and over again while claiming they're just trying to help. It's like my wife watching me load the dishwasher wrong thinking I'm helping her out, never works out. But they don't want to -- they don't really want to help vaccine holdouts. They just enjoy the conflict too much. It makes perfect sense though, if you think about it, because all good theater starts with conflict. And that's just what T.V. news has become. Good theater. So how can intimidating people and insulting them persuade anyone? Didn't the Democrats always call that bullying? Yes, you can't morally impugn shoplifters, looters, violent drug addicts who assault cops, transients or junkies pooping on your porch. That would be so insensitive and yet so reasonable. But those rubes scared of a novel vaccine. They have it coming. They're the criminals. Fact is, these media bullies just want to impugn the people who've caused them emotional turmoil over the past four years. This sort of turd swirling virtue signaling is actually therapy for them. They should really call it Dr. Drew. As Matt Taibbi points out, it's a brand new kind of snobbism. Allowing elites to look down at the unschooled underclass, stressing the affluence of their voters as an indication of their moral superiority. Listening to them though, is as harmful as French kissing a cave dwelling bat in Wuhan. I can't wait to see what they do next, and watch it blow up in their unmasked faces.

But hey, you're arrogant. If you wonder why the people who keep screwing up, why people aren't listening to them. And it -- what happens to you is that you get censored. You get demonized. And it seems like more and more you're being forced to take the vaccine. And I got it. I had no problems with it.

Council voted last year to shift 23 million out of the police budget. But that vote was a result of a destructive ideology now turning every liberal city into organized mayhem. It's what Senator Tom Cotton writing in National Review. Never heard of it. Calls the BLM effect which sounds like something that happens to me after having a cigarette with coffee. You can work out it. You can work at it. This obvious point that anti-law enforcement sentiment championed by Black Lives Matter and the media causes a drop in policing leading to fewer arrests and a rising murder rate. Cotton also adds, weak policing, weak prosecuting, and weak sentencing hurts black Americans more than any other group of our citizens. African- Americans tragically constitute approximately half of all murder victims and regularly suffer the brunt of damage resulting from riots, period, their lives matter. Meanwhile, in New York, two teens were turned in by their parents for assaulting an off duty firefighter. That's after video of the mob attack was shared online. As punishment they will be forced to work as President Biden's transcriber. Jessica, you coddle criminals like their little koala bears, it makes you feel pretty stupid now that all of your heroes are trying to get more cops on the beat. Huh?

Like Mitch McConnell is going to Trump or, you know, now with this police officers issue, like all of these defund the police activists like the squad, are they going to start calling black mayors racist, or black police chiefs racist?

Maybe you just come around that tube and you need to have some ready to go is something coming along there. I always thought they should make it wider just for me. When you watch these -- when they -- when you watch these kids playing video games, while it's flooding, Jessica, is this the right frame of mind for combating climate change?"

And I'm worried that there's a lot of adults I know that are going to wake up when the power goes out, and they're going to have no career, no family, no resume to speak of, and they're just going to log on to Twitter and start insulting people."

It's called the Galileo Project. It looks to create a global network of telescopes, cameras, and computers to investigate UFOs. I suppose we should be impressed by this. But we keep hearing about these searches for alien life every week. And they come up with nothing. At this point, should we care? I can only think of one truly awesome being qualified to discuss this with me because he's not from this earth. He also just happens to be the leader of the greatest band that is or will ever be, Gwar. Welcome back to the show, Gwar, front man of the Berserker Blothar."

But Earth is -- it's basically the -- it is a landfill in Broward County, Florida to the rest of the universe. That's what Earth I, you know. And so, the aliens, they're all -- they're all hideous. Let me tell you that. If you saw an alien, I am the best-looking alien that you will ever see. I could promise you that."

Researchers have found that radioactive wild boar pig hybrids are roaming the region near the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, apparently domestic pigs escaped from farms and got together with the wild boars and now we've got a new species. Should we be worried?"
