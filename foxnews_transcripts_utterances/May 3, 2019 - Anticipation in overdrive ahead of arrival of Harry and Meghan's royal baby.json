It's fascinating to me, Jason how quickly the narrative of, you know, well, we didn't get that, so here is what we are going to say the president is up to now based on, at this point, not -- no evidence that we can see of any of these things."

I think he's shown that he's very adept at this and knows the law better than anybody that was questioning him. But I do think that Democrats from Pelosi and Nadler, to the Senators, and now, the Washington Post and the other pundits out there are trying to distract by saying, well, Trump will do this, and he'll do that. And it'll be outrageous, and it'll be -- it'll be wrong. But we know is happening Martha is that the inspector general in the next 60 days is going to come out with a report. We know the attorney general is pursuing the origins of the stuff about Trump, and how did that all come about. And it is not going to look good for the Department of Justice, specifically the FBI, and potentially, some of the other departments and agencies in the Obama administration."

That -- but he left off where did they -- did they actually take action? Did people like Strzok, and Page, and McCabe, what did they actually do did with that information, this animus and this bias? That's what the inspector general has been looking at for more than a year now. So, that we've already had this foreshadowing, we already know this. And when you see the New York Times put out this story in the last 48 hours, you know, saying that well, actually there was a spy sent by the FBI to go peek in on George Papadopoulos. That's not a coincidence that it shows up in the New York Times. It's how they inoculate themselves and try to lessen the blow."

I said, \"What in the world is the president talking about?\" Reince didn't have any knowledge about it. But evidently, I think the president wasn't just guessing. I think the president had actually probably had some information that, that was actually true. The other thing, Martha, I think is highly suspicious in retrospect, why is it that the FBI director first time he meets with Donald Trump, starts talking about this dossier, why does he start doing that? It's probably because he's very nervous about what he and his team had done with that. But that's why you have an inspector general, an attorney general, and others that are looking at it. And like I said, we're probably within 60 days of knowing, and it's going to be ugly for a lot of those Democrats."

It's like, you know, before the fact anything that the president decides he is going to look into will be, Oh, see now, he's using his Justice Department to investigate everybody. When the question is actually now being investigated is whether or not President Obama did that during the last campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Right. So, here is what I don't understand about that narrative. George Papadopoulos was in the words of Lewandowski, Donald Trump, a liar, and somebody they'd never heard of. If the -- if the Obama White House administration was truly interested in spying on the Trump campaign, why wouldn't they have spied on Donald Trump Jr., or Jared, or anybody of any consequence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Because, when these guys work this kind of things, and you know, maybe I've read too many spy novels, they look to sort of the softest points as entry points, right? So, you go to a Carter Page, you go to George Papadopoulos. And you're looking for a way into the operation."

    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",

And what we know is that five different nations who were friends of ours reported to our intelligence agencies that they were hearing all these stories that made them convinced as ultimately our intelligence agencies verified that the Russians were trying to attack our democracy. And Papadopoulos was the one who was spreading those stories. So, that's why I think they would go after him, not because he's weak. Because he was the one where they were getting these stories. And incidentally, all this outrage about Carter Page and Papadopoulos, are we going to see a smidgen of that outrage about what the Russians did? I haven't heard that yet for all the defense of Carter Page and Papadopoulos."

If you look at the top line stuff in the Mueller report, I'm 260 pages deep into it, he's more or less vindicated. They can -- they can pit if they wanted, we can debate it, but he's more or less vindicated. Number two, let's wait for the inspector general. If there was a nefarious activity, that's their job they have to uncover it on. And if there was a nefarious activity, I would hope Richard would accept that those people, if they did things that were nefarious and unfounded that they deserve to get punished for that."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

That's just my point of view, that's my point of view as a capital allocator with $10 billion under management, not me talking as a partisan. That's just me looking objectively at the landscape, and the death of the economic growth. I think it's very hard to be the sitting president. But if we were sitting here in 2011, and we were talking about Barack Obama, and you asked me, said boy, it's going to be tough for the Republicans because he has a rising economy and there's so much strength. So, to me, we can do the Kabuki theater, we have a failing industrial policy, education policy, and infrastructure policy.

That Washington Post did an enormous piece on Bernie Sanders honeymoon which was like decades ago, and let's put up some of this. Inside Bernie's 1988 10-day honeymoon on the Soviet Union, \"As he stood on Soviet soil, Sanders criticized the cost of housing and health care in the United States, lauding the lower prices but not the quality of that available in the Soviet Union. Then, at a banquet he blasted the way the United States had intervened in other countries, stunning some of those who had accompanied him.\" So, beyond -- and we -- let's put up the picture of Bernie Sanders and -- you know, they're all having vodka at the table. Anyway, it's very interesting honeymoon. He has no shirt on which you can't really see in this picture.

All the things that are truly socialist. He's a real socialist, he doesn't make any bones about it, but she didn't play that up because she was advised. Well, that you make him a martyr.
