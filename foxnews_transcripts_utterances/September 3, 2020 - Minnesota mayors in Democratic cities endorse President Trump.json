STEVE CORTES, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: Absolutely. I think they know how critical the state of Wisconsin is and the upper Midwest will be in general. It's fascinating to me Tammy because Joe Biden snubbed the Badger State just a couple of weeks ago when he would not go there to accept the Democratic nomination even though the convention was officially still located in Milwaukee. He claimed at that time that the science wouldn't allow him to travel there. Well, the science hasn't changed over the last two weeks. What has changed perhaps is the political science and the reality of polls tightening all over the country, betting markets tightening and the realization within Team Biden that they have to get on the road that their basement bunker strategy of limping into the finish line and trying to run out the clock and win by default is not going to work. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And I think it was good that Joe Biden went there with a message of healing. Joe Biden, you're talking about Joe Biden maybe staging some comments there in this clip, but President Trump couldn't even get the people who own the business to come out and be in a picture with him.

Welcome, gentlemen. Now, tom, is this all temporary? Obviously, things can change dramatically. This is an indication that it can.

He is, in fact, exactly where Hillary Clinton was at this point four years ago in terms of her lead in the battleground states. So I think the polling, the state polling post conventions has been a bit of the mixed bag. There's been some good polls for Trump. There's a good one out today in Florida, for example, Quinnipiac showing him getting a big bump with African-Americans and leading Biden among Hispanics. You mentioned a good poll in Pennsylvania.

Like that Fox News poll that he mentioned in Arizona, you know how many Democrats in that poll? Forty-six percent. The exit polls from 2016 are 28 percent. Where did the 18 percent extra Democrats come from? There's a lot of skewed polls. The polls that are taken right, like in Pennsylvania, Rasmussen Reports had us tied today.

That would lead him to win a state like Michigan, for example, where he's close. It would lead him to win North Carolina. The problem is he would lose Florida right now because he only over performed the polls there by one percent of he's trailing by more than that. So really, if you look at the electoral map, he's got 36 electoral votes to play with and still win the election, which means he could lose two of those three upper Midwest states and still win the election so long as he wins the rest of the states, Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina.

I am Tammy Bruce in for Laura Ingraham and this is The Ingraham Angle from New York City tonight. Joe Biden, the king of flip flop. In just four days, this man has done a complete about face on three major issues. Mollie Hemingway and Matt Schlapp are here to expose it all. Plus, Biden didn't get that post-convention bump he wanted, but President Trump sure did. John McLaughlin and Tom Bevan break it all down and give us a sneak peek into some internal Trump campaign polling, you don't want to miss that. And Laura is here. Don't you worry with Raymond Arroyo for a very special Thursday follies, the best of Biden in the basement. How could they choose? You won't want to miss that either. But first, the Biden campaign must be getting some alarming internal polling on Wisconsin, because after trashing President Trump for visiting Kenosha, Joe Biden made a seemingly impromptu trip to the battle scarred city today where he met with the family of Jacob Blake and hosted an entirely scripted town hall. Well almost entirely scripted."

And host of the Aggressive Progressive Podcast. All right you guys. Welcome Aboard. Thanks for joining me. Steve, now obviously the American people can make a determination about the difference in how these two men have been treated. But what is this that they can't afford to have Wisconsin break for Trump again. Is that what's leading and behind all of this when it comes to their attitude and how they present these two stories. STEVE CORTES, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: Absolutely. I think they know how critical the state of Wisconsin is and the upper Midwest will be in general. It's fascinating to me Tammy because Joe Biden snubbed the Badger State just a couple of weeks ago when he would not go there to accept the Democratic nomination even though the convention was officially still located in Milwaukee. He claimed at that time that the science wouldn't allow him to travel there. Well, the science hasn't changed over the last two weeks. What has changed perhaps is the political science and the reality of polls tightening all over the country, betting markets tightening and the realization within Team Biden that they have to get on the road that their basement bunker strategy of limping into the finish line and trying to run out the clock and win by default is not going to work."

So, I don't know what magic polls everybody else is reading, but the poll that this network took has him up pretty substantially in Wisconsin. And I think it was good that Joe Biden went there with a message of healing. Joe Biden, you're talking about Joe Biden maybe staging some comments there in this clip, but President Trump couldn't even get the people who own the business to come out and be in a picture with him. Instead, he got somebody who used to own the business because he needed his photo op in front of a building. Donald Trump also didn't meet with the family of the man who was shot seven times in the back that started some of this protest in Wisconsin. Look, we need a president who's going to turn the temperature down. Donald Trump doesn't do it because he doesn't respect anybody but himself. We see what what's come out tonight about having said to General Kelly about his son, I mean, this is the kind of stuff that really needs to get examined."

We're waiting for, of course, Joe Biden to take more, but maybe we're seeing why he can't. Now, Wisconsin may not be the only swing state Joe Biden has to worry about. Minnesota may not be as blue as the Biden campaign thinks, especially now that six mayors from Democrat cities in blue collar iron mining districts have declared they'll be voting for President Trump in November. In an open letter, they wrote, we didn't choose to leave the Democratic Party. The party left us. Now, that's, of course, we also know that is a statement from President Reagan. Many of us can relate to that. One of those mayors, Andrea Zupancich, mayor of Babbit, Minnesota, joins me now. Mayor, thank you so much for joining us. It's a heated time for those of us who enjoy politics. I want to ask you, have other mayors or other local officials expressed similar views to you or are they worried, to say the least, about perhaps what the economic ruin Biden would bring.

And that's what's refreshing and needed right now. And I've got emails from all over yesterday, all week, actually. And I had a gentleman call me from Georgia today, and he said he had voted for Obama the last two terms and he voted for Trump this time. He said he's sick of things being made elsewhere. We need to make all this stuff in the United States again. We need to bring this back. And that includes mining.

But why hasn't he specifically called out the factions behind the mayhem like Antifa or the Marxist group Black Lives Matter? Victor Davis Hanson has an idea. He says Biden's embrace of the radical Left has put him in a socialist straitjacket with no easy way out. Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow joins me now. Victor, thank you so much for coming on this evening. I appreciate it. Now, I love the way you put things, everyone does, it is terrific to see you, and especially during this time when people are trying to figure out why people are doing strange things like why would Joe Biden, who is known for perhaps being a generally nice guy and perhaps even a moderate, what do you mean by socialist straitjacket? Because that is very evocative. Tell us about that."

      "utterance": "Well, it works on a number of levels. For about 90 days, he really was a virtual candidate and he had a steady lead in the polls because he looked at that violence in the street where Portland, Seattle is useful. Anarchy and chaos supposedly reflected badly on the commander-in-chief. And then, as Don Lemon put it, suddenly things changed. These polls that your prior guests deprecated, there's a lot of other polls and they as well showed a gradual increase in Trump support. And then suddenly it was this, we can't have this devil's bargain anymore with the hard Left. We've got to come out and sort of say something that they shouldn't do this where they were perfectly happy to see a precinct burned down or 700, not happy, but they were willing to tolerate that. And now they're not so useful. And yet they can't really come out and attack BLM and the tactics of Antifa because they've embraced, they being the Harris and Biden team, the socialist agenda, the whole thing, the new green deal and reparations and wealth tax. And this is just the beginning, Tammy, because they have all these contradictions down the road. He's already stepped into fracking. During the primary, we're going to stop all new fracking. We're going to phase out fossil fuels. And he looks at this purple swing state paradigm and he says, wait a minute, that's going to be about as popular as supporting BLM. And now, we're going to see the same thing with guns. And he's in a paradox. And every time he contextualizes and backs off on that agenda, his base is going to say, wait a minute, we were going to use you to carry this agenda through good old Joe from Scranton. You can't renege on this deal. He's a prisoner."

You appeal to a larger group of people. And he's got his vice-presidential pick. He has the nomination. Maybe this is a time if you're going to alienate a group, maybe you alienate the group that is burning down American cities while embracing the group that is not. Is that perhaps why he's beginning to flip flop in this case and realizing that somebody has advised him incorrectly? Or maybe there's chaos?"

      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "Well, he's sort of kind of maybe flip flopping, he doesn't really condemn the violence, he says this on the one hand and on the other. And the reason is that what you said is perfectly logical. The center of gravity in the Democratic Party is Silicon Valley, Hollywood, corporate America. This very hard Left, BLM and sympathy for Antifa, the universities, the foundation. As you say, they have very little popular support, but they have enormous cultural and media clout. And if you're confined in a basement for 90 days and you don't go out to a place like Kenosha until recently, you really don't know what's going on in the world. And they were shocked that these polls started to change and now they're trying to readjust. And they say they're being told by Hollywood and the Left; you can't renege on this deal.

And that's actually true, that if you believe the polls, they do suggest that that's that he doesn't need to even campaign. So, looking at what he's actually doing is just tremendously interesting. And his campaign appears to be in a bit of a panic. He did come out strongly saying he would shut down the economy if elected, that he would require everybody to wear masks. He said nothing at his convention about the violence that's gripping cities. And now all of a sudden, he's dramatically changing his positions. I think that's because they know that these messages that he had put out are not resonating with voters and they are a bit worried about having states that we're told are totally his - there's no way that they can be lost. I think he actually is very worried about it."

He clearly told the base this socialist, hardcore radical base of the Democratic Party that I'm going to take the Obama agenda and I'm going to put it on steroids. But he knows in order to win the presidency that you have to appear to be somewhat in the middle in these purple states. And what we're actually seeing here, I try not to use the L word Tammy, but he's being incredibly deceptive. There is no question that he has signed in blood with the base of his party that we're not going to have any more fossil fuels. He has signed in blood with the base of his party that there will be no regulations on abortion. And we're taking the nuns back to court because we're going to make nuns pay for abortions. As insane as that sounds, we're going to have all of these no tax increases. There is absolutely nothing moderate or centrist about any of Obama's positions except the titles.

And sometimes they're operating with flawed information. And in this case in particular, I think the media have contributed to the chaos by not accurately describing the situation of why the police were even having an interaction with Jacob Blake, what his resisting that arrest was, what that situation was like.

The school is offering a writing seminar for first year students called How to Overthrow the State, where it will place each student at the head of a popular revolutionary movement aiming to overthrow a sitting government and forge a better society. It also will have each student produce a manifesto. Joining me now is exactly who we should be hearing from on this, is Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and author of The MAGA Doctrine. Charlie, it's fascinating, you'd think that maybe they've always had this course and they just called it something else, considering what's going on in American cities these days. But it's one thing to ask students to learn about history and about what happens even after there's revolutions like in Cuba or in Russia or even in Venezuela. You're going to deal with murdering revolutionaries like Che Guevara. And it's something else obviously to act as if they are one or putting people into a position asking them to relate to that attitude. What are your thoughts on this?"

      "utterance": "It's rather incredible and Tammy, if people are wondering where the unrest in our cities stems from, we have an instructional course that you can spend $74,000 a year at Washington and Lee to go learn how to overthrow your country. If you want to see where some of this insurrection is actually the root cause of it, it's in our universities. In New York City back during the beginning, parts of the unrest when BLM Incorporated took over the streets of Manhattan, two individuals that both had passed the bar that went to Fordham University, Princeton and NYU law, they were arrested for throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers. And dare I say, Tammy, what happens on college campuses happens in the entire American culture, it doesn't stay there. And now you see in just vivid color how to overthrow the state. When you send a kid to a college campus, you might be playing Russian roulette with their values. And even worse than this, Tammy, you might be training them to overthrow your government. It's hard to even say."

      "utterance": "And Charlie, we did contact the university. This is what Washington and Lee University told \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Quote, \"Course titles are designed to attract the interest of entering students, but the courses themselves all stress and are focused on the importance of persuasive writing. The goal of the course is to teach students with an interest in history to write well and persuasively, not to overthrow the government.\" Charlie, I don't think people are worried about these students rising up, but clearly this course, and despite their statement, which seems a little interesting to me, because you could create that with any kind of assignment when it comes to making social change or being persuasive. But this really seems to be normalizing the ideas overall of mass murdering Marxists that have run around the world. Would you agree?"

      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Do you get an A if you're most like Fidel Castro? Is that the grading curve? Do you get a better grade if you make a more persuasive argument to create a revolution? And here's the other thing, I think, to go a level deeper here, why is this not considered controversial, or the university doesn't back away from it, yet if they were to have some sort of course, I don't know, defense of western civilization, how to preserve the American Republican, why America is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world, that would actually be probably more controversial than a course, whether it be provocative or not in nature to try to attract interest in students, I think is a pretty poor excuse to be perfectly honest, to try to get students to even indulge in the idea of overthrowing the state. And on a college campus, if it's mainstream to even entertain insurrection, and it's controversial to have appreciation and respect for the culture, that is when you know college campuses have lost their way."

For that we turn to Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor, author of the forthcoming book \"The Spider Who Saved Christmas.\" Raymond, they tried to keep old Joe down, down below, for as long as possible. But what happened?"

It's like the flowers bursting forth with color and vibrancy, and the birds are chirping always behind him, and the bees are buzzing. But then it seems like autumn comes right away. It's like spring comes like that, and then it's autumn right away, and things start deteriorating."

Now, Laura, in an attempt to salvage support because these polls have been sliding, team Biden has now restricted Joe to heavily edited, campaign produced conversations with his running mate, and scripted address without questions. Here he is in a speech to the National Guard recently that got little attention for obvious reasons. I love this home edition of the West Wing pressroom on the back patio."

But this runs to my primary thesis -- people vote based on the vitality of a candidate and the impression they leave on him or her. When you watch Joe Biden -- and forget what he's saying. When you watch him, there is a diminishment here. And the more people see him, the more he goes out -- he went to Pittsburgh this week, the crowds turning out for him were like a handful of people. It looked like they were looking for a bus or something. There were like 12 people standing out on the curb, that was the crowd. Enthusiasm is down. the more people see Biden, the more addresses like this he gives, the tighter these polls are going to get, and they're going to start to invert. Watch."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Not only did Joe Biden not get any bump from the DNC, that extended Zoom call may have actually hurt him in the polls in key swing states. Back in July, a Monmouth poll showed Biden leading Trump in Pennsylvania by 13 points. But now it finds his lead withered the just four. Joining me now to unpack all of this is John McLaughlin, Trump 2020 campaign poster, and Tom Bevan, you see him on social media, a favorite of ours, cofounder and president of a Real Clear Politics as well. Welcome, gentlemen. Now, tom, is this all temporary? Obviously, things can change dramatically. This is an indication that it can. And if the race, if the election was next week, these could be taken seriously. But I also thought polls indicate less of something that gives you an exact science or an exact view of something and more of an indicator of a trend. Do these numbers suggest that that is a bigger shift that is happening here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Certainly, polls give you a snapshot in time, and if you compare a poll, their current poll to their previous poll, that will give you an idea of a trend. The polling, I think, in the broader picture, from the day that the DNC first started, August 17th to today, Joe Biden has lost about a half-a-point nationally in our Real Clear Politics average, and he's lost about one point in the top six battleground states. He is, in fact, exactly where Hillary Clinton was at this point four years ago in terms of her lead in the battleground states. So I think the polling, the state polling post conventions has been a bit of the mixed bag. There's been some good polls for Trump. There's a good one out today in Florida, for example, Quinnipiac showing him getting a big bump with African-Americans and leading Biden among Hispanics. You mentioned a good poll in Pennsylvania. He's also had some polls, some Fox News polls, actually, in Wisconsin and Arizona that were not so good. So it's sort of a mixed bag at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Yes, we've gotten a look, John, at some of the internal Trump campaign polling first obtained by The Daily Caller, and of course you would know about this. But here is what they found voters care about most - - 20 percent still say it's the economy and jobs, 16 percent said fighting COVID, but only three percent and four percent respectively care most about law and order and racial injustice. So it doesn't mean they don't care about those issues, it's obviously just about if you have got to order them, jobs and the economy clearly would matter the most. John, what does this mean for Trump, and that the looting and the violence seemed to rank so low on this list? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: Just one technical point, that poll is from the pro-Trump super PAC, not the internals for the campaign."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCLAUGHLIN",
      "utterance": "But I read the same story, and the issue agenda is moving towards President Trump. From the day that Joe Biden signed that unity statement with Bernie Sanders, he picked Kamala Harris, their convention was an infomercial for us. President Trump's convention was great, it was positive, great contrast. And with Tom, he's got a lot of polls on his averages that are skewed. Like that Fox News poll that he mentioned in Arizona, you know how many Democrats in that poll? Forty-six percent. The exit polls from 2016 are 28 percent. Where did the 18 percent extra Democrats come from? There's a lot of skewed polls. The polls that are taken right, like in Pennsylvania, Rasmussen Reports had us tied today. And that Quinnipiac poll, they are coming around and these other polls are coming around where in Georgia, Landmark poll had us up at seven points. So President Trump is steadily gaining every day and moving ahead in the battleground states."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "So Tom, he makes a very good point, this is one that Trump supporters have made a lot, which is that Democrats are over polled or that they are skewed. But this does not do any favor to the Democrats either, because then you're moving forward with a completely wrong view of where you stand, which I think was part of Hillary's major problem in 2016."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "I think that's right. Listen, in those six battleground states, President Trump in the final analysis overperformed the polls by about 2.8 percentage points. So let's just assume for the sake of argument that he's going to do that same thing and he's going to overperform by 2.8. That would lead him to win a state like Michigan, for example, where he's close. It would lead him to win North Carolina. The problem is he would lose Florida right now because he only over performed the polls there by one percent of he's trailing by more than that. So really, if you look at the electoral map, he's got 36 electoral votes to play with and still win the election, which means he could lose two of those three upper Midwest states and still win the election so long as he wins the rest of the states, Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina. And those are right now toss-up states."
