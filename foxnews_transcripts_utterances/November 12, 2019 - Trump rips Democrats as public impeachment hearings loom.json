How did it make you feel? It's going to be basically group therapy in which the shrink is going to be asking the children, how mean was your daddy? And Trump being the daddy. This is why to your point yesterday about how the media had to change the language, Anderson Cooper, I think it was last night, said that Trump was orchestrating a shakedown. Now, how do you orchestrate a shakedown in public when you want Ukrainian officials to publicize it, and the person being shook down is completely unaware they're being shook down. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think they realized the quid pro quo is a no-go. They're desperate for new language, and this is going to fail. So the best that the media can do right now, because this isn't really about -- just about the Democrats, it's about the media who's been selling this, they're still hoping that we all suit up and take this game seriously because they're taking it seriously. They want us to. But you need to look at impeachment as a junkie dancing on the street corner in his underwear. It's their experienced, it's not yours. It's what they're living, but it's not yours. So the media's strategy is preventative intervention. CNN is trying to get the public to be so interested in this. Please, this is so important, but it's not happening. It's not happening. Everyone knows it's just going to be about people whining about a phone call. This thing is going to peter out in an hour.",

So before it was popular to say that President Trump was the only one attacking Hunter Biden, the media was actually doing expose on this. And as we pointed out before, the Obama campaign actually looked into some of this and Joe Biden got very upset that they were kind of circling around to see maybe what caused a problem for the Obama campaign. But why wouldn't someone like Hunter Biden want to come in front of the committee, voluntarily, to clear his name? He's been accused of a lot. There has been -- there've been a lot of rumors about his dealings.

The Daily Northwestern, the student paper for Northwestern, published a hilariously pathetic apology to activists after covering a speech on campus by Jeff Sessions. Activists felt the event shouldn't be covered because they prefer that their opinions only be heard. The cowardly paper caved like a cheap tent, apologizing for sending a reporter to cover the event in doubt. Pathetically that from now on, they'll only cover stuff that doesn't hurt their feelings. Think about that, a newspaper apologizing for reporting the news. That's like a dentist apologizing for filling a cavity, or me for filling you with such great knowledge. It's another example of how the lunatic fringe has silence dialogue by smearing it as hateful or harmful. Mind you, the loudest worst kinds of expression, sometimes even violent, comes from these wimpy twerps. Yet, they don't see their psychic violence as harming other people. Why is that? It's college of corpse rotting from within. And so, while the paper pretends to cover news, it will be the news that the activists approve of. Meaning the paper's editors, they just quit their jobs and handed it over to the activists, which may be why real journalism is dying, now that's a stressful new story which will probably go unreported, too.

Those are the people that are causing the major problems. Apocalyptic wastelands don't happen overnight. Those 10 cities didn't happen overnight. It takes days, months and years and then it becomes such a huge problem you don't know what to do to it. You don't know what to do. It's a forfeiture of responsibility by the bureaucrats to help people in need. But you said is that a solution. And yes, there is. We are seeing progress in San Diego and in Austin, Texas, which is an effort to clear the homeless and get them to state owned land where they can actually camp. There is an organization called Sunbreak Ranch which people should look up, which is helping with this idea of getting the homeless to a place where then you can have the medical facilities, the cleaning facilities, all the stuff you can - that you need to get people kind of healthier and maybe they can go to the next step. The problem is a location solution, it's a location problem. We can't have them in underpasses. You've got to take them out. You've got to put them into buses, get them to this other place and then clean and then figure it out from there. That's the solution.",

It's not going to be that interesting because it's about a phone call, it's about a president doing his job and it's about the opinions about whether it is appropriate or inappropriate. It's about opinions. So the Democrats -- here's my prediction, they're going to do their best to draw out the emotion by using questions like, did you feel threatened? How did it make you feel? It's going to be basically group therapy in which the shrink is going to be asking the children, how mean was your daddy? And Trump being the daddy. This is why to your point yesterday about how the media had to change the language, Anderson Cooper, I think it was last night, said that Trump was orchestrating a shakedown. Now, how do you orchestrate a shakedown in public when you want Ukrainian officials to publicize it, and the person being shook down is completely unaware they're being shook down. I think they realized the quid pro quo is a no-go. They're desperate for new language, and this is going to fail. So the best that the media can do right now, because this isn't really about -- just about the Democrats, it's about the media who's been selling this, they're still hoping that we all suit up and take this game seriously because they're taking it seriously. They want us to. But you need to look at impeachment as a junkie dancing on the street corner in his underwear. It's their experienced, it's not yours. It's what they're living, but it's not yours. So the media's strategy is preventative intervention. CNN is trying to get the public to be so interested in this. Please, this is so important, but it's not happening. It's not happening. Everyone knows it's just going to be about people whining about a phone call. This thing is going to peter out in an hour."

The question about Hunter Biden is an interesting one, because before this phone call was released and the complaint was filed, the New Yorker ran that piece on July 1st asking the question of whether Hunter Biden was going to derail his father's campaign because of all the corruption allegation in Ukraine. So before it was popular to say that President Trump was the only one attacking Hunter Biden, the media was actually doing expose on this. And as we pointed out before, the Obama campaign actually looked into some of this and Joe Biden got very upset that they were kind of circling around to see maybe what caused a problem for the Obama campaign. But why wouldn't someone like Hunter Biden want to come in front of the committee, voluntarily, to clear his name? He's been accused of a lot. There has been -- there've been a lot of rumors about his dealings. It seems like he would take the opportunity to go and clear up the Biden campaign of any wrongdoing to say that this call really was about going forward in using your political power as the president to go after political opponent. But instead, he's not voluntarily doing it. Adam Schiff is blocking him. And Adam Schiff is refusing to bring any Republican requested witnesses, which shows that they're not interested in a fair process, especially after the vote was so party lines in terms of moving the thing forward."

And if he backs Deval, it's over for Biden. I think Bloomberg and Patrick are looking at the party and they're -- it seems like a generic alternative to the real thing. Like they want -- you want Coke but this is RC. You want Porsche, this is a Miata. You want Letterman, it's Seth Meyers. I think the Democrats are waking up about the crowd now.

And if Joe Biden is imploding then there is a vacuum, and then you have a lot of people say, you know what? I could span in that middle. But for the moment, Joe Biden is not imploding in terms of the national polls. The closest you can come to this, Katie, is to say, well, I see that he's not number one in Iowa, and so, is he going to win Iowa? What is it mean if he loses Iowa? What does it mean if Bernie, you know, home state kind of advantage, and New Hampshire carries it? But to my mind, I think what we're really witnessing here, the real story is that the rich, from Bloomberg to Bill Gates, all these Wall Street guys writing in the papers, from the Wall Street Journal to the New York Times, oh, my God, Elizabeth Warren. Oh, my God, what if Elizabeth Warren wins? They are heavily invested in making sure that she implodes and that's what's going on. They're pushing people into this race."

Activists felt the event shouldn't be covered because they prefer that their opinions only be heard. The cowardly paper caved like a cheap tent, apologizing for sending a reporter to cover the event in doubt. Pathetically that from now on, they'll only cover stuff that doesn't hurt their feelings. Think about that, a newspaper apologizing for reporting the news. That's like a dentist apologizing for filling a cavity, or me for filling you with such great knowledge. It's another example of how the lunatic fringe has silence dialogue by smearing it as hateful or harmful. Mind you, the loudest worst kinds of expression, sometimes even violent, comes from these wimpy twerps. Yet, they don't see their psychic violence as harming other people. Why is that? It's college of corpse rotting from within. And so, while the paper pretends to cover news, it will be the news that the activists approve of. Meaning the paper's editors, they just quit their jobs and handed it over to the activists, which may be why real journalism is dying, now that's a stressful new story which will probably go unreported, too.

Those are the people that are causing the major problems. Apocalyptic wastelands don't happen overnight. Those 10 cities didn't happen overnight. It takes days, months and years and then it becomes such a huge problem you don't know what to do to it. You don't know what to do. It's a forfeiture of responsibility by the bureaucrats to help people in need. But you said is that a solution. And yes, there is. We are seeing progress in San Diego and in Austin, Texas, which is an effort to clear the homeless and get them to state owned land where they can actually camp. There is an organization called Sunbreak Ranch which people should look up, which is helping with this idea of getting the homeless to a place where then you can have the medical facilities, the cleaning facilities, all the stuff you can - that you need to get people kind of healthier and maybe they can go to the next step. The problem is a location solution, it's a location problem. We can't have them in underpasses. You've got to take them out. You've got to put them into buses, get them to this other place and then clean and then figure it out from there. That's the solution."

Finally, your next long layover could be an opportunity to get in a good workout, some airports are adding fitness facilities including gyms, yoga rooms and walking paths, so you can burn some extra calories before taking off.

Also, the airport - when you're at the airport that's your hall pass when you could say you know what, I'm going to have Prosecco at 8 AM with steak and eggs because I'm stuck here and you can actually do a pub crawl at the airport and burn it off while you're walking around from the terminals."

Sean Spicer was eliminated from Dancing with the Stars. Unfortunately, we will not be seeing this great conservative dancer cut a rug on live television anymore. I guess the votes from the American public were not enough to overcome his horrible scores from the judges. And we are all going to miss his ridiculous green shirt. Can we see the green shirt? There it is. We love you, Sean. All right, Dana Perino."

They've been attacked by a gaggle of wild turkeys. This is in Toms River. And the townsfolk told reporters that the wild turkeys are flocking in front of cars and doorways, they damage property and even bite and attack people who try to shoo them away. And former Mets first baseman Todd Frazier. He's a resident of the terrorized town. He took his frustration to the Twitter and called on New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy to bring in State Wildlife Control. But guess what, animal control unable to do anything about it, because they are not allowed to trap wildlife. So, the turkey terrorization goes on."

You guys have it easy because you're all covered. No, but so anyway, so we're going to have a vote.

Yes, it was a meteor shower in the western sky over St. Louis. A meteorologist says the phenomenon is part of the annual torrid meteor shower. And when the meteor enters the Earth's atmosphere, well as you can see, it became a fireball or a shooting star. Ancients would say this is a sign of big things to come. Maybe like oh, Mars passing in front of the moon, in front of the sun. That's happening this week."
