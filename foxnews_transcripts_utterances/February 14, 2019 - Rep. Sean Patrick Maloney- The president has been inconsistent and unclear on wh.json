That's where our border agents said, they need to build a wall. Current law, by the way, blocks the president from building a wall in that area. This agreement will remove those limitations.

And the fact is the president could have had a deal that included that, that's what my answer was to your question. What he did instead, is he drove us down this blind alley, got a worse result for himself. He's making a bunch of Conservatives and Republicans unhappy. He's setting a very dangerous president -- precedent that will come back to haunt, haunt us, I will predict to you.

President Trump was trying to get DACA to be part of a deal. I was in those negotiations, Nancy Pelosi never wanted to have any conversations about DACA and solving that problem. If you remember, it was Chuck Schumer who over a year ago had that same offer on the table to solve the DACA problem, and he walked away from the deal after initially indicating he would support it because people on the Left went nuts because they don't want to solve the DACA problem, they wanted to remain a political pawn.

We have a crisis at our southern border, he's been trying in multiple ways to solve that. We've been able to get some money for border wall, not nearly as much as I would like to see. We approved the whole $5.7 billion last year. It didn't get through the Senate. So, here we are. In this bill, we're going to be able to approve about $1.375 billion that will allow us to build about 55 more miles of wall, especially in those areas of the Rio Grande, where you're seeing most of the real bad activity coming across. That's where our border agents said, they need to build a wall. Current law, by the way, blocks the president from building a wall in that area. This agreement will remove those limitations. But it's not as much as the president or I would like to see. So, there are other areas the president can go. And, by the way, he's going to have to follow the laws on this. But, if you look at the national emergencies act, this goes back to the 1970s, it's a law that's been on the books. And it's been used, by the way, dozens of times when it's appropriate. And here is a case where the president I think has made the case to the national -- to the country."

In this bill, over 100 miles is opened up now. Now, the one thing there were some Democrats that wanted to block that altogether or to give local mayor's veto authority. That would have been a non-starter. Ultimately, what they said was in the bill, is that they will consult. The Department of Homeland Security will consult with local officials. But in the end, after getting public input, the Department of Homeland Security can still move forward to do what they need to do to keep this country safe including building new barrier wall in that area that current law blocks them from doing. So, there is no local veto authority, Democrats tried to sneak that in at the last minute that was able to keep -- be kept out."

President Trump has made an oath to keep this country safe, and he's following through on the promise. Congress should do more.

It's a couch to denial. I agree with Senator Graham that we want to get him in. But one thing, Martha, that's not being reported is that Jim Baker who was at the time the top lawyer at the FBI, he gave testimony the House Judiciary Committee that confirms who's Andrew McCabe's account. So it's not just McCabe's award against Rosenstein, the other people that were involved in this conspiracy to utilize their power as unelected bureaucrats to oust the guy that won the election.

And so they used this illegitimate authority to go and try to disrupt the duly elected president. I mean, I went on the floor about a year ago and said these people were attempting a palace coup against the president. Most of the national media mocked me for doing so. But now you, in fact, have Andrew McCabe and Jim Baker, two people at the very top of the FBI saying that these conversations were serious and that they happened.

We received an anonymous tip that the lead investigator in this case was wearing the awards that he wasn't authorized to wear including the Purple Heart that he was holding himself out as a Special Forces officer, or excuse me, as Special Forces soldier. We had our contacts, makes some inquiries for us, found out that was in fact true and that he was charged not from the prosecution but from other government entities. We received a copy of the charges that the special agent is facing now. And the stolen valor is really important. That he was wearing awards that he did not rate, that he was doing that for personal gain, but perhaps, what's most shocking is the fact that he is also charged with making lies and official statements. That makes everything that he has said after to this point a suspect. Each investigation that he's been involved in is now suspect. When he says something, you have to give pause before you can believe what he says. Because in fact, he's admitted that he's made these lies and that he did it for personal gain."

So, the information that we received, while he's not charged with it, the information that we received is that he was holding himself out as a Special Forces soldier, that he lost his Special Forces tab, and the reason that he lost it was because he was involved in a bad shoot in Afghanistan.

      "utterance": "Well, that's true. Someone might take his place. There was an investigation that ran before this special agent was involved. That resulted in no charges. That resulted in an administrative hearing which Matt had limited due process rights that resulted in a finding that Matt did not violate the laws on conflict, that resulted him being processed administratively for either conduct unbecoming or being medically retired. This new agent contacted us in October, November of 2016 who said he was the lead agent and now has gone out and re-interviewed people, provided that results of interview to the prosecution and its upon that which they've now charged him."

And creates such a hostile environment to the point that Amazon said we do not want to work in this environment. We're gone. And they took 25,000 jobs with them. And just to show you how economically illiterate she is, she said this is in the Yahoo story, she said, the city was paying for these jobs. Frankly, if we were willing to give away $3 billion for this deal, we could just invest that $3 billion in the district ourselves. We hire more teachers, we could fix our subways. We can put people to work. There is no $3 billion! It's not that there was like, a cash subsidy to Amazon, they were tax incentives. So literally she doesn't understand that there is not $3 billion. Amazon took that the $3 billion away with it along with 25,000 jobs.

Chris' son, Thomas is carrying out his father's heroic legacy and he joins me now. Thomas, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much being here."

You know, my father is the type of person that, you know, if anyone was having trouble, they could come to him and he would be there to give them advice, you know, lead them on the way. There have been few examples throughout my time of, you know, before I went off to college and before I left that, you know, he actually brought in some students who are having troubles at home and they actually live with us for a little bit till they got back on their feet and they were able to continue on."

It's something that I've tried to live my life by, ever since I was young, you know, I've always felt that I've lived that motto in a different sense, you know, I've never put in those five words.

And you know, being a marine officer myself, you know, I've known about Travis Manion from my time in the Marine Corps. And then when I did that, you know, I just kind of did it on a whim thinking, you know, they weren't going to see it. But then, you know, next thing I know, Ryan was reaching out to me and trying to connect with me. And from there, you know, we just had a great relationship ever since then."

Police in Chicago have now responded to the ABC report that we showed you earlier that claimed that Jussie Smollett and the two men who are being questioned by police staged the attack because his character was being written out of the show Empire. According to the Chicago police who have now responded they say that the media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by the case detectives. They say they have contacted ABC 7 Chicago to state on the record that they have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate. So, the plot thickens once again on the Jussie Smollett story tonight."

The news coming shortly after a meeting today between Biden and Senator Dianne Feinstein who also says she expects that he will enter the race. And just four months to go until the first Democratic primary debate which we learned of today, an official decision is imminent setting up the potential stage for a Biden-Trump showdown in 2020. Joining me now Michael Anton, former Trump administration national security official and author of the new book \"After the Flight 93 Election the Vote that Saved America and What We Still Have to Lose.\" Good onto have you here, Michael. What do you think about Biden getting in the race?"

Also, keep in mind though, it's very rare for a sitting vice president not to seek and/or get the nomination of his party when a two-term president was leaving office. He was sort of muzzled out by the Democratic Party. I don't think he appreciated that. I think he probably wants a little pay back and wants to get his chance. But I think the Democratic Party has moved on and there is not going to be a whole lot of interest in him. Whether that's fair or unfair, I think it's just probably reality."

Forty-two percent of New Jersey residents say that he wouldn't make a good president. Thirty-seven percent disagree.

I don't think he would make a very good president either. Some of the outbursts he's had from his committee seats and elsewhere in the hallways of the Senate just seem strike me as immature and not ready for prime time. It seems to me that Kamala Harris looks to me like the strongest Democratic candidate for a lot of reasons. I think Elizabeth Warren has sort of imploded. But one thing we are going to see is if you thought the 17-candidate field among Republicans in 2016 was big."

But now we want to give you the space to tell the front part of the story. Like what is -- what are politics supposed to be about. What are American principles really what did you think was at risk?
