The L.A. County indoor mask mandate, now a half-a-dozen Olympic athletes who've tested positive for COVID-19, and we have got days to go. And then two more Texas Democrats who are testing right now positive for COVID. In case you're counting, that's five now in total. The story about the vice president, Harris, who met with all of these guys, going to Walter Reed on a routine checkup just yesterday to see if, well, maybe there's any sort of issue with her. Apparently not. She tested negative. And all of this at a time the world is gripped with fears it's spreading a lot more there than any of these actions here. The CDC just raising its warning for travelers to the United Kingdom to a level four. That's the highest level you can go, with the advice being, if you don't have to go, maybe don't. All right, let's go to Christina Coleman on all of this, as, Christina, it was certainly whipsawing stocks. I can understand them being afraid, because it could call into question the whole economic recovery. But it goes further than that, doesn't it?",

The CDC is now urging people not to travel to the U.K. or to make sure they're fully vaccinated if they have to go, this as some cities and counties put additional COVID guidelines in place. L.A. County just reimposed an indoor mask mandate for people regardless of their vaccination status, citing a recent surge in cases, including the highly transmissible Delta variant. The new mask mandate is getting a lot of pushback, since it does not align with the CDC guidance that states vaccinated people do not need to mask up. Controversy also swirling over the Texas lawmakers who fled the state to avoid voting on election reform. Five vaccinated members of that delegation have now tested positive for COVID. V.P. Kamala Harris, who met with the delegation at this event on Tuesday, went to Walter Reed Military Hospital yesterday for what the White House is calling a routine doctor's appointment. No other information was released on her visit, though a V.P. spokesperson says Harris was not in close contact with the lawmakers who came down with the virus. And as for sports, at least two members of the U.S. Olympic team have recently tested positive for COVID, including tennis star Coco Gauff and U.S. gymnastics alternate Kara Eaker. Both will sit out of this year's Games. They are two of at least 55 people now connected to the Olympics, including athletes and officials, who have tested positive for COVID since July 1 -- Neil.",

They talked about areas where there were high incidence of the Delta variant, but I don't know that that's L.A. County. And so people are wondering, because these majors places, these major population centers, California, New York, Illinois, a lot of people believe that they were too ham-fisted, that too many small businesses went out of business, that too many people lost their jobs.

It's the other way around. And the Biden administration really doesn't have clean hands here, because the Biden campaign, led by, for example, Kamala Harris, did everything that they could to talk down the vaccines as something that wasn't trustworthy under Trump or having been developed under Trump. And since then, they haven't gotten the emergency authorization lifted. So people have to be advised, obviously, of what the risks are. And they have done -- they're pushing these vaccine mandates again in Democrat strongholds like Los Angeles and New York, New York City, which only tells people that, if you get vaccinated, you're going to be under all the same mandates anyhow. So I think, before he goes after Facebook, he'd be well -- he would be well-advised to maybe looking at his own house and see what it is that they're doing in their messaging that has depressed what ought to be people's enthusiasm to get -- to take advantage of these vaccines.",

Now, you can't force the issue. But can you, can you if it spirals here, let's say, as it is in places like Asia and elsewhere and even in Britain, where they are not imposing restrictions, even as cases spike and even as the CDC is saying, because they're doing that, it is a fourth level risk, the highest risk can be for travelers to the United Kingdom?

I think the best approach, especially in a free society, where we have a First Amendment and our theory that we proceed on is that, in the end, good information will always outweigh and chase out bad information, you're likely to get a lot more vaccine compliance and a lot more people submitting to it if they are convinced about what the merits of it are, rather than a heavy-handed approach. I think that could be very counterproductive. But I just was -- before we started to speak, I was just looking at an opinion by a federal judge in Indiana, who refused to give the students at Indiana University the injunction they were looking for to get out of the vaccine mandate. And it's a very thoughtful opinion by a Trump-appointed judge who says, basically, there's Supreme Court precedent that goes back more than a century which basically says that the government has the power to mandate vaccines in connection with a situation where you're trying to fight off a deadly pandemic. So, based on that precedent, unless the Supreme Court changes it, there's good reason to think that the government at the state level and the federal level is going to have a lot of leeway here.",

You have got 70 percent of folks who are saying that they feel the impact of grocery prices going up; 68 percent of people are saying they feel the impact of gas prices going up.

County just reimposed an indoor mask mandate for people regardless of their vaccination status, citing a recent surge in cases, including the highly transmissible Delta variant. The new mask mandate is getting a lot of pushback, since it does not align with the CDC guidance that states vaccinated people do not need to mask up. Controversy also swirling over the Texas lawmakers who fled the state to avoid voting on election reform. Five vaccinated members of that delegation have now tested positive for COVID. V.P. Kamala Harris, who met with the delegation at this event on Tuesday, went to Walter Reed Military Hospital yesterday for what the White House is calling a routine doctor's appointment. No other information was released on her visit, though a V.P. spokesperson says Harris was not in close contact with the lawmakers who came down with the virus.

So we should expect more transmission amongst the unvaccinated, and that to some extent the vaccinated than we had last time round.

Then you start to hear it more and more on the news. And, as investors, you start to sense, right, because the idea with investing in the market is always a sort of sense where the economy is going and that's what the market reflects. And it reflects just the anxiety over maybe a potential overreaction, L.A. County being a prime example, your interview prior to this. They talked about areas where there were high incidence of the Delta variant, but I don't know that that's L.A. County. And so people are wondering, because these majors places, these major population centers, California, New York, Illinois, a lot of people believe that they were too ham-fisted, that too many small businesses went out of business, that too many people lost their jobs. And everyone -- no one wants to go through that again, right. We want to be cautious, even if it's to a fault, but not to the point where we derailed the economy."

I think Wall Street's going to start to zero in on that and then keep our fingers crossed that those -- the needle doesn't move on that. And I think, ultimately, if that doesn't happen, then you will see the markets say, OK, sort of a sigh of relief that, while highly transmissible and obviously we want to avoid it as much as possible, if it is not as deadly as last time around, maybe we won't get the same sort of restrictions and lockdowns."

So when you hear these percentages, up 60, 70 percent, these are very low levels, coming off extremely low levels. And you mentioned hospitalizations and deaths. They're very low overall. My -- I guess what I'm asking, as we go forward here, without getting wonky, the bond market was seeing yields drop a lot today. Normally, normally, that's a sign that all these inflationary pressures you hear so much talk about, that wasn't the worry, the worry, again, just today, that this could slow the economy down.

That little capsule, yes, that's where they're all be. And, yes, we call these people heroes. I don't know that the -- that is a term that really applies. These are very fortunate people that are going to get up to look at -- back at Earth through these huge windows in this capsule. Going to be a real treat. They have tested this capsule and the rocket 15 times without people in it. It has performed flawlessly. And they hope that it'll do that again. Jeff Bezos made it all happen. And he says, Neil, as he told you, I know, exclusively earlier today, that this is all about the future and about making enough money to advance the technology and get America and the world into space, maybe colonizing space. We need big thinkers like that, don't we? And we're going to see tomorrow. Hope the weather holds, by the way. It's a stormy day today out in the desert. Tomorrow, forecast is for better times.

As Jeff said, 15 unmanned tries to make sure that the first manned try tomorrow will go off without a hitch.

But, even so, the part -- the point of this is to -- over time with practice to drive down that cost. That's what happens with -- it's what happened with commercial air travel.

And it's all going to be controlled by the computer. And so it's amazing. And I think that's the right thing to do, because they have proven it through their 15 previous flights that it works.

They went through all the data that they had about the platform and report back: \"The data shows that 85 percent of Facebook users in the U.S. have been or want to be vaccinated against COVID-19. President Biden's goal was for 70 percent of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed.\" And elected Republicans have some other ideas."

Stop throwing it in people's faces. People typically have like a revolt when somebody tells them what to do. If you want people to get vaccinated at a higher rate, just provide the information, step back, and let adults manage their own lives."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so, as we told you a little earlier, the administration kind of dialing back the charges the president made against social media, particularly Facebook, that putting misinformation out there on the danger of vaccines is tantamount to killing people. But the legal back-and-forth continues as to, what is misinformation and what is a social media company's responsibility like a Facebook? Let's go to Andy McCarthy, the former assistant U.S. attorney. Andy, this is an always evolving subject. I get that. But where is this leading, let's say, Facebook?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think things have turned on their head, Neil, because the government is not supposed to be calling out the media or the social media for misinformation. It's the other way around. And the Biden administration really doesn't have clean hands here, because the Biden campaign, led by, for example, Kamala Harris, did everything that they could to talk down the vaccines as something that wasn't trustworthy under Trump or having been developed under Trump. And since then, they haven't gotten the emergency authorization lifted. So people have to be advised, obviously, of what the risks are. And they have done -- they're pushing these vaccine mandates again in Democrat strongholds like Los Angeles and New York, New York City, which only tells people that, if you get vaccinated, you're going to be under all the same mandates anyhow. So I think, before he goes after Facebook, he'd be well -- he would be well-advised to maybe looking at his own house and see what it is that they're doing in their messaging that has depressed what ought to be people's enthusiasm to get -- to take advantage of these vaccines."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, I think if he had his druthers, I mean, they would push for mandatory vaccinations. Obviously, that is a problem right there. But their argument is these spikes in cases and everything else is directly in proportion to that stopping, in other words, people not getting vaccinated, a stubborn plurality, up to a third of Americans, who refuse to. Now, you can't force the issue. But can you, can you if it spirals here, let's say, as it is in places like Asia and elsewhere and even in Britain, where they are not imposing restrictions, even as cases spike and even as the CDC is saying, because they're doing that, it is a fourth level risk, the highest risk can be for travelers to the United Kingdom? What do you do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they're going to have a lot of latitude. Neil, as far as mandating vaccines are concerned. And I would question whether that's the best approach. I think the best approach, especially in a free society, where we have a First Amendment and our theory that we proceed on is that, in the end, good information will always outweigh and chase out bad information, you're likely to get a lot more vaccine compliance and a lot more people submitting to it if they are convinced about what the merits of it are, rather than a heavy-handed approach. I think that could be very counterproductive. But I just was -- before we started to speak, I was just looking at an opinion by a federal judge in Indiana, who refused to give the students at Indiana University the injunction they were looking for to get out of the vaccine mandate. And it's a very thoughtful opinion by a Trump-appointed judge who says, basically, there's Supreme Court precedent that goes back more than a century which basically says that the government has the power to mandate vaccines in connection with a situation where you're trying to fight off a deadly pandemic. So, based on that precedent, unless the Supreme Court changes it, there's good reason to think that the government at the state level and the federal level is going to have a lot of leeway here."

The Democrats say all that spending is going to goose the economy and help everyone. Republicans say it's going to lead to stagflation and Joe Biden is another Jimmy Carter. That's a chasm between the parties, isn't it? After this."

Republicans are saying that the inflation we will be seeing will dwarf whatever gains we're getting. Time to hash that out with Lee Carter, GOP pollster, Jess, Jessica Tarlov, FOX News contributor, Democratic strategist. Jess, end it with you. That's the argument, right? This is well worth it. Prices might go up, but it's more than compensated for the gains of this spending, right?"

      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "That's always what the argument is, going back to what FDR did, who Joe Biden has said he's modeling his presidency after, because that's the kind of decisive action that we need after the last 18 months that we have had. Now, I will say that I wish we were having this discussion on a different day than today, when obviously inflation has been so negatively affecting the markets. And I'm at a bit of a disadvantage here. But I think that, if you look at public opinion, you look at the kind of infrastructure, human and technical, that we will be getting out of this, that, net-net, the American people will be happy, and that the economy is incredibly durable and will certainly survive this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, the one thing I know covering this stuff, whether you're on the left or right, Lee, is inflation rarely is transitory. It sticks around a while, sort of like me when I visit someone's house and I'm ordering pay- per-view movies, raiding the refrigerator."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I don't leave. So I'm wondering, Lee, if that's what we're looking at here and that should be a big worry for Democrats. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that, to me, is the bigger issue right now, because Biden and even Yellen today are trying to position it as temporary inflation. They're saying, it's just going to be a few months, we will get through it, we're going to get to the other side. And if it isn't, and it likely isn't going to be a short period of inflation, rather, it's going to be more prolonged, I think that they're going to have a credibility problem. And because of that promise and the expectation on the other side, I think that people are going to expect to start feeling better, when right now people are already starting to feel the impacts of inflation. You have got 70 percent of folks who are saying that they feel the impact of grocery prices going up; 68 percent of people are saying they feel the impact of gas prices going up. And so when you have that kind of an impact on your wallet, and that kind of feeling people, notice it on their day-to- day lives. And if they're promising a short-term pain for a longer-term gain, they're going to have to deliver on that or they're going to have a problem, I think, in the next couple of years, when it comes to -- time to devote."
    },

In other words, you can start with this spending that will propel that and put it on steroids. And this country does have a history of doing that sort of thing, too. So I'm just wondering how the Democrats you talk to are playing that out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Well, everyone's thinking about the midterm elections, which are right around the corner, because we live in a perpetual cycle of running for office and fund-raising and pitching everybody."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "And that's a concern for this, especially for Democrats and Republicans, because if the Republicans sign on to a bipartisan infrastructure bill, then they own this as well, whereas they can't just say, hey, this is the Democrats' fault. And the Democrats will have the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which is hugely popular, and then we're both sitting there with this infrastructure pile in our lap, saying, like, no inflation, it's this guy's fault."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, real quickly, Lee, Republicans are hardly ones to judge anyone on spending. I mean, obviously, it's picked up the pace here, but it's a bipartisan binge. I'm just wondering how it does sort out. And average Americans, if they keep seeing these high prices, they're going to fret, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think it's going to have -- I think it's going to have an impact. But I think, even if it's a bipartisan plan, I think it's still the Democrats' plan, and they're going to have to own that when it comes time to the midterms."
