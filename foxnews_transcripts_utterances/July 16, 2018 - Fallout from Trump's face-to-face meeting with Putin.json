And President Trump tweeting from Airforce One today, as I've said today and many times before, I have great confidence in my intelligence people. However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past. As the world two largest nuclear powers we must get along, Helsinki, 2018, is the hashtag.

He's trying to leave the past behind and he's trying to build relationships knowing that you cannot trust a lot of these people. He could have talked tougher but it will never be tough enough for most people because they see him as a salesman. But forget about the talk. Look at the actions. If you want to strangle, you know, Putin's Russia, a public spat isn't going to do it. What you're going to do is you're going to go after their financial pipeline, and you're going to have sanctions, and you're going to arm Ukraine. So, if the idea -- he is Russian's -- I don't know, stooge. He may be the worst Russian stooge ever because he's been tougher on them than Obama has. So the thing is, yes. Could have been tougher, could have been tougher, but he wouldn't make anybody happy, and this is who he is. He's trying to create relationships. This is no different than North Korea. It may work.

He was very critical during the primary about the WMD fiasco when all the intelligence agencies said Iraq had them, they didn't, and we lost a lot of blood and treasure in that desert. And now he's got the former DNI director, former CIA director, former FBI director, all kind of scheming against him during his candidacy and then afterwards, throwing spies in there, listening to phone calls, and actively undermining him during the early stages of his presidency, so that's where he is.

So, basically, what's he's done, he said -- the stick has gotten bigger, here are the carrots. If you want these carrots, you can have them and it will be really great experience, but if you don't want them, this is the stick. This is exactly what he did with North Carolina -- North Korea. I guess what makes me laugh is that peace seems to be breaking out all over. And a lot of people who normally would be for that are against it, and it's like the champions of dialogue are getting crushed by the dialoguer in chief. He's actually better at this. Again, he's the good cop with his words. He's the bad cop with his deeds. You've got sanctions, expulsion, and you've got the buildup of this amazing military. You know what?

That was before Putin decided to do things like invade Georgia, and I remember at that 2008 Olympics when they had the last meeting -- last time they ever spoke was when Vladimir Putin said, well, you know, -- hot-blooded and I'm hot-blooded too, and the president said no, you're cold-blooded. And that's the last time they ever spoke. Then Obama comes in and then they have the reset. But don't forget, it was Romney in the debate talking about Russia and he was also ridiculed, but not just by the media but by Democrat who thought that this was so foolhardy. I do though think about if the shoe 6were on the other foot, if Trump had just lost the election and we found out that Putin was trying to help Hillary, and he had gotten into the RNC, and this conversation might be very different. But I feel like the frustration, for me, was for him today was this missed opportunity to say this is an attack on all of us and we know what you're doing, and you're not going to get away with it again, and that would have been enough."

What kind of an investment are we talking about in cyber security? What sort of retribution will there be if Russia continues to do this? Russian said the same thing about their systemic government run doping program. They said it didn't exist, it was a few individuals, and that was proven to be completely false. It's the same thing here. They're not trustworthy. But what do we do on our side? I think Dana hit on something really important here. If Hillary had won, you know, with or without Russian meddling which wasn't necessarily interference. And there are three different things here, interference, meddling, and collusion.

Five years ago Ukraine was totally comy -- you know what I mean, totally pro- Russian.

Third, you have to ask why they care so much about us and about our immigration concerns. It's because these protesters are leftists first, countrymen second. As with all socialists, the cause always outranks any patriotism. But what of the giant Trump balloon? The media made it seem so huge, but I think I won something like that at a county fair.

If Montenegro, which is a new member of NATO, is attacked, my son is obligated, America is obligated to go defend Montenegro. Why is that -- maybe that's a great idea, but tell me why that's a great idea. How is that in America's interest to extend a security guarantee to Albania? I mean, is it? If so, tell me how?

I think of course they're trying to interfere in our affairs. They have for a long time. Many countries do, some more successfully than Russia. Like Mexico, which is routinely interfering in our elections by packing our electorate. So those are our concerns. I just don't -- I honestly don't understand why we need to believe that Russia is the sort of primary issue of American political life. That seems kind of nuts to me. Maybe you disagree with Trump, which is totally fine, but the idea that where you are on Russia is the defining question, like, that's kind of demented, actually. Because it's like No. 115 on the list of real concerns, at least in my mind. Maybe I'm the demented one. But that's my opinion."

And they're like, \"Let's keep this going for as long as we possibly can.\" That said, Democrats are super good -- I keep reminding people that they're very, very good at registering new voters.
