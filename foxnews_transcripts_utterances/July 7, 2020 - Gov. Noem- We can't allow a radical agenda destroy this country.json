We had a bit of a sell- off here, after a big run-up, a lot of it based on these virus, coronavirus concerns, and where things are going.

Stanley Erck is the Novavax CEO and president, joins us right now. Doctor, first, congratulations on this news. Obviously, it reflects tremendous faith in what you're coming up with. The timing of this is interesting, too, that it would cover potentially up to 100 million doses by early next year. So, tell us where you stand with this.   STANLEY ERCK, CEO, NOVAVAX: Well, we started -- we started the project in January, and when the -- when the gene sequence was announced, and we started cloning the gene and making the vaccine construct then.

Some governors might take exception, Republican and Democrat, to the notion it is politically advantageous to keep them closed or to delay their opening right now. For many of them, it's proven a huge hassle and a controversy with parents, who want to see their kids back in school as well. So we're monitoring that very closely, on the same day that Andrew Cuomo in New York was saying he too would like to see schools reopen in the Empire State.

But, literally, all day today, the Trump administration has been making the case that in-person classes, in-person classes for students, that should be the goal. And they say it is good for the students, but also good for the entire U.S. economy, Neil, because it means that their parents can go back to work -- Neil."

And then think of what's happening at the college level, as schools like Harvard are looking at virtual classes this fall, albeit at the same $50,000 price tag. So, a lot of parents look at that and say, wait a minute, which -- which way should we go?

      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, let's look at Florida first. The executive order there says all brick-and-mortar schools, public and private, must reopen this fall for five days each week. But that order then depends on whether the local health department deems the school safe. And elsewhere in the country, in many cases, the decision to reopen will be up to individual school districts. No governor has yet to definitively state that he or she plans to keep schools closed this fall. The CDC director says school reopening decisions will be based on location. And at least 39 states have released reopening guidelines for districts to consider. California, for instance, is encouraging its 10,000 public schools to consider a mix of online and in-person classes. In Beverly Hills, for example, parents will get to choose between a school year entirely online or one that alternates at home and in class each week. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo has ordered the state's 700 districts to first decide for themselves if they should reopen and then, if so, come up with a plan on how they will get that done."

But Denmark actually reopened its schools successfully mid-April by emphasizing social distancing. Class sizes were reduced drastically and times -- and times were staggered. Kids ate lunch alone, and there were zones added to playgrounds, so children would only interact with a small number of their peers. None of the decisions are easy. The vast majority of parents, obviously, Neil, like the president, support full reopening of schools, but, equally, no parent wants their child getting sick. And then there are the teachers and administrators too to consider, many of whom will obviously be in a much higher risk bracket than the kids. Bottom line, Neil, this is going to be anything but easy for anyone -- Neil."

But I will tell you, for the majority of America who maybe can't afford to live in Beverly Hills, continuing online may not be an option, because it is extremely important to get those children back to school. But, Neil, we have to do it in a very smart way and safe way. That being said, we know that children are less severely and less often affected by COVID-19. However, the question really does still linger about what role they play in viral transmission. Those studies that you were talking about that those that were reopening schools, but then they had to close down again because of increased virus transmission, they didn't actually prove that it was in the school and the children that was actually causing that viral transmission, rather that there were just increased local cases, which is what we have been doing here in the United States. When you have a flu outbreak, we have proven that proactively shutting down schools does actually decrease transmission. Whether or not that's going to be the same for COVID-19, that may be our normal. But, moving forward, Neil, we heard the first lady earlier saying that the mental health and the development of our children needs to be taken into consideration, just as much as the physical health."

I do think that there is a role for the World Health Organization in our fight against public health and global pandemics. So, severing those ties, I'm not actually sure if there are stipulations in place, if this is something that is going to happen if metrics aren't met. I don't necessarily know the details there. But I can tell you that the World Health Organization does play a vital role when it comes to the public health of our world.

I think that this is putting forth a very strong message from the United States, saying that they want fuller transparency see when it comes to the World Health Organization. They're questioning the ties, potentially, to China, the largest donor to the World Health Organization. I think it brings forth a lot of questions. I certainly don't think it is necessarily an answer. But I think that more people need to look into this and figure out how we can all come together, work together to make the World Health Organization more transparent, more forthcoming, and make sure that they're equally representing all bodies, not just their highest contributor."

It's not necessarily the same dire situation as we saw here in the Northeast. Could they get to that point? It's possible, but I'm hoping not. The good news is, Neil, that it is a younger population. They have fewer people on ventilators. However, you also have to remember that they started their elective surgeries that were potentially held off for the last few months.

Perhaps those shutdowns in some of those areas that weren't being hit that hard should not have been done. That's, unfortunately, something that we're going to have to move forward. I think that move -- they're going to have to look at each case on a case-by-case basis and see, is this something that needs to be done right now, while we're having decreasing beds? As of right now, there's certainly -- no one's without a ventilator that would need one. No one's without a bed that would need one. It's just something to keep a very close eye on."

I'm thankful that the president made the statement that he made in his speech about protecting Mount Rushmore and other monuments across the country.

It's about policies that are good for the American people, and that we can't afford to let a radical agenda, which is a political agenda designed to destroy this country, gain any foothold.

And I think it's incredibly important that we do what we can to mitigate the spread of this virus. But we also know that we can't stop it. And the science that we're learning about it is changing consistently. And it's very mixed in some areas. So, what I'm telling people is, I will give you as much information as I possibly can, and allow you the opportunity to make decisions that help your family, keep them safe, run your businesses, protect your customers, and also your employees, and put food on the table and a roof over your head."

And I'm wondering. Since a number of Republican governors and mayors are in that group that says, we're not quite sure yet, do you think that's a valid response, to say that those who are concerned about opening schools in the fall are somehow doing it for some political gain?"

And we did that, based on the fact that, when kids went home from school when this virus hit our country, that, overwhelmingly, we didn't have great contact with them. We had 20 to 30 percent of our kids in South Dakota that didn't check in once with their teacher, with the administrators.

Five were killed, Neil, including that 8- year-old girl riding in a car with her mom. The number of people shot in Atlanta was up 104 percent this June, compared to last June, Governor Kemp writing: \"Peaceful protests were hijacked by criminals with a dangerous, destructive agenda. And this lawlessness must be stopped and order restored in our capital city.\" Now, violence also continues in Chicago. According to local reports there, 19 people were shot, four killed just last night, this after a brutal long weekend in which we saw 87 people shot, including two kids.

Under Georgia law, and, actually, under the law of just about every state in the union, the governor cans supersede law enforcement and bring in state assets, whether it's state police or, in this case, the National Guard. I recognize it can be a little fearsome to see people in military garb and military equipment in the street. But the governor has the power to do that, if he believes that local officials are unable to maintain law and order. Now, in this case, there's a bitter rivalry. Well, we have our own rivalry in New York between Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. But the rivalry between Governor Kemp and Mayor Bottoms is even more severe. And, of course, there are racial overtones to it as well. The majority of the city is African-American, as is the governor -- as is the mayor -- excuse me -- and the governor is white. The mayor is saying, we don't want the National Guard here. The governor is saying, well, you can't or won't maintain order, whether it's for political reasons or because you don't have the assets or the competence, and so I'm going to do so.

I don't know whether he is expecting to get fired, but, so far, he's still in the job. But he's angry at the fallout this has had on his men and women, saying that they feel ostracized.

And then delegates will meet in other satellite conventions around the country. But now there's talk that those might not even happen. The Democratic Party is really weighing just how much to do in person and how much to do virtually. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, they are going forward with a convention of sorts. President Trump will be in Florida accepting his nomination. And then the delegates will be meeting, doing party business in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was originally where they were set to have their convention.

They're trying to figure out how to make it as safe as possible, but still have people gathering in person, whereas Democrats, who have run sort of -- Joe Biden is running against President Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic, have to figure out how close they want to go with him, if they're going to try to also hit him on the topic."

Meet the company and the man behind it that got that, and apparently has got something very close to a cure, or at least a treatment, for the coronavirus. Stanley Erck is the Novavax CEO and president, joins us right now. Doctor, first, congratulations on this news. Obviously, it reflects tremendous faith in what you're coming up with. The timing of this is interesting, too, that it would cover potentially up to 100 million doses by early next year. So, tell us where you stand with this.   STANLEY ERCK, CEO, NOVAVAX: Well, we started -- we started the project in January, and when the -- when the gene sequence was announced, and we started cloning the gene and making the vaccine construct then. And then we do what we have done for many times over the past seven or eight years, is, we started putting that vaccine into mice. You have to show safety, immunogenicity."

      "utterance": "And then you -- and we were successful in that, then moved up to the next class, which is up to non-human primates. And, probably, the most important study we have done, the most important data we have is the data that we have from a baboon study, where we dosed the baboons and showed that we got very high levels of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses. And so -- so that almost always translates to what you see in humans. And so, in the comparative -- in comparison of all the different vaccines, I don't see the data from the other companies, but, apparently..."

      "utterance": "... the U.S. government and Gates Foundation and CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, all saw the data and said that this is -- this is one we should fund. So, you need to do two or three things. You need to show safety. You need to show that it makes an immune response that you can predict is efficacious. And you also need to be able to scale it and have it be stable. And that's how we designed our vaccine. And so stability is probably one of the leading features of it is, is that you can scale it up to a very large scale, and it can be stable at room temperature for days, and in a refrigerated state when stored. So it's got all the features of a vaccine that you would like to have. We -- I'm sorry -- where are? We're..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, what is interesting, too, about it, Doctor? Well, on that, I just wanted the timing of it, because there's another company, Regeneron, which is in advanced stages, into later-stage testing that looks also potentially promising."

      "utterance": "There are a number of companies, like Becton, Dickinson, that has a way, a test, a fast test to identify the drug, different parts, different strategies, and I know they're all moving at the same time. Is it your sense, then, that by the end of the year, there could indeed be a vaccine, let's say yours, available? And how -- given the success rate of and the efficacy rate -- generally, they look for 50 percent or better -- are you confident you have something like that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERCK",
      "utterance": "Well, we are. I mean, we have a vaccine that we can scale up. And, in fact, part of our contract, an important part of our contract is, is that, in addition to just showing the safety and efficacy in human clinical trials, we have to scale up the production, which is itself a very large project. And so -- so, we're trying to -- as a company, we're developing production capacity for the vaccine. It takes two or three different components to manufacture. And we're doing that in the U.S. under this contract. We're doing it in Europe, in Asia and India, so that we are going to have a vaccine that will have availability globally. And so, with borders closed, we will have vaccine for the world. And so how much are we going to have? Our contract with the U.S. government asks us to try to make 100 million doses by the turn of the year. So, we will start delivering those doses in the fourth quarter. And so they will be on the shelf awaiting FDA approval of the vaccine, and into the first quarter. So, it's a -- it's a race to get there, but we think we can."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "That's great news. We will see what happens. And, again, I like the way you sort of laid out, the process and how it goes. You have to make sure you do these things right every step of the way. But, Dr. Erck, thank you very, very much. Stanley Erck is the CEO of Novavax, got all this attention today, deservedly so. Some people get their hopes up, but they have been very -- sticklers about getting any -- every detail, every phase right. There are about a dozen companies right now either working in concert with other big biotech concerns or governments themselves, including in the United States, and in Great Britain and France, where they're also racing to find a cure, a treatment, a vaccine, anything and everything to put this to rest once and for all. Stay with us."

What they might be ashamed of is the $50,000 full tuition that goes along with those virtual classes.

      "utterance": "What do you think of this? So many schools that are juggling whether to open or not, but, in Harvard's case, it's going to be virtual, but we're going to still charge you the same. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "It makes zero sense when you're talking about anything. Could be school. Could be anything. This is not the Harvard of the past. It's not the same thing. So they're charging the same price for a completely different product. That's unfair. I can't believe anybody would actually go and pay this amount. I mean, if you're going to be spending $50,000 on anything, it's better -- it's better be something that's going to at least get you off the couch. And this is not that. So think twice."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The president was ashamed that they're even doing it virtually, let alone on the tuition thing. He has said the same about governors and others who are considering postponing an in-person school year. Your thoughts on all of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Look, I think that this is a complicated situation. We haven't been in one like this before. I also think that college, even if it's in person, a school like Harvard, I think it's still too expensive, even when you do have the classroom experience. I got into an Ivy League grad school, didn't go, didn't want to take out the loan, learned skills other ways, worked hard. There are other options. I think that one good thing to come out of this is, we could move away from that model of learning, where we look at student debt and all these people struggling to pay for something, when, really, it's ultimately about the piece of paper having the prestigious name on there. And the second thing is getting to rub elbows with the people that might be in an institution like that. Now rubbing elbows is a thing of the past in general. I don't see how anyone could see this as worth it. I would like to see -- change our perspective on these things overall."

We were monitoring what the president was saying about all this. Kat, good seeing you. In the meantime, we want to bring your attention to some shifts going on in our society, not only about schooling, but where people want to live. It's something we're going to be exploring on FOX Business on Thursday, Barbara Corcoran my special guest, 1:00 p.m., talking about the trend away from big cities. That's why all of those expensive penthouses in Manhattan are going begging and why the real estate market there is tumbling, because people just want to live in the suburbs. Let us know your questions, investedinyou@FOXBusiness.com. If you're nice and you say nothing personal, we will share them.
