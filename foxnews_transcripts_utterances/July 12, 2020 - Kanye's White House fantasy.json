On Roger Stone though, particularly, I think as much as journalists profess to loathe him and despise him, he's really their ultimate fantasy.

He didn't have to wade into these waters, getting embroiled in not only the argument about the Confederate flag. But the ongoing argument about race, no -- race in sports, which brings us back to Colin Kaepernick, it would've been a lot cleaner for him messaging- wise if he had just stayed out of it.

That may be one of the reasons why I haven't been on television very much lately.\" So you have this partisan debate over whether the president is side-lining people like Fauci.  LIASSON: Well, there's no doubt that the White House has chosen not to put Fauci on television as much as they did in the beginning when he was kind of a good housekeeping seal of approval for the president. He was the scientist who was going to tell everybody what to do and how to stay safe, et cetera. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as the president has wanted to open up faster than maybe Dr. Fauci thinks that we should open, he has been pushed to the side a bit. But Dr. Fauci has also come to the president's rescue a couple times, trying to explain why the president said 99 percent of the cases are harmless.

Americans want their kids back in school. They want to get back to work and they want it to be done safely and responsibly. And the CDC has released very extensive guidelines on how to do that.

He also, I think in this context, is an elderly individual who was about to go into prison at the time of the Coronavirus and everything intended with that. These are the kinds of cases where we've seen leniency. But honestly, I think that the president would be better off focused on the kind of pardons and the kind of commutations that can actually have an impact on society at large as supposed to looking into his friends. He's used that power far less than prior presidents. In this case, you know, I wish I could have seen this kind of uproar over the President Obama's pardoning, for instance, of unrepentant murderer, Oscar Lopez Rivera and other people who he saw fit to get out of the kind of punishment that its viewed them (ph).

This is another case of it. That's why I'm sure he'll get on to more significant pardons for the rest of us.

On Roger Stone though, particularly, I think as much as journalists profess to loathe him and despise him, he's really their ultimate fantasy. And the fact that he's going to stay out of prison for four years is like their wildest dream come true, because he's going to continue talking to them. Maybe people on the outside don't realize this, but he's in constant contact with journalists. I've probably am not far out when I say that he's on text chains with probably a journalist from every single media outlet in America. If he was in prison, it would be a lot harder to keep that line of communications open. So for a lot of journalists, this is actually a boone to them, the fact that he's going to stay out of prison."

Ben, Michael Cohen, who unlike the loyal Stone turned on Trump, was just sent back to prison after a COVID-related home release after refusing to sign an agreement that he wouldn't talk to journalists or publish a book that he's working on. And the journalists are saying, well, that's an infringement of his rights, because even if he was in jail he would be allowed to publish a book or talk to journalists."

    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",

To Gillian's point, I have to say he actually just showed the other day up on Ryan Long's comedy podcast doing an extensive hour-long interview. So he really is someone who's kind of everywhere. I think in this case Cohen is someone who mishandled that situation. I think he should have gone into that with an attitude toward negotiation as opposed to refusing the deal the way that it was laid out. But certainly, there's no lack of people who want to strike while the iron is hot. Try to get books out. Try to have some relevance as it relates to the election. I think that's what Michael Cohen was attempting to do."

The extraordinarily harsh and personal nature of the media criticism of the president in recent months in the COVID era, shall we say. I wonder whether you think in light of the polling and everything that this is because a lot of pundits have concluded that Donald Trump may lose this election, and so it's OK to pile on."

Much of it is news he doesn't want to make. But the fact is his polling is down. It's down across the board. He has made some really self-destructive moves, I would say, in regards to COVID. The whole mask issue, whether or not to invite your supporters out to rallies in hot zones like Tulsa. You know, this kind of situation is -- the president doesn't need to have bad press because just regular press covering his moves is enough."

All right, Gillian, The Washington Post is quoting unnamed aids and advisors as saying that Trump is doing a woe is me lament in private that he's been unfairly victimized by the virus, the shutdown, the protests, and rallying against journalists by name. Is this news or is it just private venting by the president?"

      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, it is news in the sense that there's new sources apparently coming forward to report this stuff. But it's not surprising to anybody. The president vents about reporters by name on Twitter every single day, in press conferences. I will also say at this point it's surprising to me that he continues to do it because it's widely acknowledged, you know, in the media. I can only speak for my colleagues and I. But every time the president does that, he elevates journalists. He gives them more exposure. He gives them, in a sense, more power. Because the second he gets somebody in particular in his crosshairs, everybody pays attention to them. Everybody wants to know who they are, what they think. They want to know who their sources are. So it's surprising to me that aides haven't really sort of prevailed upon him to stop doing this and singling people out who he doesn't like by name. Because it really only helps them."

New tweet by the president, too many universities and school systems are about radical left indoctrination, not education, telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their tax exempt status. Ben, you might agree about the indictment of the schools. But a lot of journalists see this as a kind of a culture war move to aid his re- election."

This is the reality that he's in. And he is right to identify these universities as being the places that have produced the kind of people who are willing to go out as screaming in the faces of cops and pulling down statues. I do think this is something that is not necessarily the best way to go about attacking those institutions or correcting their ways in lots of different respects. Tax exemptions versus accreditation or something like that."

      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "He clearly does have a position on the Confederate flag. And this is not a situation where the press bombarded the press secretary at the briefing because they wanted to. They got dragged into this because President Trump keeps talking about it and keeps tweeting about it. Once he does that, it is their responsibility to bring it up with the press secretary. So let's get the facts straight about the order of these things. This is an unforced error for President Trump. It's a perfect, perfect opportunity for him to stay out of the fray, not make unforced errors here. He didn't have to wade into these waters, getting embroiled in not only the argument about the Confederate flag. But the ongoing argument about race, no -- race in sports, which brings us back to Colin Kaepernick, it would've been a lot cleaner for him messaging- wise if he had just stayed out of it. And then Kayleigh wouldn't have been put in that position at the briefing."

      "speaker": "DOMENECH",

Like so many other stories that end up looking -- that like, you know racial incidents at first. There was an explanation for this along the same lines as we've seen in other instances such as those ropes hung from a tree out in California. And so I think that's actually a good thing that we should take away from it. In this instance, I think the president always tries to fire away at what he views as political correctness and the problems related to it. But I want to circle back to something that Gillian just said there, which I think is incorrect. The president gave a speech at Mount Rushmore. And the next day, the Washington Post ran a front page article from Bob Costas (ph) and from Phil Rucker that lied that said right off the bat that he had given a speech defending Confederates. And that's something that they didn't correct. They didn't roll back. I think the president is actually engaged in the media on this, because the media continues to try to make this about Confederate statues and Confederate symbols when that's not what's actually being attacked. They're trying to gaslight the country and to turning this into something that is it isn't, which is -- looking at the Confederacy as opposed to attacking the people that are on Mount Rushmore, attacking Christopher Columbus, attacking the whole of America's heritage. And I think the president's very well aware of that."

First of all, even many people on the right say Bubba Wallace has nothing to apologize for, although it turned out the noose incident was not a hate crime. But in her response to reporters, Kayleigh McEnany said why have I not gotten a single question on the weekend surge in murders in New York and Chicago including children. You work for a Chicago newspaper. Isn't that a fair point?"

The president had a burr under his saddle for Chicago crime for a long time. But as I have wrote in my weekend column here, what happened to that expert on Chicago crime who was going to solve the whole problem in a week? That was what President Trump promised me and other members of the Tribune editorial board, repeated that on the campaign trail, and has yet to come up with this expert of his on Chicago crime. He loves to grandstand about Chicago crime. This is what we're seeing here again as with the Confederate, as with the Bubba Wallace incident. Ben is right. Bubba Wallace's story is a good news story. President Trump has just lost the narrative here. And going back to how he began his campaign back in Mobile, Alabama, four years ago. And this is his base, and he -- and NASCAR, the mostly white male and southern oriented constituency of NASCAR, if you will, that's Trump's base. He feels like he owns it. How dare somebody tell my friends they can't have the rebel flag flying?"

It's something that means that they're not going to be able to pour over his tax returns in the context of an election year. He has enough challenges as it is when it comes to this election. But in terms of the nuance here, I think this is another example where the rush to report about Supreme Court rulings ends up missing a lot of what's going on there procedurally. And I think in this instance, a lot of people saw this as -- were on the left saw this as a win for them and then came to realize that at least in the short political measure, it's not."

It's a victory for the presidential accountability to Congress and the other branches. Not just as a partisan victory or loss, this won't have much effect before the election.

And I think the media, the disappointment is not so much about the legal principles here, but this has been this great hunger since the 2016 campaign to find out if there's anything damaging in the president's tax returns. Obviously, we'll not find out for sometime if we ever do. Ben Domenech and Clarence Page, this time, I will wish you a great Sunday. Thanks very much for joining us."

In a memo to the staff yesterday, Fox News' CEO Suzanne Scott and president and executive editor Jay Wallace minced no words about what happened.

Neff's abhorrent conduct on this forum was never divulged in the show or the network until Friday, at which point we swiftly accepted the resignation. Make no mistake. Actions such as his cannot and will not be tolerated at any time in any part of our workforce. The disclosures were reported by CNN.

First of all, parents desperately, me included, want their kids back in school and we desperately want our kids safely back in school. But the media has also pointed out correctly that 90 percent of school funding comes from local governments and states. The president only, I think, has control of about 10 percent of it. So he doesn't have a lot of leverage. He does have a bully pulpit. The problem is that he also urged states to open up economies which people wanted, and in a lot of places, that didn't work out so well. So it's a cautionary tale for every school district that is struggling with where they're going to find the money to do the extra sanitation, the plexiglass, the masks, the extra classrooms if you have to spread kids out.

So that is something that should not be political. It should be somewhere where we all join together in the American spirit of back to work and stick-to-itiveness."

And Mara, the president also slammed Harvard University which plans to go all online for the next academic year, saying they should be ashamed of themselves and it is the easy way out. Other university systems are also planning that. Are the media buying into that criticism?  LIASSON: I don't know. Look, college is a different situation. Harvard, by the way, is having people come back to campus and go to school online. So it's not like they're keeping everybody out of school. Each school has to make these decisions for themselves. This is a tough, complicated problem. This is what Gayle said, we got to figure out how to open up safely."

Why is this book getting such a huge media ride?"

    {
      "speaker": "KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "This happens when every one of these books come out. This is obviously the first one by a relative, but there is a whole genre of books at this point of people who have been (INAUDIBLE), the behind the scenes, salacious type of thing. And I think it's the same thing every time where Trump's detractors really love to sink their teeth into it and say, wow, look at this, this guy is crazy. But I don't think it really changes the level of support among his supporters whatsoever. I think people just kind of brush it off entirely and don't even consider what's in it. So, I don't understand, these keep getting written. It's almost like a TMZ-esque genre really more than any actual sort of anything else."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Interesting analogy. The president tried to stop publication of this book, which is too much and never enough. The book -- Mary Trump writes in this book that Donald Trump paid a guy named Joe Shapiro to take the SAT for him. That helped him get into the University of Pennsylvania. Well, The Washington Post to its credit tracked down the sister of Shapiro, who is now deceased, and she said this can't be true because Joe didn't meet Donald until they were both students at Pen. So that kind of fell apart."

Sure, some of it is probably true, looks like some of it isn't. But again, the way that it's covered too is quite interesting. A lot of it is a little overblown in the way it's been covered. For example, I saw a piece in the LA Times and the headline was that horror clouds every page, right? OK, like really, like the part about how when he was a kid, he hid his brother's trucks, like not a nice thing to do, but I wouldn't call it horror, right?"

      "utterance": "Mary Trump is a clinical psychologist with a PHD. She writes Donald's pathologies are complex and his behavious are often inexplicable, he's a narcissist, and she blames this on the stern treatment of his father, Fred Sr. But I question whether her personal animus undercuts the book. I believe that if some relative of Barack Obama had published a book trashing the 44th president, there would be great debate in the media, should we really cover this, but there's no hesitation here to cover all of the dirty family laundry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right, absolutely. It's so interesting because you do have to acknowledge that obviously they don't get along. It's a spat over money, essentially, at the end of the day, that they haven't really spoken or anything like that. You do have to keep in mind who is the narrator of this. There are people who know me, who don't like me, and I wouldn't want -- wouldn't like to read their book. They probably have horrible things to say. You have to keep that in mind. But again, it's salacious, it is fun for people to read and kind of tease the president if they don't like him, but I truly don't think anyone else really actually cares or I don't see how you could."

Do you think that he -- he said that, you know, well, it's a hospital, it's appropriate. Do you think he wanted to finally put an end to all the media criticism, why aren't you wearing a mask?  TIMPF: Yeah, I think he -- I think he certainly did. He obviously -- I think that it's bad that it has become a sort of political thing. If you're a mask wearing person, you're liberal, and if not, you're conservative. It shouldn't have anything to do with it. So I was glad to see him wearing the mask and especially if you're in a situation like a hospital. And also --"

We're back with Gillian Turner. This seems pretty bogus to me. Kanye hasn't made a move to get on a single state ballot. He's had mental health issues in the past. Why so much coverage for Kanye?  GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Register with the FEC, which would be the first step he would take -- this campaign would take to show that they're serious about it. But any journalist in America who tells you they know whether he's serious or not is lying, because his own wife, Kim Kardashian, reportedly doesn't know whether he's serious. Her friends and family members have been telling People magazine, I was just reading about this, that it's unclear to her whether he's serious at all or whether he's completely unserious. So she doesn't know. We definitely don't know."

Now, on a more serious note, Ghislaine Maxwell was tracked down and arrested, charged with helping the monstrous sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein with at least three girls who were abused by the late predator. She's on an intensified suicide watch, wearing paper clothes after Epstein's jail house death. I know this is an important story. But it seems to me there is some X factor here that is really driving the coverage into the stratosphere."

Republicans or conservatives think one thing and Democrats or liberals think another. Everybody is in perfect agreement on the fact that he was a monster. Most people think, you know, it's a good thing that he's no longer walking freely on the face of the earth being a predator. So, it is interesting that the Ghislaine Maxwell storyline is following the same trend here. Mostly bipartisan support --"

Finally, the Central Park dog walker, Amy Cooper, was actually charged this week of filing a false police report in that incident in New York where she lied about an African American man, a bird watcher, who said -- she said he was threatening her. Why are the media still milking this story?  TURNER: Because it picks up on the racial -- the struggle for racial justice that's going on right now. But I like that the media is so woke that even her dog is now going to get justice. People jumped all over the fact that she was choking him inadvertently while she was yelling at this guy. Now, the dog has been taken away from her, getting put up for adoption."
