When Fauci killed science. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, during a global pandemic, he's had time to do every podcast, every live stream, and glitzy photo shoots all of them under the sun. Yet sadly, America's doctor hasn't joined us on THE ANGLE for well over a year. Although this morning, I did have the feeling he was thinking about us.",

His arguing is essentially - I'm sorry I'm howling laughing at this. \"I am the science, I am the truth.\" That's his response to his many critics, who themselves, in most cases are distinguished scientific researchers, or treating physicians? They actually treat COVID patients? The man really does think he is some kind of deity, except there was only one guy who had the standing to say, \"I am the way, the truth and the life\". And he's found in the book of John, Chapter 14, verse 6. Not on MSNBC with Chuck Todd. Of course, Fauci's pandemic preening is just the latest in a long line of outlandish deflections. In fact, we've noticed this anytime he faces legitimate questions about the science behind his pronouncements, Dr. Fauci shifts to his default mode. He kind of cavalierly brushes aside the question, then implies his critics are politically motivated. Now, when I questioned Fauci back in February of 2020 about China's lack of transparency, he gave me answers that made no sense. Unless, of course, he was interested in covering up for the CCP. Yet for the longest time, I think Fauci was able to glide by with very little pushback from his media boosters, who themselves secretly hope that COVID would kill Trump's chances last November. But now Fauci's act is wearing thin, and we see time and again, that it was he and his like-minded experts who were routinely acting against basic scientific norms. Over the past 16 months, THE ANGLE has showcased some of the brightest minds in science and medicine, who have weighed in with meticulous precision on how best to balance health concerns and they are very serious that were presented by this virus against the broader economic, educational and social needs of our citizens. Treating physicians told us about effective ways to treat the virus early and cheaply.",

So Mr. Science was not about science at all, it was about nudging.

In other words, it's medical malpractice to force vaccines on the tens of millions of Americans, probably more than that, who've already gotten protective T cells, B cells or COVID antibodies, again from previous exposure infection. My friends, this is Immunology 101. You learn this like in your first year in college if you're pre med. One study showed people infected by the original SARS virus, just to remind you of all this, they still have T cell immunity 17 years later. That was the original SARS.

And I'm not even speaking about our unconstitutional loss of personal liberty with a little to no legislative oversight. Fauci though loved the way the blue states handled things. Remember, the cozy relationship with the Cuomos? There was less freedom for people, but more power for unelected bureaucrats like him. And now data from the Oxford University compiled by Bloomberg in May confirm what we told you a year ago, that lockdowns made no sense. It found little correlation between the severity of a nation's restrictions and whether it managed to curb excess fatalities. Again, death is the endpoint, should be serious illness for this virus. Of course, the same study did find a correlation between hard lockdowns and deep economic pain, which is what Europe is facing. And we see the same dynamic here between red states that never shut down or reopened very early and blue states that stayed closed. Jobs data from April shows that eight of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates are led by GOP governors, and 10 states with the highest unemployment rates have Democrat governors naturally. And perhaps there's no issue more revealing of the Fauci fraud than the issue of face masks. The filthy Chinese made face coverings that litter the streets and clog our gutters were always about politics, and never about science.",

First of all, Fauci admitted in a newly released email in February of 2020, that masks really aren't effective, which is correct, and confirmed by a huge study on masks and influenza that the CDC had posted on its own website back in May of last year. And another recent study from the University of Louisville points out that \"Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth searches. But since Democrats in the media threw out science and facts, they throw it out long ago, we still get completely incoherent and unscientific recommendations like this one from Fauci's pals at the CDC. \"Athletic activity should be done outdoors when possible. Wear a mask outdoors when in crowded settings or during close-contact vigorous activity, like playing sports.\" Zero evidence of the virus spreading efficiently outdoors, which we knew and told you a year ago. But the anti-scientists at the CDC and Anthony Fauci simply will not let this power go. There's too much political power at stake. And speaking of power, the entire field of public health has been sadly, and I think it will for a long, long time, compromised, if not forever by the research dollars from pharma, and also the influence of the CCP. And that means Fauci is still giving China the benefit of the doubt in the virus origins. Notice how he starts this next little sound bite with \"Most scientists I know\".",

Abigail Shrier writes \"Laws in California, Oregon, and Washington placed troubled minor teens as young as 13 in the driver's seat when it comes to their own mental healthcare, including gender affirming care, and can render parents powerless to stop them.\" Joining me now is Abigail Shrier, journalist and author of \"Irreversible Damage.\" Abigail, you're something of an expert in this. This was a stunning piece, and I encourage everyone to read it to understand really what's at stake here for parental rights and the innocence of children. What do Americans need to know right now about the power of some of these state governments to take kids away from parents, or undermine their values? ABIGAIL SHRIER, AUTHOR OF \"IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE\": Right, well, what I found was that if a young teenager in Washington, the age, control for their mental healthcare is 13 and up, if they decide that they are transgender and want to announce a transgender identity, that the state and parents are on board and want to affirm that identify and immediately proceed with hormones and surgeries, the state will support them and applaud them. And if a parent takes a different tact and says, hold on, I'm not sure this is right for you, or maybe this is a last resort, then the state seems to put its thumb on the scale, and it can very quickly escalate into a threat for the parents' custody.",

They actually treat COVID patients? The man really does think he is some kind of deity, except there was only one guy who had the standing to say, \"I am the way, the truth and the life\". And he's found in the book of John, Chapter 14, verse 6. Not on MSNBC with Chuck Todd. Of course, Fauci's pandemic preening is just the latest in a long line of outlandish deflections. In fact, we've noticed this anytime he faces legitimate questions about the science behind his pronouncements, Dr. Fauci shifts to his default mode. He kind of cavalierly brushes aside the question, then implies his critics are politically motivated. Now, when I questioned Fauci back in February of 2020 about China's lack of transparency, he gave me answers that made no sense. Unless, of course, he was interested in covering up for the CCP. Yet for the longest time, I think Fauci was able to glide by with very little pushback from his media boosters, who themselves secretly hope that COVID would kill Trump's chances last November. But now Fauci's act is wearing thin, and we see time and again, that it was he and his like-minded experts who were routinely acting against basic scientific norms. Over the past 16 months, THE ANGLE has showcased some of the brightest minds in science and medicine, who have weighed in with meticulous precision on how best to balance health concerns and they are very serious that were presented by this virus against the broader economic, educational and social needs of our citizens. Treating physicians told us about effective ways to treat the virus early and cheaply."

In other words, it's medical malpractice to force vaccines on the tens of millions of Americans, probably more than that, who've already gotten protective T cells, B cells or COVID antibodies, again from previous exposure infection. My friends, this is Immunology 101. You learn this like in your first year in college if you're pre med. One study showed people infected by the original SARS virus, just to remind you of all this, they still have T cell immunity 17 years later. That was the original SARS.

And I'm not even speaking about our unconstitutional loss of personal liberty with a little to no legislative oversight. Fauci though loved the way the blue states handled things. Remember, the cozy relationship with the Cuomos? There was less freedom for people, but more power for unelected bureaucrats like him. And now data from the Oxford University compiled by Bloomberg in May confirm what we told you a year ago, that lockdowns made no sense. It found little correlation between the severity of a nation's restrictions and whether it managed to curb excess fatalities. Again, death is the endpoint, should be serious illness for this virus. Of course, the same study did find a correlation between hard lockdowns and deep economic pain, which is what Europe is facing. And we see the same dynamic here between red states that never shut down or reopened very early and blue states that stayed closed. Jobs data from April shows that eight of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates are led by GOP governors, and 10 states with the highest unemployment rates have Democrat governors naturally. And perhaps there's no issue more revealing of the Fauci fraud than the issue of face masks. The filthy Chinese made face coverings that litter the streets and clog our gutters were always about politics, and never about science."

First of all, Fauci admitted in a newly released email in February of 2020, that masks really aren't effective, which is correct, and confirmed by a huge study on masks and influenza that the CDC had posted on its own website back in May of last year. And another recent study from the University of Louisville points out that \"Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth searches. But since Democrats in the media threw out science and facts, they throw it out long ago, we still get completely incoherent and unscientific recommendations like this one from Fauci's pals at the CDC. \"Athletic activity should be done outdoors when possible. Wear a mask outdoors when in crowded settings or during close-contact vigorous activity, like playing sports.\" Zero evidence of the virus spreading efficiently outdoors, which we knew and told you a year ago. But the anti-scientists at the CDC and Anthony Fauci simply will not let this power go. There's too much political power at stake. And speaking of power, the entire field of public health has been sadly, and I think it will for a long, long time, compromised, if not forever by the research dollars from pharma, and also the influence of the CCP. And that means Fauci is still giving China the benefit of the doubt in the virus origins. Notice how he starts this next little sound bite with \"Most scientists I know\"."

There are now hundreds of thousands of patients who have been treated with hydroxychloroquine in studies, even the randomized trials, all stopped early, when combined show a reduction in (inaudible). There is no doubt about it. Hydroxychloroquine in combination with other drugs is safe and effective, and reduces hospitalization and death. And Americans should have been treated.

The only people left, the majority of people left to actually get infected are younger people. That doesn't mean it's selecting for younger people at all, by no means.

And I suspect, it's going to start leading to a whole series of lawsuits because you have governors who are clearly violating the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution was written to guarantee our rights against the government. And now your government's out here, whether it's on blocking churches from having sessions, or whether it's dictating to people, or saying which businesses can open up, or which schools can open up. And I agree with your analysis, there's something about being a liberal Democrat that just loves power. And they - it's an addiction. And they love being in charge, and they love, frankly, corruption. And so they use their power to reward their friends and punish their enemies, and to take care of their family, and to take care of their political supporters. And I think this is the largest breakdown of the U.S. Constitution in the nation's history. I'm not counting the Civil War. But I just think and in a non Civil War environment, it's astonishing, in places like New York, or Michigan, or Illinois, or California, how much power these governors have grabbed. And you're exactly right. It makes them the equivalent of a third world dictator, and it guarantees massive levels of corruption."

So - but the other thing is deeper and sicker, and you see it in the Biden administration. There's an entire generation of left-wing Democrats who have total contempt for the rule of law, total contempt for the Constitution. And I believe that is their God given right to override the Constitution, and to tell you how to live your life. And if you don't listen to them, to use the power of government to punish you.

This idea that automatically red, white, and blue is bad -- I have to tell you, I disagree deeply, bitterly with the Biden administration's decision that American embassies can fly both the Black Lives Matter flag and the gay pride flag. The American embassy should fly the American flag and only the American flag. And the Congress ought to pass -- there's a bill in called the Old Glory Bill which is very clear. The only flag we should fly at an American embassy is an American flag."

      "utterance": "Newt, thank you. Great to see you tonight, as always. And speaking of blue state tyranny, some Democrat controlled states are empowering social workers, youth shelters, and hospitals to actually rip children away from their parents. This is one of the most shocking stories I've read lately. Abigail Shrier writes \"Laws in California, Oregon, and Washington placed troubled minor teens as young as 13 in the driver's seat when it comes to their own mental healthcare, including gender affirming care, and can render parents powerless to stop them.\" Joining me now is Abigail Shrier, journalist and author of \"Irreversible Damage.\" Abigail, you're something of an expert in this. This was a stunning piece, and I encourage everyone to read it to understand really what's at stake here for parental rights and the innocence of children. What do Americans need to know right now about the power of some of these state governments to take kids away from parents, or undermine their values? ABIGAIL SHRIER, AUTHOR OF \"IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE\": Right, well, what I found was that if a young teenager in Washington, the age, control for their mental healthcare is 13 and up, if they decide that they are transgender and want to announce a transgender identity, that the state and parents are on board and want to affirm that identify and immediately proceed with hormones and surgeries, the state will support them and applaud them. And if a parent takes a different tact and says, hold on, I'm not sure this is right for you, or maybe this is a last resort, then the state seems to put its thumb on the scale, and it can very quickly escalate into a threat for the parents' custody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Can parents actually be given an ultimatum to say you either give them the -- I hate even saying it, the gender -- I think it's a complete outrage for children -- they can't get on a plane by themselves without a note from their parents, but they can do this. Can parents actually be told you do this or else you lose custody? Is that where we're headed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHRIER",
      "utterance": "Well, we're headed there I do think, because look at the laws in the state of Washington. A child age 13 up has total control over inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment. They also have total privacy rights to that mental healthcare. So parents are not entitled to know about it. And health workers and insurance companies are directly barred, by law, from disclosing that mental health treatment, gender affirming treatment to the parents, and that can include hormone treatment and anything from affirming someone's pronounce to their hormone treatments and surgeries."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "This is why a lot of mom friends of mine, Abigail, when a doctor says I want to talk to the child by herself, who are these parents that walk out of the room? I don't understand that. Who are these parents that do this. You have to stay there. You don't know what they're saying. We hope it's all fine, but I think a lot of parents are thinking about this, like thinking about undermining their family's values, or just their parental rights. And I think people have to see this. In Canada we see where this all could be headed. The \"Post Millennial\" is reporting that a warrant was issued by a judge for the arrest of a father after calling his biological female child his daughter and referring to her with the pronoun \"she\" and \"her.\" He was found to be in contempt of court. Abigail, I bet you could find a lot of Democrats today who would be just fine with that in the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHRIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, but, actually, the unfortunate thing is that a lot of Democrats are not OK. Most of the parents who call me are politically progressive. The problem is that they were a little naive about, as in the case you brought up, allowing social workers to speak alone with their kids. Sometimes social workers will show up at the school so parents won't find out about it until after the fact, and that can start a scenario that very quickly is ca late to a threat to the parents' custody."

And we still don't know the name of the officer who took the life of Ashli Babbitt. My next guest aims to change all that. Joining me now, California Congressman Devin Nunes, ranking member of the House Intel Committee. Congressman, we asked the D.C. U.S. Attorney's office about this, and the response was the attorney's office \"is in the process of making all video material to January 6th defendants.\" Congressmen, they don't say Congress will get access. Should you?"

We don't need the executive branch or the Department of Justice to give us our own videotapes. We are a separate branch of government. What's going on here is a massive coverup by Pelosi and the Democrats. These 14,000 hours should be shared across all of the committees in Congress, and the members of Congress should decide whether or not these should be released to the public. As it relates to the defendants in this case, of which so far there's only, from what I can tell, because we can't get a true reading of it, three dozen people have been charged with the breaking and entering. So there's been all kinds of promises, all kinds of hype. But if I was a defendant in that case, I would be pressing hard to get that videotape to know what the defendant actually did or did not do, because, likely, there's cameras all over the Capitol. I would think defense lawyers would want to have that information."

      "utterance": "Well, look, it's really a two-tiered system of justice that we've seeing a continual trend in by the Department of Justice over the last five years where Republicans seem to get the book thrown at them, and on other cases nothing happens. So in this case, as it involves a police officer, Capitol Hill police officer, no one's looking to see that person get doxxed. But we need to compare the Capitol police, who are a public institution, they work for the legislative branch of government, how are they different than a local law enforcement officer that continually get doxed, their names get put out there if they're involved in some type of officer-involved shooting. And I think that's what you're seeing here. It just doesn't make sense. Why when it's a Republican involved nothing happens. When supposedly it's supposedly a Democrat and Democrat constituency, they dox the officer, the officer's families get threatened. You even have NBA players threatening these police officers. Yet here we have no idea who this police officer is. There seems to be something wrong. As I understand, the Babbitt family is going to be filing a lawsuit. They should. They have a right to know what happened to their daughter."
