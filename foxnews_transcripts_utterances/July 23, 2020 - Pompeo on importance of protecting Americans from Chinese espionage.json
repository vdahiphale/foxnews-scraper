Look at these numbers. 62 percent say that today's climate prevents them from talking about what they believe with anybody. By a large margin, those who identify, though, as very liberal. This is the group who feels the most free to speak out among friends, family, whatever, about their politics. So what exactly does this tell us about the state of the 2020 race? And what is America's growing frustration with cancel culture as an adjunct to that tell us?

We're going to break that down and talk to him about exactly what he said about that. That, as China says they are not going to leave the embassy in Houston. We will get for the first time the Secretary of State to respond to them, digging in their heels at that embassy in moments. Then after that, K.T. McFarland is here with her analysis of the Pompeo interview. What's - are we in a cold war with China now? Is China been a failed experiment since 1979? All that with Katie. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But we start tonight with Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and Marie Harf, Executive Director of Serve America PAC.

Tonight we just showed everybody the latest numbers from Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. And they always say, look, we don't care. The polls aren't right. There's a lot of secret Trump voters out there, which we saw in a Monmouth poll last week in Pennsylvania. But Marc, it makes it very difficult to gauge where the country is at right now.",

In fact, there was a poll - Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania, that 57 percent of the voters there were pretty sure that some of their neighbors were planning to vote for Trump, but weren't saying it. And there's a reason for that. There's the cancel culture as it has taken hold in a way it has in recent months. I mean, think about this. Is it more or less hospitable environment for a Trump supporter to express their support for the president now than it was four months ago? I think not. So, I think that - I think there are a lot of people who won't tell a pollster that they're supporting Trump and - but are really going to vote for him in the ballot box. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We know there was a hidden Trump voter then in many of these swing states that the Fox News poll spoke to today like Michigan or Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump won by very little in 2016. So Democrats are worried about this. They really want to act like they're running from behind. I think these numbers do concern the Trump team, though. And I also think it's a really polarized time in our country. I mean, there are people on the other side of the aisle who've told me that Democrats hate America, and they hate Christianity. And that kind of language, even four or five years ago wasn't really out there. So our country is really deeply divided. We see that every day and it's a real problem. I don't know how to fix it.

The only group that feels that it's - that has - a majority feel confident about it, saying what they what they believe are staunch liberals. And the reason for that is, because there really isn't a penalty for being a liberal or for expressing staunch liberal views. You're not going to get in trouble at work for saying Black Lives Matter. You will get in trouble for saying blue lives matter. There will be repercussions for that. So I think there is - this cancel culture is going after the Right in a way that it's not over the Left.

And a rapidly changing landscape for the 2020 election. The President canceled the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention when he came out to speak to the press today. Also, we've got some brand new polling numbers for you from Fox polling that show that the President trails Joe Biden in the battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, as we are about 100 days out from the election. Mr. Trump was in a similar position, though, we should point out back in 2016, and after his very surprising victory that year there was a lot of talk in the country about who these voters in this silent majority in America could be?

      "utterance": "Could some new numbers tonight from the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute suggests that Americans are still, in fact even more so now, keeping their politics to themselves. Look at these numbers. 62 percent say that today's climate prevents them from talking about what they believe with anybody. By a large margin, those who identify, though, as very liberal. This is the group who feels the most free to speak out among friends, family, whatever, about their politics. So what exactly does this tell us about the state of the 2020 race? And what is America's growing frustration with cancel culture as an adjunct to that tell us? Marc Thiessen and Marie Harf are here to debate tonight. Also, as Bret mentioned, my exclusive interview this evening with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who just delivered a blistering message to China's communist leadership, calling on the Chinese people to perhaps consider a different path than the communist government that leads them. We're going to break that down and talk to him about exactly what he said about that. That, as China says they are not going to leave the embassy in Houston. We will get for the first time the Secretary of State to respond to them, digging in their heels at that embassy in moments. Then after that, K.T. McFarland is here with her analysis of the Pompeo interview. What's - are we in a cold war with China now? Is China been a failed experiment since 1979? All that with Katie. But we start tonight with Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and Marie Harf, Executive Director of Serve America PAC. Both are Fox News Contributors. Great to have both of you here tonight, Marie and Marc. It strikes me every time we have anyone on from the Trump campaign, we show them the latest numbers. Tonight we just showed everybody the latest numbers from Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. And they always say, look, we don't care. The polls aren't right. There's a lot of secret Trump voters out there, which we saw in a Monmouth poll last week in Pennsylvania. But Marc, it makes it very difficult to gauge where the country is at right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, they probably overstated, especially these new Fox News polls show a big gap. It's probably not as big a gap as the polls show. So I don't think Democrats should get too excited about it. But I think that - and questionably there are secret Trump voters. In fact, there was a poll - Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania, that 57 percent of the voters there were pretty sure that some of their neighbors were planning to vote for Trump, but weren't saying it. And there's a reason for that. There's the cancel culture as it has taken hold in a way it has in recent months. I mean, think about this. Is it more or less hospitable environment for a Trump supporter to express their support for the president now than it was four months ago? I think not. So, I think that - I think there are a lot of people who won't tell a pollster that they're supporting Trump and - but are really going to vote for him in the ballot box."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I think it's fascinating. And when you look at that number, 62 percent say that they do not want to share their political feelings with anybody. And back in 2017, three years ago, that number was at 58 percent. So we've seen increase, Marie, in the people in the country who are just saying, I'm not going to talk about it. I'm keeping my decision to myself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, Martha. And every Democrat, I know is running like Joe Biden is 10 points behind for this exact reason. People were very confident in 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win. We know there was a hidden Trump voter then in many of these swing states that the Fox News poll spoke to today like Michigan or Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump won by very little in 2016. So Democrats are worried about this. They really want to act like they're running from behind. I think these numbers do concern the Trump team, though. And I also think it's a really polarized time in our country. I mean, there are people on the other side of the aisle who've told me that Democrats hate America, and they hate Christianity. And that kind of language, even four or five years ago wasn't really out there. So our country is really deeply divided. We see that every day and it's a real problem. I don't know how to fix it. There's no easy answer."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I want you to take a look at some of these other numbers, because they are disturbing. I mean, let's pull up this one. 32 percent worry about their jobs, because if their political opinions become known, they're concerned that they could lose their job. Look at this next one. Do you think it's OK to fire someone who supports Trump or Biden? In other words, if at your job it became known that you had given money to Joe Biden or who had given money to Trump, they support firing you. 50 percent of those who consider themselves very liberal, Marc - I mean, just think about this. So they support - they think that person should be fired from their company, that's a very disturbing number."

    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "--that it just show how polarized our country has become. But let's keep in mind - that I agree with Marie that there are some Republicans who say things that are overwrought about Democrats like saying that they don't love America. I condemn that. But the reality is, if you look at that poll, Republicans are more worried - there are more Republicans who are worried about expressing their views than Democrats by 25-point margin. The only group that feels that it's - that has - a majority feel confident about it, saying what they what they believe are staunch liberals. And the reason for that is, because there really isn't a penalty for being a liberal or for expressing staunch liberal views. You're not going to get in trouble at work for saying Black Lives Matter. You will get in trouble for saying blue lives matter. There will be repercussions for that. So I think there is - this cancel culture is going after the Right in a way that it's not over the Left. And we should condemn it whether it goes after conservatives or liberals."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I also thought that deeper in that number, the 62 percent, who say that they don't feel comfortable talking about who they support politically, 59 percent of independents said that. So - I mean, these are the people who elect presidents and we don't know, which side they're on when you look at that number. But 59 percent of independents, Marie, said that they did not want to discuss who they will vote for or who they support."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Yes, these numbers are really interesting, and I agree, disturbing in many ways. And Donald Trump as an election strategy hasn't gone after independents. He's really tripled down on his base. We've seen that with his rhetoric and his policies. And so, I don't know where those independents will break. In the polling we've seen from Fox and others, they're breaking towards Democrats and they certainly broke towards Democrats in 2018."

I'm very confident that we'll proceed in a way that makes clear that it's not OK to use your diplomats to engage in industrial espionage. It's not OK to steal intellectual property. It's not OK to engage in those kind of behaviors. That's the reason we did it. We did it to protect the American people. And we're going to make sure that that happens."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Martha, let's go back to first principles. The first principles are this, for 40 plus years now - and this is why I'm at the Nixon Library today. For 40 plus years, America has turned the other cheek while we've watched the Chinese Communist Party engage in activity that's fundamentally not fair to the American people, it's not reciprocal for the American people and it doesn't have the transparency we need, so that we can engage with China in a way that's fair for our people and provide security for people. That's what we're aiming to do. And so this decision about the consulate that was made is consistent with all - whole bunch of other actions that we have already taken. A whole bunch more that we're going to continue to do until we get the change. I talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong. All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people. And so the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats their inside of China. We will make sure that we do right by the American people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I mean, it sounds like you're saying that this is a very ruptured relationship. And, if I'm reading too much in to take from that, but it - we may, yes, we may pull out of embassies in China that might be part of this process."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Yes, Martha I talked today about actions, not words. I was in Honolulu, just a few weeks back. I met with Yang Jiechi. We had a wonderful discussion. But in the end, what matters are actions, the things that make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump's trade deal was a good first effort. That the Phase 1 trade deal is important. If we get that right, that'd be the beginning of a basis for us to expand a fair and reciprocal set of trading relationships. But look at our diplomatic relationship today. They have many more diplomats here in the United States than we have inside of China. And their diplomats here in the United States have much more freedom of movement, and much more access that our diplomats do in China - inside of China."

      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "General Secretary Xi has clearly taken actions that are aggressive and broken promises that are central to how great power nations behave. Remember he made a promise back in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama. He said he wouldn't militarize the South China Sea. You can go look, there's now significant military activity there by China. He made a promise to the people of Britain, to the people of Hong Kong that they would have a 50-year deal of one country two systems. He busted it. He broke it. United States is simply demanding that if the Chinese Communist Party wants to be considered in the League of Nations that have great power and great roles and great importance, they've got to behave according to promises that they make and the rules that have been set out for sovereign nations to preserve freedom for their own people. That's what we're seeking to see happen. Label it what you must.

We have every expectation that they will, and our task will be to verify that they've done so. We hope that they do. And if they do, perhaps there'll be an opportunity to build on that. And what we're not going to let happen is what we've allowed to happen before, is that they make a set of promises, they make a commitment, like the Phase 1 trade deal and then they try and they do a little bit and America calls it good enough. President Trump is not going to permit that to happen. We're going to hold them accountable for the promises that they make, Martha"

They've raised hundreds of millions of people out of destitute, poverty, we think that's a good thing. We're not trying to contain the prosperity for the people of China. We're simply trying to preserve freedom for the people of the United States of America. That is the American task. President Trump, when he was sworn in, and I - when I was sworn in as Secretary of State, that's the promise that we made. And so what we are concerned about is not holding China down, but making sure that we all get this right, so that we can have a prosperous economy here in the United States of America, and that we can hold them accountable in ways that preserve and secure freedom for the American people. That's the mission. So when I talk about the Chinese people, I'm talking about making sure that they have the opportunity to participate on a fair and reciprocal basis, in the same way that we expect the American people will."

And we see what's happening in Taiwan where they have a genuine fear that they might be invaded or attacked by the Mainland. You look at what's happening in Hong Kong, where they are experiencing a diminishment all the time of their independence.

We know that the Chinese Communist Party has a different system. They still have obligations to live up to promises, promises even that they make to their own people. Our task is to preserve freedom and security for our people. And we know we need partners to do that. We know we need friends. I was in London and Copenhagen just the last two days, talking to them about this. The whole world is beginning to see that when you bend the knee to China, that bad things happen to your own country. So I have every expectation what the whole world, indeed freedom loving people all around the world must demand that the Chinese Communist Party live up to the commitments that it makes."

We'd love to know the answers to that. But sadly, the Chinese Communist Party has prevented that. But we know it came from Wuhan. We know they closed down Hubei Province, but didn't close down traveled to the rest of the world. That has caused enormous harm to the United States of America. So this is indeed a china virus.

MCFARLAND, AUTHOR, \"REVOLUTION\": You know, this is a really significant interview you just had with him and it's a really significant event. And here's why it's important. Forty-nine years ago this month, Richard Nixon, President Nixon directed his national security advisor to go to China and open up relations with China, to bring China into the world. I was a young staff aide to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger at that time. I remember this as if it was yesterday. And that set American foreign policy with China in a certain direction for 50 years. And President Nixon was right. He said we will induce them to change. Our thoughts, Republican and Democrat alike was that as China modernizes, as China comes into the world, as they develop a middle class, they will be an open society, an open economy, an open society, but that's not how it turned out. The Chinese in fact have exploited that. And that's why Pompeo was at the Nixon Library today, because he is indicating we now have a reverse. We are now -- we are now acknowledging the fact that the Chinese have stolen intellectual property rights, have militarized the South China Sea, have unleashed a bio weapon onto the world, have practiced wolf diplomacy and so, we, the Trump administration with the United States we're going to have a very different approach to China going forward and that's exactly what he was telling you. And, Martha, I also thought it was interesting when he mentioned to you that he was in Copenhagen, he was in London."

And then China will determine what everybody else does. And you step out of line for a minute, you try to -- you try to challenge China, you try to go against China and you get crushed. The Australians, for example, the Australians had the temerity to say let's just investigate what happens with the pandemic, with the coronavirus and China turned around and tried to crush their exports, their barley and wheat exports to China. China has, they play with really elbows out sharp. There is President Trump says they are ruthless in their negotiations."

Reopening schools creates opportunity to invest in the education, well-being and future of one of America's greatest assets, our children, while taking every precaution to protect students, teachers, staff, and all their families.\" Tonight, we are joined by three teachers, all with different opinions about whether students can safely return to the classroom. Leigha Phillips teaches high school English, Krista Herrin teaches kindergarten and first grade special education, and Phil Strunk teaches middle school social studies. Great to have all of you with us today. Krista, let me start with you, teaching kindergartners, how do you feel about the fact that, you know, they say some very young children don't even need to do the mask part necessarily? KRISTA HERRIN, KINDERGARTEN & FIRST GRADE TEACHER: I have a lot of concerns going into the school year. Kindergartners love to share, they love to share toys, they love to share hugs and they love to share germs. And I think it's going to be really difficult for us to keep masks on kids and social distance in a small classroom.

The New York Times came out with an article that said we're spreading it -- or sorry -- 10-year-olds are spreading it at about the same age as adults. We are working in schools now where like the state of Pennsylvania, that a nurse to student ratio is 1500 to one. That guideline was set back in the 40s. In my home state of Virginia, it's over 800 to one. And the CDC guidelines are 750 to one."

I'm coming home to a wife and we are expecting our first child this November. The CDC has also pointed out that women that are in their third trimester of pregnancy are at huge risk and that's where she's going to be. I think of teachers that have taught with that are overcoming cancer and a lot of other illnesses. And for me, you know, I want the economy open just like everybody else, I want to eat meals with my friends. I want to be able to stand next to a student whenever they're struggling with something. I don't think you're going to find any teachers who are going to say I don't want to be back in school. But for me, my value on human life is much higher than the need to currently open up the education system in an in-person format.

Just like Phil said, I am worried about my high school kids transmitting it whether it's between themselves, giving it to me and me taking at home, me giving it to my elderly grandma.

You know, what do you think having lived there and worked there and watched all of this, is there a solution that's going to make people safer on the streets?"

      "utterance": "I think we're in for a slog here, I think you know it and I think the country knows it, the police do do their jobs, there's not enough police to do it and some are afraid to do it. But just last week they pulled 106 guns off of 117 arrestees. Guns are everywhere, what could the governor do? She's not even talking about it, right? She's busy tweeting with the president. Madam, put the state police on the major thoroughfares in the city, seven- mile, six-mile, McNichols, Finco (Ph), five-mile, Telegraph, let them patrol the main boulevards so the police can be in the neighborhoods. That's one way to do it. We've got more state troopers than the president is sending federal agents."

She doesn't get good marks for the nursing homes, she hasn't addressed that. The Senate today voted to take COVID positive people out of nursing homes and have their own facilities."
