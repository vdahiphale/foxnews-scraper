And then in this \"New York Times\" interview, the President also leaves the door open to firing Robert Mueller as special counsel if this investigation expands into the Trump family and their finances. He was asked that direct question and said to him, that would cross a line. So, all of this is just going to add more fuel to the fire from the President's critics who are wondering why he is lashing out at various people. Especially remember before the Donald Trump, Jr. meeting and the news of that, this investigation had been settling down to some extent. That obviously ratcheted up in recent days.

The House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee with James Comey and then the news that Jesse mentioned at the top is that we now learned that next week Jared Kushner is expected to go behind closed doors, not public testimony but behind closed doors with yet another committee that is looking at this, the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Also tonight, we've learned, President Trump son, his former campaign manager and his son-in-law are all schedule to testify before Senate panels next week as part of the Russia inquiry.

This is something that they are dealing with because as you mentioned, a few days ago we learned that John McCain had a blood clot removed and there had been a mass that they were checking on. We're now learning it was in fact cancerous."

What kind of treatment they want to have and tonight there are leaders in both parties who are really stepping out and saying that this is an American hero, that they want to rally around as he deals with this fight. Former President Barack Obama just sending out a tweets saying, John McCain is an American hero and one of the bravest fighters I have ever known. Cancer doesn't know what it is up against. Give it hell, John. That's from Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton as well coming out and saying, quote, \"John McCain is as tough as they come. Thinking of John, Cindy, their wonderful children and whole family tonight.\" And speaking of that family, we should note of course that Meghan McCain is not just part of the McCain family but also part of the FOX News family. And she has put out a very emotional statement tonight. I will read it in part where she concludes, quote, \"My love for my father is boundless and like any daughter, I cannot and do not wish to be in a world without him. I have faith that those days remain far away. Even in this moment my fears for him are overwhelmed by one thing above all, gratitude for our years together and the years still to come. He is a warrior and does one of the greatest Americans of our age. And the worthy heir to his fathers and grandfathers name. But to me, he is something more. He is my strength, my example, my refuge, my confidant, my teacher, my rock, my hero, my dad.\" And that from Meghan McCain our colleague here at FOX News tonight as the McCain family figures out the way forward here in terms of the Senator's treatment. There had been a lot of talk here in Washington in recent days about when Senator McCain would come back because of the health care debate. The vote that Republican leaders wanted to have. Senator McConnell and other leaders putting out statements tonight saying, that is the furthest thing from their mind tonight. They instead are focused on the family and what they want to do in the days ahead to make sure that he has what they hope to be a very good recovery in the days ahead. But the family rally around him tonight to figure out what treatment they want to have for what is a very aggressive form of brain cancer -- Jesse."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "You can't craft a scenario Dana where this would be part of what Ty Cobb would want the President of the United States to do. The whole reason to bring in Ty Cobb a very seasoned Washington attorney whose dealt with various Congressional and criminal investigations as you suggests is to bring in someone who is seasoned and says, look, Mr. President, stop doing interviews and stop talking about the investigation, stop lashing out at Robert Mueller or in this case lashing out at people on your own team like Jeff Sessions the Attorney General. And instead, let this play out. There is nothing you can do to stop the special counsel right now. But let it play out and not add more fuel to the fire. Instead, we have the President attacking his own Attorney General as you mentioned a moment ago. Saying that if he had known that Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from all matters involving Russia, he never would have picked Jeff Sessions in the first place. That seems to be coming out of nowhere. And then in this \"New York Times\" interview, the President also leaves the door open to firing Robert Mueller as special counsel if this investigation expands into the Trump family and their finances. He was asked that direct question and said to him, that would cross a line. So, all of this is just going to add more fuel to the fire from the President's critics who are wondering why he is lashing out at various people. Especially remember before the Donald Trump, Jr. meeting and the news of that, this investigation had been settling down to some extent. That obviously ratcheted up in recent days. But when you talk about the legal advice from his team. Part of their frustration is been that rather than letting this settle down, the President has been riling it up."

      "utterance": "Ed, you mentioned briefly there in passing that the President opposes the idea of expanding this investigation into his family business, enterprises and their finances. But what we heard tonight is that there are Congressional committees that will be specifically looking at that issue. What is the response from the White House?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, look, you have -- that is part of the problem as well obviously for this president. That may be why he is lashing out. It's not just about Robert Mueller. The special counsel, you are right. There are various Congressional committees in both the House and Senate investigating this. The House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee with James Comey and then the news that Jesse mentioned at the top is that we now learned that next week Jared Kushner is expected to go behind closed doors, not public testimony but behind closed doors with yet another committee that is looking at this, the Senate Judiciary Committee. And the next Wednesday, invitations have gone out to Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager as well as Donald Trump, Jr. of course, one of the President's sons to come testify in public under oath. That could raise the stakes in all of this, Juan. It could delve more into the family and the finances as you suggests. On the other hand, I think to be fair to the President tonight, part of what may happen next week if in fact Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort and others actually do testify is that after leak after leak, attacking this president, there may be an opportunity for people close to him to actually tell their side of the story. And if as the President says in this \"New York Times\" interview by the way tonight, I have done absolutely nothing wrong, if that is true, and they finally get to tell their story, maybe all of this will settle down."

      "utterance": "First off, I am fascinated by this story, number one, that he did it. That he summoned to the \"New York Times\" and said, come to the Oval Office. I want to talk. Number two is, they do this thing that they have not done since he actually won the election. Unless we all sat down with them actually just looked so glommed that he won. They printed a cover and they said he was amiable and it went on for 50 minutes. Ivanka came in with his granddaughter who was talking about how she spoke Chinese. It showed the actually human side of the President. But the other thing that also came up that I think is significant is that he also mentioned that Mueller wanted the job. Came in here for the job to be the FBI director. The next day, he doesn't get the job, the next day he gets a Special Counsel position. And he is wondering maybe indicated that he might have an agenda to be kind of ticked off, he didn't get the nod."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's been mentioned a little bit before, Brian but you're right. Given all of this breaking news in recent weeks not just tonight, some of this has gotten lost. Robert Mueller was a candidate to replace James Comey. It does seems odd but we have learned that before in previous reporting that I say odd because Robert Mueller had been the FBI director already. Had gone into private practice as an attorney here in Washington. James Comey, his friend had become the FBI director. He gets fired. The President of the United States was interviewing various people including Robert Mueller. I think you are right. The President believes now that Robert Mueller didn't get the FBI job instead gets special counsel, he thinks maybe he has an agenda. And the President also in this \"New York Times\" interview was not shy about saying given some of the hires, people, attorneys on Robert Mueller's staff now, special counsel, who were contributors to Democratic campaign, supporters of Hillary Clinton, this president clearly does not feel like he is going to get a fair shake."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Some of the -- we don't know all of the answers to that. Some of that may have to do with the fact that in the case of Jared Kushner of course, some of the questions involving him are about, you know, technical issues of paperwork. Why didn't he initially disclose meetings with various foreign dignitaries during the presidential transition, during the campaign, all of that. And so, maybe some of this is his attorneys are trying to say, look, these are paperwork mistakes. These were things that he seems corrected. Why do you need to drag him in front of the cameras and make a skeptical of it when he can come behind closed doors and explain to you, here is what I did initially. Then I learned that I didn't disclose all of the meetings. I quickly tried to fix that. That may be part of it. But you can bet that in the long run, if there are more questions, not just the Senate Judiciary Committee has, Special Counsel, the Senate Intelligence Committee, House Intelligence Committee, there are other forms where Jared Kushner may have to testify publicly in the days ahead."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

But before I get to that, it seems like a lot of this recent testimony has been borne out of the breaking news over the last week. It almost appears to be like the Mueller investigation didn't have a lot to sink its teeth into until this meeting broke. And now, everything seems to be coming to the forefront. And this testimony system seems to be really now the major breaking news situation on cable news."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to be honest as a reporter as we chase the facts here, many of us do not know what the Special Counsel is really doing. Because they are trying to keep that as secret as possible. So, we have to be careful about speculating of course. But attorneys who are getting notices from the Special Counsel have told us in recent days that they are now asking questions about that meeting at Trump Tower in the summer of 2016, during the campaign. After Donald Trump had gotten the presidential nomination. The e-mail had come in to Donald Trump, Jr. about the potential of information dirt if you will about Hillary Clinton. And so, Robert Mueller asking about that. You're absolutely right, Jesse, suggests that if he is asking questions about it, he is investigating it. This gets back to the bottom-line question I think that Dana Perino asked at the top about Ty Cobb the new counsel coming into the White House. If Donald Trump as president of the United States says in this interview with the \"New York Times,\" I have done nothing wrong. His son has told Sean Hannity and others, look, I have done nothing wrong. I am going to be transparent about what happened. I wanted to hear these guys out in the end, nothing came of it. If that is the truth, they need to tell that story as quickly as possible. Because as you suggest, Jesse, there is nothing here for the special counsel -- there is no actual crime. But the question is, is there something else that we simply do not know tonight that the special counsel is looking at that goes beyond all of this? That's a question we simply can't answer tonight."

It seems like the President cannot let go of the fact that these investigations have expanded and have, you know, escalated if you will in recent days because of one thing in his mind which is if Jeff Sessions had not recused himself, this would have been contained at the Justice Department investigated there. But instead when he recused himself, since there were not very many other senior officials who had been confirmed, it was so early in the administration, it went to Rod Rosenstein who basically decided, okay, we're going to kick this to a Special Counsel. And the dominos fell so quickly. It's very clear that this president believes that was Jeff Sessions' fault. And if it had been contained at the Justice Department, it would not be escalating. He could be right about that or he could be wrong about that, because again, we don't know what evidence Robert Mueller has. If there is nothing there in the end, they are going to be vindicated. If there is something they're not telling us tonight, this is an investigation that is just beginning."

We've got to give an independent voice. Ever since that's happened, it got more and more difficult and he's put this White House more and more on defense.

I just want to ask you just the time table thing. First of all, as I understand, the House Intelligence Committee said that they have known since April about this Don Trump, Jr. meeting that now has eight people, that have been named as being a part of that meeting. So, if the Health Intelligence Committee had it, I assume that the Special Counsel had it. So, I guess that we should set that aside."

I don't understand why jumping on Senator Sessions tonight makes sense. Because he has been a pretty good attorney general. He is out there on the -- issue, he is talking about the President's agenda. He just filed that huge lawsuit against the opiate, you know, the pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies who are colluding to try to bilk Medicaid out of money. It's a huge loss of it. Four hundred billion dollars. Like doing a lot of great staff. So, I don't understand how Senator Sessions could have predicted the future before he became Attorney General."

This is someone and Jeff Sessions who was the first senator to stick his neck out when the rest of the Republican senators would not support Donald Trump. He's been loyal since the beginning. He must be very disappointed about how all of this has played out. From the President's perspective, the answer to your question is, I think it's quite simple that the President believes that Jeff Sessions, yes, he couldn't predict the future, but by recusing himself, they lost control of this investigation. It was no longer controlled by the Trump Justice --"

And so far, what's going to happen behind me in the Nevada state parole board tomorrow. I covered this double homicide in California for three years from 1994 to 1997. I have to tell you honestly that I came to loathe O.J. Simpson. I feel deeply that the former football great literally got away with double murder. He did it by playing the race card as despicably as possible. As he said himself, I am not black, I am O.J. Jay-Z you should know has a new album, he condemns O.J. as the race baiting hypocrite, still with abiding due respect to the victims' families and the millions of Americans who feels as the victims' families do that justice demands that O.J. Simpson remains in prison. That nine to 33 years sentence was excessive. The Nevada judge, the jury really sense though jail for the murder raps that he beat in L.A. That is karma but it's not justice. The rinky-dink armed robbery that Mark Fuhrman referenced narrated a one year sentence maybe. Simpson is 70 years old. He's been a model -- case closed. It will be a four-zero ruling in favor of parole. O.J. Simpson will be paroled and he'll be a free man on October 1st."

And he is going to be out October 1st. And I think that this sports, this is going to go beyond the sports world. I think sadly that people will begin to forget that he killed two people and are going to begin to say, well, I wonder, nine years is enough. I think he's going to let the fact that he murdered two people and almost decapitated them. Going to the past. And I think that's a mistake.

So, when he gets out, I don't think half the country is going to care this under 30. But I think if you are over 30, you look at this guy and you think he deserves to stay in prison. He skated on a double homicide. He had the cash for the dream team to skate. And they had the jury in downtown L.A. That's the reason he skated. If they had to held it in Brentwood, there would have been no way who have been convicted. It went along racial lines. And you know, when he gets out, I think Gutfeld said the other day, this guy is going to be such a phenomenon. TMZ is going to be there. You're going to be taking selfies with O.J. There is going to be so much media attention around the sky. It's just going to be sick.

But guess what, you know what, Fred Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson's family are going to be just as much in demand. I think more in demand. By the way, Jesse said to me yesterday. He said, you know, I think black people still. There is still is a divide. I looked it up. And guess what? More whites than black thinks he is guilty but it's now the point where it's closed to 60 percent of blacks who think O.J. Simpson committed those murders."

So, you can just go through a list of some of the thing that some of these athletes have done. Gerry Sandusky, you know, football coach convicted of -- serial rapist and child molester. Michael Vick ran a dog fighting enterprise signed a hundred million dollar contract after that. You've got athletes punching their fiances on camera in an elevator. Mike Tyson convicted rapist, you can just go down the list. And I'm just so sick and tired of these athletes being elevated to a point where they feel like they're invincible and they can do whatever they want. And a lot of them get away with it.

I believe that courage plays a role in fighting especially him, with what he is been through as a war hero. That will play a role. There is an experimental vaccine that they use for certain proteins in the cancer that might be a possibility that it duke. I am sure all of these things will be explored.
