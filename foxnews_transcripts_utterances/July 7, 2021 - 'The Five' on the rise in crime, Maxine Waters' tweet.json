I'm Greg Gutfeld with Katie Pavlich, Geraldo Rivera, Jesse Watters and for the Olympics she platform dives into a thermos, Dana Perino, \"The Five.\" So, this is a big week for us. Yes, it's bigger than Dana finally potty training Jasper who now flushes twice as a courtesy. And it's bigger than Jesse finally getting the hair transplant. Thanks to the Bronx Zoo for donating the minx. No, but its way bigger than that. \"The Five\" is turning 10. This show is officially old enough for Anthony Weiner to start texting it. It's true. The show, probably one of the biggest hits and cable news has outlasted everything from \"24\" to \"Lost\" to Brian Stelter's hair. To put 10 years in perspective, that's four Geraldo marathons (ph). I still remember when I was asked to do this show, one boss called me and said hey, we are doing this thing. You want to be on the thing? You have to write a mono for the thing. I said what's this thing pay? We had no expectations. All we had was our good looks and prescription medications. But I remember sitting here on the first day next to Dana Perino, both on our booster chairs. She had ghosted me the entire time she was at Fox. But now she was stuck with me and against her better judgment and the restraining order, we bonded. And the rest is what liberals hate, history. The show succeeds for one reason that other networks can't replicate. We are real and they aren't. Even though this show is seen by millions, it could just be one person. The cameras are on, the cameras are off, we don't change. There is no difference between us talking here and talking in the green room, except for Dana's filthy mouth. She curses more than Jeb Zukker looking at this show's ratings. We are deliberately unpredictable. We just can't help it. We've just done something like 2,000 shows.",

You treat us like family. And by that, I don't mean showing up unexpectedly, eating all our food and then stealing our booze. Instead, you welcomed us into your living room. I always know that if I'm down on my luck, you would lend me money just before payday. If Dana is on the run from the law for violating the height requirements at Six Flags or Jesse pulled another runner at another expensive dinner bill, you'd hide all of us. That's a true friend.

And therefore, things spin completely out of control in the very communities that Geraldo is talking about. But this is a lot. This is a direct result of a lack of deterrence. There's no incentive not to be a criminal right now, and then there's no consequences for people's actions. And that combination is a recipe for disaster. I mean, I went into a Walgreens in New York City last week, and was watching these guys just carry stuff out of the store. They're leaving with stuff out of the store, and I was looking at the cashiers who are not white, by the way. Here they are working an honest job. They're trying to make a living. The manager is just beside himself from people just walking outside the door.

But one thing that's really strange, and Greg hit on it, is that the White House looks at their polling -- believe me, they look at it every day -- and the two issues that are pulling them down the most are crime and immigration, on those two issues.

      "utterance": "Hello. I'm Greg Gutfeld with Katie Pavlich, Geraldo Rivera, Jesse Watters and for the Olympics she platform dives into a thermos, Dana Perino, \"The Five.\" So, this is a big week for us. Yes, it's bigger than Dana finally potty training Jasper who now flushes twice as a courtesy. And it's bigger than Jesse finally getting the hair transplant. Thanks to the Bronx Zoo for donating the minx. No, but its way bigger than that. \"The Five\" is turning 10. This show is officially old enough for Anthony Weiner to start texting it. It's true. The show, probably one of the biggest hits and cable news has outlasted everything from \"24\" to \"Lost\" to Brian Stelter's hair. To put 10 years in perspective, that's four Geraldo marathons (ph). I still remember when I was asked to do this show, one boss called me and said hey, we are doing this thing. You want to be on the thing? You have to write a mono for the thing. I said what's this thing pay? We had no expectations. All we had was our good looks and prescription medications. But I remember sitting here on the first day next to Dana Perino, both on our booster chairs. She had ghosted me the entire time she was at Fox. But now she was stuck with me and against her better judgment and the restraining order, we bonded. And the rest is what liberals hate, history. The show succeeds for one reason that other networks can't replicate. We are real and they aren't. Even though this show is seen by millions, it could just be one person. The cameras are on, the cameras are off, we don't change. There is no difference between us talking here and talking in the green room, except for Dana's filthy mouth. She curses more than Jeb Zukker looking at this show's ratings. We are deliberately unpredictable. We just can't help it. We've just done something like 2,000 shows."

You treat us like family. And by that, I don't mean showing up unexpectedly, eating all our food and then stealing our booze. Instead, you welcomed us into your living room. I always know that if I'm down on my luck, you would lend me money just before payday. If Dana is on the run from the law for violating the height requirements at Six Flags or Jesse pulled another runner at another expensive dinner bill, you'd hide all of us. That's a true friend. And the reason for that is easy. Because while it's always 5:00 somewhere, the best somewhere is here. Is that --"

I think Greg, you've gotten funnier and skinnier and much richer. And I think I have been more mature. I don't make personal attacks about people's physical appearance as much anymore. I think Dana has probably changed the most. She started making sweeping generalizations about people based on skin color. I don't like that. So I think you need to watch your mouth.

This land is stolen, stolen land and Black people still aren't free.\" And Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Jesse's aunt, adds tweeting \"The Declaration of Independence says all men are created equal. Equal to what? What men? Only white men?\" It wasn't just Congress, media outlets, left-wing media outlets, \"The New York Times,\" PBS, et cetera, also taking shots at America.

But these are politicians. These are \"our leaders.\" And the belief in the media is that no one will take you seriously if you are patriotic. And in fact, if you are patriotic, that's a dog whistle for extremism, right. It's actually exclusionary to actually love your country. So it's flipped. When we were younger, being patriotic was the norm and burning a flag was risky. Now, it's completely reversed. If you want to be accepted in the entertainment industry, in media, in academia, you have to trash this country. However, none of these critics would go anywhere else. They love what they get.

So are you saying these black leaders are denying freedom to the black people of St. Louis? That's insane. So what she's doing is she is trafficking in hatred for money. And I looked at her website.

Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for example, President Barack Obama, Larry Elder, Ben Carson -- he's one of the best surgeons the world has ever known. I mean, this idea that they are downplaying all of the accomplishments of these people to keep up this divisive narrative that as Dana said, makes them money, gets some retweets, maybe get some to be a card-carrying member of the new squad in the House. It really downplays not just the progress that we've made as a country, but also the progress that American, black Americans have made for their communities and for their country. And when it comes to fixing what you say is inequality in these communities, I recommend people read \"White Guilt\" by Shelby Steele because it talks about these problems that have persisted for decades under black leadership.

Other crimes way up too, like in San Francisco where a group of thieves, they looted a high-end department store and no one even tried to stop them. The city is being rocked by a shoplifting epidemic right now. All right, Greg, the only thing that's really going to stop the bleeding is you just have to arrest, prosecute, and then incarcerate the shooters.

This is a crime wave that is affecting black people in America in a way that is so profoundly destructive. It is the number one cause of death. Homicide is the number one cause of death for black men up to the age of 44. Homicide is the number one cause of death. We got to absorb that. I really believe that they don't mention it because it is too difficult. They have no way, no ideas to fix it without stop and frisk and roadblocks and, you know, traffic stops and so forth. I really do think that this is a crisis that will mark this era in our lives. This is the civil rights issue of our time, the death of, you know, within the black community. All of those murders you talk about Chicago, you don't -- you don't say the next day. They were -- every one of them was black. The shooter and the victim were all black. I mean, at what point does President Biden and all the Democrats and everyone else -- and God, they've got to recognize that this is a crisis, and it's not going to fix it."

And therefore, things spin completely out of control in the very communities that Geraldo is talking about. But this is a lot. This is a direct result of a lack of deterrence. There's no incentive not to be a criminal right now, and then there's no consequences for people's actions. And that combination is a recipe for disaster. I mean, I went into a Walgreens in New York City last week, and was watching these guys just carry stuff out of the store. They're leaving with stuff out of the store, and I was looking at the cashiers who are not white, by the way. Here they are working an honest job. They're trying to make a living. The manager is just beside himself from people just walking outside the door. And where's the justice for those people who are there doing the right thing, working a real job, and they are completely victimized by this entire system and the politicians who want more money for crime bailouts, and who refused to address the problem?"

And if you look at the -- I mean, like a 5-year-old can figure out the cause and effect here. It's not that hard. But one thing that's really strange, and Greg hit on it, is that the White House looks at their polling -- believe me, they look at it every day -- and the two issues that are pulling them down the most are crime and immigration, on those two issues. And I mean, I'm talking they're like at 31 percent approval for the immigration piece and crime is way down as well.
