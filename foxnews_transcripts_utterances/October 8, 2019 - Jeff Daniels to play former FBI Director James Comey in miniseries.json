So, I am actually all for the message, but I think Kanye West does a better job of it in the sense that his message is for people who would directly benefit it now, basically saying, you may hate Trump, but that doesn't mean you should hate his supporters. Whether you like it or not, they saw something valuable in the person they voted for. They saw him as an outsider who rejected platitudes. You may think - he may not be your cup of tea, but he's there you know Jolt Cola and I think that's - I like her message, but you've got to talk about the people who would benefit from it now.

If Democrats plow ahead on impeachment, Joe and his son, Hunter, could be forced to testify in an official senate trial. And now, Lindsey Graham is offering Rudy Giuliani the chance to testify before his committee about potential Biden wrongdoing. And that's just the beginning of sleepy Joe's troubles. He's got another huge problem, big money Democrat donors who are reportedly frustrated over his many gaffes, disastrous debate performances, and how he's handling Trump's attacks. So far, Biden's main response to the Ukraine controversy is rage."

All right. So, the New York Times over the weekend, Dana, came out with this big story about how Biden's reaction was a case study in political indecision, and he just struggled to meet the moment. He waited a week or two to do anything. And at the end, he just yelled at a reporter and put out an op-ed. I mean, an op-ed? Where's he's been?"

Now donors don't always have the best feel for what needs to happen on a campaign. They will always call you up and say you need to be doing something different than you are. But you don't see this kind of thing for Warren, Mayor Pete, even Harris, or Booker, who has not been able to raise a lot of money. Klobuchar. You don't actually see blind quotes in a paper basically saying they're screwing this up. And I think that's often because you have donors who have friendships with people in the media and they want to be called upon in the future, so they're basically trying to show their cards that they're about to turn.

After all, they spent 3 years talking about collusion and obstruction. Shouldn't they want to revisit this relationship if it had an impact on an election? Of course, in between your writing of books about Russian collusion, maybe you can look into this. I know you're still working on you advance -- getting your advance for your book on Russia, but you can actually do this. But -- you know who Biden's remind me of?

You know, the moment I set foot on the field I was like a tackling dummy that just went around me. I look like a tackling dummy in sunglasses. I was completely out of my league. That is Biden now. When he was on the sidelines he saw that he could compete and he could play. Now he's in the game and he can't keep up and it's noticeable. I feel like when you're walking around him you want to tighten every bolt with an Allen wrench because he's just all shaky and stuff.

I think it's really intended for Republicans. But I think the Biden's story -- just let me come on it before I come back to that letter, Jesse. I think that it's very interesting that in polls that are out today, for the first time you see Elizabeth Warren as the number 1 Democrat in the poll. This is a Quinnipiac poll has her at 29, Joe Biden at 26. And now in the Real Clear Politics average, she's, you know, it's clearly within the margin of error. I think it's 0.2 percent ahead of Joe Biden. To me, that's much more interesting. Let me just go a little bit further on that. Her gain is not coming out of Joe Biden. Her gain is coming out of people like Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, they are going down, down. We are now down to a three-way race, which is Biden, Warren, and Bernie Sanders who recently was ill with a heart attack. We'll see how he does if he can get the energy up -- upcoming debate. But to me, this is shaping up as a three-way race. Now, if we go back to this letter, it seems to me Biden may not be doing so great. And by the way, all these donors, they're nervous at least all the time. They're always nervous, and they want Biden to be more combative. From your perspective, they want him to really go after Trump in a vicious way. And Biden is just not that guy right now."

He's on defense all the time. He's worried about his son's business dealings. He's worried about Elizabeth Warren. And the problem is that all of the worry shows in every interaction he has. When he gets on the debate stage he doesn't look confident. He doesn't look like he's in control. Many people cannot even cite what Joe Biden would actually do as president. He's so in -- unable to really prioritize what his stands on the issues, because he's so worried about all these things. Once I saw that op-ed in the Washington Post come out, I said to myself, this guy doesn't even know how to create a populous grassroots movement. He is so -- he is back in a political time when you would hand over talking points to the Washington Post and try to sell yourself that way and that would be successful. That's not how it goes anymore. Now you're going against the likes of Warren and Sanders who have that populous energy, who knows how to tap into a crowd, and he's lost. And now you have donors come out and looking at him and saying this guy is not able to defend this issue with Ukraine, and he's not able to defend his own record.

The only time that it got attention was when President Trump brought it up, appropriately -- or appropriately on the call, whenever.

The guy is bulletproof at this point. And if he cooperates he's guilty. If he doesn't cooperate he's guilty. He can't win. So, what is America gonna do? They're going to have one anonymous CIA agent overturn the will of 60 million people? That's not gonna fly in this country. And to make Adam Schiff the face of impeachment is a huge miscalculation. Adam Schiff is like the Jussie Smollett of John Brennan's. He's got no credibility, he's totally compromise, and everything he says no one believes at this point. And I do want to do a mini deep dive into the deep state because I have some new information to bring you guys. One of the lawyers for the whistleblower used to worked for the southern poverty law center, the ACLU, Hillary Clinton, and Chuck Schumer.

I mean this is a lot of power and a lot of clout. This is a much bigger issue that has to be dealt with because it's not going anywhere, it just seems to be getting worse.

And on the point about George W. Bush, it is true that the only reason that people are kind of look back fondly on presidents is because they get out of the public eye. He wrote a book explaining his decisions. He's given the new president, the meaning Obama and Trump like the room that they need. Call me if you need me, but other than that I'm going to be a former president and I'm going to try to do good things. And that's what she was trying to say.

And she'll never be allowed to come back, because she's bad luck at this point. But here's the deal, everyone should listen to Ellen because they need to hear it from people like Ellen. Think about who the people have been saying this recently are. Michael Moore said Trump's going to win because of the blue-collar connection. Kanye said, it's OK for blacks to wear MAGA hats. Bill Maher said political correctness is destroying this country. And now you have Ellen saying you know we can be friends with conservatives. But if you listen to politicians, the politicians tell you the exact opposite. They say you have to chase conservatives out of restaurants. They say you have to ban them and boycott them.

So, the media entertainment and academia aren't that interested in going after him. But they would have, and they have, they demonized Bush, they demonized Romney, they demonized McCain, they demonized Reagan. You can go back. You know that's what they do when you're in power, but when you're out of power, we don't care about you anymore. Kind of the way the Republicans feel about when Carter started going and building houses, we thought that was great. So, I am actually all for the message, but I think Kanye West does a better job of it in the sense that his message is for people who would directly benefit it now, basically saying, you may hate Trump, but that doesn't mean you should hate his supporters. Whether you like it or not, they saw something valuable in the person they voted for. They saw him as an outsider who rejected platitudes.

At first, I felt sad for her because I felt like she had to come out and defend herself. And I said oh why is she doing that. But then I thought about it and I said you know what, she's seizing an opportunity. She lived a real life moment. She saw a real life response. And she happens to be lucky enough to have that kind of platform to come out and make a statement. And I liked that she did it with humor that is her signature. I have found her hilarious for years and I think it's important for people who have those microphones to take those opportunities that when they do live these real life moments they step up on the platform and they say, listen, there was a time when it wasn't so crazy that you would get along with people that you had disagreements with. That time seems to be vanishing. Let's bring it back."

So, you know Juan just what I need is more Comey in my life. Are you excited? Is this something you would tune into?"

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

I mean you know Veep and all those kinds of political shows, I look to just see because half the time you think, I'm not sure they really get it right. I want to see where they get it right, when they get it wrong. How difficult is it to dramatize the reality of American politics when there is a lot of drama? But I will say I think Jeff Daniels is a great actor. I just saw him in To Kill a Mockingbird on Broadway. He did a wonderful job. As for Comey, I don't know. You know Democrats have maybe have more problems with Comey than Republicans, because I think he cost Hillary the election. But you know I think people are just curious and this - the thing about the Donald Trump era is so entertaining, Jedediah in some ways, and it lends itself to Hollywood. And so here is going to be a Hollywood presentation."

      "utterance": "Yes. That's not going to rate. The real stuff that rates, we're watching it right now unfold in reality. That's the good stuff. You can't overdramatize what's happening. I mean it doesn't get any better than this. Of course, Trump is going to get impeached, of course. He's going to give us everything, just wait till the second term. And it is appropriate that the guy that played Dumb and Dumber is going to be playing James Comey. But Hollywood has to white knight this guy. They have to memorialize him as the hero in order to lock into the American psyche that this guy was the right man to take out a dastardly president. But once the Durham report comes out, they might have to rewrite the thing."
    },

But if they were to say that - if there was one person that caused them a lot of anxiety, a lot of problems, it was James Comey. So, they really can't stand up. I think it's pretty interesting, a premiere date hasn't been set. Let's be honest. This will happen two weeks before the election of 2020. We know when that will happen. Also, I'll be very interested to see who the contributing producers are. Who are the people in the current drama outside of it that all are going to get paid to consult for this production?

They need to make - they need to focus on him taking down that vicious criminal Martha Stewart because that really is the high point of his heroic career, is getting that vicious criminal off the street, Martha Stewart and putting her in jail. But to Juan's point, it's true, it's like these things you have no idea what they get wrong or get right. Unless until it's about you and being at Fox and seeing all these things come out, it's interesting to see how much is wrong and how much is right. And it's - I would say, it's probably like 60 percent wrong and 40 percent right. There's somebody playing me by the way, Dana. Did you know that?"
