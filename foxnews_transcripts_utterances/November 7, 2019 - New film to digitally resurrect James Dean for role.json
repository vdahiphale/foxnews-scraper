      "sentences": "--great to see you. I'm Laura Ingraham this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. Why is the media lying about laws surrounding the whistleblowers suppose a deserved anonymity? Alan Dershowitz is here in moments to set them all straight. Could Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell single-handedly blow up the 2020 Democratic Primary? Fox's own Ed Henry is here with some very interesting Intel and also tonight, a special edition - we don't do this often but its Thursday follies. Don Jr., triggers the ladies of \"The View\" and if you missed it, we were screaming it was hilarious. Raymond Arroyo is here with all the details on that and a lot more. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tucker Carlson, a very unusual drop by him on what seems to be nothing but collusion among the big three television networks, what is that all about? But first, impeachment by emotion, that is the focus of tonight's ANGLE. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Adam Schiff is a lousy Congressman but he would be an even worse magician. He's forever trying but failing to pull off a slight of hand thinking the audience is too stupid to see him hide the card up his sleeve. This impeachment farce, we are supposed to believe that President Trump knowing that what a dozen people were listening in on his Ukraine call with Zelensky was nevertheless improperly using diplomatic channels to plot against Joe Biden. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's positively ludicrous, the fact that some of the deep State Department folks felt it was unseemly or felt uncomfortable, it is totally irrelevant. You do not impeach a President because of other people's emotions, especially when those offended didn't like the President's policies in the first place. As we see in the released transcripts of testimony from both Former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor, these folks aren't happy unless their foreign country of focus is awash in taxpayer money. They are both adamant that Ukraine gets lethal military aid regardless of whether or not it cleaned up its recent abysmal track record on fighting corruption. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As Byron York points out, Taylor actually saw Trump's policy on Ukraine as an improvement over Obama he said I was happy that we were providing aid. It was a substantial improvement, and this administration provided javelin antitank weapons. Still, Trump is far more skeptical of foreign aid than any of the people who listened in on his call. Frankly most of the people shouldn't be working in the White House let alone in a high-level position such as Ambassador. Marie Yovanovitch's testimony illustrates why? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She and the Democrats interviewing her were only interested in the drama surrounding her firing. The transcript of her closed-door testimony has the words \"feel,\" felt\" and \"emotion\" get this 43 times. It sounds like this woman needs to be on a therapist's couch, not a witness stand. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent's testimony was also supposed to be a huge bombshell. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Rather than waste your own time - I was thinking about this today, rather than wasting your own time or emotion on a sham impeachment, it's been exposed day in our day out. The President I think would serve the country in his own reelection campaign best by simply building on its record of success, let the fools do with the fools are going to do, other people can fight the impeachment stuff. He and his domestic policy team should be rolling out initiative after initiative that advances the America First agenda that has been so successful that means new stuff. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also the President has to remember that many if not all, many of the career civil servants just don't share his worldview - that's okay. But some inside government, may be inside the White House are actively working to subvert the President's policy. Remember all three of the witnesses set to testify publicly next week are people in Trump's Administration hired, brought on two of them still work for the President. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In the business world, ideology may not matter but this is politics and when you least expect it, the alligators lurking in the swamp will bite and snap and that's THE ANGLE.

One, deal with Senators one on one in the days ahead on policy grounds, forget about Ukraine, talk to Senator Murkowski.

And McConnell I'm told basically told the President if you basically do those things you're going to survive a trial and McConnell is very confident that he has told President in private that there would never be two-thirds of the Senate to remove the President from office, that's the bottom line and I'm told that's what McConnell has told the President.",

Not wanting to let the Peacock network get away with all the fun, ABC and CBS are now getting into the mix themselves. After ABC anchor Amy Robach's hot mike rant about how the network snuffed out her Jeffrey Epstein reporting, it went viral. The network there said that they were going to investigate. Well, not how this story was dropped, but who leaked the embarrassing video? The investigation led them to CBS where the since departed employee reportedly now works, or worked. Instead of protecting their employees, CBS acquiesced to ABC's pressure and fired that person. The networks used to be in competition, remember, over ratings and stories. Now they are just in competition to see who can engage in the most disgusting and hypocritical cover-up. And the worst part? They are covering for each other. We are happy to be joined now by my friend Tucker Carlson, host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" here on FNC. Tucker, my friend, how are you? Good to see you.

Why is the media lying about laws surrounding the whistleblowers suppose a deserved anonymity? Alan Dershowitz is here in moments to set them all straight. Could Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell single-handedly blow up the 2020 Democratic Primary? Fox's own Ed Henry is here with some very interesting Intel and also tonight, a special edition - we don't do this often but its Thursday follies. Don Jr., triggers the ladies of \"The View\" and if you missed it, we were screaming it was hilarious. Raymond Arroyo is here with all the details on that and a lot more. Tucker Carlson, a very unusual drop by him on what seems to be nothing but collusion among the big three television networks, what is that all about? But first, impeachment by emotion, that is the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Adam Schiff is a lousy Congressman but he would be an even worse magician. He's forever trying but failing to pull off a slight of hand thinking the audience is too stupid to see him hide the card up his sleeve. This impeachment farce, we are supposed to believe that President Trump knowing that what a dozen people were listening in on his Ukraine call with Zelensky was nevertheless improperly using diplomatic channels to plot against Joe Biden. It's positively ludicrous, the fact that some of the deep State Department folks felt it was unseemly or felt uncomfortable, it is totally irrelevant. You do not impeach a President because of other people's emotions, especially when those offended didn't like the President's policies in the first place. As we see in the released transcripts of testimony from both Former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor, these folks aren't happy unless their foreign country of focus is awash in taxpayer money. They are both adamant that Ukraine gets lethal military aid regardless of whether or not it cleaned up its recent abysmal track record on fighting corruption. As Byron York points out, Taylor actually saw Trump's policy on Ukraine as an improvement over Obama he said I was happy that we were providing aid. It was a substantial improvement, and this administration provided javelin antitank weapons. Still, Trump is far more skeptical of foreign aid than any of the people who listened in on his call. Frankly most of the people shouldn't be working in the White House let alone in a high-level position such as Ambassador. Marie Yovanovitch's testimony illustrates why? She and the Democrats interviewing her were only interested in the drama surrounding her firing. The transcript of her closed-door testimony has the words \"feel,\" felt\" and \"emotion\" get this 43 times. It sounds like this woman needs to be on a therapist's couch, not a witness stand. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent's testimony was also supposed to be a huge bombshell."

The bombshell turned out to be a dud. Finally there's a man who replaced Yovanovitch, Acting Ukraine Ambassador Bill Taylor now he has been hyped as the diplomat who could single handedly take down Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "A swing and a miss because Taylor's closed-door testimony contained this inconvenient fact, Congressman Ratcliff says based on your knowledge nobody in the Ukrainian government became aware of a hold on military aid until August 29th. Ambassador Taylor responded that's my understanding. That means Ukraine had no idea there was a hold on military aid until over a month after Trump's call with their President. How was that a quid pro quo? It's a quid pro no. Last night I mentioned this stunning admission from Taylor, that his testimony was based not on first, second, third but possibly on fourth hand information. Any time you have a chance to put REO Speed Wagon into an ANGLE you just got to take it. Meanwhile if you haven't noticed the stock market hit another record high today in our economy is still the envy of the world. Rather than waste your own time - I was thinking about this today, rather than wasting your own time or emotion on a sham impeachment, it's been exposed day in our day out. The President I think would serve the country in his own reelection campaign best by simply building on its record of success, let the fools do with the fools are going to do, other people can fight the impeachment stuff. He and his domestic policy team should be rolling out initiative after initiative that advances the America First agenda that has been so successful that means new stuff. Also the President has to remember that many if not all, many of the career civil servants just don't share his worldview - that's okay. But some inside government, may be inside the White House are actively working to subvert the President's policy. Remember all three of the witnesses set to testify publicly next week are people in Trump's Administration hired, brought on two of them still work for the President. In the business world, ideology may not matter but this is politics and when you least expect it, the alligators lurking in the swamp will bite and snap and that's THE ANGLE. All right, here to respond Alan Dershowitz Harvard Law Professor Emeritus, Author of the new book \"Guilt by Accusation\" and Guy Lewis Former U.S. Attorney great to have you both on tonight. Alan, moments ago we learned that House Intel Dems have subpoenaed Mick Mulvaney to appear in - get this, this is hard to believe - 11 hours from now.

When I first went back I went back and looked at the complaint Laura, it is so clear to me that a lawyer wrote this complaint beginning to end and if it's Mark Zaid, if it's this guy who wrote the letter to the President today, this is the same lawyer who two years ago January 2017 says - these are his words, not mine, his words. \"A coup has started. Impeachment will follow immediately. July a few months later.

And unnamed CIA official saying \"I think you would have to tell the President we cannot unveil this person, it would create a very bad feeling in the building that would not be good for national security or you personally, Mr. President\" interesting choice of words, remember Chuck Schumer's warning before the President was sworn into office.

First of all is I don't think Director Gina Haspel needs any self-righteous lectures from Former CIA Officers, no matter how senior they might be? She doesn't need them trying to explain to her how to set her compass or to do the right thing. I find that really distasteful and off-putting, she's an outstanding Director and as far as why would she protect a whistleblower? Look, if a whistleblower comes forward, using the Intelligence Communities Whistleblower Protection Act which is a mouthful then I think you use the protections that are in place. If that person comes forward in good faith, it really shouldn't matter what their politics are, frankly. So I'm fully on board with that but what you've got to see if got some members, former members of the Intel Community who are coming out and making that case, and I think they are talking simply about not about the anonymity they are talking about the protections in place to prevent reprisals. Then you do have others who are obviously partisan, I'm thinking of may be perhaps Former Director John Brennan, maybe Mike Morel, they are coming at it from a different angle."

      "utterance": "Yes, Laura good to see you. Well, you're right that certainly this has been a moving target in terms of the schedule. House Democrats were saying they might move forward on articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving. Now, they're predicting, well, maybe they will get it done by Christmas. So what does that mean if they do move forward? It means that Mitch McConnell would be setting up a trial at some point in mid-late January, maybe even into February and as you say, that starts touching into the Iowa Caucuses, New Hampshire Primary. In fact, it could even go when you talk about six weeks all the way close to Super Tuesday, pinning various 2020 Democrats down in Washington at the trial. Here is the big picture, what I'm hearing from some of the President's Advisors is that the Mitch McConnell right there was at the White House with the President yesterday talking judicial nominations, he had multiple conversations with the President in private on how a Senate trial may play out and I'm told that McConnell told the President that if he does two things he's going to survive this. One, deal with Senators one on one in the days ahead on policy grounds, forget about Ukraine, talk to Senator Murkowski. Lisa Murkowski from Alaska McConnell about her energy bill, make her important on these issues and stop talking about Ukraine. Focus on policy, she's a swing vote somebody who could turn against the President. She was a swing vote on Kavanaugh. Second I'm told McConnell said do not attack individual Senators, they're going to take this very seriously as jurors. You did it a little bit with Mitt Romney, McConnell know it's the President I'm told in these private conversations but don't do it with the others, you've got to move beyond that because if you attack them they are only going to dig in and you need them in the end. And McConnell I'm told basically told the President if you basically do those things you're going to survive a trial and McConnell is very confident that he has told President in private that there would never be two-thirds of the Senate to remove the President from office, that's the bottom line and I'm told that's what McConnell has told the President."

If we look at what happened in Kentucky the other night, the guy who won focused on bread and butter issues and didn't want to shake up everything but keep what Obama built and built on that.

That is a lot of money to be going after some of these Democrat primary opponents if he actually does enter the race. And if you are Joe Biden, you have to be nervous, he's sitting on $8.9 million on cash at hand, which is abysmal in comparison to some of his counterpoints like Sanders and Warren. And it also demonstrates a real lack of enthusiasm, Laura, because, look, the vast majority of Joe Biden's donors have been these big dollar donors, it's not those grassroots supporters, those small dollar donors. It's these big dollar donors. And guess what, 38 percent have already maxed out. So if you want to go the distance in a competitive primary field, how is he going to do that when he doesn't have money?"

To me that is so insulting of the field. It's frankly shocking."

And by the way, if you get insulted by people running against you, this is the wrong business for you to be in. But if you look at the polls in Iowa right now, undecided is winning in every poll that is taken. So if I'm Michael Bloomberg, $100 million to Mike Bloomberg is like me throwing a $20 out to pay for drinks tonight. So I think he could roll the dice and he could get in the race, and see what happens. If 29 percent of Iowans are completely undecided and that is leading the field right now, why not? He's got the money. He's got the time. He was a great mayor of this city. He's going to shake things up, and it's going to draw some more attention to this race, and I think that's a good thing."

And if you are on the debate stage, Bloomberg could directly go after Elizabeth Warren on some of her plans and how ridiculous they are, like Medicare for all. And her poll numbers took a little bit of a dip after the debate when she faced incoming because the media has insulated her so much from attacks, and she doesn't do well when she is under attack. So Bloomberg could potentially go after her on some of her policies and how fictitious and crazy they are. And also one other thing about Joe Biden, people like to point to the national numbers about him, but he is struggling in Iowa, he is struggling in New Hampshire, and again, I told the fundraising story earlier, which is another sign about that lack of enthusiasm for him. So I really don't think Joe Biden is a strong candidate by any stretch of the imagination, and Elizabeth Warren has a lot of flaws that really have not been challenged so far."

In just a matter of weeks, execs at ABC, CBS, and NBC seem to have chosen to protect two rich and powerful deviants over the journalists who actually work for them. Just last month Ronan Farrow, a former NBC reporter, revealed in great detail how NBC killed his painstakingly reported story exposing Harvey Weinstein. Not wanting to let the Peacock network get away with all the fun, ABC and CBS are now getting into the mix themselves. After ABC anchor Amy Robach's hot mike rant about how the network snuffed out her Jeffrey Epstein reporting, it went viral. The network there said that they were going to investigate. Well, not how this story was dropped, but who leaked the embarrassing video? The investigation led them to CBS where the since departed employee reportedly now works, or worked. Instead of protecting their employees, CBS acquiesced to ABC's pressure and fired that person. The networks used to be in competition, remember, over ratings and stories. Now they are just in competition to see who can engage in the most disgusting and hypocritical cover-up. And the worst part? They are covering for each other. We are happy to be joined now by my friend Tucker Carlson, host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" here on FNC. Tucker, my friend, how are you? Good to see you. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\": I was reading the script as it was rolling, it was making me so mad."

They're crushing anyone who gets in the way of Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein. In the Epstein case, this raises very serious questions about the involvement of foreign governments, about whether or not he actually killed himself, there seems to be something of an emerging bipartisan consensus that maybe he didn't. Who knows? But this is a real story. This is not some frivolous celebrity story. It's a real story that touches on all kinds of powerful people, and for them to suppress it actually makes you nervous. It makes me nervous. It's not just that they're incompetent. There's something very sinister about this, I think."

And that was annoying, and I think it had a bad effect on the country. That's not exactly what's happening now. Now what you're seeing is a kind of ruthless suppression of anyone who challenges the interests of the ruling class. Now you kind of see the media operating as a Praetorian Guard for finance. Do you know what I mean? Standing up on behalf of private equity chieftains and hurting anyone who asked questions. And that's the point at which you think this is actually scary. This needs to be destroyed. I have always felt sad whenever a media business goes under because I so believe in the basic mission of media --"

I'm not saying they are liberals. They are not liberal at all, there's nothing liberal about this. It's fascist.
