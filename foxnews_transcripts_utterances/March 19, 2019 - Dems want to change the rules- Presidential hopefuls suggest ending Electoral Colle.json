He wrote a best-selling book called Biased. And it was his realization over time that, you know, there was a bias against conservatives. But the thing I always feel like -- that's why conservatives -- you just have to work harder and be smarter and utilize new technologies, like President Trump does. I really think that when the history books are written -- stay with me here, folks. I'm going to praise twitter and the president's tweets. Looking back, so what happen? We had the printing press. That was a huge technological development for how you disseminate information. Then you get to the radio and then you have fireside chats and people say what is he doing on the radio? He should be focused on -- but you know what? That was the best thing that he could have done. Ronald Reagan uses television to his advantage. Now you have President Obama who actually zoomed past Hillary Clinton because he understood social media better than she did. And now President Trump has figured out a way to talk directly to the American people. The thing is he's not the only one that has the tools and access to it.

Their proposals would alter the constitution and upend hundreds of years of precedent. A growing number of 2020 candidates are now revolting against the current makeup of the Supreme Court and want major changes. Much more on that in a moment.

And look what New York did to Amazon. I don't think we need to give them any more power than they already have. What they're trying to do is they're trying to disenfranchise flyover country. They're only their four time a year anyway, but they don't want to have them have any more power. And Liz Warren thinks she knows more than Ben Franklin? We designed a constitutional republic to prevent mob rule. And that's the point. And what they're trying to do is short- circuit all of these systems in place because they know they can't beat Trump.

When you think about North Korea, trade, prison reform, and Syria, the Democrats have been chasing collusion for two years. That's why they're devoid of any kind of strategy because they've been so lazy. They're just hoping for impeachment and they've got nothing. They should try to challenge him on ideas.

If vote delusion is the basis on which all of these arguments lay, then there's a hypocrisy on so many levels. And that's how, to me, it gets interpreted poorly in that way. And I think it also wastes everyone's time. If there's that national popular vote interstate compact none of it is every going to get anywhere.

Term limits which candidates are also throwing around needs a constitutional amendment to achieve that. That's in the constitution. These judges serve for good behavior. They can be impeached and that's it. So I also think it kind of blazon ignorance with all of them talking about it.

CNN, the Washington Post, social platforms see division as a way to make money and they -- by the way, CNN, this is their second go around. They did this with law enforcement for five or six years. Now they're doing the Trump voter, right? This is a way to make money. The consensus media has decided to demonize half the population. It's unhealthy. So, yeah, you're right.

But the thing I always feel like -- that's why conservatives -- you just have to work harder and be smarter and utilize new technologies, like President Trump does. I really think that when the history books are written -- stay with me here, folks. I'm going to praise twitter and the president's tweets. Looking back, so what happen? We had the printing press. That was a huge technological development for how you disseminate information. Then you get to the radio and then you have fireside chats and people say what is he doing on the radio? He should be focused on -- but you know what? That was the best thing that he could have done. Ronald Reagan uses television to his advantage. Now you have President Obama who actually zoomed past Hillary Clinton because he understood social media better than she did. And now President Trump has figured out a way to talk directly to the American people. The thing is he's not the only one that has the tools and access to it. Before, if you are Reagan, you could do the TV stuff -- not everybody could have a radio show. Now everyone has a voice. One thing I would point out about the media coverage, Facebook has tried to do this thing where they are trying to find local newspapers and news organizations that they can give money to, that they can support because local news is dying.

And there was a case upheld through the United States Supreme Court that basically yelp, didn't have to take down a defamatory post, right? And I want to point out the fact that we have lawmakers that are arguing about things when we have in the communications decency act, that's what set out that these platforms are not responsible for the content unless they put something novel on it, right? And I know there's an argument in the courts whether that novelty has to do with add (ph) as well, whatever. But - so it would be up to lawmakers to change the laws if they wanted, because right now the courts are favoring the platforms. That being said, these tech companies are on the hot seat in Congress, obviously, and so it would probably behoove them to have a warmer relationship between the two. Twitter is tricky too and that it sets its own rules. And so it can say, \"Oh, we didn't need to shadow ban you. And we didn't shadow ban, because it was an exception and it was this algorithm or whatever, and so they can always kind of get out of it in a court setting, which they do."
