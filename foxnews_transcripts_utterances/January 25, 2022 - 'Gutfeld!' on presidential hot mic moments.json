That since this event, the so-called president has called Mr. Doocy to clear the air, which when talking about Joe usually involves opening a window and the use of at least 75 glade plugins. Apparently was a perfect phone call. Although odds are good, Joe was still talking 10 minutes after Peter hung up. But what a pair, reporter who's never shaved and a president you wouldn't let near anything sharp. But I say why bother? This is the best thing President Biden has ever done since -- in fact, it's the best thing Joe Biden has ever done. It's definitely the most honest thing to come out of his -- come out of him since he crop dusted Camilla Bowles with the air biscuit heard round the world. It's better than beating corn pop and breakdancing up the stairs to Air Force One combined. Because when Biden called Doocy an SOB, what did he do? He reminded you of the good old days, when the only problems we had were verbal. Yes, let's take a walk down memory lane or insult avenue if you will to the glorious days of old where the only things hurled through the air were words and not Russian missiles pointed at Kiev.",

Now besides that rash I got into loom. But there was no inflation, no high crime unless you count the coddled left-wing mascots, Antifa and BLM, no foreign policy disasters, no education implosion, no attacks on parents. No dividing America to us versus them based on vaccinations, race or pronouns. All we had were mean tweets and some hilarious insults. So what would you rather be doing? Paying seven bucks a gallon for gas or listening to Trump called Bette Midler a washed up psycho? Would you rather havebare supermarket shelves? Or have your president say of kneeling NFL players,get those SOBs off that field? You are free to get mad or laugh it off? Well, unless you were Rosie O'Donnell.

Turns out the new guy is about as genial as a scorpion with jock rot. What I wouldn't give for the cab driver. Instead, we got grandpa Simpson driving us off a cliff. Meanwhile, the same idiots who castigated Trump for calling journalists names are now heaping praise or at least excusing Joe for the very same thing. It shows Joe's tough, he's got backbone, even though it's crumbling from osteoporosis. Putin so scared he might even put a shirt on. So the press either has the memory of a goldfish, or just biased A-holes. My apologies to literal A-holes. So in one brief moment, Joe reminded us what we had and what we lost.

To his managers in record label, I do not, probably written with a quill pen. The 184-year-old rocker wrote \"I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines.\" What is this -- what is his accent? Potentially causing death to those who believe that this information being spread by them. I want you to let Spotify know immediately today that I want all my music off their platform. They can have Rogan or Young, not both. Maybe it's me, but that's an easy choice. Rogan of course has become a target during the pandemic for his views of the vaccine and how he treated his own COVID diagnosis. Of course, Neil Young was in a band with David Crosby, who free based every drug that wasn't Ivermectin. And it's out the first time Young is wind to Spotify. In 2019 he removed most of his songs from the platform, claiming their sound quality wasn't good enough. But were ultimately relenting and letting them carry his music.

Noe, who was invited by Turning Point USA and College Republicans was set to give a talk with ex-Antifa member of Gabriel Nadales, about far-left violence, it was titled extremism in America. So far, so good. We're all opposed to extremist violence, right? Well, not so fast after the event was announced. Leftist trolls online threatened violence if the school allowed the talk to take place. Bomb squads, police dogs had to do a sweep of the venue before Andy's arrival. And since it's Antifa, they also sniff for body odor. Three of the dogs had to be hospitalized. Ultimately, Dartmouth pulled the plug due to safety concerns, which is the worst excuse I've heard since. I can't go out with you. You're too attractive.

Doocy who just turned 16 last week, his home recuperating spending most of his time in his bedroom, playing video games, smoking blunts, and texting Kilmeade about the hot new girl in homeroom. That since this event, the so-called president has called Mr. Doocy to clear the air, which when talking about Joe usually involves opening a window and the use of at least 75 glade plugins. Apparently was a perfect phone call. Although odds are good, Joe was still talking 10 minutes after Peter hung up. But what a pair, reporter who's never shaved and a president you wouldn't let near anything sharp. But I say why bother? This is the best thing President Biden has ever done since -- in fact, it's the best thing Joe Biden has ever done. It's definitely the most honest thing to come out of his -- come out of him since he crop dusted Camilla Bowles with the air biscuit heard round the world. It's better than beating corn pop and breakdancing up the stairs to Air Force One combined. Because when Biden called Doocy an SOB, what did he do? He reminded you of the good old days, when the only problems we had were verbal. Yes, let's take a walk down memory lane or insult avenue if you will to the glorious days of old where the only things hurled through the air were words and not Russian missiles pointed at Kiev."

Now besides that rash I got into loom. But there was no inflation, no high crime unless you count the coddled left-wing mascots, Antifa and BLM, no foreign policy disasters, no education implosion, no attacks on parents. No dividing America to us versus them based on vaccinations, race or pronouns. All we had were mean tweets and some hilarious insults. So what would you rather be doing? Paying seven bucks a gallon for gas or listening to Trump called Bette Midler a washed up psycho? Would you rather havebare supermarket shelves? Or have your president say of kneeling NFL players,get those SOBs off that field? You are free to get mad or laugh it off? Well, unless you were Rosie O'Donnell.

Turns out the new guy is about as genial as a scorpion with jock rot. What I wouldn't give for the cab driver. Instead, we got grandpa Simpson driving us off a cliff. Meanwhile, the same idiots who castigated Trump for calling journalists names are now heaping praise or at least excusing Joe for the very same thing. It shows Joe's tough, he's got backbone, even though it's crumbling from osteoporosis. Putin so scared he might even put a shirt on. So the press either has the memory of a goldfish, or just biased A-holes. My apologies to literal A-holes. So in one brief moment, Joe reminded us what we had and what we lost.

Neil Young says he wants his music pulled off Spotify because the company is providing a platform for Joe Rogan. That's the Rock and Roll spirit. In an open letter -- who does that? To his managers in record label, I do not, probably written with a quill pen. The 184-year-old rocker wrote \"I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines.\" What is this -- what is his accent? Potentially causing death to those who believe that this information being spread by them. I want you to let Spotify know immediately today that I want all my music off their platform. They can have Rogan or Young, not both. Maybe it's me, but that's an easy choice. Rogan of course has become a target during the pandemic for his views of the vaccine and how he treated his own COVID diagnosis. Of course, Neil Young was in a band with David Crosby, who free based every drug that wasn't Ivermectin. And it's out the first time Young is wind to Spotify. In 2019 he removed most of his songs from the platform, claiming their sound quality wasn't good enough. But were ultimately relenting and letting them carry his music. So maybe it wasn't Spotify's his fault. Maybe the songs aren't that good. Let's have a quick refresher of Young's biggest hit."

Journalists Andy Noe's event at Dartmouth College at bartending correspondence school was cancelled last week after Antifa protested his appearance on campus, which has us wondering, will the school change their nickname from big green to big yellow to match the street down their backs? Noe, who was invited by Turning Point USA and College Republicans was set to give a talk with ex-Antifa member of Gabriel Nadales, about far-left violence, it was titled extremism in America. So far, so good. We're all opposed to extremist violence, right? Well, not so fast after the event was announced. Leftist trolls online threatened violence if the school allowed the talk to take place. Bomb squads, police dogs had to do a sweep of the venue before Andy's arrival. And since it's Antifa, they also sniff for body odor. Three of the dogs had to be hospitalized. Ultimately, Dartmouth pulled the plug due to safety concerns, which is the worst excuse I've heard since. I can't go out with you. You're too attractive.
