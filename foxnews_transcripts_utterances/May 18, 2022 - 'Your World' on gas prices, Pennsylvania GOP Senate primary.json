      "sentences": "Charles, it was a bloodbath. It took out even the sectors often considered safe, like consumer staples. Think Campbell's Soup, for instance. If you look at the Dow, it had its worst day in quite some time, slumping 3.6 percent, or more than 1,100 points, the S&P 500 down more than 4 percent, the Nasdaq down almost 5. Mohamed El-Erian says, yes, we have entered a new phase of this sell-off, as runaway inflation erodes living standards and profits. Take a look at Target. It lost a quarter of its value today, the worst day for them since Black Monday, 1987. Why? Higher costs for gas, for shipping pushed their own costs up by a billion dollars. They couldn't pass all that on to shoppers, so their quarterly profits fell 50 percent. Well, yesterday, Walmart said its profits fell 25 percent, as inflation becomes unmanageable. The lower-income consumer feels it the most. Look here. Dollar General, Dollar Tree, those stocks tanked today, 14 percent for Dollar Tree. CEOs are noting a shift in how we shop, from buying big things like electronics and appliances to buying food and essentials. And Goldman Sachs says it's seeing customers tap into credit to get by. Fed Chief Jay Powell says the Federal Reserve must bring down inflation. And they're going to act aggressively, raising rates to do so. And that warning hit the growth stocks today. Apple, the country's biggest company, it's down 22 percent from its highs. Meta, Facebook, that's down 49 percent. And if you think that's bad, look at Netflix. It's lost three-quarters of its value from its 52-week high. So, investors right now are wondering, how low can these stocks go if they're growth stocks? How much is growth going to slow in general? And the other risk is the R word, recession. Are we in one? Are we about to enter one? And, if so, Charles, how bad is it going to be?",

And they have been unable, finally, to pass it on to the consumer. This is what we call price elasticity. And you heard that from Walmart's CEO yesterday. He says consumers are still spending, but there's a point at which they are willing to opt for the cheaper options here, especially with those private labels. Target's CEO says that the consumer is still strong about. But what they're willing to pay for right now are experiences, instead of the basic goods. I think it's interesting that also Target and Lowe's part of the sell-off today. Yes, they missed on profit, but they kept their sales guidance intact for this year. And what that tells me, Charles, is that these companies, they will be forced to eat some of the higher prices and inflation and not be able to pass that on to consumers.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, I will tell you this, is that stock markets seem to be pricing in a 70 percent probability of a recession. You heard from Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, this morning. She talks about a strong household and consumer, because they're still cashed up. They have been unable to spend. And you have been able to see some of these companies. They have been raising prices. Look at the airfares that you're paying, up 20 percent from month to month, and rising at record paces. Now, I will tell you this also is that there is some optionality out there, meaning that, yes, we're pricing at a 70 percent probability of a recession, but the Fed, they could -- and you heard that from Jay Powell yesterday at The Wall Street Journal conference -- is that, yes, they're behind the curve. They should have raised interest rates earlier. But there is optionality, in that if they see that the stock market is doing the work for them, which it seems to be, given that were down 1,200 points, they could take their foot off the pedal. And that would actually be, I would say, positive for risk assets up there. And it's been pretty orderly, don't you think? I mean, look at the volatility and the fear gauge. It's gone nowhere in the last year or so. In this type of sell-offs, and especially if there's panic, as you have seen in '87, since we have been referring to retail stocks seeing the worst day since that Black Monday, it's been pretty orderly. And people are not running for the exits, and nor is there that huge volume to sell in these markets.",

As we look at this race, it is really too close to call at this moment. Right now, we have Oz leading, about 2,100 votes ahead of McCormick. If the lead stays at or below 0.5 percent, it'll trigger an automatic recount, which must be completed by June 7. There are still thousands of mail-in ballots to count, including absentee and military ballots. In Lancaster County, workers have about 16,000 ballots left to count after a batch of 22,000 ballots misprinted and must now be marked by hand. in Allegheny County, McCormick's hometown of Pittsburgh, we're still waiting on results from 31 precincts after memory sticks on voting machines failed. Those memory sticks with votes have been transferred to a central facility. We're told counting will easily extend into next week. We're told the McCormick camp is feeling confident because mail-in ballots have been going their way. They think they have enough of those uncounted mail-in ballots to overtake Dr. Oz. The Dr. Oz camp feels optimistic that they can hold their lead. Last night, Oz specifically thanked former President Trump for his endorsement, which boosted his campaign.",

But, really, this is -- the question about these primaries is really the influence of Donald Trump. And what is interesting to me is to see sort of the MAGA agenda sometimes split from Trump's endorsements and which one was more powerful. Here, he endorsed Dr. Oz, and Dr. Oz is now in this very, very tight run- off with a more sort of fiscally traditional Republican, while the person who really represented the MAGA agenda, probably closest, is Kathy Barnette. And she's out of this race, but she had an enormous surge. And a lot of people thought that she was actually really, really close to winning this thing. And she came from behind at the last minute. So it'll be interesting to see how Trump's endorsement and some of his heterodox on in terms of trying to establishment GOP, his heterodox policies, how those sometimes split apart. Sometimes, they're in the same place, right, with J.D. Vance, for example. But, here, they have split apart, where Dr. Oz has not been -- on a lot of the cultural issues especially, has not been aligned with what I think a lot of Republicans understand to be the MAGA agenda. But he had that personal endorsement from Donald Trump. So, here, those things are split apart.",

I think this certainly neutralizes some of the headwinds we see with the environmental factors like inflation. And when you send extremist candidates, then they line up real well with the moderate Democrats that are winning their primaries across the country. So I think it was a big day for Democrats because of the Republican choices and the fact that President Trump really does still have influence on the party. And I will say this, one other footnote. Madison Cawthorn losing his race shows that, when the establishment and moderate Democrat -- or moderate Republicans get together, they can actually stop Trump from sending those extreme candidates.

And if they do that, long term, that is why we need to get them the arms with the standoff distance and lethality, so that Ukraine can continue that fight, cut off the Russians and allow them to wither on the vine and keep their forces boxed up, and eventually be able to push them back to the border.

And the housing inflation really hasn't shown up yet. So the White House has got bad news, economic news on the price front coming forward. So it makes no sense. In fact, Charles, you probably noticed this, but four countries are lowering their business tax rates to fight inflation, knowing those taxes end up in the bottom line for consumers in higher prices. And we have a president going exactly the opposite direction at exactly the wrong time for families and workers. So, look, his whole economic policies have been puzzling, to say the least.

    {
      "speaker": "LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Charles, it was a bloodbath. It took out even the sectors often considered safe, like consumer staples. Think Campbell's Soup, for instance. If you look at the Dow, it had its worst day in quite some time, slumping 3.6 percent, or more than 1,100 points, the S&P 500 down more than 4 percent, the Nasdaq down almost 5. Mohamed El-Erian says, yes, we have entered a new phase of this sell-off, as runaway inflation erodes living standards and profits. Take a look at Target. It lost a quarter of its value today, the worst day for them since Black Monday, 1987. Why? Higher costs for gas, for shipping pushed their own costs up by a billion dollars. They couldn't pass all that on to shoppers, so their quarterly profits fell 50 percent. Well, yesterday, Walmart said its profits fell 25 percent, as inflation becomes unmanageable. The lower-income consumer feels it the most. Look here. Dollar General, Dollar Tree, those stocks tanked today, 14 percent for Dollar Tree. CEOs are noting a shift in how we shop, from buying big things like electronics and appliances to buying food and essentials. And Goldman Sachs says it's seeing customers tap into credit to get by. Fed Chief Jay Powell says the Federal Reserve must bring down inflation. And they're going to act aggressively, raising rates to do so. And that warning hit the growth stocks today. Apple, the country's biggest company, it's down 22 percent from its highs. Meta, Facebook, that's down 49 percent. And if you think that's bad, look at Netflix. It's lost three-quarters of its value from its 52-week high. So, investors right now are wondering, how low can these stocks go if they're growth stocks? How much is growth going to slow in general? And the other risk is the R word, recession. Are we in one? Are we about to enter one? And, if so, Charles, how bad is it going to be?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I just want to tackle the retailers, first of all, Charles, because this is macro becoming micro, meaning the record high gas prices, higher wages is finally biting into the profit margins of some of these retailers. And they have been unable, finally, to pass it on to the consumer. This is what we call price elasticity. And you heard that from Walmart's CEO yesterday. He says consumers are still spending, but there's a point at which they are willing to opt for the cheaper options here, especially with those private labels. Target's CEO says that the consumer is still strong about. But what they're willing to pay for right now are experiences, instead of the basic goods. I think it's interesting that also Target and Lowe's part of the sell-off today. Yes, they missed on profit, but they kept their sales guidance intact for this year. And what that tells me, Charles, is that these companies, they will be forced to eat some of the higher prices and inflation and not be able to pass that on to consumers."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, I will tell you this, is that stock markets seem to be pricing in a 70 percent probability of a recession. You heard from Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, this morning. She talks about a strong household and consumer, because they're still cashed up. They have been unable to spend. And you have been able to see some of these companies. They have been raising prices. Look at the airfares that you're paying, up 20 percent from month to month, and rising at record paces. Now, I will tell you this also is that there is some optionality out there, meaning that, yes, we're pricing at a 70 percent probability of a recession, but the Fed, they could -- and you heard that from Jay Powell yesterday at The Wall Street Journal conference -- is that, yes, they're behind the curve. They should have raised interest rates earlier. But there is optionality, in that if they see that the stock market is doing the work for them, which it seems to be, given that were down 1,200 points, they could take their foot off the pedal. And that would actually be, I would say, positive for risk assets up there. And it's been pretty orderly, don't you think? I mean, look at the volatility and the fear gauge. It's gone nowhere in the last year or so. In this type of sell-offs, and especially if there's panic, as you have seen in '87, since we have been referring to retail stocks seeing the worst day since that Black Monday, it's been pretty orderly. And people are not running for the exits, and nor is there that huge volume to sell in these markets."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",

They think that they're -- they think the retail investor has to suffer more, has to blink more, has to so-called puke it all up, panic. They will actually think that's going to be the buy signal. And until we get that volatility, until we get that volume spike, Wall Street is saying, we're going to go much lower, and that's what's concerning me. It doesn't have to come to fruition, but that's what folks on the Street are looking for."

      "speaker": "LI",

It is the county, the Philadelphia suburb that put Dr. Mehmet Oz just in the lead late last night, ahead of his challenger, former CEO of a hedge fund, Dave McCormick. As we look at this race, it is really too close to call at this moment. Right now, we have Oz leading, about 2,100 votes ahead of McCormick. If the lead stays at or below 0.5 percent, it'll trigger an automatic recount, which must be completed by June 7. There are still thousands of mail-in ballots to count, including absentee and military ballots. In Lancaster County, workers have about 16,000 ballots left to count after a batch of 22,000 ballots misprinted and must now be marked by hand. in Allegheny County, McCormick's hometown of Pittsburgh, we're still waiting on results from 31 precincts after memory sticks on voting machines failed. Those memory sticks with votes have been transferred to a central facility. We're told counting will easily extend into next week. We're told the McCormick camp is feeling confident because mail-in ballots have been going their way. They think they have enough of those uncounted mail-in ballots to overtake Dr. Oz. The Dr. Oz camp feels optimistic that they can hold their lead. Last night, Oz specifically thanked former President Trump for his endorsement, which boosted his campaign."

I'm going to bring in RealClearPolitics' Phil Wegmann, along with Democratic strategist Laura Fink, and Inez Stepman with the Independent Women's Forum. Inez, let me start with you. A lot of debate over the influence of President Trump. But I think the last point Bryan made was really most important. There's overwhelming enthusiasm on the GOP side, no matter what faction of the Republican Party is winning."

But, really, this is -- the question about these primaries is really the influence of Donald Trump. And what is interesting to me is to see sort of the MAGA agenda sometimes split from Trump's endorsements and which one was more powerful. Here, he endorsed Dr. Oz, and Dr. Oz is now in this very, very tight run- off with a more sort of fiscally traditional Republican, while the person who really represented the MAGA agenda, probably closest, is Kathy Barnette. And she's out of this race, but she had an enormous surge. And a lot of people thought that she was actually really, really close to winning this thing. And she came from behind at the last minute. So it'll be interesting to see how Trump's endorsement and some of his heterodox on in terms of trying to establishment GOP, his heterodox policies, how those sometimes split apart. Sometimes, they're in the same place, right, with J.D. Vance, for example. But, here, they have split apart, where Dr. Oz has not been -- on a lot of the cultural issues especially, has not been aligned with what I think a lot of Republicans understand to be the MAGA agenda. But he had that personal endorsement from Donald Trump. So, here, those things are split apart."

Thank you for putting independents, young people, and especially women back on the table for Democrats in the fall. I think this certainly neutralizes some of the headwinds we see with the environmental factors like inflation. And when you send extremist candidates, then they line up real well with the moderate Democrats that are winning their primaries across the country. So I think it was a big day for Democrats because of the Republican choices and the fact that President Trump really does still have influence on the party. And I will say this, one other footnote. Madison Cawthorn losing his race shows that, when the establishment and moderate Democrat -- or moderate Republicans get together, they can actually stop Trump from sending those extreme candidates.

We're going to get a good sense of that once some of these mail-in ballots are finally counted in Pennsylvania. And quickly, though, I think that what Laura laid out is very interesting, right? Democrats are eager to run against some of these candidates who are farther to the right.

Over the last 16 months, we have seen our county go -- one of the safest counties on the Southwest border to I think one of the most challenged counties on the southwest border. We have doubled the capacity in border-related crimes in my jail, the pursuits, all the way up to murder. We have had our community challenged at the hands of this administration.

Obviously, one of the biggest hurdles right now is to make sure that the concerns being addressed by President Erdogan in Turkey, make sure that we work through those, because they are essentially blocking that right now. But, at the end of the day, I think Finland and Sweden will become members of NATO. Russia is probably going to react initially with some form of hybrid warfare. Whether they take it military or not, I actually doubt.

At this point in time, what we have seen happen is that the only time deterrence in any form has worked, it has been by Putin's threats to deter the West from taking action. Not one thing that the United States, NATO, or the West has done to date has deterred Putin from taking any action when it comes to Ukraine. I don't think they're necessarily backed into a corner or their backs are against the wall. Nobody is invading Russia. Nobody is threatening to topple their government. Nobody is demanding that we have regime change. So everything that Russia is doing right now that might justify that action flat doesn't exist. So the reality on the ground is, nothing that Russia has done to date is going to allow them to be able to push into NATO and create a wider-scale conflict."

And what that means is, if they can regain that territory, and they can get more toward the Russian border, they're going to have the ability to literally cut off the logistic lifelines that are now supporting the Russian forces in the east and even going south across the southern border area. So, if they can get in and start interdicting some of those logistics and supply lines, we have already seen where Russia is incapable of maintaining those in the first place. And if they do that, long term, that is why we need to get them the arms with the standoff distance and lethality, so that Ukraine can continue that fight, cut off the Russians and allow them to wither on the vine and keep their forces boxed up, and eventually be able to push them back to the border.

      "utterance": "Like -- because they're talking price controls. They're hinting at that. There's all kinds of crazy suggestions out there that many people think would actually make it worse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "There are many people that think that things will make it worse, but 80 percent of Americans right now saying this administration is not doing enough to combat inflation. So they'd like to see anything tried, rather than some of these things that are just -- we're just sitting here blaming everybody else. But I do think the bottom line is that people are going to want to see more production of the oil here at home, so that we can start getting some ease there. There's a lot of other things that can be done. And I think, if the Republicans start talking about what they will do in November if they take power, that's going to be really what people want to hear right now, because people are struggling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's the one area that I have seen some question marks, like, OK, we know President Biden, more or less, he declared war on fossil fuels. We heard how much electric vehicle registrations are up. That was the goal. That was the goal, to make us feel pain at the pump. But we're not hearing, are we -- we're not hearing enough, right, from Republicans, like, what is the alternative? What's their plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "That's exactly, I think, one of the biggest problems Republicans have. And I look at the polling. And you think, the Democrat approval rating is so low, you would expect Republicans to be doing really well in a generic ballot. But that's not the case, because they're not putting anything forward, except, look how bad this is. We can't afford to have this happen. That's not a playbook for success. A playbook for success lays out the map to a more prosperous America and give us hope again. When you look at the fact that only 14 percent of Americans right now feel optimistic or excited about the future of this country, Republicans have an easy job to paint a better future of what they're going to do. It's not about attacking Democrats. They don't need to do it. They can just move forward."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "No, you're exactly right. This is a mystery economic principle that just surfaced. And, look, the numbers right now for them are really bad, because inflation has been accelerating. And you have probably noticed, the last three months, we're averaging 9.9 percent inflation for consumers and for the last almost half- a-year, double digit on our wholesale prices, which means those are going to end up -- going to come into those consumer prices. And the housing inflation really hasn't shown up yet. So the White House has got bad news, economic news on the price front coming forward. So it makes no sense. In fact, Charles, you probably noticed this, but four countries are lowering their business tax rates to fight inflation, knowing those taxes end up in the bottom line for consumers in higher prices. And we have a president going exactly the opposite direction at exactly the wrong time for families and workers. So, look, his whole economic policies have been puzzling, to say the least. And this is another one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I have always said, though, to be quite frank, it's -- I don't think they are truly economic policies. I think they're driven by climate. They have got -- their goal is climate change. That's the agenda. And every now and then, they will try their best to wrap something in the veneer of economics. But when it doesn't make sense, and when it does more harm than good, someone's got to push back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes, it -- I think you're right. And it really is driven by this agenda. And another great example economically is, all their incentives to pay people more to stay home than to return to work and reconnect, they still -- they still don't recognize why more workers should be a focus and how it helps us on inflation and pricing..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "What do you make of -- this week, it has been so intriguing. You have had a couple of the richest people who've ever walked the planet, mostly liberals, maybe you can consider one a libertarian, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, pushing back on the White House and finally standing up. In fact, even Elon Musk, from what I understand, said he's going to vote Republican for the first time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think they're just tired of the nonsense out of the White House, these policies, the blame game, just the denial and really dismissing and of really some of the key economic factors. And with this country, I think they're just tired of the route that is being taken. And I think a good example of the reverse is, after the tax cuts, we saw not only the most competitive economy on the planet, but we lifted almost six million people out of poverty. Paychecks were rising twice as fast as inflation."

    },

One created organic gains, where we saw everyone enjoy -- the same tide lifting all ships, to your point. Now we're dealing with the runaway wage- price spiral. We have heard -- we're hearing from companies this week that they may have to start laying people off. So we may lose all of the gains we have had quickly if nothing is done. I mean, but what can be done?"

Their second priority would be stop the COVID era spending, get that out of the budget. The third one is, let's do more on the supply side, encourage businesses with lower rates to invest in the supply chains in all those technologies and equipment that will allow us to move out of this inflation fight."

      "utterance": "Mortgage rates increasing, rents skyrocketing, and Americans are turning, well, now to creative housing solutions. Enter stackable sleeping pods that can make a single-family home fit 14. Brownstone Shared Housing's James Stallworth and Christina Lennox join me now on their new invention -- innovation, rather. Guys, you got a 14 -- how does it work? Tell me how it works."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAMES STALLWORTH, BROWNSTONE SHARED HOUSING",
      "utterance": "Yes, so we have these sleeping pods we created, that they're just furniture that we can put into the house. And it allows more people to share a room than would typically be able to with less private bunk beds or single beds. And we create the space where they have their own lights and fans and an area to work at a desk, and then just design the house, so it can accommodate everyone."

      "speaker": "STALLWORTH",
      "utterance": "Yes, we have a lot of people interested. And since we have gotten some publicity, a lot of people are applying. Thousands of people have come to our Web site. And we don't have any spots open. But even before all of that, we always had the houses full."

Is it because what's happening in the housing market, what's happening with inflation, or do they just like the idea of even being able to have -- fit more people under the same roof?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTINA LENNOX, BROWNSTONE SHARED HOUSING",
      "utterance": "So a lot of it's money. It's easy to get into because there's no security deposit. And so that's really appealing to them. And the rents are really, really high here in Palo Alto. And so, normally, for a one-bedroom house, it would be around $3,200-plus. And so, yes, they see that $800 price tag with the utilities included, and that's really appealing to them, because our housing market is pretty insane right now."
    },

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes. No. Yes, it's probably the worst, Palo Alto. Hey, let me ask you, where do I put my 72-inch TV if I get into one of these things?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STALLWORTH",
      "utterance": "So we provide a TV that everyone shares. We have a little movie room that we set up, and there's also space to work. So it's not just a house full of pods."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

    {
      "speaker": "LENNOX",
      "utterance": "Not at all, actually. Surprisingly, it's warmly embraced by our residents. And everybody has a culture of respect, mutual respect, and love for each other. And it's just like a nice little warm community inside of our house. And I like it because there's people from 15-plus different countries now stayed in our house. And one of our unifying beliefs, basically, is that we -- we do need to respect each other. And kind of our differences, they draw us together."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "I'll tell you what. The IPO market has dried up a little bit, but something this innovative. Are you concerned about copycats? I mean, is there any sort of patents that you guys have on this? It's a brilliant idea. I'm sure it will take off in parts of this nation, but it doesn't seem like it'd be hard to duplicate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STALLWORTH",
      "utterance": "Well, it actually would be very hard to duplicate. And the reason is, it's easy to do it wrong. And, as you know, many people have tried to do this. And we have been able to build a brand. And we have a lot of customers and a lot of data. And so, if someone wants to get a six-month to a year late start to a race, then we welcome that competition."
