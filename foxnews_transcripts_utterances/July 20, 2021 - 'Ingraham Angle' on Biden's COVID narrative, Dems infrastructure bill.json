We have Senator Lindsey Graham, Glenn Greenwald, Victor Davis Hanson plus Raymond Arroyo with a hilarious \"Seen & Unseen.\" But first, \"Liar Liar,\" that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, this weekend, it became obvious that the Biden Administration is just losing control of its COVID narrative. Remember, it was just about two weeks ago now that President Biden was close to declaring independence from the virus. But now the White House is grappling with a new reality that threatens any chance of a real recovery. Now, of course, the focus on the Delta variant and the misplaced emphasis on tracking case numbers instead of preventing serious illness is coming back to bite them. The control freaks in L.A. County are reinstituting mask mandates.",

Now, they're still trying to force masks on children two and up. Now, reminder, there is nearly zero risk for kids with COVID. And most teachers are vaccinated. So for the Left, masks at some point, just become stage props, a sign of blind compliance. And for the young, the mandates are frankly demented and cruel. Now, the misrepresentation on this extends to the experimental vaccine itself for kids. These emergency use approvals have been rushed with zero long-term testing. And again, teachers are vaccinated, so why frighten or pressure children, again, who face virtually no risk of serious illness. We never required flu vaccines, and the flu kills far more kids worldwide. Now, we know there's support for school closures - speaking of misinformation - was a huge assault against children's learning and also on their social and emotional wellbeing. So anyone and everyone who supported closing schools and shutting down in-person learning should be barred from medicine and education forever. And what about the efficacy of the vaccine itself among adults? Well, anyone else think it's weird that five fully vaccinated members of the Texas Legislature who fled to D.C. in their voting rights stunt, tested positive for the coronavirus? We have to know more about that. And why hasn't Fauci and friends address this interesting data point in the U.K.? Britain's Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said on Monday that 60 percent of people being admitted to the hospital have had two doses of the vaccine. He later came out and walked that back saying it was 40 percent in the hospital, who had had two COVID shots, but obviously that's still a significant number. So why hasn't that Biden Administration addresses this? Why hasn't Collins or Fauci talked about it? Or at least put renowned vaccine expert Olivia Rodrigo on it? Of course, no misinformation roundup would be complete, though, without reminding everyone that Fauci and Collins have routinely misled America on the viral origins question.",

But we all know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been conducting dangerous and controversial gain of function research, and that Collins's NIH was insane enough to funnel taxpayer money there via the group EcoHealth Alliance. So the deluge of misinformation, disinformation coming from the White House also extends far beyond COVID. Because for political leverage, they claim that - I don't know - a few hours of criminal unrest on January 6th was itself a serious insurrection against democracy, almost as ludicrous as contending that voter ID requirements are racist, right? And even the \"Washington Post\" fact checker gave Biden four Pinocchio's for his claim, which he made three times, by the way, that Georgia's Republican drafted election law had somehow shortened voting hours. It didn't. And let's not forget, Biden lied about little things and big, including this claim that under Trump, federal contracts awarded directly to foreign companies rose by 30 percent. False - disinformation. Or the claim that his infrastructure plan would create millions of jobs when the actual estimates peg it at more like a half a million over 10 years. Then late in June, Biden either demonstrated a shameful ignorance of the Constitution or a purposeful desire to spread disinformation as to its meaning.",

All right, and I don't even have time to get into their lies about the border not being a crisis, and the disinformation about the violent crime wave not being linked to their defund the police nonsense. Democrats should be wiped out next year just on those two issues alone in the midterms. The fundamental problem here, the reason that Dems get away with this nonstop lying and disinformation campaign is because they never face any pushback from the corporate media. As a result, their thinking gets more duplicitous or sloppier and sloppier. Now, at the White House, you should always be under pressure by reporters, whether you're Republican or Democrat, to get things right. Next year, when they're up against real opponents in the midterms, they're going to have wish that they've had put all Biden through the paces and that's THE ANGLE. Here now is Dr. Harvey Risch, Yale Professor of Epidemiology, and Alex Berenson, author of \"Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns\" Alex, given all these apparent breakthrough cases of COVID with individuals who have received two shots of the vaccine, it's a bit odd that Biden and his medical D team keep referring to recent outbreaks as the pandemic of the unvaccinated, primarily, correct? ALEX BERENSON, \"UNREPORTED TRUTHS\" AUTHOR: Yes. No, you're absolutely correct. It's not just odd. It's simply a lie. If you look at the data out of Israel, and you look at the data out of the U.K., it's very clear that there's a massive number of cases happening in vaccinated people. And so, the vaccine advocates have sort of fallen back on this argument that, well, it's - yes, there are some breakthrough cases, but really the serious cases, the hospitalizations, and the deaths are still happening in unvaccinated people. The problem is that that is no longer true either in either Israel or the U.K. as the - as the U.K.'s the Chief Science Adviser acknowledged today, and as Israeli data shows, clearly. What's happening, I think, and this is something I actually warned about in the Unreported Truths 4 booklet is that the most vulnerable people are losing immunity first. So it's not that the vaccines don't have some protective effect. It's that we never really demonstrated that the protective effect was long- term, because the trials were short term and we never really demonstrated that the protective effect was on older people, because so few older, vulnerable people were enrolled in the trials. And now those chickens are coming home to roost, and instead of being honest about it, the Biden Administration is trying to punish people like me, trying to get people - trying to get Twitter to deplatform people like me, and attack people like you, and it's just wrong. They should be honest about what the truth is.",

We were there with troopers from Texas, Nebraska and Florida as well as Border Patrol, as hundreds of migrants arrived at a closed gate in the border wall. Now, the gate was periodically open to allow family units in. But at times, some of the adult men actually tried to squeeze through and take advantage. Troopers had the muzzle the gate closed and sometimes yell for them to get back. Now despite the administration's repeated claims that the border is closed, Border Patrol ultimately ended up opening the gates to allow hundreds of migrants through, including large groups of single adult men, some of whom told me, they're from Ghana and Haiti. The migrants were packed onto buses and vans and taken to processing centers that are already well over capacity. Border Patrol sources tell us it's likely many of them with asylum claims will go to ICE and then just be released into the U.S., pending their active cases. Also here in Del Rio, Texas State Troopers arrested an active member of Los Zetas, one of the most dangerous drug cartels in Mexico. I'm told the man was dressed in camo and was found walking on a local highway. He later admitted to being a paid coyote who smuggled migrants into the United States. And in the Laredo area today, Texas Troopers pulled over a semi-truck with 105 illegal immigrants crammed inside who are all being smuggled, the driver was arrested for human smuggling.

We have Senator Lindsey Graham, Glenn Greenwald, Victor Davis Hanson plus Raymond Arroyo with a hilarious \"Seen & Unseen.\" But first, \"Liar Liar,\" that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, this weekend, it became obvious that the Biden Administration is just losing control of its COVID narrative. Remember, it was just about two weeks ago now that President Biden was close to declaring independence from the virus. But now the White House is grappling with a new reality that threatens any chance of a real recovery. Now, of course, the focus on the Delta variant and the misplaced emphasis on tracking case numbers instead of preventing serious illness is coming back to bite them. The control freaks in L.A.

Now, they're still trying to force masks on children two and up. Now, reminder, there is nearly zero risk for kids with COVID. And most teachers are vaccinated. So for the Left, masks at some point, just become stage props, a sign of blind compliance. And for the young, the mandates are frankly demented and cruel. Now, the misrepresentation on this extends to the experimental vaccine itself for kids. These emergency use approvals have been rushed with zero long-term testing. And again, teachers are vaccinated, so why frighten or pressure children, again, who face virtually no risk of serious illness. We never required flu vaccines, and the flu kills far more kids worldwide. Now, we know there's support for school closures - speaking of misinformation - was a huge assault against children's learning and also on their social and emotional wellbeing. So anyone and everyone who supported closing schools and shutting down in-person learning should be barred from medicine and education forever. And what about the efficacy of the vaccine itself among adults? Well, anyone else think it's weird that five fully vaccinated members of the Texas Legislature who fled to D.C. in their voting rights stunt, tested positive for the coronavirus? We have to know more about that. And why hasn't Fauci and friends address this interesting data point in the U.K.? Britain's Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said on Monday that 60 percent of people being admitted to the hospital have had two doses of the vaccine. He later came out and walked that back saying it was 40 percent in the hospital, who had had two COVID shots, but obviously that's still a significant number. So why hasn't that Biden Administration addresses this? Why hasn't Collins or Fauci talked about it? Or at least put renowned vaccine expert Olivia Rodrigo on it? Of course, no misinformation roundup would be complete, though, without reminding everyone that Fauci and Collins have routinely misled America on the viral origins question."

But we all know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been conducting dangerous and controversial gain of function research, and that Collins's NIH was insane enough to funnel taxpayer money there via the group EcoHealth Alliance. So the deluge of misinformation, disinformation coming from the White House also extends far beyond COVID. Because for political leverage, they claim that - I don't know - a few hours of criminal unrest on January 6th was itself a serious insurrection against democracy, almost as ludicrous as contending that voter ID requirements are racist, right? And even the \"Washington Post\" fact checker gave Biden four Pinocchio's for his claim, which he made three times, by the way, that Georgia's Republican drafted election law had somehow shortened voting hours. It didn't. And let's not forget, Biden lied about little things and big, including this claim that under Trump, federal contracts awarded directly to foreign companies rose by 30 percent. False - disinformation. Or the claim that his infrastructure plan would create millions of jobs when the actual estimates peg it at more like a half a million over 10 years. Then late in June, Biden either demonstrated a shameful ignorance of the Constitution or a purposeful desire to spread disinformation as to its meaning."

All right, and I don't even have time to get into their lies about the border not being a crisis, and the disinformation about the violent crime wave not being linked to their defund the police nonsense. Democrats should be wiped out next year just on those two issues alone in the midterms. The fundamental problem here, the reason that Dems get away with this nonstop lying and disinformation campaign is because they never face any pushback from the corporate media. As a result, their thinking gets more duplicitous or sloppier and sloppier. Now, at the White House, you should always be under pressure by reporters, whether you're Republican or Democrat, to get things right. Next year, when they're up against real opponents in the midterms, they're going to have wish that they've had put all Biden through the paces and that's THE ANGLE. Here now is Dr. Harvey Risch, Yale Professor of Epidemiology, and Alex Berenson, author of \"Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns\" Alex, given all these apparent breakthrough cases of COVID with individuals who have received two shots of the vaccine, it's a bit odd that Biden and his medical D team keep referring to recent outbreaks as the pandemic of the unvaccinated, primarily, correct? ALEX BERENSON, \"UNREPORTED TRUTHS\" AUTHOR: Yes. No, you're absolutely correct. It's not just odd. It's simply a lie. If you look at the data out of Israel, and you look at the data out of the U.K., it's very clear that there's a massive number of cases happening in vaccinated people. And so, the vaccine advocates have sort of fallen back on this argument that, well, it's - yes, there are some breakthrough cases, but really the serious cases, the hospitalizations, and the deaths are still happening in unvaccinated people. The problem is that that is no longer true either in either Israel or the U.K. as the - as the U.K.'s the Chief Science Adviser acknowledged today, and as Israeli data shows, clearly. What's happening, I think, and this is something I actually warned about in the Unreported Truths 4 booklet is that the most vulnerable people are losing immunity first. So it's not that the vaccines don't have some protective effect. It's that we never really demonstrated that the protective effect was long- term, because the trials were short term and we never really demonstrated that the protective effect was on older people, because so few older, vulnerable people were enrolled in the trials. And now those chickens are coming home to roost, and instead of being honest about it, the Biden Administration is trying to punish people like me, trying to get people - trying to get Twitter to deplatform people like me, and attack people like you, and it's just wrong. They should be honest about what the truth is."

Just all the large numbers of cases in people who had been vaccinated, they stopped counting. So of course, those cases don't register for the CDC's counts since all the great proportion that they're claiming, are in unvaccinated people.

And the thing that's so amazing, Laura, is even if you're somebody who isn't incredibly disturbed by the idea that the government is instructing social media companies what should and shouldn't be allowed to be on the internet, these are the people least competent to judge what is misinformation. They're the ones who spent a year saying that the theory of a COVID lab leak in Wuhan was a crazy conspiracy theory, and now they say it's highly plausible. Worse, these are the same people who flooded the country for five years with deranged conspiracy theories that Putin and the Russians had taken control over the U.S. through clandestine sexual blackmail.

Obviously, the other two cable networks combined don't get anywhere near the audience of this network. And so they look at Ben Shapiro and other Right Wing voices, and they're angry that more people want to listen to them than to these corporate media outlets. And so their only option, instead of looking in the mirror and asking why people don't want to listen to them, is to try and just silence everybody so that they maintain their monopoly over the discourse, and everyone is captive to listen to them, because everyone else has been silenced.

But instead of when you ask a question, you raise a point - a data point, then you're a vaccine denier, you're anti-science, you have to be stopped, it's disinformation.

And our only option to survive politically, is to control the means of communication that we no longer control, which is the internet.

And if the wild video shot by Fox today is any indication, it's only getting worse. The man who captured the scene, Fox News National Correspondent Bill Melugin has the story for us tonight. Bill, what are you seeing?"

      "utterance": "Well, Laura, this was one of the biggest single groups that I have ever seen here at the border. We've witnessed a group of up to 400 illegal immigrants arriving at the border wall here in Del Rio today. They had hopes of being led into the United States and ultimately almost all of them were led in."

      "utterance": "Take a look at this wild video from earlier today when we were out there. Crazy scene. We were there with troopers from Texas, Nebraska and Florida as well as Border Patrol, as hundreds of migrants arrived at a closed gate in the border wall. Now, the gate was periodically open to allow family units in. But at times, some of the adult men actually tried to squeeze through and take advantage. Troopers had the muzzle the gate closed and sometimes yell for them to get back. Now despite the administration's repeated claims that the border is closed, Border Patrol ultimately ended up opening the gates to allow hundreds of migrants through, including large groups of single adult men, some of whom told me, they're from Ghana and Haiti. The migrants were packed onto buses and vans and taken to processing centers that are already well over capacity. Border Patrol sources tell us it's likely many of them with asylum claims will go to ICE and then just be released into the U.S., pending their active cases. Also here in Del Rio, Texas State Troopers arrested an active member of Los Zetas, one of the most dangerous drug cartels in Mexico. I'm told the man was dressed in camo and was found walking on a local highway. He later admitted to being a paid coyote who smuggled migrants into the United States. And in the Laredo area today, Texas Troopers pulled over a semi-truck with 105 illegal immigrants crammed inside who are all being smuggled, the driver was arrested for human smuggling. Laura, we'll send it back to you."

      "utterance": "Unbelievable story. Now, while our border completely breaks down, the Biden Administration has set its sights elsewhere - so called American infrastructure. But not by addressing the very real issue of roads and bridges, but rather by pouring billions into political pet projects that could fundamentally change the face of this country. Now, earlier tonight, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer decided to move toward a final vote on the bill despite the fact that it hasn't even been written yet. Here now, Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator, the media is still calling this effort, \"bipartisan.\" How is this bipartisan and why would a single Republican, even if you're retiring grant them the veneer of legitimacy here?"

      "speaker": "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC)",
      "utterance": "Right. We're not going to file - we're not going to proceed to bill that's not written because that makes no sense. So if Joe Biden really wants to do infrastructure, roads, bridges, and ports, for around $1 trillion, there are plenty of Republicans who are with him. Chuck Schumer is trying to blow this effort up. Can you imagine? You've been around town for a while here, Laura. Filing cloture on a bill that doesn't exist is insane. So President Biden, get on the phone to Schumer and tell him to stand down. Tell him that you're undercutting an effort to find common ground on infrastructure regarding roads, bridges, and ports. You can tell Schumer to stop. Whether he will or not I don't know, but you should at least try to stop him from blowing this up."

      "utterance": "What you can do from infrastructure, which is not in the bipartisan package, and I'm glad they're continuing to negotiate and make progress -- what you can do is put election infrastructure in there. You could tie it to certain things as incentives for states to do same-day registration, to do the mail-in balloting."

      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That really helps roads and bridges, right? Yes. So this is the power grab. The $3.5 trillion Democratic infrastructure package has got not a damn thing to do with infrastructure. They're wanting to put amnesty in the infrastructure bill. So you had a great story just a moment ago about a broken border. Imagine if you gave legal status to illegal immigrants without first securing the border? No proposal that's ever been made in Washington gave legal status until the border was first secured. Joe Biden said today he wants to put amnesty in the Democratic infrastructure bill. That will lead to an invasion of illegal immigration. It will put jet fuel on a system that's already broken. If you give one person legal status, there will be a run on our border like you've never seen before. The dumbest idea in the history of the Senate, the history of the White House, it will lead to a breakdown of law and order beyond what you see today."
