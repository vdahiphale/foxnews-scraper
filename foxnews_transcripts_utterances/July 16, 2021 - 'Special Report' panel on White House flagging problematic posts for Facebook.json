If you said at the beginning of the Hunter Biden investigation that this laptop is going to provide information, that was one of the things that was disinformation, Ben. So as it evolved, it's now not disinformation as the head of the W.H.O. just conceded. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I'm sorry to disappoint Harold, but \"transparency\" is not a word I in any way associate with any processes when it comes to Facebook flagging misinformation or disinformation. In fact, they are completely opaque in terms of their processes, what they judge, and how they deem things to be determined, including even their fact-checking process, which we previously at \"The Federalist\" ran into on exactly this issue when it came to reporting and writing about the lab leak hypothesis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that was something that certainly frustrated us as a publisher, but it was also far more frustrating from the perspective of individuals, just trying to share their own thoughts, their own information. And one of the things that I'm really concerned about, when it came to Jen Psaki's comments today, is she mentioned the fact that this wasn't just about Facebook but about also the companies in other areas that they own. They obviously own the popular messaging component, the app, WhatsApp, which is something that a lot of people use to communicate. What we saw during the Hunter Biden experience was that people weren't even allowed to direct message \"New York Post\" reporting about that laptop on Twitter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Is this going to be a similar circumstance where Facebook starts to reach into the private communications of individuals under the guise of preventing misinformation, disinformation, when we all know that the real reason that people are seeing these declines in terms of vaccination rates is the kind of story that you had earlier about L.A. County, about these school processes, that say regardless of your vaccination status, you are going to have to wear a mask again. That does much more damage to the cause of vaccination than I would say any kind of sharing of information or debate around the origination of this virus or any of the other related issues that we're discussing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I don't fault this administration for trying to use every tool possible to get as many Americans vaccinated, because one thing we do know, if you're vaccinated, the chances of you getting sick or worse from this virus decreases in overwhelming and dramatic terms to less than 0.1 percent. This is what we should be doing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No American, no person in public life, in responsible public life should be encouraging people not to get the vaccine.

I'm an immunologist, and I have worked in the lab, and lab accidents happen. It's common. I have seen it happening. And I have myself had errors. So it can happen."

      "utterance": "The beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, if you said on Facebook or on Twitter that there was a leak from the lab at Wuhan that caused this coronavirus to spread, that was one of the things listed as disinformation. If you said at the beginning of the Hunter Biden investigation that this laptop is going to provide information, that was one of the things that was disinformation, Ben. So as it evolved, it's now not disinformation as the head of the W.H.O. just conceded. BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I'm sorry to disappoint Harold, but \"transparency\" is not a word I in any way associate with any processes when it comes to Facebook flagging misinformation or disinformation. In fact, they are completely opaque in terms of their processes, what they judge, and how they deem things to be determined, including even their fact-checking process, which we previously at \"The Federalist\" ran into on exactly this issue when it came to reporting and writing about the lab leak hypothesis. And that was something that certainly frustrated us as a publisher, but it was also far more frustrating from the perspective of individuals, just trying to share their own thoughts, their own information. And one of the things that I'm really concerned about, when it came to Jen Psaki's comments today, is she mentioned the fact that this wasn't just about Facebook but about also the companies in other areas that they own. They obviously own the popular messaging component, the app, WhatsApp, which is something that a lot of people use to communicate. What we saw during the Hunter Biden experience was that people weren't even allowed to direct message \"New York Post\" reporting about that laptop on Twitter. Is this going to be a similar circumstance where Facebook starts to reach into the private communications of individuals under the guise of preventing misinformation, disinformation, when we all know that the real reason that people are seeing these declines in terms of vaccination rates is the kind of story that you had earlier about L.A. County, about these school processes, that say regardless of your vaccination status, you are going to have to wear a mask again. That does much more damage to the cause of vaccination than I would say any kind of sharing of information or debate around the origination of this virus or any of the other related issues that we're discussing."

Don't see the mixing of the government and the White House and this private company that's not controlled or overseen as a publisher."

      "utterance": "Yes. That's the unfortunate thing is we used to have a lot more robust community, including groups like the ACLU, that would be terrified if the federal government was, in essence, coercing companies this way, because, remember, the enormous amount of power the feds have over outside big tech groups. And we now have Democrats in the House who proposed legislation that would basically require big tech to get the sign-off of federal regulators for almost any action they take. And all of this is going to lead potentially to some really big lawsuits."

      "utterance": "It's not lost on me any of the things that are being said. I would hope that people would want to get a vaccine because they want to stop wearing a mask. I would hope people also realize that we may all get the vaccine and there may not be enough of us vaccinated that we may have to go back to wearing it. This will all be played out in court. I don't fault this administration for trying to use every tool possible to get as many Americans vaccinated, because one thing we do know, if you're vaccinated, the chances of you getting sick or worse from this virus decreases in overwhelming and dramatic terms to less than 0.1 percent. This is what we should be doing. No American, no person in public life, in responsible public life should be encouraging people not to get the vaccine. So I understand what the White House is trying to do. And if it's wrong, if it's illegal to both of my panelists, look, the courts will step in. But I doubt they will."
