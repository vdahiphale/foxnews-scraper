      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" A lot of news breaking this Friday night. While two deranged, angry lunatics fight it out in what is an increasingly nasty battle for the Democratic nomination, there was President Trump fully focused on the job, serious issues. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Earlier today, he toured what is the devastation sadly to our friends in Tennessee. Multiple tornadoes ravaging the state on Tuesday night, killing at least 25 people, including five children. On the ground, the president offered his full support, vowed to provide whatever federal assistance the state will need. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then he flew to Atlanta, where he met with officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Convention (ph), the CDC for short. The president's trip to CDC marks what has been the single, most aggressive and most thorough response, the quickest response by any modern day administration to any type of the pandemic or virus outbreak -- in this case, the coronavirus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But predictably, sadly, they can't even agree to work together to prevent people from getting a virus. I don't think the virus cares if it's a liberal or a conservative infected. Anyway, the mob and the media, Democrats, what do they do? They want to use a deadly virus as a political weapon against the president, seemingly rooting for this to be, quote, \"Trump's Katrina.\" They want you to believe that the spread of coronavirus is the president's fault, and he is not doing enough to protect you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They couldn't be farther from the truth because we have the facts, in spite of \"The New York Times\" saying it's the Trump virus. No, it's the Trump virus. If you're feeling bad, you know who to blame -- Trump. No, it's not either. Here's the timeline: first identified December 30th. Oh, they had a virus in the Wuhan province area of China. By the way, and then it is identified as having pneumonia symptoms. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then it was January 7th, when we first actually named it the \"coronavirus.\" Remember that? Now, corona -- this one is the corona variation of a previous corona. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On January 31st, the Trump administration, they in record time declared a public health emergency. Americans returning from most areas impacted to quarantine, mandatory, on military bases, something that hadn't been done for decades in this country. February 2nd, the temporary travel ban went in effect for all non-U.S. citizens who recently visited the entire country of China. Unprecedented steps by the president. He made the call, and we now know and through my interview and others most officials thought it was too early for travel ban or for any quarantine. In the following days, the president formed a task force filled it with the top, the greatest, the best scientific medical professionals in the world, led by the virus president of the United States. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On February 29th, the temporary travel ban was extended to, quote, any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days. On the same day, the State Department issued new travel restrictions to Italy, where the outbreak has been fairly large, and in South Korea. Also on the 29th, the FDA cut regulations allowing a more rapid testing response and capacity for coronavirus. On March 2nd, the president met with pharmaceutical executives where he learned that phase one testing of this vaccine is imminent, record time again. March 3rd, the administration ordered the CDC to lift all restrictions on testing. Today, the president signed $8 billion emergency spending package into law. He even donated his salary to the Department of Health and Human Services to fight back against the virus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The media mob's weaponization and politicizing of this very serious issue is beyond predictable and disgraceful. Yes. Last week, believe it or not, \"The New York Times\" said if you're feeling sick and you know who to blame. This is the Trump virus, because if the dog bites, the bee stings and you're feeling sad, it's Donald Trump's fault. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Instead of, what? Well, maybe coming together and providing you with truth and facts, what have they been doing? Sowing fear, panic, distrust. Now, make no mistake. Like with every pandemic, even the one that Biden and Obama did not react as quickly to as they should have in 2009 and '10, that was H1N1, and better known as the swine flu. The coronavirus is serious. You should be informed about real risks and real dangers, as with the flu, as with any virus, as with any pandemic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is not the first major pandemic, possible pandemic to impact the United States. We've been impacted far less thankfully than other countries, but we want a cure for everybody. 2009, here's their timeline under President Obama. H1N1, that virus infected 61 million Americans leading to, what, 13,000 deaths of within almost a year. So put that in perspective. And by the way, took six months for Obama to declare the full national emergency. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So far, there are around 250 cases of the coronavirus in the U.S., 250 too many. According to the assistant secretary of health, the overall estimated mortality rate for the coronavirus is less than 1 percent. OK. Pretty low. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The H1N1, that tended to impact young children. This one tends to impact older people a little bit more, especially those that are more susceptible with the weakened immune symptoms, the elderly with other underlying health issues. Watch yourself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They've been predicting the downfall of our economy. Not happening either. Our economy, well, in spite of Wall Street always being jittery, it continues to show the fundamental strength is at all-time high. Why? Because in February, we now know as of today, we added a whopping 273,000 new jobs, causing the unemployment rate to fall yet again. Yes, a 50-year low of 3.5 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here with the full report from the FOX Business Channel, Melissa Francis. Look, I have never been the person that says -- I said on my radio show a lot that says the barometer of an economy is the stock market. Markets get jittery. It's normal. It's a process. There are market corrections. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I wouldn't recommend anybody putting money in a market unless you leave it there for ten years and don't look at it. But when you look at these unemployment numbers revising upward December unemployment numbers, record low, the same with January. This is to show a lot of the strength and the growth continuing. MELISSA FRANCIS, \"OUTNUMBERED\" CO-HOST: It is. That was part of the tremendous news today. What you really laid out for the viewers is what the market is looking at, which is a lot of cross currents and uncertainty. The jobs number was enormous. It blew away the expectations, like you said, unemployment rate falling unexpectedly to 3.5 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Larry Kudlow, the king of pro-growth economics, coming out today and telling Stuart Varney among others that he is ready to come in with the targeted stimulus. And he knows exactly how to do that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But so much of this is based on emotion.

      "sentences": "They were not stepping up on to the plate on that virus. I can tell you from my own experience. And in terms of this virus, President Trump was projecting calm leadership in the midst of all of this coronavirus hysteria today. He traveled to the CDC where flanked by the health leaders including HHS Secretary Alex Azar and the CDC director and the noted virologist, Sean, no one ever says that, right, Robert Redfield, he talked about coronavirus but a far more serious current killer which disrupts our lives every year, known as influenza. In fact, this year is a particularly bad season because of two different strains. And according to preliminary figures from CDC, get this, it's already infected 39 million to 42 million people leading to hospitalizations and 20,000 to 50,000 deaths. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president heard those numbers today, Sean, and he was deeply affected by them. And while he wasn't downplaying the coronavirus, he did point out that by comparison, it's only confirmed 240-plus people infected in the U.S. with 11 deaths. Eleven important deaths he said. Trump acknowledged that with the more test kits becoming available and we heard there are going to be now private as well as public, many more cases will appear, especially the mild kind that we have been overlooking. Maybe we'll have more hysteria, right? In fact, testing reveals how the fear-mongering World Health Organization - - what a disgrace -- is making things worse about the questionable statement of the coronavirus death rate being 3.4 percent. Well, in fact, if you look at South Korea, which we know well, which has an advanced healthcare system like ours, they've tested over 200,000 people to reveal 6,000 cases with a death rate of far less than 1 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Sean, you know what else has a death rate of less than 1 percent?

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" A lot of news breaking this Friday night. While two deranged, angry lunatics fight it out in what is an increasingly nasty battle for the Democratic nomination, there was President Trump fully focused on the job, serious issues. Earlier today, he toured what is the devastation sadly to our friends in Tennessee. Multiple tornadoes ravaging the state on Tuesday night, killing at least 25 people, including five children. On the ground, the president offered his full support, vowed to provide whatever federal assistance the state will need. And then he flew to Atlanta, where he met with officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Convention (ph), the CDC for short. The president's trip to CDC marks what has been the single, most aggressive and most thorough response, the quickest response by any modern day administration to any type of the pandemic or virus outbreak -- in this case, the coronavirus. But predictably, sadly, they can't even agree to work together to prevent people from getting a virus. I don't think the virus cares if it's a liberal or a conservative infected. Anyway, the mob and the media, Democrats, what do they do? They want to use a deadly virus as a political weapon against the president, seemingly rooting for this to be, quote, \"Trump's Katrina.\" They want you to believe that the spread of coronavirus is the president's fault, and he is not doing enough to protect you. They couldn't be farther from the truth because we have the facts, in spite of \"The New York Times\" saying it's the Trump virus. No, it's the Trump virus. If you're feeling bad, you know who to blame -- Trump. No, it's not either."

      "utterance": "first identified December 30th. Oh, they had a virus in the Wuhan province area of China. By the way, and then it is identified as having pneumonia symptoms. Then it was January 7th, when we first actually named it the \"coronavirus.\" Remember that? Now, corona -- this one is the corona variation of a previous corona. On January 31st, the Trump administration, they in record time declared a public health emergency. Americans returning from most areas impacted to quarantine, mandatory, on military bases, something that hadn't been done for decades in this country. February 2nd, the temporary travel ban went in effect for all non-U.S. citizens who recently visited the entire country of China. Unprecedented steps by the president. He made the call, and we now know and through my interview and others most officials thought it was too early for travel ban or for any quarantine. In the following days, the president formed a task force filled it with the top, the greatest, the best scientific medical professionals in the world, led by the virus president of the United States. On February 29th, the temporary travel ban was extended to, quote, any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days. On the same day, the State Department issued new travel restrictions to Italy, where the outbreak has been fairly large, and in South Korea. Also on the 29th, the FDA cut regulations allowing a more rapid testing response and capacity for coronavirus. On March 2nd, the president met with pharmaceutical executives where he learned that phase one testing of this vaccine is imminent, record time again. March 3rd, the administration ordered the CDC to lift all restrictions on testing. Today, the president signed $8 billion emergency spending package into law. He even donated his salary to the Department of Health and Human Services to fight back against the virus. The media mob's weaponization and politicizing of this very serious issue is beyond predictable and disgraceful. Yes. Last week, believe it or not, \"The New York Times\" said if you're feeling sick and you know who to blame. This is the Trump virus, because if the dog bites, the bee stings and you're feeling sad, it's Donald Trump's fault. Instead of, what? Well, maybe coming together and providing you with truth and facts, what have they been doing? Sowing fear, panic, distrust. Now, make no mistake. Like with every pandemic, even the one that Biden and Obama did not react as quickly to as they should have in 2009 and '10, that was H1N1, and better known as the swine flu. The coronavirus is serious. You should be informed about real risks and real dangers, as with the flu, as with any virus, as with any pandemic. This is not the first major pandemic, possible pandemic to impact the United States. We've been impacted far less thankfully than other countries, but we want a cure for everybody. 2009, here's their timeline under President Obama. H1N1, that virus infected 61 million Americans leading to, what, 13,000 deaths of within almost a year. So put that in perspective. And by the way, took six months for Obama to declare the full national emergency. So far, there are around 250 cases of the coronavirus in the U.S., 250 too many. According to the assistant secretary of health, the overall estimated mortality rate for the coronavirus is less than 1 percent. OK. Pretty low. The H1N1, that tended to impact young children. This one tends to impact older people a little bit more, especially those that are more susceptible with the weakened immune symptoms, the elderly with other underlying health issues. Watch yourself."

They've been predicting the downfall of our economy. Not happening either. Our economy, well, in spite of Wall Street always being jittery, it continues to show the fundamental strength is at all-time high. Why? Because in February, we now know as of today, we added a whopping 273,000 new jobs, causing the unemployment rate to fall yet again. Yes, a 50-year low of 3.5 percent. Here with the full report from the FOX Business Channel, Melissa Francis. Look, I have never been the person that says -- I said on my radio show a lot that says the barometer of an economy is the stock market. Markets get jittery. It's normal. It's a process. There are market corrections. I wouldn't recommend anybody putting money in a market unless you leave it there for ten years and don't look at it. But when you look at these unemployment numbers revising upward December unemployment numbers, record low, the same with January. This is to show a lot of the strength and the growth continuing. MELISSA FRANCIS, \"OUTNUMBERED\" CO-HOST: It is. That was part of the tremendous news today. What you really laid out for the viewers is what the market is looking at, which is a lot of cross currents and uncertainty. The jobs number was enormous. It blew away the expectations, like you said, unemployment rate falling unexpectedly to 3.5 percent. Larry Kudlow, the king of pro-growth economics, coming out today and telling Stuart Varney among others that he is ready to come in with the targeted stimulus. And he knows exactly how to do that.

In fact, this year is a particularly bad season because of two different strains. And according to preliminary figures from CDC, get this, it's already infected 39 million to 42 million people leading to hospitalizations and 20,000 to 50,000 deaths. The president heard those numbers today, Sean, and he was deeply affected by them. And while he wasn't downplaying the coronavirus, he did point out that by comparison, it's only confirmed 240-plus people infected in the U.S. with 11 deaths. Eleven important deaths he said. Trump acknowledged that with the more test kits becoming available and we heard there are going to be now private as well as public, many more cases will appear, especially the mild kind that we have been overlooking. Maybe we'll have more hysteria, right? In fact, testing reveals how the fear-mongering World Health Organization - - what a disgrace -- is making things worse about the questionable statement of the coronavirus death rate being 3.4 percent. Well, in fact, if you look at South Korea, which we know well, which has an advanced healthcare system like ours, they've tested over 200,000 people to reveal 6,000 cases with a death rate of far less than 1 percent. Sean, you know what else has a death rate of less than 1 percent? The yearly flu."

You got Bolshevik Bernie on one side and his supporters who will share the truth about their insane socialist policies and beliefs and even the support for murdering dictatorship. Now, on the other side, quid pro quo Joe. Well, he's going to pretend to be a moderate all he can, but we all know that's not true. Biden has embraced the insane Green New Deal, which is what? $93 trillion socialist Trojan horse masquerading as a climate change bill, and also proposing massive tax increase on we, you, the American people. That's $4 trillion more than Hillary Clinton's plan in 2016. Biden also proposing government paid family leave and expansion of Obamacare, free healthcare for illegal immigrants, open borders, and oh, yes, he wants to take away your guns. And he will go use Bozo Beto O'Rourke to help him. The media mob thinks this is so wonderful. But they realize the American people won't buy it. So they're going to try hard and pretend that Biden is a moderate candidate. I keep going back to my analysis of Tuesday night. What happened Tuesday night? Bolshevik Bernie defended the murderous dictators in the regime leading up to Super Tuesday. That was the party they agreed with. Not the socialism. They are all in agreement on that. Tape we showed you last night, the same people trying to trick the American people to Joe Biden being a moderate. And -- well, say to you there really aren't issues with the gaffe thing. Does he have the stamina, the strength, the acumen and the focus that will be needed to take on number one hardest job in the entire world?

And the enthusiasm in the arena was off the charts but on the streets, we saw it, too. I would go to some of those primary locations. Don Trump Jr. was out there, some of the other family members. Ivanka was there. And you would go and there would be maybe a large group of Trump people, and then when you look at the Democrats, all the candidates included, there were more Trump people than all the other candidates included. And then President Trump broke the record in New Hampshire for the most votes, double the number that Obama had set. And that was the previous record for the sitting president. The media doesn't want to report this enthusiasm because they know there is no enthusiasm on the side of Joe Biden. And Reince is exactly correct.

So, diligent oversight, tenacious oversight eventually brings forward the truth. And what's been hampering us right now is we had the special counsel. And it's really difficult to get information when you have criminal investigations ongoing. The impeachment really stopped us as well. But now the impeachment is over, we're starting to get documents, for example, about 2,800 pages out of the State Department. We got the National Archives sitting on probably more than 10,000 pages responsive to our request for notes and the information on these meetings that took place between DNC officials, Obama administration officials, including one certain National Security Council Ukrainian specialist and Ukrainian prosecutors.

And the problem he had in any court case, and most of these things get brought within the district of D.C., it's a jury pool that's heavily tilted toward Democrats which really is one of the reasons why they decided against indicting Andrew McCabe. So, my point to the attorney general is, even if you don't indict, you have to write a report, or you have to give that information to Congress so the American people know what happened. You know, one of the requests was to the Attorney General Barr right now, within the inspector general's report, the FISA report. There are four footnotes. They were redacted. They were classified. When you read those footnotes and you compare it to the text and the public report, it's misleading. Now, I'm not blaming the I.G. You know, he writes a report, others redact it.

But they are the first to go after Trump day in and day out, and call every Republican and every conservative, and yet they dismissed what they do on their air every single day and what their correspondents do to demean Donald Trump as the president and every other conservative. It's so unbelievably wrong. And no one except for you and the rest of your teammates, Sean, call this out. It is so ignored and so washed over by the rest of the media. It's unbelievable."

      "utterance": "Dangerous crime wave continues to plague New York City. NYPD is reporting year-to-date rise in almost every major crime category. And just this morning, new video released of a brutal attack against a 15- year-old teenager by a large group of males. This is happened in Brooklyn, New York. \"The New York Post\" reporting the mob stole her sneakers, Air Jordans. Now, overall, a crime spike is being largely blamed on New York's controversial new bail law. That allows dangerous criminals to walk free. The scariest part these are the policies that Biden and Bernie would bring to your neighborhood. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, former NYPD commissioner Bernie Kerik. You know, Dan, I look at this and I'm like, I -- there are other stories underlying this group of kids, that group of kids. They don't like it -- I don't -- this is a brutal beating. How do people became this insane and violent? Look at this."

Listen, this is just a Twitter video, however disturbing it is to a lot of people. You weren't the ones on the floor being beaten up. But to that girl, that happened. This is going to scar her for the rest of her life. And, listen, I'm not going to pin this specific incident but there's no question about it, that liberalism is a damn forest fire. And every time you put these people in charge of a big city and they get their holds on law enforcement, and they go with this permissive, make criminality easy atmosphere, what do you get, Sean? You get more criminality, and more nonsense. It's a real shame because real people are being hurt by this."

He comes on the show and I say, we got video. Look what they're doing to these cops, look what they're doing to cop cars. We have video of every guilty person. Will you pledge to get every person? And he wouldn't answer. He turns around, you don't have faith in the police department. No, I want your support for the cops that we're going to use the evidence to get everybody. I want the tape used to identify every one of those kids involved in the beating."

You know, today, the police commissioner, Shea, testified before the city council and went on a rampage basically talking about how the crime spike is the result of the bail reform. And you have members of the city council saying, well, I need to see more data. Well, pick up \"The New York Post\" and look at any of the tabloids, listen to the people in the street. You know what? Take a ride around the city, and take a look around. You have to be a moron or an ostrich with your head in the sand not to see what's going on, and it's their fault."

Violent criminals released, aided and abetted and not handed over so that they repatriated. No, they get to commit more violent crimes. When do we say blood is on their hands? When for those who don't control the border where 90 percent of the heroin and so much fentanyl comes in, when do we get to that point? That, oh, maybe you are responsible because you won't take measures to protect the American people?"

I mean, when are we going to get past that? Some of us is concerned, not us on the show. And stop giving -- not all Democrats but liberals credit -- they don't deserve any credit. They don't care about that. I mean, when Bernie Kerik was the commissioner, and Bill Bratton before him, and Rudy Giuliani were in office. And they applied simple common sense, Sean. If you jump a turnstile, you get arrested, you get a check for a warrant, you go to jail. You know what happened? Crime went down. You know why it went down, Sean? It's not hard. The guy who jumped the turnstile was the guy who was going to rob someone on the train. But he couldn't rob someone on the train because he went to jail. It's called common sense. That's what they did, and what Bill de Blasio is not doing."
