Raymond Arroyo will be looking for answers in a special Tuesday appearance on the show. But first, how to win the midterms? That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Now you probably heard this, that traditionally, parties in power lose seats in the midterm elections. According to the latest Quinnipiac poll, there are some troubling signs for Republicans. But all is not lost.

But if the Democratic Party gains majority, in either House of Congress, what are they going to do? Well, they'll try to reverse all of Trump's progress, and destroy one incredible economic recovery. Industries will be decimated. Jobs will be lost. Of course, the other obvious danger, should the Democrats won, a House majority, well, what will that be?

He promised to hold China accountable, make NATO countries pay their fair share. Renegotiate NAFTA. And that is what he is doing. Republicans promised to cut taxes and rollback onerous job killing regulations. And they did that, too. Now this is why the Democrats keep talking about other issues, talking about things like Mueller or Michael Cohen, or Stormy or Michael Avenatti. But why the Democrats do that? Because they have zero answers to Trump's success. They have no alternative except to go to the tangential, unimportant issues. Now the president, because he gets how to tell a story, he understands the value of touting the economy as he did tonight in Florida.",

Its face it, due to Trump agenda, we have record-low unemployment and the best job market in decades. And by the way, we have 375,000 manufacturing jobs that did come back to the United States, President Obama. According to MarketWatch today, wage and benefits are rising at the fastest pace in the decade. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The employment cost index rose .6 percent in the second quarter, a tick below the MarketWatch estimate of 7.4 percent. More important, the cost of worker compensation, in the form of pay and benefits, edged up 2.8 percent to mark the biggest yearly-gain since mid-2008. In other words, workers are making out better. You bet. The argument for every Republican candidate goes something like this. If you want to get this economy going, if you want to keep this job market thriving, see your investment accounts growing, vote Republican. Number two, a way to avoid impeachment, and keep the midterm elections and Republicans grip? Educate voters on what the Democrats have become. The Democrats, let's face it, have gone totally nuts. Then now want to abolish ICE. They believe people should not be able to use things like normal gender pronouns, that's offensive to Democrats. They prefer that I guess we go to war with Russia rather than supporting Trump's diplomatic overtures to Russia. They want to sanctuary cities from sea to shining sea. One guy even wrote a column, a Democrat, about how we should have no borders at all. At least they're honest. Now they have a world where illegal immigrants are protected while our citizens become an afterthought. So on the campaign trail, emphasize how the Democrats are on the margins. They're the fringe. They are the radicals. They threaten individual liberty. Now this is the party now of regulation and speech codes. It's a party that is intolerant of any view but their own. They want to turn our entire country into, like, one big college campus, where every expression is controlled by them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Number three: argue that a life Democrat congressional rule is merely going to be the nation will be locked into two years of relitigating the 2016 election. In other words, any real hope of solving our immigration, our spending, our entitlement, or our infrastructure problems -- poof -- it's all going to evaporate. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } With this economy roaring, right now, we will can focus on those things, because of Trump and his big victory, we're finally out of the post-9/11 crisis mentality. Remember, it wasn't so long ago that we were either mired in the Middle East or dealing with fallout from the housing bubble, the financial crisis, or essentially just allowing China to dominate us with impunity. But thanks to Trump, we can now, as a nation, have a real conversation, and a debate would be nice, about the role that the United States will play in a world where the limits of globalization they've frankly become pretty obvious. But let's not forget, the Democrats are loathe to even begin considering that. They don't want to debate. They want to personalize, demonize, isolate Trump from his base. The fourth way to win in the midterms and avoid impeachment: be happy warriors. Have fun on the campaign trail. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It is a great time to be an American.

This is best done by focusing on your results and offering more solutions without the histrionics or the side issues that will just be used to caricature you later on. And finally, if the president wants to do something in Congress before the midterms, hey, I would push for a middle-class tax cut. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I know they are considering another capital gains tax cut, but how about another middle-class tax cuts? Make what you already passed, and is working, permanent, and expand the cuts you have in place. That puts the Democrats totally on the defensive and on the spot. That means they are going to have to vote against their own constituents' economic well-being. That's a great idea. And one last midterm strategy, there was something of the president said about this wall and his desire for the wall that caught my attention.",

As a political strategy -- I'm talking about winning at November to prevent the impeachment of this president -- I think it is really risky. It's really risky. Why is it really risky? Because with suburban women, with the independent voters, that is not really where they are. Results matter. Making their lives better matters. And with the president on the wall 100 percent, but if you're going to take a risky gamble on shutting down the government, the time to do that?

But that was a time to take the stand. Now it is too close to the election, the midterm election. And plus, I think it would also convey a sense of chaos. And that's not what those independent voters want to see. They want a happy warrior president. They want the economic success is touted. They want to know who the Democrats really are.

Remind voters that without a GOP Congress, your booming economy is sure to unravel. And then when it does unravel, it is going to give way to daily impeachment warfare on Capitol Hill. As for you Republicans, who still don't really fully embrace the president's record, I have to say this, frankly, you don't deserve to win. But for the rest of you, make these midterms just the start of something phenomenal. And that's the Angle.

They shadow banned them. And when you shadow ban somebody, everything you put up on Twitter is invisible except to yourself. And you know what they did to the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel?

      "utterance": "All right, thanks Sean good evening. I'm Laura Ingraham, this is 'The Ingraham Angle' live as you can see from New York Saturday. We have a fantastic show, I'm always immodest, a fantastic show for you this evening. What'll prove the powerful force in the midterms? Bob Mueller or the economy? Two top pollsters join us with information you will not get anywhere else and a House candidate -- check this out -- this happened last night at midnight that I got word of this. Calls First Lady Melania Trump a name so repulsive, so vile, that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wants him banned from Twitter. Leader McCarthy will speak with us exclusively tonight about that and a lot of other topics. Plus, why is one of the NFL's most prominent owners suddenly going silent about the national anthem protest? He's being shushed. Raymond Arroyo will be looking for answers in a special Tuesday appearance on the show. But first, how to win the midterms? That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Now you probably heard this, that traditionally, parties in power lose seats in the midterm elections. According to the latest Quinnipiac poll, there are some troubling signs for Republicans. But all is not lost. But check this out, it's important you for you to understand what is at stake. Among independents, a group that Trump won by four points in 2016, Republicans face a 17-point deficit as of now versus the Democrats. Among white women, a group Trump won by nine points in 2016, they are now preferring Democratic candidates by a 14-point margin. And among voters, 65 and older, they prefer Dems by a 14-point margin. Now look, there is no doubt that the left is energized and they're craving for power. But if the Democratic Party gains majority, in either House of Congress, what are they going to do? Well, they'll try to reverse all of Trump's progress, and destroy one incredible economic recovery. Industries will be decimated. Jobs will be lost. Of course, the other obvious danger, should the Democrats won, a House majority, well, what will that be? That sounds a little bit like this. REP. AL GREEN, D—LOUISIANA: I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the president of the United States of America."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

But let's remember, should Nancy Pelosi repossess that Speaker's gavel, you can bet that she will mire the country in endless investigations of the Trump administration, and plunge us into a daily impeachment drama. There's no doubt about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Well tonight, I have four recommendations to keep all of this from happening. Number one",
      "utterance": "the Republicans should be out, day in and day out, selling the Trump economy. Go across your districts and remind people that for his administration, its promises made, promises kept and the Republican Congress helped him along the way. The president promised peace and prosperity and that is what he delivered. He promised to hold China accountable, make NATO countries pay their fair share. Renegotiate NAFTA. And that is what he is doing. Republicans promised to cut taxes and rollback onerous job killing regulations. And they did that, too. Now this is why the Democrats keep talking about other issues, talking about things like Mueller or Michael Cohen, or Stormy or Michael Avenatti. But why the Democrats do that? Because they have zero answers to Trump's success. They have no alternative except to go to the tangential, unimportant issues. Now the president, because he gets how to tell a story, he understands the value of touting the economy as he did tonight in Florida."

It will be history."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It was great. And I think about a lot of things, I think about old flashbacks, but it really makes me smile, given everything that has happened on the economic front, to look back on what Barrack Obama said about Trump back in 2016. Do any of you recall this?"

      "speaker": "BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "When somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he is going to bring all these jobs back, well, how exactly is he going to do that? He just says, I will negotiate a better deal. How? How exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have and usually, the answer is, he doesn't have an answer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK. Well, he's got something. I don't offense his magic wand. Maybe it's just great politics. Its face it, due to Trump agenda, we have record-low unemployment and the best job market in decades. And by the way, we have 375,000 manufacturing jobs that did come back to the United States, President Obama. According to MarketWatch today, wage and benefits are rising at the fastest pace in the decade. The employment cost index rose .6 percent in the second quarter, a tick below the MarketWatch estimate of 7.4 percent. More important, the cost of worker compensation, in the form of pay and benefits, edged up 2.8 percent to mark the biggest yearly-gain since mid-2008. In other words, workers are making out better. You bet. The argument for every Republican candidate goes something like this. If you want to get this economy going, if you want to keep this job market thriving, see your investment accounts growing, vote Republican. Number two, a way to avoid impeachment, and keep the midterm elections and Republicans grip? Educate voters on what the Democrats have become. The Democrats, let's face it, have gone totally nuts. Then now want to abolish ICE. They believe people should not be able to use things like normal gender pronouns, that's offensive to Democrats. They prefer that I guess we go to war with Russia rather than supporting Trump's diplomatic overtures to Russia. They want to sanctuary cities from sea to shining sea. One guy even wrote a column, a Democrat, about how we should have no borders at all. At least they're honest. Now they have a world where illegal immigrants are protected while our citizens become an afterthought. So on the campaign trail, emphasize how the Democrats are on the margins. They're the fringe. They are the radicals. They threaten individual liberty. Now this is the party now of regulation and speech codes. It's a party that is intolerant of any view but their own. They want to turn our entire country into, like, one big college campus, where every expression is controlled by them."

With this economy roaring, right now, we will can focus on those things, because of Trump and his big victory, we're finally out of the post-9/11 crisis mentality. Remember, it wasn't so long ago that we were either mired in the Middle East or dealing with fallout from the housing bubble, the financial crisis, or essentially just allowing China to dominate us with impunity."

The fourth way to win in the midterms and avoid impeachment",
      "utterance": "be happy warriors. Have fun on the campaign trail. It is a great time to be an American. I can't think of a better time, frankly, in my lifetime, and this economy, than right now. Are you kids out there watching? These are the good old days. Because of the efforts of Republicans and this White House, more Americans will be able to pursue happiness.

He said, my 401(k) is up 44 percent and to my wife thinks I am for the first time a financial genius. She is giving him all the credit. She said, darling, I love you so much. And he said, yes, I am great financial wizard."

      "utterance": "The audience was laughing and having fun. That is what politics at its best is all about. Making people's lives better. Connecting with the electorate. Personalizing the narrative. And that's with the president did tonight. He's out explaining why his policies are working. Highlighting the results and the benefits for particular regions of the country. I hope he goes to places, by the way, that he lost in the general election, or the vote was kind of close. Don't be deterred by the protesters or their resistance mentality from traveling to places like California, Illinois, Colorado, and go back to Wisconsin, go to Michigan. To win over independent voters, and even some Democrats, the president and the Republicans have to take the wind out of the resistance's sails. This is best done by focusing on your results and offering more solutions without the histrionics or the side issues that will just be used to caricature you later on. And finally, if the president wants to do something in Congress before the midterms, hey, I would push for a middle-class tax cut. I know they are considering another capital gains tax cut, but how about another middle-class tax cuts? Make what you already passed, and is working, permanent, and expand the cuts you have in place. That puts the Democrats totally on the defensive and on the spot. That means they are going to have to vote against their own constituents' economic well-being. That's a great idea. And one last midterm strategy, there was something of the president said about this wall and his desire for the wall that caught my attention."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We're going to have tremendous border security that will include the wall. That will include the wall. We have started large portions of the wall, but we are going to need -- even the way we negotiate, we're going to need more, we're going to get more, and we may have to do some pretty drastic things, but we are going to get it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "All right, well, I hope by drastic things, he's not referring to a government shutdown. Now I know a lot of you conservatives are like, yeah, government shutdown. I get it. It's tantalizing. But it's like the skeleton crew works the government and it functions just fine for a time being and I might force Congress to fund the wall before the midterms, although I'm not sure that would happen. As a political strategy -- I'm talking about winning at November to prevent the impeachment of this president -- I think it is really risky. It's really risky. Why is it really risky? Because with suburban women, with the independent voters, that is not really where they are. Results matter. Making their lives better matters. And with the president on the wall 100 percent, but if you're going to take a risky gamble on shutting down the government, the time to do that? That was last March when the whole omnibus spending bill debate was going on. Right? That's when the president had the good instinct, it was in the morning he voted on it, the good instinct to veto it. Well the Republicans made him change his mind on that -- he didn't veto it. But that was a time to take the stand. Now it is too close to the election, the midterm election. And plus, I think it would also convey a sense of chaos. And that's not what those independent voters want to see. They want a happy warrior president. They want the economic success is touted. They want to know who the Democrats really are. They wanted steady as she goes. So Mr. President keep the focus on the economy, like you did tonight, and your party cannot lose. Remind voters that without a GOP Congress, your booming economy is sure to unravel. And then when it does unravel, it is going to give way to daily impeachment warfare on Capitol Hill. As for you Republicans, who still don't really fully embrace the president's record, I have to say this, frankly, you don't deserve to win. But for the rest of you, make these midterms just the start of something phenomenal. And that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction as John Summers, a Democrat and former communication director for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Dan Bongino, an NRA TV contributor and author of the forthcoming book, \"Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump.\" Great to see both of you. All right, John, take it away. Where do you think I went wrong with my four steps to holding the House and Senate and avoiding impeachment?"

He obviously didn't have a 0 percent chance of winning. He speaks more to your animosity toward the person than it does your political acumen. Now I just want to address something John said though. I am always kind of weirded out by this, when people say Trump should focus more on the middle class, when he just was responsible largely for a tax cut that has filtered down to the middle class and now we are seeing the numbers. I get this a lot when I debate with Democrats. They try to prod you with emotion, but they lose all of the facts and data. We just had the employment cost index. 2.8 percent. Barack Obama hovered around 2.2 present this entire time. He's at 2.8, Trump is only been in office two years. We've just seen an explosive growth, even an income tax revenue toward the government. We've seen 4.1 percent GDP. Recovering from eight disastrous years of Barack Obama.

I'd go for another middle-class tax cut. Dan Bongino, do you agree with me? I'd push the Democrats on that.

Running on the economy, a middle-class tax cut, is the pro-growth message that the Republicans need. If they get distracted shutting down the government over immigration, that's the stone-cold loser. You asked about the Mueller investigation -- Trump's numbers have gone up, the Republican numbers have gone up, as that investigation has carried on.

The congressman joins us now exclusively with more on that and other issues. Congressman McCarthy, this is so low, but it's one of the many things the left has said about conservative women over the last few years that have gone on with impunity. No repercussions, no boycotts, they say it, they get away with it, and they are celebrated for it, congressman. REP. ANDREW MCCARTHY, R—HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Exactly right. That is why he saying it. And this is inappropriate on any platform to say about a first lady, this first lady, or any other first lady. And Twitter is treating people much different. You look what they did to conservatives. They shadow banned them. And when you shadow ban somebody, everything you put up on Twitter is invisible except to yourself. And you know what they did to the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel?

They said our philosophy was Nazism. Remember what Twitter continues to do to conservatives, a shadow ban. This has got to stop especially before we go into this campaign.

      "utterance": "No, I agree 100 percent. If people really saw the president Trump I always see, he is a happy warrior. He's a lot like when you watched Ronald Reagan. If you believe your policies bring people more freedom and liberty, you should be a happy conservative."

Congressman, thanks for joining us exclusively tonight. We really appreciate it. Up next, seven illegal Mexican immigrants attempt a brazen robbery in Texas, but why do the local authorities not tell us about it initially? Stay with us."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, a viewer warning to all of our liberal viewers. You're not going to like this story because we have yet another example of crime committed by illegal immigrants. This is brazen. This time it's coming from the border town of McAllen Texas where on Saturday masked men stormed a jewelry store in a botched robbery attempt. As you can see the surveillance video, at least some of the men appear to be armed. Thankfully, authorities quickly took the man into custody. There were no injuries. According to customs and border protection, all seven of the suspects were in the country illegally. What a shocker. A fact that the local police neglected to disclose in their initial statement. Joining me now for reaction, Christopher Cabrera, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council. Chris, I always find that it's like pulling teeth to get immigration status out of local authorities or reporters who are covering these stories. But this was amazing. You have some background information in at least a few of these robbers. Tell us."

      "speaker": "CHRIS CABRERA, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL",
      "utterance": "Yes. A couple of these individuals that attempted that robbery had been arrested in California in 2015 for a similar robbery, a smash and grab type operation, where I think 10 people went into a jewelry store in the Los Angeles area and two of them ended up, two of them from this group were part of that previous group."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Chris, what I think American people get frustrated by is that these people coming to the country illegally, some of them get arrested for crimes, they do some time in California, then they are released into society because it's a sanctuary state. They are released into society. They are not really deported. Some of them are but then they come back over. They commit yet another crime. And then they do time here, we pay for three square meals a day, we pay for their incarceration, and then perhaps they'll be deported into Mexico. How bad is it right now at the border, and what in your mind has to be done immediately to stop this flow across the country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CABRERA",
      "utterance": "I think we need to be tougher on the prosecutions, tougher on the sentencings, and make it a real deterrent against coming over here. Also we need more agents in the area, on the ground. However we manage to do that, it remains to be seen. But it needs to be done because right now, it is wide open out there. And the American public deserves security along the border."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I have a friend of mine who actually used to work for me years ago, but he works in McAllen, Texas. He loves the people of McAllen, Chris, but it is in some ways, it's the Wild West as a border town. Is that accurate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CABRERA",
      "utterance": "It's a nice community, it's a great community. There are times where there is crime out here. There's a lot of home invasions. Usually, those are done -- I guess those are within the drug community, those guys fighting against each other. But it's just a matter of time before something breaks off. We have had cross-border violence for some time. Unfortunately, the local authorities, whether it is the city or the county municipality, they don't want to admit that we are having spillover violence from Mexico. And it is coming slowly but surely, it has increasingly gotten worse. It's just that people are pretending it's not there."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Obrador, the new president of Mexico, this is going to end. There is no more thruway from Central America through Mexico or Mexico into United States. Not going to happen anymore. Chris, thanks for that insight. It's fascinating. We're going to be right back, close at this hour. Do not go anywhere. Stay there."

OK, Obama had about 46 percent at the same time in his presidency. Don't be making those points on the show. There he is. He just got off the plane. He had a raucous rally in Florida talking about the economy, getting the troops all psyched up for the midterms and this gubernatorial race. Focusing on the economy, Mr. President, and it's all going to be coming up roses. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the great \"Fox News @ Night\" team are up next."
