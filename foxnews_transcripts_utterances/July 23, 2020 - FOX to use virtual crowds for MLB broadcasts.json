And right in the middle of this was the city's mayor, Ted Wheeler. He was there for solidarity, for what he is calling or what he called last night a listening session. But when he started talking, he was shouted down with obscenity. He was called a Nazi. Someone spit at him, and he was told to resign by many people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then he was hit with tear gas, not once, but twice.

Arsonists also threw Molotov cocktails. They broke through a fence around the courthouse, set fires and tampered with a fire hydrant. But when asked about his tear gassing, Wheeler told a reporter that he saw nothing that would provoke that kind of response. The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General has opened a review of the conduct of the federal officers in Portland. Several lawsuits have been filed claiming civil rights abuses. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the federal agencies are pushing back, saying that three of their officers may lose their sight after getting hit in the eyes with laser beams. At least 38 officers have been doxed, their identities revealed on social media.

The secretary mentions President Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China and says engagement with the Chinese government has since failed to live up to the change Nixon had hoped to create. He says democracies must abandon blind engagement with China and -- quote -- \"General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology. We can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries.\" Pompeo floats the creation of an international alliance of democracies to induce change in China's government. Just yesterday, the State Department ordered the Chinese government to vacate its consulate in Houston. China is warning the U.S. to reverse that decision, and, if not, promising to retaliate. The FBI claims China's consulate in San Francisco is protecting a Chinese researcher who prosecutors have charged with lying about her military background to get a visa to come to the United States. State Department officials say there's been a marked increase in Chinese spying activity in the United States over the past few years. And in just the past month, there has been a significant deterioration in U.S.-China relations.

But as for the embassy -- or -- excuse me -- the consulate closure in Houston, the Chinese presumably will retaliate.",

And right in the middle of this was the city's mayor, Ted Wheeler. He was there for solidarity, for what he is calling or what he called last night a listening session. But when he started talking, he was shouted down with obscenity. He was called a Nazi. Someone spit at him, and he was told to resign by many people. Then he was hit with tear gas, not once, but twice. After the second guessing, his security detail, well, they got him out of the area to a sheltering in a city building nearby. Federal police were firing tear gas and flashbangs for hours, as hundreds of fireworks were shot at the federal courthouse. Arsonists also threw Molotov cocktails. They broke through a fence around the courthouse, set fires and tampered with a fire hydrant. But when asked about his tear gassing, Wheeler told a reporter that he saw nothing that would provoke that kind of response. The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General has opened a review of the conduct of the federal officers in Portland. Several lawsuits have been filed claiming civil rights abuses. But the federal agencies are pushing back, saying that three of their officers may lose their sight after getting hit in the eyes with laser beams. At least 38 officers have been doxed, their identities revealed on social media. And now the Portland City Council has passed a law banning the Portland P.D. from helping the federal officers in any way."

How exactly would this work?"
    },

      "speaker": "REP. ANTHONY BRINDISI (D-NY)",
      "utterance": "Well, what the bill says is that, if a city moves to defund the police department, if they want to abolish the police department or significantly cut funding to a police department, then they - - that would put them at risk of losing certain federal grants. And I think we have to step back and acknowledge that our law enforcement does, by and large, very good work. Most officers serve with dignity and respect. And these are very difficult times that our country is going through right now. We should be having conversations about how we reform policing and improve relations. However, I don't think we should be doing that at the expense of cutting back at -- on things like community engagement programs, or body cameras, which hold bad actors accountable, or on training, which police need to be able to protect and serve."

And my goal was to build a bipartisan coalition here in Washington, D.C., to make sure that we have a voice defending our police officers. They are under assault right now. And they need our support. Do we need to make reforms? Of course we do. And our coalition believes that that should happen. And we will do that in a responsible manner. But these calls to defund the police -- Mayor de Blasio cut $1 billion out of a $6 billion budget of the NYPD, at a time when they need more help than they ever have. We need some voices of reason. And they need to start speaking up. And that's what we're going to do. And like everything I do, we're going to do this in a bipartisan manner to make sure we get the whole country on board."

I'd be interested in a couple things, first, the kind of pushback or agreement that you're seeing and talking about behind closed doors, and also the images that we're getting out of Portland, where, clearly, elected officials are making the police and the federal law enforcement agents the bad guys. They're turning them into villains in a public relations campaign that I think is making this worse. They're emboldening those folks out there who - - it's not just a peaceful protest, not all 56 nights."

      "speaker": "BRINDISI",
      "utterance": "Yes, you're exactly correct. And I think that the point behind this legislation -- and I commend Congressman Fitzpatrick, and I'm proud to work with him on this -- is to really build a bipartisan coalition here, because, by and large, if you poll the majority of Americans, they will tell you, yes, we do have to see some reforms to policing. Yes, we have to improve relationships between police and the communities that they're charged with protecting and serving. But, by and large, the Americans on both sides, I think, are against abolishing police departments, defunding police departments. And that's what this bill is meant to address."

Maybe it's a game of semantics. It means the same thing to me, if money is not going into the police departments, which, by the way, could use extra funding for these improvements in the training that everyone is -- everyone agrees that they should have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRINDISI",

And these are all things that are important, body cameras, that are important to help protect and improve relations between the police departments and the communities that they serve. And I'm all for investing in mental health and education. I think our officers are being asked to do way more than they have to right now. They're becoming educators, health care professionals, mental health counselors."

Again, I would love to see Vice President Biden come out and not use terms like redirect, and claim it's not the same as defund. And, by the same token, the American public overwhelmingly is against this idea. So, do you think they will -- maybe we can stem the tide of this crazy notion of defunding the police?"

And what we have come along and done is to basically say, we believe you can further fair housing by providing affordable, safe, decent, nondiscriminatory housing without the federal government bullying mayors and local officials into changing their zoning restrictions to do away with single family houses."

So, they have been talking about how they're going to pipe in these crowd noises at the games, which my first reaction was, this is going to sound like a really bad sitcom, when people are laughing in the background and there's no one actually in studio. But when you add in this augmented reality, you're putting life behind those sounds. And, Charles, I don't know about you. But when I watch a baseball game, I'm not looking at the faces of the fans, minus the times where you get that viral video of maybe a guy holding a baby and a beer, and then there's a foul ball and the ball lands in the beer.

And he was saying that, look, these guys come up through the farm system. So they're not used to playing -- until they reach the majors, they're not used to playing in front of these crowds that you get at Citi Field or Yankee Stadium.

Remember, it was black voters who brought Biden's campaign really back from the dead in South Carolina. And then the second part here, which goes to the heart of your question, is, he's got to find someone who is going to make younger voters enthusiastic. Not long ago, during the primary, a lot of millennials, a lot of younger voters were literally saying, please don't make me vote for Joe Biden.

But we have seen a tremendous lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden, and, more recently, his unfavorables have begun to skyrocket.

David Axelrod talked about this problem in a recent piece, where he pointed out that whoever Biden picks needs to be able to help him win the election, but then the larger question is, not only help him win the election, but be a lieutenant who is ready on day one to really go brawl with Republicans on Capitol Hill, because it is going to be a fight for him to get anything that he has proposed to the finish line."

Heather, today we got initial jobless claims, the first uptick after 16 straight weeks of decline. A lot of that can be attributed to the fact that many places where we saw reopenings, then they stalled, or they closed, or they reversed.

When you look at the jobs data, if there is one silver lining, it's that continuing claims have come down, still over a stunning 16 million people filing for continuing claims over and over again.

Our economy has done so much better than any expert thought it would. But now these experts are back saying, OK, now we're going to be right. Now the V-shape starts to plateau. Now we go back down. And it bothers me, because a lot of these places that are reclosing, I feel, sometimes, it's as much a political decision as a health decision.

But you wear a mask, like Baltimore mayor and governor of Maryland is enforcing now, and you social distance. The news that we got about the bar in Chicago closing permanently, for good, they're not alone. You're seeing businesses across the board having to shut their doors because we're shutting the economy down. According to Yelp, for example, almost 70,000 small businesses have just given up and they're saying, I can't do this anymore. And so it shouldn't be a matter of a political debate, of Democrats wanting to shut down the economy to save lives and Republicans wanting to keep it open to keep the economy going. There should be a middle common ground that we can take safe measures and cautious measures to keep the economy open."

Democrats are all in favor of doing another round, as are most Republicans, but this time it will be targeted more towards small businesses. Secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that. Those that were hit at least 50 percent by COVID will be helped to keep businesses going, and open not those big Harvard endowments or the Potbellys are the Ruth's Chris or those that may not need it.

What is the ultimate number that they should agree on, understanding that a lot of that could probably immediately go back into the economy, but also pile up on the debt? It's a difficult conversation. But we do see where the markets are becoming concerned about this. And that seems to be one of the major battlegrounds between the two parties."

And Republicans are saying, how about $200, maybe $300? Or what Steven Mnuchin is saying is that we give 70 percent of your income. So you target the number to what people making before, because the biggest problem would be that you're receiving more income by staying at home than going to work. And some may deem that an insensitive comment to those that have lost their jobs, but it's really not, because in order to sustain the economy over the long run, you want people to be working and to be employed. And so you can't make more unemployed than you are when you're working. And that's why that's 70 percent of your income prior to COVID number is being looked at by the GOP."

And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to justify the U.S. closing the Chinese Consulate in Houston because he says it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. That's according to the prepared remarks for the secretary's speech that he's about to give at the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California. The secretary mentions President Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China and says engagement with the Chinese government has since failed to live up to the change Nixon had hoped to create. He says democracies must abandon blind engagement with China and -- quote -- \"General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology. We can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries.\" Pompeo floats the creation of an international alliance of democracies to induce change in China's government. Just yesterday, the State Department ordered the Chinese government to vacate its consulate in Houston. China is warning the U.S. to reverse that decision, and, if not, promising to retaliate. The FBI claims China's consulate in San Francisco is protecting a Chinese researcher who prosecutors have charged with lying about her military background to get a visa to come to the United States. State Department officials say there's been a marked increase in Chinese spying activity in the United States over the past few years. And in just the past month, there has been a significant deterioration in U.S.-China relations. The United States has authorized and enacted sanctions on Chinese government officials and businesses that were involved in massive human rights abuses in Northwest Xinjiang, China, and, of course, revoking that special trading status that Hong Kong once enjoyed -- Charles."

This looks like the U.S. ratcheting up tensions, but what really it is, is, frankly, just the U.S. finally getting its head in the game. President Trump throughout his administration has been tough on China, particularly on trade, trying to bring some equity and some fairness to that relationship and putting tariffs on more than half of what we import from China. But the political pushback on the criminal realm and now the diplomatic realm has been a little slower coming, but now it's coming full force. What Secretary Pompeo is going to say today really is, frankly, Reaganesque. It's language we haven't really seen this starkly from the administration, so I think a good turn.
