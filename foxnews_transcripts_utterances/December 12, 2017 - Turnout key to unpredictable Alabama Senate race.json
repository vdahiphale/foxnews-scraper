Polls close at 7 p.m. local time, 8 p.m. Eastern. It's a race the nation has been closely following after the Washington Post broke a story last month alleging Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with minors decades ago. Can Moore pull off a victory tonight? He was down ten points according to our most recent Fox poll.

I think there's going to be a lot of take away for that, for other races as well since you've got a lot of people, sort of, clamoring down there. You've got Cory Booker down there.

The advantages you would think would go to the Republican candidate, but President Trump really waited a little but to get in this and doing a last minute robocall. Yet, he stood down and didn't condemn him like others in the Republican Party did.

But if you vote for Moore, you're voting for a pedophile and you're going to burn in hell. That's the two choices you have. I love America. We only have two choices.

Soros doesn't believe in Christ, he's going to hell anyway. And that's what started the whole discussion about the anti-Semitic.

There are plenty of men, Al Franken and others, who have said I'm retiring, I'm resigning, I'm getting out of the game, I'm done doing this.

And CAIR is probably the worst P.R. that American Muslims could have. If I had a family member that came to another country, tried to set off a bomb, and then he got busted, literally, red-handed, I would apologize, hide, and then cooperate.

So you can actually see in January, February, the president able, in the state of the union address, say that we are moving forward on a comprehensive immigration bill that will give him more border security, and some sort of a wall thing that he can call a wall, chain migration ending and going back to a merit-based system.

He says the DOJ and the FBI cannot ignore obvious conflicts of interest. Attorney General Jeff Sessions isn't opposed to the idea.

A special counsel is supposed to go after criminal activity. They -- if the inspector general thinks that it should be deferred to a special counsel or to prosecution, that's usually how that should work. And you have the situation where you have -- I think this is a response of a demand to do something. And I -- the wheels of justice turn very slowly, and I think one of the attempts is to try to bog everything down into investigations so that it's just so confusing that nobody knows what the heck is going on. And so that by the time there is a conclusion, nobody trusts it. But I think they should be careful what they wish for. I think there's an inspector general. They should empower them. But if they're unhappy, they should look to the top of the DOJ. I mean, the DOJ is run by the attorney general, Jeff Sessions.

I just want a second investigation.\" I'm thinking to myself, what is going on here? Ever since Flynn pled guilty, what we've seen from the White House and their legal -- and the president's legal team are efforts to call into question the integrity not only of the Mueller investigation but the FBI.
