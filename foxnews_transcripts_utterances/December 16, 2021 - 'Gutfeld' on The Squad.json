Really, why do they keep demanding so much from America when they could get everything they want from a Commie paradise 90 miles south? What whiners? Terrorists don't make this many demands when they kidnapped someone. They work for us, not the reverse. But now, they're lashing out at Biden after he said the White House has no plans to extend the pause on federal student loan repayments. Gee, I wonder if AOC has over $17,000 in student loan debt.",

Hell, even Jesse Watters can do that. And now, you expect us to wipe that financial slate clean? She makes 174-grand a year off taxpayers and for her, that's not enough. But, it does raise a point. Why do the dumbest people have the most degrees? As a matter of fact, the really smart ones don't have any. Einstein quit high school. Bill Gates dropped out. So did James Woods and David Geffen. Both Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs left school without diplomas too. What does that tell you? At least these people have made huge contributions to our world unlike you dolts. Those pieces of paper, we call it diplomas, are the only reason to mistake \"The Squad\" for being smart. And sure, maybe they got ripped off but not by you or me. They didn't go to the University of Gutfeld, which is free and voted number one party school three years in a row. Yes. I am accepting applicants but you have to send a photo. They got ripped off by the colleges who saw how easy it was to get student loans from banks tagging these brain-dead bozos with absurd interest rates. Who would think a system where 18-year-olds with no income getting $100,000 loans would cause problems? The universities and the government did. They should give themselves in \"a\" for absolutely incompetent. And, didn't AOC get a degree in economics? I could clip my toenails for six months, put them in a bag and they would understand inflation better than her. By the way, I sell them on eBay to pay off my college debt. That's enterprising. Now, they try to pretend that forgiving student debt helps the poor except the people with student debt are just like them, pampered upper-middle- class leftists who can afford more stuff than you. We've seen AOCs DC apartment on Instagram. Didn't look like Section 8 housing to me, Ms. Cortez. They pretend to be the working class but they expect the working class to bail them out. Yet, while they were racking up debt with useless degrees, the working class were denied that opportunity largely due to cost. You bailed these idiots out. You're literally taking money from people who are worse off than them. I wonder how this would play out in the real world.",

Maybe that's why Biden and Pelosi had so much plastic surgery. So, here is an idea. You want debt forgiveness that actually doesn't help the rich? I got a plan. I call it Gutfeld on Wheels. There are more people who rely on cars for a living than a master's degree in gender dysmorphia. Suddenly, their gas costs more than 50 percent than before. Their loans are roughly the same as the student loans. Why not forgive those loans for hardworking yanks instead of your spoiled scholastic (inaudible). I won't pick up the tab for some whiny entitled creep but I'll pay off the truck loan of some contractors supporting a family or an IHOP waitress with two kids who moonlights as a stripper and needs implants. I am nothing if not a philanthropist. Forgiving an auto loan is way more egalitarian than forgiving debt for people who go to Met Galas in a Tesla. But, if you want loan forgiveness, you're not -- you can't come to us. You got to go to the schools. Why punish the taxpayers? They didn't take your money. The overpaid administrators did. Their cost controls are more non-existent than Pete Buttigieg's breast pump. Of course, Joe Biden, instead of leading, continued squirming spineless void ready for the picking. He said it's up to Congress to help execute his plan to cancel 10-grand worth of student loans but only if the Congress sends him a bill. It's pretty convenient for this lame Trojan horse. And, speaking of horses, we'd be better off with Mr. Ed running things. At least he could talk. But, it could be that Joe is playing dumb. But, come to think of it, there would be no playing involved. Welcome tonight's guests. He is so young. He still calls Congress his summer job. North Carolina GOP Congressman Madison Cawthorn. She is smart as the width. She uses the Peter co-host, Host of Kennedy on Fox Business, Kennedy. She is like a string of old Christmas lights, twisted and half of the time never working, Fox News contributor Kat Timpf.

Hell, even Jesse Watters can do that. And now, you expect us to wipe that financial slate clean? She makes 174-grand a year off taxpayers and for her, that's not enough. But, it does raise a point. Why do the dumbest people have the most degrees? As a matter of fact, the really smart ones don't have any. Einstein quit high school. Bill Gates dropped out. So did James Woods and David Geffen. Both Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs left school without diplomas too. What does that tell you? At least these people have made huge contributions to our world unlike you dolts. Those pieces of paper, we call it diplomas, are the only reason to mistake \"The Squad\" for being smart. And sure, maybe they got ripped off but not by you or me. They didn't go to the University of Gutfeld, which is free and voted number one party school three years in a row. Yes. I am accepting applicants but you have to send a photo. They got ripped off by the colleges who saw how easy it was to get student loans from banks tagging these brain-dead bozos with absurd interest rates. Who would think a system where 18-year-olds with no income getting $100,000 loans would cause problems? The universities and the government did. They should give themselves in \"a\" for absolutely incompetent. And, didn't AOC get a degree in economics? I could clip my toenails for six months, put them in a bag and they would understand inflation better than her. By the way, I sell them on eBay to pay off my college debt. That's enterprising. Now, they try to pretend that forgiving student debt helps the poor except the people with student debt are just like them, pampered upper-middle- class leftists who can afford more stuff than you. We've seen AOCs DC apartment on Instagram. Didn't look like Section 8 housing to me, Ms. Cortez. They pretend to be the working class but they expect the working class to bail them out. Yet, while they were racking up debt with useless degrees, the working class were denied that opportunity largely due to cost. You bailed these idiots out. You're literally taking money from people who are worse off than them. I wonder how this would play out in the real world."

Maybe that's why Biden and Pelosi had so much plastic surgery. So, here is an idea. You want debt forgiveness that actually doesn't help the rich? I got a plan. I call it Gutfeld on Wheels. There are more people who rely on cars for a living than a master's degree in gender dysmorphia. Suddenly, their gas costs more than 50 percent than before. Their loans are roughly the same as the student loans. Why not forgive those loans for hardworking yanks instead of your spoiled scholastic (inaudible). I won't pick up the tab for some whiny entitled creep but I'll pay off the truck loan of some contractors supporting a family or an IHOP waitress with two kids who moonlights as a stripper and needs implants. I am nothing if not a philanthropist. Forgiving an auto loan is way more egalitarian than forgiving debt for people who go to Met Galas in a Tesla. But, if you want loan forgiveness, you're not -- you can't come to us. You got to go to the schools. Why punish the taxpayers? They didn't take your money. The overpaid administrators did. Their cost controls are more non-existent than Pete Buttigieg's breast pump. Of course, Joe Biden, instead of leading, continued squirming spineless void ready for the picking. He said it's up to Congress to help execute his plan to cancel 10-grand worth of student loans but only if the Congress sends him a bill. It's pretty convenient for this lame Trojan horse. And, speaking of horses, we'd be better off with Mr. Ed running things. At least he could talk. But, it could be that Joe is playing dumb. But, come to think of it, there would be no playing involved. Welcome tonight's guests. He is so young. He still calls Congress his summer job. North Carolina GOP Congressman Madison Cawthorn.
