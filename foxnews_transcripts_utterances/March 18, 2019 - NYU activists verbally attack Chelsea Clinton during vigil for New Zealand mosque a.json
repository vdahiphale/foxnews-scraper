That number sounds large and it is. And guess what, it's the same number as Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann.

The problem is that the reporter that wrote it had known about it for over a year. Joseph Menn says he sat on it because he struck a deal with members of that hacking group that you were talking about, Cult of the Dead Cow which he was writing a book about. They've confirmed O'Rourke's involvement in the group but only if Menn agree to hold the piece. Reuters is now defending the deal as a common arrangement between journalist and sources, and apparently, the candidates himself. Quote, \"In an interview in late 2017, O'Rourke acknowledged that he was a member of the group on the understanding that the information would not be made public until after his Senate race against Ted Cruz in November 2018.\" Well Cruz responded by saying, \"So Reuters had evidence in 2017 that Beto may have committed multiple felonies which Beto confirmed on the record but deliberately withheld the story for a year to help him win the Senate race? But when he is running against Bernie, et cetera, now it's news?\" Well, the group O'Rourke was a member of was responsible for things like hacking into computers and stealing credit card numbers. Though, the report says that O'Rourke never engaged in the, quote, \"edgiest sort of hacking activity.\" But he did contribute to the group's electronic magazine under the handle, \"psychedelic warlord\" including a fictional story that he wrote when he was 15 that involve running over children with a car. And here's a clip -- or an excerpt of it. He wrote, \"as I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood. And then the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. I was so fascinated for a moment, that when after I'd stopped my vehicle, I just sat in a daze, sweet visions filling my head.\" Well, after the story resurfaced O'Rourke said \"I'm mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed but I have to take ownership of my words. Whatever my attention was as a teenager doesn't matter, I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the actions I have used. And I have to constantly try to do better.\" So, O'Rourke is acknowledging that it is really hateful stuff when he was writing. Those are his words. But he's asking everybody to remember that he was only 15 years old at that time that he wrote it, Martha.",

There was no candidate who the press was more in the tank for in 2018 than Beto O'Rourke. And the fact is that if his name was Bob and he had been running against somebody other than Ted Cruz that would just not have been the case. The fact is that everyone who was really part of the media in that state, profile after profile glowingly portraying of this as a guy who collected all the right vine, knew all the hip things and was totally engaged in, you know, in culture and that kind of thing. And now that he is actually up against a couple of other Democrats in a race for the presidency, the standard is different. Now these early fund- raising numbers they are impressive, but to me, the real question is can this cult a personality around Beto O'Rourke survive the test that are going to come with running for president.

Authorities have not confirmed the Gambino crime family has posted a bounty on the back of 24- year-old Anthony Comello, but one source told our corporate cousin New York Post that the general feeling is there is an axe on this guy's back. Police say last Wednesday Comello drove his truck to Frank Cali's Staten Island home and used it to ram Cali's Cadillac Escalade and when the mob boss came out to see what happened, police say Comello shot him 10 times and drove over his body. Investigators do not believe the killing was related to organized crime, there's been speculation it was revenge for Frank Cali not allowing Comello to date his niece. But police don't have the evidence to support that. Anthony Comello was arrested at his parent's waterfront home in Brick Township, New Jersey. In court you could see pro-Trump, pro-conservative and other writings on his hand. And because he waved extradition, he'll be brought back to stand trial in New York. Meanwhile, experts say for his own safety he will likely be placed in segregation at the Staten Island jail. Those who cover organized crime say Comello's real threat will come once he arrives in state prison, which is where they believe Frank Cali's cronies will try to avenge his death. Even a high-ranking member of the NYPD told the New York Post that, quote, \"Comello is going to have some issues in jail.\" The last time a mafia don was murdered in New York was 1985 when Paul Castellano was gunned down outside of spark steak house in Midtown Manhattan. The hit was thought to have been ordered by John Gotti who then became head of the Gambino family. In 1992, Gotti's right-hand man, Sammy the Bull Gravano testified against him and sent him to prison for life. John Gotti died in 2002 of cancer. Martha?",

It is much the reason that President Trump is being dragged into being blamed for these -- for this Massacre. It is so preposterously anti-intellectual. You have a situation where President Trump is responsible for what happened in New Zealand. So, who's responsible for what happened in the Charleston, South Carolina church massacre? Who's responsible for what happened in the church in Southern Springs in Texas? Who's responsible for the Orlando Pulse nightclub? Who's responsible for the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut? It all of which happened on the Barack Obama -- President Obama's watch. It is -- it is pathetic that people look for scapegoats to blame for the things that ail us.

The left is so determined to try to paint America as a source of white supremacy, whereas, in fact, there is virtually no institutional support for these -- for a handful of kooks that are insane, they are violating the very premises of Western civilization. But, we are all on campus now. What happened at NYU is infiltrating the culture at large more and more of the -- of the Democratic Party is adopting this poisonous identity politics that is determined to paint America as a bastion of white supremacy when that is not true. As for the numbers, Martha. It is ludicrous. The number of reported hate crimes, and we don't know how many of those are Jussie Smollett hoaxes.  Last year, was identical to what it was 10 years ago when there were 25 million fewer people in the United States. And many fewer reporting agencies. And if you go 10 years before that, you have 3,000 more hate crimes -- reported hate crimes. So, the idea that there's been some surge in hate, much less white supremacist hate is completely ridiculous."

And this is the way they -- that they did it. I believe this is Washington Post, right guys? This -- OK, this from the Washington Post. So, they say they attribute six deaths in 2017 to left-wing groups. 11 deaths to right-wing groups. 16 deaths to Islamic extremists and other unknown is the highest in the group at 62 because this is the last year they tracked these numbers and that includes the Las Vegas massacre. The horrific massacre that happened in Las Vegas. But, you know, when you look at it that way, at least, in that one year, and the numbers, you know, swing around from time to time. It looks like there's no single group that is sort of dominating this issue. And also that the numbers are relatively low. We'd love to see zero, obviously, across the board here."

I do not understand the Washington Post methodology because they're unknown categories groups they don't even know what the motivation is. So, why they count -- they get to count those as extremist hate -- terror incidents -- domestic terrorism when they just may be your average guy going postal. I don't know. But they certainly, their numbers do not show a surge in white supremacist violence. It's just preposterous. Again, Martha, the mainstream institutions in this country coming out of the campuses are beating into student's heads that it is white people that are evil. The hate is going in one direction. If you want to see a more mainstream demonstration of what hatred looks like in the United States today, let's recall the Covington, Kentucky pile on. Where you had politicians across the Democratic Party, the media, piling onto these kids because they were so desperate to find any representative of their narrative about widespread white based hatred which is a complete falsehood. But the vitriol, the vindictiveness that were directed at those kids is a direct import from campus victim ideology."

And it just strikes me when you look at a vigil, as I said before. You know, you want -- when one person, when one American human being is wrong -- during this case people from New Zealand. What you want is for the community to come together and mourn the loss of life regardless of who, what religion those people are or what race those people are. And we have seen those moments in the past in our society.  And that is not where we are right now, unfortunately.

Twitter as you said in the hot seat as Congressman Nunes alleges the social media giant did not remove defamatory and malicious tweets. Nunes says that those tweets are from real people and bogus accounts and the tweets carry Nunez and his family's name. I want to read some of that suit to you that was filed. It says \"Twitter knew the defamation was and is happening. Twitter let it happen because Twitter had and has a political agenda and motive. Twitter allowed and allows its platform to serve as a portal of defamation in order to undermine public confidence in plaintiff and to benefit his opponents and opponents of the Republican Party.\" Now, Nunes goes on to allege that these tweets were an effort to distract him from doing his job with the investigation of potential corruption in the 2016 presidential election. \"The purpose of the concerted defamation campaign was to cause immense pain, intimidate, interfere with, and divert Nunes' attention from his investigation of corruption and Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.\" And get this, Nunes is seeking $250 million. That number sounds large and it is. And guess what, it's the same number as Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann. Now, he's suing for defamation in his case the Kentucky Catholic high school student, you see him right there. He was plastered all over the headlines for a confrontation with the Native American man back in January. We, of course, reached out to Twitter about this lawsuit. I just heard back from them within the last five minutes though. They say that they are not commenting on this case. But we did hear from Nunes' personal attorney. I want to read that statement. It says, \"Twitter is a machine.  It is a modern-day Tammany Hall. Congressman Nunes intends to hold Twitter fully accountable for its abusive behavior and misconduct.\" Now, right here, it says very clearly. Trial by jury is demanded. And Martha as you said, Devin Nunes not just talking about himself and his family but also talking about other conservatives that he says are under attack. Martha?"

Some saying the suspect 37-year-old Gokmen Tanis was firing indiscriminately at passengers and others, believed he was targeting a woman. And when people tried to help that woman, he then fired at them. Those on board also say because the conductor didn't immediately open the doors, they started kicking out windows and jumping out. But the gunman certainly didn't appear to be trying to hide his identity and there were numerous surveillance cameras. Listen."

His associates say he appeared to be religious and had a history of strange behavior. The mayor of Utrecht was very blunt saying this does appear to be terrorism but the prime minister of the Netherlands was more cautionary saying a link to terrorism has not been established and police later added that the motive could be a personal matter. Still, the national coordinator for anti-terrorism did initially raise the terror threat level in Utrecht but it has now been lowered to the pre- attack level. The attack also happened in an area of Utrecht with a very large Muslim community. There's no word if that plays a part but in the wake of the New Zealand attack and to play it safe, authorities in the Netherlands evacuated the mosques in Utrecht and increased security at mosques across the country. A second person has been arrested in connection with the attack. Police won't say what if any role that person may have had. Martha?"

      "utterance": "Hey, Martha. Well, this was a quite a scoop by Reuters, a prominent presidential candidate's involvement in America's oldest hacking group. The problem is that the reporter that wrote it had known about it for over a year. Joseph Menn says he sat on it because he struck a deal with members of that hacking group that you were talking about, Cult of the Dead Cow which he was writing a book about. They've confirmed O'Rourke's involvement in the group but only if Menn agree to hold the piece. Reuters is now defending the deal as a common arrangement between journalist and sources, and apparently, the candidates himself. Quote, \"In an interview in late 2017, O'Rourke acknowledged that he was a member of the group on the understanding that the information would not be made public until after his Senate race against Ted Cruz in November 2018.\" Well Cruz responded by saying, \"So Reuters had evidence in 2017 that Beto may have committed multiple felonies which Beto confirmed on the record but deliberately withheld the story for a year to help him win the Senate race? But when he is running against Bernie, et cetera, now it's news?\" Well, the group O'Rourke was a member of was responsible for things like hacking into computers and stealing credit card numbers. Though, the report says that O'Rourke never engaged in the, quote, \"edgiest sort of hacking activity.\" But he did contribute to the group's electronic magazine under the handle, \"psychedelic warlord\" including a fictional story that he wrote when he was 15 that involve running over children with a car. And here's a clip -- or an excerpt of it. He wrote, \"as I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood. And then the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. I was so fascinated for a moment, that when after I'd stopped my vehicle, I just sat in a daze, sweet visions filling my head.\" Well, after the story resurfaced O'Rourke said \"I'm mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed but I have to take ownership of my words. Whatever my attention was as a teenager doesn't matter, I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the actions I have used. And I have to constantly try to do better.\" So, O'Rourke is acknowledging that it is really hateful stuff when he was writing. Those are his words. But he's asking everybody to remember that he was only 15 years old at that time that he wrote it, Martha."

I think it really fits with us over all, skateboarding and punk rock sort of message. But let's step back for a moment and recognize this. There was no candidate who the press was more in the tank for in 2018 than Beto O'Rourke. And the fact is that if his name was Bob and he had been running against somebody other than Ted Cruz that would just not have been the case. The fact is that everyone who was really part of the media in that state, profile after profile glowingly portraying of this as a guy who collected all the right vine, knew all the hip things and was totally engaged in, you know, in culture and that kind of thing. And now that he is actually up against a couple of other Democrats in a race for the presidency, the standard is different. Now these early fund- raising numbers they are impressive, but to me, the real question is can this cult a personality around Beto O'Rourke survive the test that are going to come with running for president. Particularly in a moment when the Democratic base seems to be a lot more engaged in identity politics, intersectionality and the like. And a lot are more skeptical of maybe nominating another white guy."

Authorities have not confirmed the Gambino crime family has posted a bounty on the back of 24- year-old Anthony Comello, but one source told our corporate cousin New York Post that the general feeling is there is an axe on this guy's back. Police say last Wednesday Comello drove his truck to Frank Cali's Staten Island home and used it to ram Cali's Cadillac Escalade and when the mob boss came out to see what happened, police say Comello shot him 10 times and drove over his body. Investigators do not believe the killing was related to organized crime, there's been speculation it was revenge for Frank Cali not allowing Comello to date his niece. But police don't have the evidence to support that. Anthony Comello was arrested at his parent's waterfront home in Brick Township, New Jersey. In court you could see pro-Trump, pro-conservative and other writings on his hand. And because he waved extradition, he'll be brought back to stand trial in New York. Meanwhile, experts say for his own safety he will likely be placed in segregation at the Staten Island jail. Those who cover organized crime say Comello's real threat will come once he arrives in state prison, which is where they believe Frank Cali's cronies will try to avenge his death. Even a high-ranking member of the NYPD told the New York Post that, quote, \"Comello is going to have some issues in jail.\" The last time a mafia don was murdered in New York was 1985 when Paul Castellano was gunned down outside of spark steak house in Midtown Manhattan. The hit was thought to have been ordered by John Gotti who then became head of the Gambino family. In 1992, Gotti's right-hand man, Sammy the Bull Gravano testified against him and sent him to prison for life. John Gotti died in 2002 of cancer. Martha?"

Because we all want to help our kids out, but when you clear out all of the obstacles you really robbed the child of any opportunity to experience, you know, what it's like to fall down and get back up. We talked about this a little this weekend on Fox & Friends weekend when I was hosting and we had a viewer right in and say, I think we should be tow truck parents where we let them go into the ditch and then we are there to help them, you know, help pull them out when they are in trouble. And what we are also seeing, Martha, is a lot of psychologists are warning us of the really deep results of this. They are seeing kids or young adults in their late 20s on getting into deep depression and anxiety, just for facing the everyday struggles that we all face, because they are facing them for the first time in their late 20s and early 30s.
