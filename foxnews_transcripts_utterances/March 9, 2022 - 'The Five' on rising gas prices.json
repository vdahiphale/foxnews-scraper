Horrific new images coming out of Ukraine that we must warn you are very hard to watch. Carnage at a maternity hospital after it was hit by a Russian air strike with babies and mothers inside. Ukraine accusing Russia of intentionally targeting the building in the city of Mariupol. Officials say at least 70 people were injured in the blast. President Zelenskyy called the attack and atrocity and saying that children are buried in the rubble. Mike Tobin is in Lviv, Ukraine. He has the latest for us. Hi, Mike.",

The unthinkable has happened with this maternity ward being struck by Russian munitions resulting, as you mentioned, in 17 injuries, there are still rubble there. And also produced the images of a woman apparently in labor injured in this blast being hauled away from a hospital. Another image that you can see is a big crater outside of the hospital from the impact of the blast. Now Mariupol has been under siege really since the start of the invasion. There is not access to food, there is not access to water in that town. Several attempts at humanitarian ceasefires to let the civilian population get a break have fallen apart quite quickly, with Ukrainians saying that the Russians are targeting the civilian population, trying to flee this town. As it relates specifically to this maternity hospital, a Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov was asked. He said simply, we don't target civilians. If they are not targeting civilians and if this was a dummy munition and not a munition that you can aim, certainly there is a callous disregard for injuries to civilians as we have seen time and time again since this invasion began.

I was thinking of them as the strategic enemy of peace. And I feel very guilty about that. But when I see this. Putting that aside to the extent that I, a, ever will be able to, seeing what Putin did here, Dana, with this indiscriminate -- it isn't indiscriminate, it is intentional bombing of a maternity and children's hospital. You don't hit a building like that unless you aim for it. And to see those images of the woman in labor and another one with a child hurt and another with the baby crying and the mother unable to comfort the child, it drove me to the point where I just say Putin is a son of a bitch and I don't want to provoke him into nuclear war, but there must be a way to get those MiG-29s to Ukraine a creative way. If we could in World War II on the precipice of war with Hitler, if we could contrive a way to get our aircraft, despite the Neutrality Act, over the border to Canada so that the British could use them against the Germans. If we could manage that scheme, there must be a way to do this. Even if you have to take the damn things apart and ship them up in cartons, there must be a way to get those jets. We can't let these people continue to be the victims of indiscriminate bombing where they are -- it doesn't matter how brave they are, it doesn't matter, all those foreign volunteers and the women with AK-47s and all the rest of it. They can't stand against a missile and a bomb. Their -- it's the skies are hell.",

We are going to have to steel ourselves because this is just the beginning. They are going to lay siege to city after city, atrocity after atrocity, and it's going to be shot into our brains. And the leaders of these western countries are going to have to decide. I don't even think a no-fly zone is going to stop this. So, here is your choice, I don't think we are going in, but they are going to have to destroy the Russian economy. Meaning they are going to have to stop all oil and gas to Western Europe. Germany is going to have to say, sorry, we are going to have to maybe not turn the lights on for a little bit. They're going to have to just buy up all the LNG they possibly can. They are going to have to find some oil and gas and maybe some African former colony or something like that. They are going to have to do that because that's the only way you're going to stop Putin. You have to obliterate the economy, obliterate the energy sector and force a coup. I don't see any other way around it. He's not leaving Ukraine. He's not saying OK, I'll turn around the tanks. He's going to keep eating that country limb from limb until he owns it or until he's deposed. And the question is how are we going to do that?",

      "sentences": "Now it's just going to go on and on. The CIA director says Putin is in a mess and we know this. He mistakenly thought that Ukraine was weak and that Europe wouldn't amass a strong defense, which it has. He though his military was up to the challenge that his economy could weather this. So far, he is wrong which means he is going to get more desperate, which means he is going to have even less regard for civilian casualties and civilian or innocent loss of life. And it goes back to what both of you are saying and it's what we talked about yesterday. What do we do? We are presented with a choice and the obvious Ukrainian desire is the no-fly zone, but if you do that you shoot down a Russian jet, then we are at war with Russia. We might already be in a war with Russia. But if we don't do that then this goes on indefinitely. And then it raises the question, from two weeks ago, do we want this as badly as Putin does? Because if so, then we have to go all in. Because we are going to be looking at these come as you say about stealing, we are going to have to look at these photos, these horrible images every day, every day, because as long as we sit here on the sideline, the massacre will be prolonged. Right? But there is a solution and it's something I was going to ask you about before the show but I figured I wanted to ask you here. We don't hear anything about a serious attempted mediation. It's like it never get -- let me, and I'm not talking about sending Kamala Harris which we're going to talk about. That is not a serious attempt. OK? Where it's something where world leaders urgently meet with Putin and Zelenskyy and they figure out a way -- a face-saving, small victory for Putin because he can't afford to lose. He's already a war criminal which means if he loses, he's dead. So, they have to give them some kind of as Avril Haines said, she is the director of national intelligence said, you've got to give this guy proper deference because he feels that he never got that from the west or from Europe. So, we have to like somehow, you know, a nice little, small victory. A face-saving off-ramp. We need to have some kind of mediation, because to echo what Jesse said, what else can you -- what else can you do except world war? Right?",

And you know, when we talk about proper deference, you may -- you may believe he needs that, Putin needs that to save face. But when you are dealing with a man who is as wild as this man is, and I'm not going to say crazy because he's evil. Crazy is an excuse. The man is evil, he's attacking hospitals where women are giving birth. Women are no more vulnerable than they are when they are giving birth, I know. It is -- it is the most vulnerable. You are as vulnerable as you will ever be, when you are giving birth. But the idea that, you know, we've got to figure out a way to proper deference so we can work it out. Maybe we can.

And if you give them, you know, if you get rid of oil, you may trigger us. He can change the rules every minute of the day. Do I have the answer? No, I don't have the answer, Greg. Maybe it's something where he wants eastern Ukraine and maybe that's the way it should happen. But my instincts, every fiber of my being says this man is an animal, he needs to be punished for the murders, for the decimation, for the 6-year-old who died of dehydration.

I think Admiral Kirby is a great guy, I've known him for a long time, I was in Haiti with him in the earthquake of 2010. But for him to go down the list about the aircraft and so forth. I want those MiGs delivered by any means necessary. And I don't care if they have to FedEx. In terms of Vice President Harris, though, this is the biggest day of her vice presidency. This is the most Herculean task she's ever been assigned. It's time now for her to shake off the mantle of ineffectiveness and really put her tushy on the line. I want her to disappear tonight. I don't want her to go with the Pols and the Hungarian -- I want her to disappear and I want her to go into Ukraine. Into western Ukraine. So far, it's safe. So far you don't have any, you know, assassination squads or so forth. You see the pictures of Lviv, maybe she doesn't have to go that far. I think it would be so symbolically powerful for the vice president of the United States to go into the beleaguered country, visit with those refugees and see the mamas and see the babies, and you know, what do you need, what can America do?

They said, OK, we're going to put you in charge of the border. She says, OK, but I'm just going to talk about the root causes with just these three countries and actually I was never seen or heard from again on the border. So now you have a situation where earlier this week, I know it is only Wednesday but on Monday, we asked Admiral Kirby on America's Newsroom, there are reports that there are holdups at the White House in getting these MiGs out. He says no, no, no, no hold up, everything is fine. That afternoon is when Poland said, hey, guess what, surprise, we are going to send you the planes and then you are going to send them. And the Americans were like, wait, that is not going to happen. I'm pretty sure that Kamala Harris was supposed to go today so that she could say, isn't it great we got this all worked out? Poland sending the planes. And instead, because they were dragging their feet at the White House, this is just speculation on my part but it's pretty good speculation I would say, they're dragging their feet at the White House, now she's going there and she got a public dispute. This is what I would ask. What kind of diplomacy do we have, what kind of teamwork is it where you have a dispute like this that spills out into the public, to Geraldo's point, that this is not a discussion we should be having with the world about like how this all went down? But I think it was because the Pols tried to force the White House's hand on it, and now she has to go over there and try to clean it up. I don't know if it can be.",

They have a voracious appetite. And they've been helping Iran for many years get out of the situation with the sanctions for the rest of the world. China doesn't care, they'll buy their oil.

Horrific new images coming out of Ukraine that we must warn you are very hard to watch. Carnage at a maternity hospital after it was hit by a Russian air strike with babies and mothers inside. Ukraine accusing Russia of intentionally targeting the building in the city of Mariupol. Officials say at least 70 people were injured in the blast. President Zelenskyy called the attack and atrocity and saying that children are buried in the rubble. Mike Tobin is in Lviv, Ukraine. He has the latest for us. Hi, Mike."

The unthinkable has happened with this maternity ward being struck by Russian munitions resulting, as you mentioned, in 17 injuries, there are still rubble there. And also produced the images of a woman apparently in labor injured in this blast being hauled away from a hospital. Another image that you can see is a big crater outside of the hospital from the impact of the blast. Now Mariupol has been under siege really since the start of the invasion. There is not access to food, there is not access to water in that town. Several attempts at humanitarian ceasefires to let the civilian population get a break have fallen apart quite quickly, with Ukrainians saying that the Russians are targeting the civilian population, trying to flee this town. As it relates specifically to this maternity hospital, a Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov was asked. He said simply, we don't target civilians. If they are not targeting civilians and if this was a dummy munition and not a munition that you can aim, certainly there is a callous disregard for injuries to civilians as we have seen time and time again since this invasion began.

I was thinking of them as the strategic enemy of peace. And I feel very guilty about that. But when I see this. Putting that aside to the extent that I, a, ever will be able to, seeing what Putin did here, Dana, with this indiscriminate -- it isn't indiscriminate, it is intentional bombing of a maternity and children's hospital. You don't hit a building like that unless you aim for it. And to see those images of the woman in labor and another one with a child hurt and another with the baby crying and the mother unable to comfort the child, it drove me to the point where I just say Putin is a son of a bitch and I don't want to provoke him into nuclear war, but there must be a way to get those MiG-29s to Ukraine a creative way. If we could in World War II on the precipice of war with Hitler, if we could contrive a way to get our aircraft, despite the Neutrality Act, over the border to Canada so that the British could use them against the Germans. If we could manage that scheme, there must be a way to do this. Even if you have to take the damn things apart and ship them up in cartons, there must be a way to get those jets. We can't let these people continue to be the victims of indiscriminate bombing where they are -- it doesn't matter how brave they are, it doesn't matter, all those foreign volunteers and the women with AK-47s and all the rest of it.

We are going to have to steel ourselves because this is just the beginning. They are going to lay siege to city after city, atrocity after atrocity, and it's going to be shot into our brains. And the leaders of these western countries are going to have to decide. I don't even think a no-fly zone is going to stop this. So, here is your choice, I don't think we are going in, but they are going to have to destroy the Russian economy. Meaning they are going to have to stop all oil and gas to Western Europe. Germany is going to have to say, sorry, we are going to have to maybe not turn the lights on for a little bit. They're going to have to just buy up all the LNG they possibly can. They are going to have to find some oil and gas and maybe some African former colony or something like that. They are going to have to do that because that's the only way you're going to stop Putin. You have to obliterate the economy, obliterate the energy sector and force a coup. I don't see any other way around it. He's not leaving Ukraine. He's not saying OK, I'll turn around the tanks.

He mistakenly thought that Ukraine was weak and that Europe wouldn't amass a strong defense, which it has. He though his military was up to the challenge that his economy could weather this. So far, he is wrong which means he is going to get more desperate, which means he is going to have even less regard for civilian casualties and civilian or innocent loss of life. And it goes back to what both of you are saying and it's what we talked about yesterday. What do we do? We are presented with a choice and the obvious Ukrainian desire is the no-fly zone, but if you do that you shoot down a Russian jet, then we are at war with Russia. We might already be in a war with Russia. But if we don't do that then this goes on indefinitely. And then it raises the question, from two weeks ago, do we want this as badly as Putin does? Because if so, then we have to go all in. Because we are going to be looking at these come as you say about stealing, we are going to have to look at these photos, these horrible images every day, every day, because as long as we sit here on the sideline, the massacre will be prolonged. Right? But there is a solution and it's something I was going to ask you about before the show but I figured I wanted to ask you here. We don't hear anything about a serious attempted mediation. It's like it never get -- let me, and I'm not talking about sending Kamala Harris which we're going to talk about. That is not a serious attempt. OK? Where it's something where world leaders urgently meet with Putin and Zelenskyy and they figure out a way -- a face-saving, small victory for Putin because he can't afford to lose. He's already a war criminal which means if he loses, he's dead. So, they have to give them some kind of as Avril Haines said, she is the director of national intelligence said, you've got to give this guy proper deference because he feels that he never got that from the west or from Europe. So, we have to like somehow, you know, a nice little, small victory. A face-saving off-ramp. We need to have some kind of mediation, because to echo what Jesse said, what else can you -- what else can you do except world war? Right?"

And we would say it was the victim's fault that she was raped, her skirt was too short. Well, there was only one person at fault, and that's the rapist. And you know, when we talk about proper deference, you may -- you may believe he needs that, Putin needs that to save face. But when you are dealing with a man who is as wild as this man is, and I'm not going to say crazy because he's evil. Crazy is an excuse. The man is evil, he's attacking hospitals where women are giving birth. Women are no more vulnerable than they are when they are giving birth, I know. It is -- it is the most vulnerable. You are as vulnerable as you will ever be, when you are giving birth. But the idea that, you know, we've got to figure out a way to proper deference so we can work it out. Maybe we can.

And if you give them, you know, if you get rid of oil, you may trigger us. He can change the rules every minute of the day. Do I have the answer? No, I don't have the answer, Greg. Maybe it's something where he wants eastern Ukraine and maybe that's the way it should happen. But my instincts, every fiber of my being says this man is an animal, he needs to be punished for the murders, for the decimation, for the 6-year-old who died of dehydration.

I think Admiral Kirby is a great guy, I've known him for a long time, I was in Haiti with him in the earthquake of 2010. But for him to go down the list about the aircraft and so forth. I want those MiGs delivered by any means necessary. And I don't care if they have to FedEx. In terms of Vice President Harris, though, this is the biggest day of her vice presidency. This is the most Herculean task she's ever been assigned. It's time now for her to shake off the mantle of ineffectiveness and really put her tushy on the line. I want her to disappear tonight. I don't want her to go with the Pols and the Hungarian -- I want her to disappear and I want her to go into Ukraine. Into western Ukraine. So far, it's safe. So far you don't have any, you know, assassination squads or so forth. You see the pictures of Lviv, maybe she doesn't have to go that far. I think it would be so symbolically powerful for the vice president of the United States to go into the beleaguered country, visit with those refugees and see the mamas and see the babies, and you know, what do you need, what can America do? Poor thing, I'm so sorry, we'll get these bastards. I want her to step up to this historic moment and not be the border czar and the other ridiculous job."

They said, OK, we're going to put you in charge of the border. She says, OK, but I'm just going to talk about the root causes with just these three countries and actually I was never seen or heard from again on the border. So now you have a situation where earlier this week, I know it is only Wednesday but on Monday, we asked Admiral Kirby on America's Newsroom, there are reports that there are holdups at the White House in getting these MiGs out. He says no, no, no, no hold up, everything is fine. That afternoon is when Poland said, hey, guess what, surprise, we are going to send you the planes and then you are going to send them. And the Americans were like, wait, that is not going to happen. I'm pretty sure that Kamala Harris was supposed to go today so that she could say, isn't it great we got this all worked out? Poland sending the planes. And instead, because they were dragging their feet at the White House, this is just speculation on my part but it's pretty good speculation I would say, they're dragging their feet at the White House, now she's going there and she got a public dispute. This is what I would ask. What kind of diplomacy do we have, what kind of teamwork is it where you have a dispute like this that spills out into the public, to Geraldo's point, that this is not a discussion we should be having with the world about like how this all went down? But I think it was because the Pols tried to force the White House's hand on it, and now she has to go over there and try to clean it up. I don't know if it can be."

And we even heard yesterday that the Germans and the French were talking to the Chinese about figuring out a way to try to find peace talks. I think -- I think that the Chinese look at Putin and think like, if it had gone perfectly according to all the things that Greg mentioned, all the assumption, the four assumptions that Putin had, that all of that had worked out perfectly, I think Beijing would have said, well, then next fall, after our big communist meeting, maybe we just go ahead and figure out a way to take Taiwan. That might have gotten harder now. But one of the things that China will figure out in addition to the economic things that you've mentioned, is that the oil will be available to them to buy. They have a voracious appetite. And they've been helping Iran for many years get out of the situation with the sanctions for the rest of the world. China doesn't care, they'll buy their oil.
