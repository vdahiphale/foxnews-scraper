So Joe's team, they decided that he should say something about the economy, don't you think other than promising to lock it down. Now, of course, he has nothing to say. He had almost 50 years to build a record on economic issues, and he utterly failed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So like the rest of his campaign, Biden's economic claims are just another act. They're sleight of hand. Based on his campaign's view that most Americans aren't that smart, and that the press, of course, will provide cover for all of his mistakes. Now, after all, this is the same guy who voted for one bad trade deal after another, including both NAFTA in that catastrophic decision to normalize trade relations with China. Now, that colossal mistake of a bill, not only fast-tracked China's nation -- China's entry into the WTO, but it also gutted American industry, and it destroyed millions of American jobs. Well, I forget almost that Biden was a vocal supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was a deal that was so bad even Hillary Clinton could not defend it. She backed away from it. Now, to be fair to Biden, he probably didn't think too hard about any of these votes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } After all, he's a Senator from Delaware -- he was, where lots of multinational companies get their charters, and he's probably just doing as he was told. Just like he'll do if he gets in the White House. Now, you think that a guy with almost five decades of political experience, would be proud to tout his record, but not Joe Biden. After decades of doing whatever the globalist wanted and pushing for policies and treaties that gutted American jobs and drove down wages. He wants you to believe that now at the age of almost 80, he's finally seen the error of his ways. At long last, he'll abandon the Clinton-Obama internationalist playbook. So all of a sudden he trundles over to scrim and read this speech designed to make it sound like someone who really cares about American workers. The whole charade is absurd on its face. It's basically an insult to our intelligence. Democrats have told us time and again, what they really think of saving key American industries. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now remember, he was Vice President for eight years, the Democrats had plenty of time to revise NAFTA, stand up to China and push policies that would lead to higher wages. They didn't do any of that. Instead, they promoted exactly the same type of outsourcing policies that the Bushes and the Clintons pushed, and Biden was with them every step of the way. So you want to know what Joe and his party really think of American workers, listen to them in their own words. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Trump didn't just promise to revise NAFTA, he got new provisions in it that would make it harder to ship auto jobs to Mexico. And he didn't just promise to stand up to China. He whacked them with tariffs for their cheating. And he didn't just promise to resist international bureaucrats, he shut down the WTO's Dispute Settlement system in response to its obvious anti-American bias. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So is Joe Biden likely to continue fighting for American workers in the same way? Of course, not. Don't make me laugh, OK. I'm already laughing through his speech today. The moment the first Canadian or European bureaucrat raises an eyebrow, the moment the first member of the press asked a hard question, the moment the first CEO gets Biden on the phone, his administration will cave and the outsourcing party begins again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Of course, all of this will help the rich. Big hedge funds will be thrilled. They're desperate for the days of easy returns by selling out to the CCP, and Biden's just their man. Look at it this way. If Joe were truly a made in the USA kind of guy, would a guy like Mike Bloomberg be supporting him? Ignore the happy talk and the fake blue-collar events. To understand Biden's real agenda, we don't have to look any further than the 110-page document released yesterday, a joint product of the Biden campaign and the Bernie Bros. I prefer to call it Biden's roadmap to ruin. Now, a climate task force will push for a Green New Deal and calls for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Accord. Leading the effort will be those well- known nationalists, John Kerry and AO.C Say goodbye to the U.S. energy sector, my friends, too bad Texas, tough luck, Pennsylvania. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then the criminal justice task force, that will boast an impressive roster of big thinkers, including Senator Biden aide, Symone Sanders. \"The Washington Post\" described her as someone who pushed the campaign to be wary of language that frustrates black activists, urging staffers to avoid the term white working class. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mr. Fast and Furious himself, former Obama AG Eric Holder, also took part. Well, their demands are a law enforcement nightmare. Federal use of force standards, making it easier to sue police, national registry of police officers who abuse power -- whatever that means, repealing mandatory minimums, expunging all past convictions for pot and juvenile criminal activities, no prison time at all for failure to pay fines for child support, no cash bail, and appointing activist judges -- that'll be a varsity sport. So there's a lot in there that's great for Tony Soprano and his crew maybe, but nothing for law abiding citizens. To Biden in this team, that's what you get for liking America. Of course, such an array of radical ideas is only going to ensure more racial injustice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And isn't that you are trying many of these same proposals about the police and defunding them as we speak? And look what's happening there. We have massive police retirements, massive crime, the President talked about it tonight. People with money are leaving New York City in droves.

They know that in order to win, he's going to need some of that blue-collar love from voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Now, don't forget that according to RealClearPolitics, voters still approve of President Trump's handling the economy. So Joe's team, they decided that he should say something about the economy, don't you think other than promising to lock it down. Now, of course, he has nothing to say. He had almost 50 years to build a record on economic issues, and he utterly failed. So like the rest of his campaign, Biden's economic claims are just another act. They're sleight of hand. Based on his campaign's view that most Americans aren't that smart, and that the press, of course, will provide cover for all of his mistakes. Now, after all, this is the same guy who voted for one bad trade deal after another, including both NAFTA in that catastrophic decision to normalize trade relations with China. Now, that colossal mistake of a bill, not only fast-tracked China's nation -- China's entry into the WTO, but it also gutted American industry, and it destroyed millions of American jobs. Well, I forget almost that Biden was a vocal supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was a deal that was so bad even Hillary Clinton could not defend it. She backed away from it. Now, to be fair to Biden, he probably didn't think too hard about any of these votes. After all, he's a Senator from Delaware -- he was, where lots of multinational companies get their charters, and he's probably just doing as he was told. Just like he'll do if he gets in the White House. Now, you think that a guy with almost five decades of political experience, would be proud to tout his record, but not Joe Biden. After decades of doing whatever the globalist wanted and pushing for policies and treaties that gutted American jobs and drove down wages. He wants you to believe that now at the age of almost 80, he's finally seen the error of his ways. At long last, he'll abandon the Clinton-Obama internationalist playbook. So all of a sudden he trundles over to scrim and read this speech designed to make it sound like someone who really cares about American workers. The whole charade is absurd on its face. It's basically an insult to our intelligence. Democrats have told us time and again, what they really think of saving key American industries. Now remember, he was Vice President for eight years, the Democrats had plenty of time to revise NAFTA, stand up to China and push policies that would lead to higher wages. They didn't do any of that. Instead, they promoted exactly the same type of outsourcing policies that the Bushes and the Clintons pushed, and Biden was with them every step of the way. So you want to know what Joe and his party really think of American workers, listen to them in their own words."

Now, why am I not surprised that people who despise America would also despise American workers? Thank God, Trump never believed that defeat is nonsense. Trump didn't just promise to revise NAFTA, he got new provisions in it that would make it harder to ship auto jobs to Mexico. And he didn't just promise to stand up to China. He whacked them with tariffs for their cheating. And he didn't just promise to resist international bureaucrats, he shut down the WTO's Dispute Settlement system in response to its obvious anti-American bias. So is Joe Biden likely to continue fighting for American workers in the same way? Of course, not. Don't make me laugh, OK. I'm already laughing through his speech today. The moment the first Canadian or European bureaucrat raises an eyebrow, the moment the first member of the press asked a hard question, the moment the first CEO gets Biden on the phone, his administration will cave and the outsourcing party begins again. Of course, all of this will help the rich. Big hedge funds will be thrilled. They're desperate for the days of easy returns by selling out to the CCP, and Biden's just their man. Look at it this way. If Joe were truly a made in the USA kind of guy, would a guy like Mike Bloomberg be supporting him? Ignore the happy talk and the fake blue-collar events. To understand Biden's real agenda, we don't have to look any further than the 110-page document released yesterday, a joint product of the Biden campaign and the Bernie Bros. I prefer to call it Biden's roadmap to ruin. Now, a climate task force will push for a Green New Deal and calls for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Accord. Leading the effort will be those well- known nationalists, John Kerry and AO.C Say goodbye to the U.S. energy sector, my friends, too bad Texas, tough luck, Pennsylvania. Then the criminal justice task force, that will boast an impressive roster of big thinkers, including Senator Biden aide, Symone Sanders. \"The Washington Post\" described her as someone who pushed the campaign to be wary of language that frustrates black activists, urging staffers to avoid the term white working class. Mr. Fast and Furious himself, former Obama AG Eric Holder, also took part. Well, their demands are a law enforcement nightmare. Federal use of force standards, making it easier to sue police, national registry of police officers who abuse power -- whatever that means, repealing mandatory minimums, expunging all past convictions for pot and juvenile criminal activities, no prison time at all for failure to pay fines for child support, no cash bail, and appointing activist judges -- that'll be a varsity sport. So there's a lot in there that's great for Tony Soprano and his crew maybe, but nothing for law abiding citizens. To Biden in this team, that's what you get for liking America. Of course, such an array of radical ideas is only going to ensure more racial injustice. And isn't that you are trying many of these same proposals about the police and defunding them as we speak? And look what's happening there. We have massive police retirements, massive crime, the President talked about it tonight. People with money are leaving New York City in droves. So imagine those policies of Bill de Blasio coming to a neighborhood near you? Well, unlike Biden, Trump doesn't have to pretend to believe in America first. He's already proven it."

And let me make this point, despite the mantra of the Democrats that all tax cuts help the rich. The Trump tax cuts did exactly what we hoped. That is, middle income, blue collar workers, lower wage earners performed the best, not only with the lowest unemployment rate in history, but their wage increase was faster than the top 1 percent. And the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics and Asians and women were at historic lows. Plus, Biden's going to add new taxes, today he said by the way. He does want to have the stock market. He doesn't want to have shareholders involved in the stock market. Well, besides pension funds, and even union pension funds 51 percent are invested in the stock market, which I might add is up 40 percent since the laws.

Trump says he was going to do it from China. I'm going to do it. Why hasn't the Trump administration moved on that order? I know Peter Navarro and others have been pushing. It was reported today.

We will give them the lowest corporate tax rates, we will give them perhaps tax credits, certainly 100 percent expensing. We may use some government funds to pay for their moving costs. We have a whole campaign planned. We're warning American investors not to invest in Chinese stocks because of the fraudulent accounting. Robert O'Brien and I have already warned, the Thrift Savings Plan and the Railroad Retirement Fund. So we are doing exactly that. And we're taking steps to deal with this Hong Kong disaster. So I don't think it's right to say we haven't done it. We've been doing it. And the tax reform itself, we made it so easy to repatriate profits and capital come back to the United States.

You don't see business school professors saying now the supply chains don't work. We got to bring it back home, because China is not reliable. They're not the only ones who are unreliable. But I hear the same thing for people around the world, so that's going to be a major change. But we have got to continue low taxes and deregulation and fair-trade deals. If we do that, we will come through this pandemic, I think we're going to get 20 percent growth in the second half.

He is no better than the founders of Black Lives Matter, the Marxist. He himself is a Marxist. If you go back to 1987 when he was 26 years old.

Well, the truth is that one of the rulings today completely destroyed Congress's gross unconstitutional overstep in trying to obtain Trump's tax returns. So yes, the High Court did rule that the Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance could subpoena the tax documents. But it's not the stirring victory the Left would have you believe. You actually have to read the opinions. Now, first, the case was remanded back to the lower court, where Trump's lawyers can make more constitutional arguments to draw up the case. And second, even if a court expedites its decision, the tax returns would go to a grand jury, meaning they'll still be secret. Now, in fact, the Manhattan D.A. may not see the President's tax returns for many more months or many more years. This is just harassment, come on. In other words, there's almost zero chance that Trump's taxes become public before the November election. Joining me now is John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow, Constitutional Scholar; also Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel.

But that's kind of a theoretical question, Laura, they then send it back to the lower courts, as you say, and President Trump is free to say all right. But in this particular instance, this subpoena is a problem. This subpoena, for example, is nothing but a retaliatory effort to interfere with my executive powers. They're still free to make any argument they want with respect to the particular subpoena. Why was it issued at this particular time? Why do you want my -- why exactly do you need these tax returns? So, yes, they lost on their legal points, which I don't think most people thought they were going to win on anyway. But as a practical matter, I think it's a win, certainly in the short term."

But it certainly opens up a can of worms down the road for other Presidents, perhaps."

      "speaker": "JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, it does open it up perhaps. But I agree with Sol, and that's not what -- I mean, I was watching the news today and wondered whether the news reports were reading the same opinion I was reading. I mean, I think the Chief Justice, and the and the large majority of the court went out of its way to try and prevent that kind of rogue district attorney from harassing the President. He said the entire the entire conduct of the proceeding needs to be conducted with the fact that this is the President of United States and the Office of Chief Executive in mind. And it specifically says that the President can challenge these subpoenas as an attempt to influence the performance of his duties that would violate the supremacy clause. And so, you don't have absolute immunity from the subpoena, but we're not going to allow witch hunts for partisan political gain against a sitting president or a presidential candidate. And I think the court made clear on that. So I don't think this is a win for Vance at all. The Second Circuit decision was affirmed, and that just means the president doesn't have absolute immunity, but the things that are handed to him are more than enough to force him having to disclose."

Sol, if this report is delayed until after election, it's never going to the light of day, we might not ever know what was really down to the president or what nefarious efforts were undertaken at the FBI and beyond."

I would also say there's a considerable amount of time between an election if the president loses and the following term. But listen, I have a lot of faith in Durham. He's got a sterling reputation. And as Attorney General Barr said -- first of all, Attorney General Barr said he doesn't think there is even going to be in an investigation, a criminal investigation of former President Obama or President Biden. If you take those two out of the equation, as Barr said, who are we going to be looking that is going to be running for office? Nobody. So I don't really -- I'll believe it when I see it.

The way it is right now, they just don't want to have sports, and there's no way in this world you can do anything in this world without a risk. People stormed Normandy. I took some grandchildren over there. They knew there was going to be casualties, they knew there was going to be risk, but it was a way of life. Now if you eliminate all nonconference games, first of all, you have seven teams in the Big Ten that schedule four patsies so they know they're going to win four games, with two conference games, they can go to the bowl. That ain't going to happen. But let me tell you the devastating effect it's going to have is then the nonpower five schools, my son is head coach at Louisiana Tech. He used to play Baylor, Vanderbilt, those are money games, those are very, very important. But how are you going to have football when they don't even want to have school? Some schools like Notre Dame has said, OK, we're going to start on August 10th. Now some of faculty members say, oh, it's too risky, I don't want to go. You have teachers' unions saying you shouldn't go back to school. The underprivileged, the people from the poor neighborhoods, where they going to get education? What has happened to our way of life? Look at it from both points of view. The risk is always there, but you cannot just look at it from one side, and that's exactly what's happening. And I think it will end on Election Day."

But Notre Dame, Alabama, even some of those Ivy League schools, the Pac 10, Ohio, the Buckeyes, they all want to play football.

I can't begin to tell you the lessons people learn in football. It's a microcosm of life. You learn about sacrifice, you learn about teamwork, getting along with other people. You learn to work on your skills to make sacrifices, to make a total commitment to other people for the welfare of the overall team and unit. There is so many valuable lessons you learn from it, and when you are part of a team, people want to be part of something. That is how games came about.

      "utterance": "In the beginning when I adopted the French regimen, which was 600 milligrams a day, as opposed to the 2,400 milligrams lower dose that people were using, CDC, actually the FDA eventually endorsed, I got immediate pushback from the CMO at one of the hospitals we go to. Immediate. Like, we'll take it from here, Stephen, after I sent them the article. I said, what? He came in on a Saturday and I was still in the hospital working my tail off, and I said, no, you won't touch my patients. And since then, I don't know why -- I didn't know I was creating controversy. I thought I was following the data like I always do. And it's a safe drug, a cheap drug. And I got in another argument with the CMO of the system. He said, if we give everybody 600 milligrams a day, which is only 6,000, as opposed to 2,400 milligrams, we're going to run out of hydroxychloroquine. I said I don't believe him. He hung up on me. That was after maybe I had spent three hours taking care of 50 of his patients."

      "utterance": "I think we can get it under control but keeping it under control is going to be the real problem. This virus, to our dismay, is spectacularly efficient in transmitting from person to person. That makes me skeptical whether we would get permanent, sustained control of this without having a vaccine."

      "utterance": "OK, Dr. Jensen. The translation -- get ready to be locked down until Biden is elected. I'm sorry, I hear that, and my blood boils. It is a virus, it's a bad virus, but most people do fine with it. Could this be with us forever? And vaccines aren't 100 percent useful anyway, in most cases."

      "speaker": "JENSEN",
      "utterance": "I would ask Dr. Fauci why in the world he would use the word \"spectacularly.\" That sounds like just fearmongering. And I would ask, what RNA viruses have we been successful at in terms of creating a vaccine that really does what we want? We know that with our influenza vaccine, we frequently face just terribly mediocre results. And if you look at other coronavirus viruses, whether you're talking about SARS or MERS, we don't have a great track record. So the fact of the matter is, if a vaccine comes along to help us, that's great, but we are far more realistically leaning into herd immunity."

      "utterance": "Yes, the Henry Ford Health System study on hydroxy has come under fire. Not only was the study not randomized, outside experts noting the patients who received hydroxy were also more likely to get steroids. Dr. Smith, you've read the study, you've treated all these patients successfully. What are your thoughts?"

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "It's really hard to -- actually it's harder to show something works than doesn't work. And obviously we've had several trials showing this drug or drug combination works very well. Our data support that. There are many other trials that show that. And when you see efficacy, you really take notice, because, again, it's harder to prove something works in this situation then to say it's neutral. It's a lot easier to say he doesn't have an effect for a bunch of reasons."

As a result, it really is more loss of life. We can't do that. We have to get back now. We did it right. We saved millions of lives by what we did.
