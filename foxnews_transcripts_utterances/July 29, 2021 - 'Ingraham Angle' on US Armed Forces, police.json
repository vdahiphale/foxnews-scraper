      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from a very busy Washington tonight. A California restaurant owner has decided to ignore Gavin Newsom's new edicts throwing open his eatery to the unvaccinated and maskless. He's here tonight on why he's doing it his own way and why he isn't scared of the repercussions. Plus, one of the most embarrassing displays you will ever see from a sitting United States congressman. Raymond Arroyo has the cringe-worthy video in seen and unseen. But first, our general discontent. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, toward the end of the show last night, I interviewed a guest you probably had never heard of before. Josiah Lippincott, a marine vet and a student at Hillsdale College, shared a shocking story that I think speaks volumes about the state of today's current Military leadership. Major General Patrick Donahoe, the commanding officer at Fort Benning, Georgia, apparently has so much time on his hands that he decided to take up a fight with Lippincott, who had criticized the military's obsession with getting young healthy service personnel vexxed. Now, Lippincott, a combat vet, noted that while the DoD had tragically lost 26 service members due to COVID in just the last quarter of 2020, 26 additional service members had taken their own lives compared to the prior year. But the strangely defensive and sensitive general Donahoe accused Josiah of engaging in false equivalency. Then he issued this courageous tweet, \"Hey, Hillsdale, come get your boy.\" In other words, shut him up for me to shut him up. What an utterly pathetic and predictable eighth-grade girlish response from a person with such influence and stature.",

These guys spent 20 years in Afghanistan, spent $2.4 trillion of American taxpayer money. We lost 2300 service members. And we left Bagram Air Force Base in the middle of the night.

The depressing truth is that we haven't won a war in decades. We couldn't defeat the Taliban. We didn't bring peace and stability to Iraq. The Military, of course, is filled though with courageous men and women who are basically being abysmally served by the leadership. So our romantic ideal of America's top Military leaders as selfless and heroic, lot of it comes from old movies and riveting history. But a lot of things have changed. For instance, do we even really know how top commanders are chosen today? Don't you think we should? I think a cursory review of recent history would find that getting promoted through the ranks today has less to do with one's success on and off the battlefield than it does with how well one plays the current political game. The Pentagon is under the spell of corporate America. And contrary to what Austin said in that hearing, it's gone totally woke. We need a Military led by men and women who stand above the political fray in focus on the mission of defending our national interests. Certainly, not leaders who are more focused on their post Military job prospects more than they are on improving our warfighting capabilities. We're at a fork in the road for our top Military brass. We've seen what happens to the credibility of other institutions that forget what their original mission is. Just look at the eroding faith in the public health sector with all these idiotic stops and starts on COVID. A few years ago and most Americans would have listened closely to what the head of the CDC had to say about any given health threat. But now a lot of people are just tuning them out. Fauci, by the way, is no one to blame but himself, ditto for the Capitol Police who testified on Wednesday. Despite the crowds they had known for weeks would show up at the Capitol on January 6, the Capitol Police couldn't hold the Capitol perimeter on that day. That itself is a scandal. And instead of examining why that happened, they turn to blaming President Trump, who they all obviously despise. This officer who called Trump a hitman in his testimony is so unbiased, so professional, that last year he attacked me personally on Twitter. He deleted it. So brave. But we have it. Again, credibility of another institution gravely harmed. This is all terrible for America.",

And our recruits sign up because they love this country. Someone who plans to devote years of his or her life to serve the country deserves more than Vaccine bullying and diversity training. And that's THE ANGLE. Back with me tonight is Josiah Lippincott, marine vet, and contributor to American Mind. Josiah, we had such a huge response to your appearance last night that we kind of had to cut short because of the nature of our breaks that I had to bring you back. Some of the last bastions of traditionalism in our country, law enforcement, the Military, they're being transformed before our very eyes. What's the end goal here in your mind?",

And you ask about what's the end state of what's happening right now, I think, for the Military today, it is to keep the money flowing, without having to confront the reality of the increasing obsolescence of many of our systems that are designed to win wars that America no longer is fighting.

So one of the difficulties that comes out of this is that our Military - a war with China, another nuclear power is not going to play out the way that our conventional Military is designed to address these kinds of conflicts. China is able to manipulate the United States in wage information warfare in a way that's way more effective than anything they can do conventionally. And I think at some level, our generals know this. At the beginning of Obama's term, there were 100,000 Chinese students in American universities. By the end of his term, there were 300,000. That's a really serious. If we're serious about confronting China, we need to address the industries that they've taken from us with the assistance of Wall Street, we need to address the fact that we're educating their elite. Laura, every year 70,000 Americans die of opioid overdose. Those drugs, those fentanyl is made in China, and then it is shipped to Mexico and then smuggled across our border. If our Military is serious about addressing chemical warfare against the American people, then we need to concentrate on building a secure border, on defending our national sovereignty, and on restoring industry back to the United States. And that means Twitter spats with civilians and Veterans is not the way to go about accomplishing that mission.",

But over the course of the civil unrest from May to July of 2020, more than 2000 officers sustained injuries in the line of duty. But of course, those all occurred outside the spotlight of the U.S. Capitol, so they have nowhere to go to get their hearing. One of those men is my next guest, LAPD officer Anthony Diaz. Now, last summer, he and his partners responded when the George Floyd protests got out of control. He and other officers arrived to the call. It had already been infiltrated by rioters, bottles, rocks and other items were being thrown at the police cars, even as they attempted to secure the area. As projectiles continued to rain down, Officer Diaz was suddenly struck through the car window. The object hit the side of his head and exited through the back window. After being knocked out, Diaz says he returned to consciousness to see blood everywhere. His fellow officers were able to break away from the rioters and find a metro police car that helped lead him to safety. Diaz was stitched up from his wound, but later learned the projectile had cracked his skull, resulting in bleeding in his brain. Officer Diaz is miraculously back on the job and is running in the Boston Marathon to raise money for injured officers. We're so pleased to have Officer Anthony Diaz with us now. Officer, thank you for being here. And thank God you're back on the job. Were you afraid for your life that night?",

People didn't comply with what Joe Biden wanted to do, and now they are scrambling. The reality is this -- hospitalization rates per capita are still very manageable.

Where could they be? Silicon Valley perhaps? And of course, the entertainment industry, where Netflix's Reed Hastings has given him a whopping $3 million. But there is a new intern in the influence peddling race, the teachers' unions. Thankful for their year-and-a-half out of the classroom which Newsom granted them, they are now opening their checkbooks. In the past two days alone the teachers' unions have dropped a whopping $2 million into the Newsom's coffers. Here now is a keen observer of California politics, Harmeet Dhillon, attorney and CEO of the Center for American Liberty, which has had a huge wins recently against Newsom and these draconian orders of his.

And so this payment, as you say, it may be for the next year of special accommodations and letting these teachers effectively not do their jobs for another year, which is really contrary to the interest and the health interests, specifically, of California's children.

A California restaurant owner has decided to ignore Gavin Newsom's new edicts throwing open his eatery to the unvaccinated and maskless. He's here tonight on why he's doing it his own way and why he isn't scared of the repercussions. Plus, one of the most embarrassing displays you will ever see from a sitting United States congressman. Raymond Arroyo has the cringe-worthy video in seen and unseen. But first, our general discontent. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, toward the end of the show last night, I interviewed a guest you probably had never heard of before. Josiah Lippincott, a marine vet and a student at Hillsdale College, shared a shocking story that I think speaks volumes about the state of today's current Military leadership. Major General Patrick Donahoe, the commanding officer at Fort Benning, Georgia, apparently has so much time on his hands that he decided to take up a fight with Lippincott, who had criticized the military's obsession with getting young healthy service personnel vexxed. Now, Lippincott, a combat vet, noted that while the DoD had tragically lost 26 service members due to COVID in just the last quarter of 2020, 26 additional service members had taken their own lives compared to the prior year. But the strangely defensive and sensitive general Donahoe accused Josiah of engaging in false equivalency. Then he issued this courageous tweet, \"Hey, Hillsdale, come get your boy.\" In other words, shut him up for me to shut him up. What an utterly pathetic and predictable eighth-grade girlish response from a person with such influence and stature."

These guys spent 20 years in Afghanistan, spent $2.4 trillion of American taxpayer money. We lost 2300 service members. And we left Bagram Air Force Base in the middle of the night. Americans should be angry, they should be demanding answers."

      "utterance": "Well, should not occur? Well, you know what should occur? A complete top to bottom review in reform of our armed forces. The depressing truth is that we haven't won a war in decades. We couldn't defeat the Taliban. We didn't bring peace and stability to Iraq. The Military, of course, is filled though with courageous men and women who are basically being abysmally served by the leadership. So our romantic ideal of America's top Military leaders as selfless and heroic, lot of it comes from old movies and riveting history. But a lot of things have changed. For instance, do we even really know how top commanders are chosen today? Don't you think we should? I think a cursory review of recent history would find that getting promoted through the ranks today has less to do with one's success on and off the battlefield than it does with how well one plays the current political game. The Pentagon is under the spell of corporate America. And contrary to what Austin said in that hearing, it's gone totally woke. We need a Military led by men and women who stand above the political fray in focus on the mission of defending our national interests. Certainly, not leaders who are more focused on their post Military job prospects more than they are on improving our warfighting capabilities. We're at a fork in the road for our top Military brass. We've seen what happens to the credibility of other institutions that forget what their original mission is. Just look at the eroding faith in the public health sector with all these idiotic stops and starts on COVID. A few years ago and most Americans would have listened closely to what the head of the CDC had to say about any given health threat. But now a lot of people are just tuning them out. Fauci, by the way, is no one to blame but himself, ditto for the Capitol Police who testified on Wednesday. Despite the crowds they had known for weeks would show up at the Capitol on January 6, the Capitol Police couldn't hold the Capitol perimeter on that day. That itself is a scandal. And instead of examining why that happened, they turn to blaming President Trump, who they all obviously despise. This officer who called Trump a hitman in his testimony is so unbiased, so professional, that last year he attacked me personally on Twitter. He deleted it. So brave. But we have it. Again, credibility of another institution gravely harmed. This is all terrible for America."

And our recruits sign up because they love this country. Someone who plans to devote years of his or her life to serve the country deserves more than Vaccine bullying and diversity training. And that's THE ANGLE. Back with me tonight is Josiah Lippincott, marine vet, and contributor to American Mind. Josiah, we had such a huge response to your appearance last night that we kind of had to cut short because of the nature of our breaks that I had to bring you back. Some of the last bastions of traditionalism in our country, law enforcement, the Military, they're being transformed before our very eyes. What's the end goal here in your mind?"

I served in the Marine Corps for four years. But my experience was with the peacetime Marine Corps that's emerged in the post really serious engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. And you ask about what's the end state of what's happening right now, I think, for the Military today, it is to keep the money flowing, without having to confront the reality of the increasing obsolescence of many of our systems that are designed to win wars that America no longer is fighting. Now, insurgency is just a different type of conflict that our Military is not built to defeat."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIPPINCOTT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. So one of the difficulties that comes out of this is that our Military - a war with China, another nuclear power is not going to play out the way that our conventional Military is designed to address these kinds of conflicts. China is able to manipulate the United States in wage information warfare in a way that's way more effective than anything they can do conventionally. And I think at some level, our generals know this. At the beginning of Obama's term, there were 100,000 Chinese students in American universities. By the end of his term, there were 300,000. That's a really serious. If we're serious about confronting China, we need to address the industries that they've taken from us with the assistance of Wall Street, we need to address the fact that we're educating their elite. Laura, every year 70,000 Americans die of opioid overdose. Those drugs, those fentanyl is made in China, and then it is shipped to Mexico and then smuggled across our border. If our Military is serious about addressing chemical warfare against the American people, then we need to concentrate on building a secure border, on defending our national sovereignty, and on restoring industry back to the United States. And that means Twitter spats with civilians and Veterans is not the way to go about accomplishing that mission."

    {
      "speaker": "LIPPINCOTT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I mean, there's a lot of money involved in these wars, and that's flowing to line the pockets of these defense contractors. When Generals are done, where did they go? Straight to the boards of those firms. And so, again - and look, in - at the end of his term, the Military admitted publicly in the news that they had lied to President Trump about troop levels in Syria. Our Generals absolutely would do the same thing to Joe Biden. And they probably already have. So what is needed is accountability. Congress has got to get involved, they need to start asking questions. What are these guys doing overseas? And are you telling the truth? Because that cannot be assumed."

      "speaker": "LIPPINCOTT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. It's absurd. I mean, Americans have paid a lot of money in taxpayer dollars, we've paid in blood. We need to have accountability on all these fronts. And I would say this to go back to General Donahoe, that's a guy who graduated from Harvard, or has a degree from, or won some kind of fellowship from there. And what I would say is, I am willing to challenge that guy to a debate on policy, on COVID policy, on foreign policy and on the Military budget. And I'll do it. If he wants to come get me, he can come to Hillsdale himself and come get me here. And I'll extend that invitation to all of our Generals and Admirals. I will debate your budget in public with you any time, any place. I'll go to the War College, I'll go to Annapolis, I'll go to West Point. But it's just time, someone has got to hold these guys accountable. And if Congress isn't going to do it, then it needs to be everyday citizens on social media and in journalism, or in some of these publications, to just hold our leaders to account."

But over the course of the civil unrest from May to July of 2020, more than 2000 officers sustained injuries in the line of duty. But of course, those all occurred outside the spotlight of the U.S. Capitol, so they have nowhere to go to get their hearing. One of those men is my next guest, LAPD officer Anthony Diaz. Now, last summer, he and his partners responded when the George Floyd protests got out of control. He and other officers arrived to the call. It had already been infiltrated by rioters, bottles, rocks and other items were being thrown at the police cars, even as they attempted to secure the area. As projectiles continued to rain down, Officer Diaz was suddenly struck through the car window. The object hit the side of his head and exited through the back window. After being knocked out, Diaz says he returned to consciousness to see blood everywhere. His fellow officers were able to break away from the rioters and find a metro police car that helped lead him to safety. Diaz was stitched up from his wound, but later learned the projectile had cracked his skull, resulting in bleeding in his brain. Officer Diaz is miraculously back on the job and is running in the Boston Marathon to raise money for injured officers. We're so pleased to have Officer Anthony Diaz with us now.

As one CNN reporter spent time counting those without masks, tweeting that \"She caught 24 maskless Republicans.\" The horror, adding, \"There's a lot of frustration over it\".

There is no other side to this pandemic. Joining us now is Florida Congressman Byron Donalds.

That's why we're all having to wear a mask. Stop being selfish. And I looked at him, like, mind your business. Why are you worried about what I'm doing? Worry about yourself. You've been vaccinated. Congratulations. Take care of yourself. Leave me alone. Mind your business. Why are you worried about what I am doing? But the truth of the matter is that the left has completely gone off the rails.

The study that the CDC is using is a study that failed peer review, is a study out of India that deals with a vaccine that is not available in the United States. So they are playing politics over there at the White House instead of giving the information to the American people. And when the information comes out to the American people, people can make decisions for themselves. People like Chris Cuomo, the member of Congress, whatever his name is, that I got into it with today, they are just in this warped view that everybody has to follow their lead. Everybody has to follow their protocol in order to get through COVID-19. But the truth of the matter is, we're mostly through it now.

What does that look like in a post vaccine world? The media still reporting on. This is if we're still back in last summer, not understanding the fact that the metrics have completely changed. And so this White House is trapped in this because they put out these arbitrary goalposts just to make Joe Biden look good. People didn't comply with what Joe Biden wanted to do, and now they are scrambling. The reality is this -- hospitalization rates per capita are still very manageable. Deaths per capita are actually down compared to the amount of cases that we are seeing go up because the people who are getting affected mostly are unvaccinated people who are not in the vulnerable age areas of being plus 65 or having other health abnormalities. That's where we are. What CDC and the White House should be doing is collecting more information, releasing that to the public with guidance for the American people, not mandates, not authoritarianism like they are doing right now."

Voters who plan to cast a ballot are now evenly divided when it comes to the question of whether Governor Newsom should be removed from office. But lucky for Gavin, he has some deep-pocketed friends. Where could they be? Silicon Valley perhaps? And of course, the entertainment industry, where Netflix's Reed Hastings has given him a whopping $3 million. But there is a new intern in the influence peddling race, the teachers' unions. Thankful for their year-and-a-half out of the classroom which Newsom granted them, they are now opening their checkbooks. In the past two days alone the teachers' unions have dropped a whopping $2 million into the Newsom's coffers. Here now is a keen observer of California politics, Harmeet Dhillon, attorney and CEO of the Center for American Liberty, which has had a huge wins recently against Newsom and these draconian orders of his. Harmeet, now, this isn't just the teachers' union paying Newsom back for all of his help, it's a down payment on what could be another year out of the classroom, no?"

The kind of rhetoric that you've been hearing out of the teachers' union and you've been hearing is that it's never going to be safe to go back into the classroom until COVID is over and eradicated. And epidemiologists who are being honest will tell that that may never occur. We have to simply learn to reduce the risks now to an acceptable amount. And so this payment, as you say, it may be for the next year of special accommodations and letting these teachers effectively not do their jobs for another year, which is really contrary to the interest and the health interests, specifically, of California's children. And so you mentioned court victories, we won a court victory last week in court for private school kids. And so unfortunately the public school kids are still at the mercy of the teachers union, so that $2 million contribution is definitely significant and forbodes more the same."

It's very scary for young people, particularly women and concerns about reproductive effects of these vaccines.

And I think some of that may have played against her when her body started doing other things during the competition here. But Laura, we move from the goat to the groan.
