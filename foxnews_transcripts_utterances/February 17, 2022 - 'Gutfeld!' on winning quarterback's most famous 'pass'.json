One of their activist Quintez Brown was charged in an attempted assassination of Jewish Democrat mayoral candidate Craig Greenberg in Louisville, Kentucky. I know you're thinking the same thing I did when I first read it. Jewish people live in Kentucky. The suspect just like CNN and MSNBC was an advocate for socialist and communist ideals and often criticized gun loving Republicans as a columnist for a Louisville paper. Yes, he's a member of the press. Well, it was either that or become a college professor. Here is the pro-gun control shooter on Joy Reid's show. Roll the tape.",

I'm not going to say that Reid's racist words incited violence against whites. But I'm not going to not say it. Surely it doesn't help when you constantly target one race for abuse. So, out of the Las Vegas Sun report this attempted murder. They blamed the right claiming that violent language for right-wing politicians like Donald Trump was enough motivation for the shooting. \"We've all heard this with our own ears. We have. Trump drawing cheers at rallies by suggesting violence against his opponents, GOP lawmakers and candidates trying to whip their followers into a frenzy with talk of taking up arms against so-called forms of tyranny, like mask mandates.\" Well, I got to say for a publication called The Sun. The people who write for it aren't that bright. Yes. You're welcome. And they claim that we've heard all of this with our own ears. Not us, buddy. All we hear is millions of people right now laughing at you for your idiocy. But at least The Sun didn't blame it on the shooter's car. Meanwhile, where's the shooter? He's not in jail. The Louisville community bail fund posted the $100,000 bond for him. Yes, the party of red flag laws bailed out a deranged man who just tried to shoot a politician. It's kind of like if Sirhan Sirhan failed, they're giving him another shot. And don't you dare blame Kamala, the person she bailed out is accused of murder in Minnesota. Which brings up another question. Why don't we know whose money bailed him out? Why aren't enterprising journalists using hacked data to find out who's responsible for freeing at attempted murderer? Well, maybe because they're hacks themselves. But look at what the press did to the truckers in Canada. Places like the Washington Post took names and numbers from a hacked list of donations and started calling people who gave as little as 40 bucks to the convoy. Like Geraldo's is hot tub is as gross as it is unsurprising. I just love that picture. And the only shooting that these so-called terrorists in Canada have done is that the goal during street hockey. The only thing they threaten is the timeliness of our Amazon packages. No wonder everyone hates the press including their own parents. They couldn't look into the president son's business dealings which they lied about being hacked. But if a coffee shop owner donates the peaceful civil disobedience, they sic the outraged mob on them. Then the government takes away their bank accounts. The doxxing has caused more damage than the protests. In short, journalists who despise the blue-collar class painted a target on people who supported a non-violent protest simply because they saw them as uneducated rubes. Uneducated rubes mind you, who you and your country rely on to make it run every day, you slime. This is class warfare with an over educated self- absorbed class taking out their aggressions on everyone they deem beneath them. Well, everyone but at attempted murder of a Jewish mayoral candidate, that crime doesn't fit the narrative. So, let it slide. But these are weird times. So weird that I find myself agreeing for once with Ilhan Omar who defended those who were doxxed and later harassed by reporters after donating to the freedom convoy. Be careful, Ilhan, your patriotism is starting to show. After the Washington Post began hunting down the doxed people, Omar said this, \"I failed to see why any journalist felt the need to report on a shop owner making such an insignificant donation rather than to just get them harassed. It's unconscionable and journalists need to do better.\" Well, amen sister, as her husband/brother would say. It's not often I find myself in staunch agreement with a radical communist, but that's what the journalist class does to you. It unites all of us against them. It's gotten so bad.

And that's because the leading Dems haven't spoken out against their party's ideas that are so far left, they make Karl Marx moved to Florida. And that coincides with a dwindling number of Democratic voters in rural areas. OK. That's three times I've had to say rural. Consider. In 2008 Barack Obama won 875 counties nationwide. In 2020. Biden won only 527. The majority of those losses, 260 of them took place in rural counties. Imagine if I was Tom Brokaw. It's going to a lot of flights in the middle of the night to change that number. Of course, the GOP gained House seats in 2020 despite losing the White House, they flipped the Virginia governorship last year. And now party officials worry that Dems will face challenges in Ohio, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Places that could help decide Senate Majority November and the White House in 2024. That's a prospect that has dem sweating like Hunter Biden after a paternity test.

And now, these cubies' most famous pass was leaving a woman who fell on her ass. So -- we should Emmy's for that. Social media is calling out Rams QB, Matt Stafford, for doing nothing as a female sports photographer fell backwards offstage right in front of his own two eyes. Yes, to be fair, he is a passer and not a receiver. It happened during the Rams Super Bowl victory celebration -- I had no idea they won -- but we haven't seen a blonde face plant like that since Kat at three for one Margarita night. Apparently, the photographer ironically named, Kelly Smiley, was getting ready to take a picture of Stafford and his wife, or soon to be ex-wife, when she lost her footing and fell off stage. Literally, that guy did nothing but take a swig of water. Oh, I need to be hydrated and leave his wife to deal with a mess. To be fair, he was still up on a high stage and people down below are attending to her. Meanwhile, Smiley posted a video on Instagram wearing a back brace and thanking everyone for reaching out. A friend of ours set up a GoFundMe page to help get Smiley back on her feet faster, as long as she doesn't donate to peaceful protesters. Of course, as for Stafford, who watched Smiley go down, after some outcry, he's now stepping up. He and the Rams issued a joint statement saying they're covering all of our hospital bills and replacing their cameras. Well, good on him, I say, because if anyone knows what it's like to hit bottom, it's a quarterback who played 12 years in Detroit. Little football joke. Tyrus, there's this, there's a thing when somebody does something and you can't look it in the same way. And I think of the Seinfeld episode, right?",

She also claimed to have given birth before but there's no record of that ever happening. She since resigned from her state job and has been charged with identity fraud, making false statements and forcing co-workers to sit through an annoying baby shower. That's the real crime, Rob.

I know you're thinking the same thing I did when I first read it. Jewish people live in Kentucky. The suspect just like CNN and MSNBC was an advocate for socialist and communist ideals and often criticized gun loving Republicans as a columnist for a Louisville paper. Yes, he's a member of the press. Well, it was either that or become a college professor. Here is the pro-gun control shooter on Joy Reid's show. Roll the tape."

I'm not going to say that Reid's racist words incited violence against whites. But I'm not going to not say it. Surely it doesn't help when you constantly target one race for abuse. So, out of the Las Vegas Sun report this attempted murder. They blamed the right claiming that violent language for right-wing politicians like Donald Trump was enough motivation for the shooting. \"We've all heard this with our own ears. We have. Trump drawing cheers at rallies by suggesting violence against his opponents, GOP lawmakers and candidates trying to whip their followers into a frenzy with talk of taking up arms against so-called forms of tyranny, like mask mandates.\" Well, I got to say for a publication called The Sun. The people who write for it aren't that bright. Yes. You're welcome. And they claim that we've heard all of this with our own ears. Not us, buddy. All we hear is millions of people right now laughing at you for your idiocy. But at least The Sun didn't blame it on the shooter's car. Meanwhile, where's the shooter? He's not in jail. The Louisville community bail fund posted the $100,000 bond for him. Yes, the party of red flag laws bailed out a deranged man who just tried to shoot a politician. It's kind of like if Sirhan Sirhan failed, they're giving him another shot. And don't you dare blame Kamala, the person she bailed out is accused of murder in Minnesota. Which brings up another question. Why don't we know whose money bailed him out? Why aren't enterprising journalists using hacked data to find out who's responsible for freeing at attempted murderer? Well, maybe because they're hacks themselves. But look at what the press did to the truckers in Canada. Places like the Washington Post took names and numbers from a hacked list of donations and started calling people who gave as little as 40 bucks to the convoy. Like Geraldo's is hot tub is as gross as it is unsurprising. I just love that picture. And the only shooting that these so-called terrorists in Canada have done is that the goal during street hockey. The only thing they threaten is the timeliness of our Amazon packages. No wonder everyone hates the press including their own parents. They couldn't look into the president son's business dealings which they lied about being hacked. But if a coffee shop owner donates the peaceful civil disobedience, they sic the outraged mob on them. Then the government takes away their bank accounts. The doxxing has caused more damage than the protests. In short, journalists who despise the blue-collar class painted a target on people who supported a non-violent protest simply because they saw them as uneducated rubes. Uneducated rubes mind you, who you and your country rely on to make it run every day, you slime. This is class warfare with an over educated self- absorbed class taking out their aggressions on everyone they deem beneath them. Well, everyone but at attempted murder of a Jewish mayoral candidate, that crime doesn't fit the narrative. So, let it slide. But these are weird times. So weird that I find myself agreeing for once with Ilhan Omar who defended those who were doxxed and later harassed by reporters after donating to the freedom convoy. Be careful, Ilhan, your patriotism is starting to show. After the Washington Post began hunting down the doxed people, Omar said this, \"I failed to see why any journalist felt the need to report on a shop owner making such an insignificant donation rather than to just get them harassed. It's unconscionable and journalists need to do better.\" Well, amen sister, as her husband/brother would say. It's not often I find myself in staunch agreement with a radical communist, but that's what the journalist class does to you. It unites all of us against them. It's gotten so bad. I'm going bowling with the squad this Saturday nights."

And that's because the leading Dems haven't spoken out against their party's ideas that are so far left, they make Karl Marx moved to Florida. And that coincides with a dwindling number of Democratic voters in rural areas. OK. That's three times I've had to say rural. Consider. In 2008 Barack Obama won 875 counties nationwide. In 2020. Biden won only 527. The majority of those losses, 260 of them took place in rural counties. Imagine if I was Tom Brokaw. It's going to a lot of flights in the middle of the night to change that number. Of course, the GOP gained House seats in 2020 despite losing the White House, they flipped the Virginia governorship last year.

And now, these cubies' most famous pass was leaving a woman who fell on her ass. So -- we should Emmy's for that. Social media is calling out Rams QB, Matt Stafford, for doing nothing as a female sports photographer fell backwards offstage right in front of his own two eyes. Yes, to be fair, he is a passer and not a receiver. It happened during the Rams Super Bowl victory celebration -- I had no idea they won -- but we haven't seen a blonde face plant like that since Kat at three for one Margarita night. Apparently, the photographer ironically named, Kelly Smiley, was getting ready to take a picture of Stafford and his wife, or soon to be ex-wife, when she lost her footing and fell off stage. Literally, that guy did nothing but take a swig of water. Oh, I need to be hydrated and leave his wife to deal with a mess. To be fair, he was still up on a high stage and people down below are attending to her. Meanwhile, Smiley posted a video on Instagram wearing a back brace and thanking everyone for reaching out. A friend of ours set up a GoFundMe page to help get Smiley back on her feet faster, as long as she doesn't donate to peaceful protesters. Of course, as for Stafford, who watched Smiley go down, after some outcry, he's now stepping up. He and the Rams issued a joint statement saying they're covering all of our hospital bills and replacing their cameras. Well, good on him, I say, because if anyone knows what it's like to hit bottom, it's a quarterback who played 12 years in Detroit. Little football joke. Tyrus, there's this, there's a thing when somebody does something and you can't look it in the same way. And I think of the Seinfeld episode, right?"

According to the New York Post, which is owned by our parent company a one steak sauce. Robin Folsom, wore a fake baby bump and sent e-mails from a fake baby daddy claiming that doctors told her she needed to rest at home. Her scheme fell apart after a co-worker spotted the false stomach and notice photos of the suppose baby to come all had different skin tones. But it was mostly the false stomach that did it for me. Run me the Halloween that when I dressed up as Brian Stelter. Yes, that was cheap. The best part when pressed by investigators about her fraudulent maternity leave, Folsom double down on the lies even after records indicated she was never pregnant. She also claimed to have given birth before but there's no record of that ever happening. She since resigned from her state job and has been charged with identity fraud, making false statements and forcing co-workers to sit through an annoying baby shower. That's the real crime, Rob. You know the great part about this Rob is that even men can do this if men can get pregnant, they can also fake pregnancy."
