It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" A lot of news unfolding today on the president, the Russia investigation, that payment made to Stormy Daniels and more. There's a new report that the feds wiretapped the phones of Michael Cohen, the president's longtime lawyer who is now under criminal investigation. According to NBC News, calls were allegedly intercepted in the weeks leading up to the raids on his home, offices and hotel room. And at least one of them was between Cohen and the White House. This comes on the heels of Rudy Giuliani's surprising revelations from interviews with Fox News, among them that President Trump reimbursed Cohen for the money he paid out to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the elections, contradicting previous claims he didn't know about that payment. This morning on \"Fox & Friends,\" Rudy tried to calm the storm: if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" A lot of news unfolding today on the president, the Russia investigation, that payment made to Stormy Daniels and more. There's a new report that the feds wiretapped the phones of Michael Cohen, the president's longtime lawyer who is now under criminal investigation. According to NBC News, calls were allegedly intercepted in the weeks leading up to the raids on his home, offices and hotel room. And at least one of them was between Cohen and the White House. This comes on the heels of Rudy Giuliani's surprising revelations from interviews with Fox News, among them that President Trump reimbursed Cohen for the money he paid out to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the elections, contradicting previous claims he didn't know about that payment. This morning on \"Fox & Friends,\" Rudy tried to calm the storm:"

I think it's pretty unlikely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST",

I don't think that he accidentally blurted something like that out. Let's get real. Plus, the tweet that went out was perfectly, like, precisely worded that the president put out as well. So now, they've put this information out there, and I guess it's part of their overall strategy."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "So, Juan, then I guess the question -- probably in the White House press corps today, was the question of -- well, that this is contrary to what information that the president himself and the press secretary had put out there. She handled it the way she did. And, I think that she did a pretty good job, basically, saying I gave you the best information that I had. She also said in the press briefing that last night, listening to that interview was the first time she heard anything different."

      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, and I think part of this, though, that strikes me is that Giuliani was clearly pursuing a legal strategy, Dana, which said that the lawsuit, you know, common cause, committee for responsibility and ethics, was really leading to a campaign finance violation. And they wanted to make it clear that there was no third party that paid for the president, and therefore, had some leverage over the president or potentially could blackmail the president, that this was a personal payment. Didn't come from the campaign, didn't come from the Trump organization, but was from the president. And therefore, they say, this should all go away. But, today, what we hear from these various groups is, in fact, they think their case has been bolstered by these comments, because now we understand the payment was made over time. So basically, it was a loan from Cohen. And then, even Giuliani's language was a little peculiar. He said, funneled through an LLC, a party that was set up by Cohen. And, of course, it was all done right before the election. So, this alleged took place in '06. But, here we are right before the election, and this money is being paid -- it looks like, you know, prima facie case of being done not to save family and the wife from embarrassment, but being done to save the president and his campaign from embarrassment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "OK. I just got in my ear -- a little birdie told me that MSNBC, apparently, has a banner up right now that says correction, the feds are monitoring, not listening, to Cohen's calls. So, I guess, perhaps, there wasn't a call that was listened to between the president -- or the White House and Michael Cohen. So, there's just another wrinkle in the story, Jesse, your thoughts?"

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

The President of the United States, campaign manager, his lawyer, his advisor, who've he never met, his general, everyone is listening to these people. And this whole investigation started bipartisan and it's now being investigated partisans. It's crazy. It's totally out of control. I don't understand what's going on. Is it about an FEC violation? I think it's a political situation with the payments -- I mean, a personal situation. If it is political, FEC violation, it's a $10,000 fine."

So, you could imagine that Michael Cohen's defense might be -- well, he's been my client for a long time. I tried to do this. It's not like that they have, like, FEC lawyers on the hotline in order to call and figure it out, which it might be something they say."

He's going to lie about sex. Fetch me a thanking couch. It's smelling salt, because I don't care. I don't care. I'm not surprised. I think most Americans watching the show right now care more about policy than porn star tricks. Fact is, voters made a choice. They've made a choice. And the choice turns out to be pretty damn good.

And I don't what they're going to do in 2020, because if the economy is going -- well, it's going super well now. Can that continue to 2020? Probably for little while here. How are they going to make an argument that there should be something different? I think that will be very difficult. But if you look at a place like Ohio right now, it's a very heated gubernatorial race. The Bernie Sanders supporters are out there in force, you have a state that is actually pretty -- turning pretty red, and it's more likely that a Republican will be able to win both statewide contests with Senate and the governor's race."

Well, most people who go to a Pink concert, well, they're dancing their little heinies off, singing along and really living in the moment. But if you are six years old, that time might be better spent with a little nap or two, as evidenced by Pink's beautiful little daughter, 6- year-old Willow. She's struggling to keep her eyes open during her mom's Dallas concert, nodding off. Her dad, carrying her, films her. So she shared the adorable video on social media, Pink, did, and said, \"I really rocked that show.\""

No news about the White House or the White Sox. The paper ran this bold front page to ask readers for their financial support, noting that news organizations that do original reporting now represent less than 3 percent of what you can find online in this country. And newspaper advertising, it's declining, taking money away from quality journalism. The situation is killing off papers all across the country. Denver especially comes to mind. Today is World Press Freedom Day. From me to you, love your local newspapers."

It's true culturally. It's true in terms of our military. It's true in terms of technology. Those are deep, deep-seated things that are just not getting fixed. And we're not unique.
