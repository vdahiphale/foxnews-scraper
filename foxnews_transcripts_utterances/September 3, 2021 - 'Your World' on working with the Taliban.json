What is sort of ironic, though, is that the same progressives that are putting pressure on lawmakers to pass this bill on the basis of climate change are also trying to pressure lawmakers to withhold their vote on the bipartisan bill that would actually do something to solve the problems that we're seeing on the TV right now, if they don't get a bill that's really unrelated. And so I think, obviously, this is just another pretext that's being used for the $3.5 trillion bill, and President Biden losing a lot of the political capital right now because of Afghanistan and other reasons that he might have used to sell the $3.5 trillion bill.

They have been able to get the arms necessary to conduct this complete overrun of Afghanistan itself before they actually got to Kabul and we gave it up to them. When you look at the drug trade that most of them are involved in, if we wanted to start hitting the Taliban, first thing we do, spray the poppy fields and take out the drug trade from them. In addition to that, we have to start looking at these other nations who, in fact, have now become state sponsors of a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. The fact that you have Admiral Kirby wanting to negotiate with them for information and things like that just shows the level of unethical compromises that the senior military leadership is now making in order to further the intelligence community's objectives to try and make sure that we can go after ISIS-K and others. I mean, this is a debacle that we have never seen. It is a strategic failure.

But the fact is that we -- there's a lot of -- we just -- to see just exactly what's happened on the ground, see what's going on in people's homes. A lot of people here, for example, because they don't have cell connections, are unaware of what available help there is right now to get them. The FEMA director and I were just talking to them. We're going to make sure we have someone coming through here going door to door, letting people know what's available to them right now, because they can't connect online. And with the governor and mayors and members of Congress, community leaders, all the folks that are here, we have been working together to deliver millions of meals and liters of water. And I know -- I know you're all are frustrated about how long it takes to restore power. It's dangerous work; 25,000 line men from around the country have come here to Louisiana to help. Crews from 32 different states are helping. And two of them lost their lives in the process of trying to get power back up. And we're going, we're working 24/7 with the energy companies, who we met with the heads up today. And we're deploying even more federal resources, including hundreds of generators. And there's more to come to restore power as fast as we possibly can, faster than anything that happened during Katrina. And we're also working on the cell phone -- with the cell phone companies, so you can call your loved ones, call for help, regardless of where you are, to make sure the people you know and you love you haven't been able to talk to lately, be able to know whether they're OK. We're moving quickly to keep gas flowing to the pumps, including I have gone into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's what's been set aside, the crude oil, providing flexibility for -- and providing flexibility for how many hours truckers are able to drive and transport gas and fuel, because there's a law in America you can't drive, for safety reasons, beyond so many hours a day. But we need more movement of this fuel. And we're expanding the supply of gasoline that can be sold in the state of Louisiana. And there's much to be done. We're working around the clock with the governor and with elected officials here until we can meet every need you all have. In fact, reports suggest that some insurance companies may deny coverage for living assistance unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. And so you have paid your insurance premiums, you're supposed to get payments for additional living expenses in case of an emergency. Well, but the insurance companies are saying, no, no, no, we won't pay you what we owe. Well, we're putting as much pressure as we can. We know all the parishes that issued strong voluntary evacuation orders first, and many didn't have enough time to make that order mandatory, as the storm moved so fast. And even with voluntary evacuations ordered, folks felt safest leaving their homes in many cases. No one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip. So, folks, they left their home because they left -- they felt they had to flee the risk of death. There's nothing voluntary about that. And so I'm calling on private insurance companies, don't hide behind the fine print and a technicality. Pay what you owe your customers. Cover temporary housing costs in natural disasters and help those in need. That's what we should all be doing now. And that's what we are doing. So far, we have provided, with the governor's help as well, $100 million in critical assistance directly to people in Louisiana by putting $500 in their bank accounts once they have contacted us. That's what we're going to come back and let all you people know exactly how to do that. That'll happen. And, secondly, at the governor's request, FEMA's helping with, fancy phrase, transitional sheltering assistance. It just means a place for you to be able to safely sleep at night and be secure by covering your hotel bill you racked up because you couldn't stay at home during a hurricane or because your home is not livable now. We're making sure this kind of relief is equitable. For those hardest hit, the resources they need have to get to them. And so, no matter who you are, if you live in an affected area, please visit disasterassistance.gov once you're able to use your cell phone. Or call 1-800-621-FEMA, FEMA. That's 1- 800-621-3362. Now, folks, Hurricane Ida's another reminder that we need to be prepared for the next hurricane. And superstorms are going to come, and they're going to come more frequently and more ferociously. I have been working closely with the governor and our colleagues in Congress from both parties on my Build Back Better plan that will modernize our roads, our bridges, our water systems, sewers and drainage systems, and power grids, and transmission lines to make sure they're more resilient. I walked through the backyards here. So many telephone lines are down. So many telephone poles are down. So many of the way in which we transmit energy is lost, because of old wooden telephone polls. We know for a fact, if they're underground, they're secure. It costs more money. We got to not just build back to what it was, put the same old poles up. We got to build back better. We got to build back more resiliently. And we got to make sure we do the same thing across the board. Think about how that $760 million West Shore project here in Southern Louisiana will build miles of new levees, pumping stations and drainage structures to provide protection for 60,000 folks in the area. It will change their lives in future storms. I told the governor that he has my full support -- I mean it sincerely -- he has my full support to get this project done. And, folks, I know you're hurting. I know you're hurting. I know the folks in Lake Charles who I visited earlier this year are still hurting from Hurricane Laura. I want you to know we're going to be here for you. And with regard to Lake Charles, I have put in a request in the new -- in the budget to provide for help for recovery for Lake Charles as a consequence of Laura and Delta, two storms that they still haven't been -- gotten the needs that they -- met that they have. This isn't about being a Democrat or a Republican. We're Americans and we will get through this together. We have just got to remember, we not only have to build back. We have to build back better than it was before, better than it was before, so, when another superstorm comes, it's not the damage done. So, thank you all very much. I'm going to see the rest of the folks in the neighborhood here. But every time I'd walk out of my grandpop's house out up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he'd yell: \"Joey, keep the faith.\" And my grandmother would yell: \"No, Joey, spread it.\" Let's spread the faith, OK? Let's get this done together. Thank you. Thank you.",

If we bury the power lines, they don't blow down in storms. And so, that way, when the storm passes over, levees work, no flooding, power is intact, life goes on.

We need to make the commitment now to harden the grid to bury those lines as one example of how we can do so, which not only protects Louisiana in a hurricane, it protects Texas in the Northeast in a ice storm, it protects the far West from forest fires from sparks coming off of a power line in the middle of a dry, hot forest.

So, theoretically, if you voted for that bill, you're for this bill. And we actually begin to lower the carbon intensity of our -- at the same time preserving a modern economy with all the chemicals and fossil fuels that we need.

Neil, we're focused on opening at least one restaurant in every community. In fact, in Bayou area, we were one of the first restaurants to open, apart from Waffle House.

It looks like this block after block where we are. And for the people who own and operate stores here, many who saw at least five feet of water come rushing into their businesses, what can you say? They are devastated. We have seen utility companies, cleanup crews, insurance adjusters and the Red Cross going up and down this block. Westchester County was one of the hardest-hit areas in the states. Floodwaters rose to 14 feet in some places. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, along with New York state Senator Chuck Schumer, came to assess the damage today. Governor Hochul announcing she has secured an emergency disaster declaration for 14 affected counties in New York, with up to $5 billion in immediate federal funding, which some say cannot come soon enough."

What do you think, Sarah?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARAH WESTWOOD, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, certainly, if you're talking about which bill would better address the kind of damage that we're seeing in Louisiana and some of the Northeastern states that were hit hard by Ida, the bipartisan infrastructure bill does that a lot more effectively. It has tens of billions of dollars for climate-related provisions, billions of dollars going to cities and states to update their infrastructure specifically to be more resilient against these types of storms. The $3.5 trillion infrastructure package is primarily social programs, things that really have nothing to do with what we're seeing, and yet you do see the left using the Hurricane Ida damage the forest fires out West to argue that climate change is urgent enough to require the passage of the $3.5 trillion bill. What is sort of ironic, though, is that the same progressives that are putting pressure on lawmakers to pass this bill on the basis of climate change are also trying to pressure lawmakers to withhold their vote on the bipartisan bill that would actually do something to solve the problems that we're seeing on the TV right now, if they don't get a bill that's really unrelated. And so I think, obviously, this is just another pretext that's being used for the $3.5 trillion bill, and President Biden losing a lot of the political capital right now because of Afghanistan and other reasons that he might have used to sell the $3.5 trillion bill. And then with Manchin obviously coming out with his opposition, the chances for that getting passed at the levels that are set are getting lower and lower."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, and there's very little of that is climate change-related only in there anyway, despite the big numbers we're talking about. But, that aside, I'm wondering now, as we wait to see the president tour Louisiana, this is a big change from the story he has been having to deal with for the better part of a few weeks now, the collapse in Afghanistan. But how he handles this could go a long way to -- among nervous Democrats see if he's stabilized things, period. So how important is this visit and his handling of these storms?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WESTWOOD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's really important for President Biden to sort of project the kind of competency that put him in the White House, right? That was his calling card, that he was going to be the steady hand on the wheel, the adult in the room, what have you, someone who was going to be able to manage crises, specifically the pandemic, but really all of them in general, more competently than President Trump. What the Afghanistan withdrawal really did that could be lasting is pierce that perception. Now President Biden is not coming off as a very competent president, someone who has a handle on things. And this is sort of something that happened to President Bush as well. When he mishandled Katrina so badly, then everything he did was sort of viewed through the lens of incompetency and failure. That's the risk that Biden has right now, that, because of the Afghanistan withdrawal changing people's perceptions of him as someone who can handle his business, for lack of a better word, that could start to bleed into other issues. If he's not able to get this $3.5 trillion bill over the finish line, if he's not able to oversee an effective response to Hurricane Ida, then that could lower his approval ratings even further. They were starting to tank before Afghanistan for reasons not all related to Afghanistan, his handling of the pandemic, the honeymoon period sort of being over for him seven months into his presidency. But, certainly, they could fall further if more things start to add to this perception that he's not really doing a good job of governing."

One of those issues that could be a pivot away from what's going on in Afghanistan is the latest jobs figure, but that's a pivot he might not welcome. It came in a lot less than expected. About a third the number of new jobs expected in this economy developed. And the president was quick to say that the Delta variant was behind that and unvaccinated people.

Most everyone was thinking a number at least three times higher than that, and it didn't deliver. And hospitality and leisure hiring that was going on crawled to like nothing in the latest period. Some are fearing that this could be a signal of things to come. Now, the president was blaming the Delta variant and all these unvaccinated people that have sort of stunted hiring in the country and all the rest. My next guest isn't buying that entirely, Larry Glazer, Mayflower Advisors. There is a bump going on here. The president seemed to indicate it's a temporary bump because of the variant, because of people not being vaccinated and putting a chill on the recovery from the pandemic. You're not buying it."

      "utterance": "What a disappointment, Neil. This is not the jobs report you want going into the holiday that celebrates labor in this country? Why? Of course, the Delta very is an issue. But, more importantly, it's the extended jobless benefits. That is crushing small businesses in this country. That's creating the problem. And this is spilling over, Neil. We see -- if you look beneath the hood of this data, you see leisure and hospitality, the areas most directly impacted, getting hurt the worst, effectively no job creation, when this economy was supposed to be off to the races. And, Neil, look, it's spilling over into consumer sentiment. That's the real concern here, that it goes beyond just data from Washington and it gets into the real economy. And at no point was there a demand issue, right? We talked to businesses, we talked to consumers. Try buying a car. Try buying a truck. People want this stuff. They want to go out. The problem for Vinny's Pizza in America right now is he can't get workers, right? He can't afford the cost of pizza. He can't afford the cost of everything. It's going up so fast. And that's what's crushing families in this country. And I think that's what gets lost in Washington, in the ivory tower. More spending doesn't solve these problems for working families. It doesn't bring gas prices down. It doesn't bring food prices down. It doesn't bring rent down. And it certainly doesn't create more jobs, like we saw today. And I think that's the message that Washington needs to get from Main Street. Main Street knows it. Washington's just learning when they saw the data today what they're doing and what they're selling isn't working on Main Street."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLAZER",
      "utterance": "Sure. No, I think that you make a really good point. And, again, there's never been a demand issue. Fidelity hiring 9,000 people on the high end of the economy, high-paying jobs, they can't find people to fill those jobs, right? But on the low end, Walmart also trying to hire people, the number of job openings at a record. So, small business, large business, they're doing their part. They're trying to create this economy. It's getting people into that work force. And those costs are rising at such a rapid clip. We don't know what the wild card is, how that's going to affect the economy over the next few months. These should be the best of times for workers. And middle-class families are getting hurt by a lot of these policies right now. So, again, we will see as these extended unemployment benefits run off, assuming that Washington doesn't have a massive spending bill that creates even more inflation, because, at the end of the day, the problem for working families in America is that their costs are rising faster than their wages. Their wages are going up. But their costs are going through the roof. And anybody who doesn't think there's real inflation in there has got their head in the sand. It's a real problem. It's a real problem. It's a regressive tax. Taxes have gone up on working families in this country because their costs are going up. And anyone who goes to the grocery store, the gas station or pays rent knows what's happening right now. And that's a real -- that's the real problem."

Meantime, at the White House, there's some new polling posing a challenge for the president. The poll from The Washington Post and ABC shows a majority of Americans believe that the president bears some blame for the ISIS suicide attack that killed 13 U.S. service members and up to 170 Afghan nationals. And Democrats, members of the president's own party, are among the people who are now calling for investigations. And also, despite hearing from the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, just about an hour ago, we still have not been told whether any more Americans have made it out of the country. They didn't outright say none have made it out. They have said we're in touch with people, but they certainly haven't given us an update that anyone has made it out. We also don't have numbers on how many green card holders and Afghan refugees who want to get out of the country remain. In the meantime, we are hearing more and more reports of the Taliban going and killing Afghans who helped the United States, going back on their promise of amnesty. It's causing fresh questions about whether the Taliban can be trusted to keep their other promise, the promise of safe passage. The White House says this is one of the reasons that the U.S. is not rushing to recognize the Taliban. But the Pentagon says there might be the need for collaboration going forward."

This is just another symptom of how poorly the Biden administration, and specifically this president, along with the senior military leadership of our nation, put together such a haphazard policy and evacuation process, that it was essentially a rout, much less a surrender, much less a negotiated surrender. And we're now paying the consequences in that, what do you mean you have derogatory information? The reality of it is, we should have known who's on every single one of those flights, and they should have been Americans, SIV holders and their families in order to get those people out.

They do it through extortion and kidnapping. They get money from Pakistan, from Russia, from Iran. They have been able to get the arms necessary to conduct this complete overrun of Afghanistan itself before they actually got to Kabul and we gave it up to them. When you look at the drug trade that most of them are involved in, if we wanted to start hitting the Taliban, first thing we do, spray the poppy fields and take out the drug trade from them. In addition to that, we have to start looking at these other nations who, in fact, have now become state sponsors of a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. The fact that you have Admiral Kirby wanting to negotiate with them for information and things like that just shows the level of unethical compromises that the senior military leadership is now making in order to further the intelligence community's objectives to try and make sure that we can go after ISIS-K and others. I mean, this is a debacle that we have never seen. It is a strategic failure. And we're absolutely right to demand that we have hearings and investigations into this that hopefully will not be politically tainted, but instead look at the national security interests of our country and our fellow Americans."

And, well, the smoke is still simmering here. This was a business owned by Jayesh, a man who opened in 2018, dealing with COVID and now this. And he's at a total loss of what to do next. It's the type of damage we have seen throughout Manville here in New Jersey. Three other homes caught on fire here as well. And if you look at these videos, there were many rescues. In fact, the first responders here in Manville went out to about 500 homes and rescued 1,000 people.

At least 25 people are dead and at least six people are missing after the floodwaters inundated communities along those rivers. In fact, we're talking about a situation here where the majority of the victims who died were submerged in their vehicles, swept away because of the waters. It all happened so fast here. In fact, in Connecticut, we now know a veteran state trooper, captain -- police Sergeant Brian Mohl died when his car was swept away at 3:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. He was out there trying to help people in this storm, and tragically lost his life. The -- frankly, it's shocking. We keep talking about this.

But the fact is that we -- there's a lot of -- we just -- to see just exactly what's happened on the ground, see what's going on in people's homes. A lot of people here, for example, because they don't have cell connections, are unaware of what available help there is right now to get them. The FEMA director and I were just talking to them. We're going to make sure we have someone coming through here going door to door, letting people know what's available to them right now, because they can't connect online. And with the governor and mayors and members of Congress, community leaders, all the folks that are here, we have been working together to deliver millions of meals and liters of water. And I know -- I know you're all are frustrated about how long it takes to restore power. It's dangerous work; 25,000 line men from around the country have come here to Louisiana to help. Crews from 32 different states are helping. And two of them lost their lives in the process of trying to get power back up. And we're going, we're working 24/7 with the energy companies, who we met with the heads up today. And we're deploying even more federal resources, including hundreds of generators. And there's more to come to restore power as fast as we possibly can, faster than anything that happened during Katrina. And we're also working on the cell phone -- with the cell phone companies, so you can call your loved ones, call for help, regardless of where you are, to make sure the people you know and you love you haven't been able to talk to lately, be able to know whether they're OK. We're moving quickly to keep gas flowing to the pumps, including I have gone into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's what's been set aside, the crude oil, providing flexibility for -- and providing flexibility for how many hours truckers are able to drive and transport gas and fuel, because there's a law in America you can't drive, for safety reasons, beyond so many hours a day. But we need more movement of this fuel. And we're expanding the supply of gasoline that can be sold in the state of Louisiana. And there's much to be done. We're working around the clock with the governor and with elected officials here until we can meet every need you all have. In fact, reports suggest that some insurance companies may deny coverage for living assistance unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. And so you have paid your insurance premiums, you're supposed to get payments for additional living expenses in case of an emergency. Well, but the insurance companies are saying, no, no, no, we won't pay you what we owe. Well, we're putting as much pressure as we can. We know all the parishes that issued strong voluntary evacuation orders first, and many didn't have enough time to make that order mandatory, as the storm moved so fast. And even with voluntary evacuations ordered, folks felt safest leaving their homes in many cases. No one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip. So, folks, they left their home because they left -- they felt they had to flee the risk of death. There's nothing voluntary about that. And so I'm calling on private insurance companies, don't hide behind the fine print and a technicality. Pay what you owe your customers. Cover temporary housing costs in natural disasters and help those in need. That's what we should all be doing now. And that's what we are doing. So far, we have provided, with the governor's help as well, $100 million in critical assistance directly to people in Louisiana by putting $500 in their bank accounts once they have contacted us. That's what we're going to come back and let all you people know exactly how to do that. That'll happen. And, secondly, at the governor's request, FEMA's helping with, fancy phrase, transitional sheltering assistance. It just means a place for you to be able to safely sleep at night and be secure by covering your hotel bill you racked up because you couldn't stay at home during a hurricane or because your home is not livable now. We're making sure this kind of relief is equitable. For those hardest hit, the resources they need have to get to them. And so, no matter who you are, if you live in an affected area, please visit disasterassistance.gov once you're able to use your cell phone. Or call 1-800-621-FEMA, FEMA. That's 1- 800-621-3362. Now, folks, Hurricane Ida's another reminder that we need to be prepared for the next hurricane. And superstorms are going to come, and they're going to come more frequently and more ferociously. I have been working closely with the governor and our colleagues in Congress from both parties on my Build Back Better plan that will modernize our roads, our bridges, our water systems, sewers and drainage systems, and power grids, and transmission lines to make sure they're more resilient. I walked through the backyards here. So many telephone lines are down. So many telephone poles are down. So many of the way in which we transmit energy is lost, because of old wooden telephone polls. We know for a fact, if they're underground, they're secure. It costs more money. We got to not just build back to what it was, put the same old poles up. We got to build back better. We got to build back more resiliently. And we got to make sure we do the same thing across the board. Think about how that $760 million West Shore project here in Southern Louisiana will build miles of new levees, pumping stations and drainage structures to provide protection for 60,000 folks in the area. It will change their lives in future storms. I told the governor that he has my full support -- I mean it sincerely -- he has my full support to get this project done. And, folks, I know you're hurting. I know you're hurting. I know the folks in Lake Charles who I visited earlier this year are still hurting from Hurricane Laura. I want you to know we're going to be here for you. And with regard to Lake Charles, I have put in a request in the new -- in the budget to provide for help for recovery for Lake Charles as a consequence of Laura and Delta, two storms that they still haven't been -- gotten the needs that they -- met that they have. This isn't about being a Democrat or a Republican. We're Americans and we will get through this together. We have just got to remember, we not only have to build back. We have to build back better than it was before, better than it was before, so, when another superstorm comes, it's not the damage done. So, thank you all very much. I'm going to see the rest of the folks in the neighborhood here."

      "utterance": "The president using this hurricane and the fallout to justify that $3.5 trillion human infrastructure package that he says would go and focus on a lot of these issues. The reality is, climate change and some of these other issues are a small part of that package, in fact, almost infinitesimal. And that is what is concerning, forget Republicans, some Democrats, who say that it really doesn't have its priorities right. Now, it's still in the early stages. They're trying to play with the numbers. But to say that that second measure would address what happened here in Louisiana and some of the damage we have seen elsewhere is simply incorrect. The president is addressing this now, promises more federal aid behind that -- what is already available, and is looking at the Northeast as well. It's a mess. Here's \"The Five.\""
