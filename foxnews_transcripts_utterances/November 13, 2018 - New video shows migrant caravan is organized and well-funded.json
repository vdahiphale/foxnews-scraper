There are signs of things bogging down though I wouldn't take too much stock in the state court giving Palm Beach County a five-day extension to complete the machine recount.

It's just getting started because it seems election workers in that county had been bogged down and tied up in just separating pieces of paper, so that they would have the right pieces of paper to run through the machines just to get the recount started. And with that, yes, Snipes continues to be the focus of this national debate. And the question up for debate seems to be whether she is corrupt or inept. That's not a place you want to be. And you have former Governor, Jeb Bush, who appointed her 15 years ago, now saying she has to go. And Tucker, here's where it gets interesting because today she responded by saying, OK, she's going to put in her notice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She put in her two year's notice. She just said she's not going to run for re-election in two years. So, she's effectively saying, \"Just let me get through this mess, after all the other messes. Then let me manage the 2020 Presidential Election in Broward County, and then let me manage the race to find a successor for me, and then I'm out of here.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, of course, the - the current or the incoming governor would have the power to - to hasten her retirement with the Senate and remove her from office. That's where we stand in Broward County. And then you have a big day in court coming up for both Scott and Nelson tomorrow because Senator Bill Nelson is asking the State to accept a good number of ballots that had been previously rejected either because they may have been mailed before the election but arrived in the election offices late, he says by no fault to the voters. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He wants to change the process that loosen the rules in which some ballots are - are determined for voter intent if they mess up the ballot whether or not you counted. And he also wants to count ballots that had been rejected for signature mismatches on grounds that some people just don't sign their - their name the same way from - from time to time.",

And if that's true, obviously it's not good. But let's put this into some perspective. False statements are everywhere in Washington. That's what the city specializes in, and not just false statements about small things. Barack Obama told you your premiums would go down and you could keep your doctor. Jim Clapper told Congress that the NSA was not spying on you. Clapper said that under oath. It was an outright lie. He was never charged. So, the obvious lesson is as long as you're powerful and your lie is big enough, you are never ever charged in Washington. No one is. You can wreck an entire healthcare system. You can take an entire country to war under false pretenses. You can kill American citizens with drone strikes, and you can lie about all of it, and nobody will ever think for a moment about prosecuting you. But give the finger to the establishment, mock the people in power, that is dangerous, and they'll get you for that. Jerome Corsi is learning that lesson the hard way, just as Mike Flynn learned it, just as George Papadopoulos learned it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All three and others have been bankrupted and destroyed by Robert Mueller for doing something that virtually everyone in Washington does every day with impunity, lying. So, what was the point of all of this? Why are we destroying all these people? What's the justification for it? It was supposed to be Russia. Remember? They were foreign spies afoot. They were dark forces sent by Vladimir Putin to destroy our democracy here in America. That's what they told us again and again on cable news. And that's how we were sold on the Mueller investigation in the first place. Well two years later, we learned, all fake. No evidence that any of that was real. No plot has ever been uncovered. All we've really learned is that an Independent Counsel was a handy way to settle political scores and that a lot of people on the Left don't really believe in the tenets of Western justice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Watch as one of them, just today, one of the resident geniuses on MSNBC, explains the new legal standard for guilt in this country.",

In return for bestowing his grace on America's two richest cities, Jeff Bezos, who is the world's richest man will receive more than $2 billion in subsidies from you, the taxpayer. Well new Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had this to say today. \"Amazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need more investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.\" Hate to admit it. But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a very good point. Brian Brenberg is Associate Professor of Business Economics, The King's College. And he joins us tonight. Professor, thank you very much for coming on. That's the only time I've ever agreed with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",

      "utterance": "Well, first, you had election managers having trouble keeping track of all the ballots flying in. And now, they may have trouble keeping track of all the lawsuits flying in because when you look at Nelson, you look at Scott, you look at League of Women Voters, we're now up to, by our count, nine different lawsuits and we're just in the first phase of this recount, possibly with much more to come. There are signs of things bogging down though I wouldn't take too much stock in the state court giving Palm Beach County a five-day extension to complete the machine recount. That's ultimately something that may be weighed and worked out in federal court. It is a federal race. But to that point, Bill Nelson is also calling for the lifting of all deadlines or extending them for all 67 counties, something also for courts to work out. And then, as you noted, there is Broward County and there are more wrinkles. Broward County happens to be particularly late to starting its recount. It's just getting started because it seems election workers in that county had been bogged down and tied up in just separating pieces of paper, so that they would have the right pieces of paper to run through the machines just to get the recount started. And with that, yes, Snipes continues to be the focus of this national debate. And the question up for debate seems to be whether she is corrupt or inept. That's not a place you want to be. And you have former Governor, Jeb Bush, who appointed her 15 years ago, now saying she has to go. And Tucker, here's where it gets interesting because today she responded by saying, OK, she's going to put in her notice. She put in her two year's notice. She just said she's not going to run for re-election in two years. So, she's effectively saying, \"Just let me get through this mess, after all the other messes. Then let me manage the 2020 Presidential Election in Broward County, and then let me manage the race to find a successor for me, and then I'm out of here.\" But, of course, the - the current or the incoming governor would have the power to - to hasten her retirement with the Senate and remove her from office. That's where we stand in Broward County. And then you have a big day in court coming up for both Scott and Nelson tomorrow because Senator Bill Nelson is asking the State to accept a good number of ballots that had been previously rejected either because they may have been mailed before the election but arrived in the election offices late, he says by no fault to the voters. He wants to change the process that loosen the rules in which some ballots are - are determined for voter intent if they mess up the ballot whether or not you counted. And he also wants to count ballots that had been rejected for signature mismatches on grounds that some people just don't sign their - their name the same way from - from time to time."

That would seem to be another thing that Ms. Snipes is not very good at counting because, unfortunately, her track record is littered with missteps and violations of the law. I mean in 2018, this election, we know that illegal ballots will count in the governor's race and in the Senate race because they were incapable of cleanly separating illegal ballots from legal ballots once they've been opened from their envelopes. So, we know that's going to happen. But this is not the first time. She's admitted under oath that she's allowed illegal immigrants and felons to cast ballots in Broward County in violation of numerous laws. You mentioned the time she destroyed the ballots that seem to have given a boost to Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Her office has been found guilty of illegally opening ballots inappropriately, right, and without proper oversight. And so, unfortunately, and actually, it's a fun fact when she was challenged on that topic, \"Why is your office opening ballots outside the presence of the official Canvassing Board?\" Her argument in court was, \"Well, I guess I didn't understand the meaning of the word canvassing.\" So unfortunately, her history is consistent with what we're seeing in the present and it augurs not very good things for Florida."

But what I can tell you is is that people, I think, have historically been afraid to challenge Ms. Snipes or Dr. Snipes, quite honestly, because of what you mentioned. They're afraid of being challenged as and called a racist. When Brenda Snipes' County Office Attorney pushed forward and she was being criticized because she donated to political campaigns and, actually, one of the County Commissioners, who was on the opposing end of one of the campaigns that Broward County Attorney donated to, the - the County - the Elections County Attorney played the race card and tried to rally support by generating a bunch of African-American attorneys to show up in solidarity. Eight of the nine members of the County Commission, when this issue came up, were Democrats. And, quite honestly, you don't do very well as the political official in Broward County if you attack African-American Democrats. Even though Rick Scott's a Republican, you know, you obviously had statewide aspirations, how well do you think you do statewide in Florida if you're perceived as a racist?"

There were a 108 attempts through double votes in Miami- Dade in this election, which means people tried to cast the second ballot in the same election.

      "utterance": "CBS News is reporting that the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, may soon issue new indictments. It's not clear who will be charged but there are indications of it. And some suggest that Political Consultant Roger Stone may be in the list. Another possible target is a man called Jerome Corsi, a 72-year old author and, by the way, Harvard-trained Political Scientist. He's an Associate of Stone's. Of course, he has said he expects charges soon. What for? Well, apparently, perjury. Of course, he says he was manipulated into making false statements to Mueller's lawyers. And if that's true, obviously it's not good. But let's put this into some perspective. False statements are everywhere in Washington. That's what the city specializes in, and not just false statements about small things. Barack Obama told you your premiums would go down and you could keep your doctor. Jim Clapper told Congress that the NSA was not spying on you. Clapper said that under oath. It was an outright lie. He was never charged. So, the obvious lesson is as long as you're powerful and your lie is big enough, you are never ever charged in Washington. No one is. You can wreck an entire healthcare system. You can take an entire country to war under false pretenses. You can kill American citizens with drone strikes, and you can lie about all of it, and nobody will ever think for a moment about prosecuting you. But give the finger to the establishment, mock the people in power, that is dangerous, and they'll get you for that. Jerome Corsi is learning that lesson the hard way, just as Mike Flynn learned it, just as George Papadopoulos learned it. All three and others have been bankrupted and destroyed by Robert Mueller for doing something that virtually everyone in Washington does every day with impunity, lying. So, what was the point of all of this? Why are we destroying all these people? What's the justification for it? It was supposed to be Russia. Remember? They were foreign spies afoot. They were dark forces sent by Vladimir Putin to destroy our democracy here in America. That's what they told us again and again on cable news. And that's how we were sold on the Mueller investigation in the first place. Well two years later, we learned, all fake. No evidence that any of that was real. No plot has ever been uncovered. All we've really learned is that an Independent Counsel was a handy way to settle political scores and that a lot of people on the Left don't really believe in the tenets of Western justice. Watch as one of them, just today, one of the resident geniuses on MSNBC, explains the new legal standard for guilt in this country."

He graduated at the top of his class at the Naval Academy. He served this country for five years as an Intelligence Officer, and then he made a fateful mistake. He backed the wrong presidential campaign. Page soon found himself accused of being a Russian spy. There was never any evidence that he actually was a Russian spy. Page was never charged with spying. He was never charged with anything. Didn't matter. The ghouls on cable news kept up the drumbeat, \"Carter Page. Russia. Carter Page. Russia.\" Before long, Carter Page's life was over. His reputation was gone. Who would hire him now? Nobody, ever. But the ghouls don't care. They're on to the next victim, and so is Robert Mueller. Maybe it'll be Jerome Corsi this time, facing a criminal perjury count. Maybe someday, it will be you. They'll make up some official sounding charge. But don't fool yourself. What they're really punishing is disobedience. Jonathan Turley is a Professor at George Washington University Law School and he joins us tonight. I am confused by the focus on Roger Stone and Jerome Corsi and Carter Page, and people who, you know, whatever you think of them, approve or disapprove, aren't - clearly not central players in a Russian espionage plot."

If you take a look at some of these - these statements, Flynn's case is really quite weak, if you look just at - at that false statement. I mean they're originally the - the FBI agents were not viewing that as a criminal matter. Every indication we have is that when Mueller came in, they converted it into something they wanted to indict for. There's no indication that when they saw that that statement is being false or misleading, they viewed it as a criminal act. And so, the real question for Mueller is - is - is whether at the end of this investigation, I do think we can see it from here, are we going to have a figure step forward where you go OK, I get it.

We do know that that Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which is the - the main group, which organized this Caravan has a couple of front organizations in the United States, and the money is flowing from them to Pueblo Sin Fronteras. We know there are some Leftist groups. I know it's - it's - it's forbidden to say that Soros is part of it. But Soros has, in fact, funded at least some of those groups in the past. So, we don't know where the money is exactly coming from. But we know it's not coming from Honduras."

Amazon has announced, after months of hype, that it's building two new headquarter facilities, one outside New York City, and the other outside Washington and Arlington, Virginia. In return for bestowing his grace on America's two richest cities, Jeff Bezos, who is the world's richest man will receive more than $2 billion in subsidies from you, the taxpayer. Well new Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had this to say today. \"Amazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need more investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.\" Hate to admit it. But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a very good point. Brian Brenberg is Associate Professor of Business Economics, The King's College. And he joins us tonight. Professor, thank you very much for coming on. That's the only time I've ever agreed with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez."

And again, the whole point is he's trying to cozy up the politicians so that they will give him and his company, a $200 billion company, the biggest tax breaks around, and put them in a position where they can fend off competitors for years to come because they're cozy with the rule makers."

BRETT LARSON, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7: I just flew in, Tucker. It is another one from the X-Files. Several airline pilots flying across the Atlantic saw something out there, a bright light in the sky, moving at what the pilot thought was at least Mach 2 or two times the speed of sound. Concerned for what it was, both pilots on a British Airways flight from Montreal to London, Heathrow contacted Air Traffic Control first to inquire if there was a military exercise, and then told Air Traffic Control--"
