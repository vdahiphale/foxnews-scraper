During the July 25th call, President Trump also repeatedly press the Ukrainian president to coordinate with his personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani. Why was Rudolph Giuliani's name mentioned multiple times during the July 25th phone call? Giuliani is not the Secretary of State. He's not an ambassador. He's not a member of the diplomatic corps. Rudolph Giuliani is a cold-blooded political operative for President Trump's reelection campaign. That is why he was referenced multiple times on that July 25th phone call. And it is evidence of corrupt intent by President Trump. By the time the call took place, President Zelensky understood Giuliani's connection to the shakedown scheme. He recognized Giuliani's role as the president's political operative. As matters related to Ukraine. Zelensky informed President Trump that one of his aides spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes. The Ukrainian leader knew Giuliani represented President Trump's political interest in his country and could help unlock the long sought-after Oval Office meeting that President Zelensky desire. The phony investigation sought by President Trump on July 25th call were not designed to bolster the national security interest of the United States of America. Quite the contrary, President Trump sought to benefit himself and his own reelection prospects.

That's a couple of days away, but I'm quite confident of where this goes at the end of the day, but we are going through the process right now.",

During the July 25th call, President Trump also repeatedly press the Ukrainian president to coordinate with his personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani. Why was Rudolph Giuliani's name mentioned multiple times during the July 25th phone call? Giuliani is not the Secretary of State. He's not an ambassador. He's not a member of the diplomatic corps. Rudolph Giuliani is a cold-blooded political operative for President Trump's reelection campaign. That is why he was referenced multiple times on that July 25th phone call. And it is evidence of corrupt intent by President Trump. By the time the call took place, President Zelensky understood Giuliani's connection to the shakedown scheme. He recognized Giuliani's role as the president's political operative. As matters related to Ukraine. Zelensky informed President Trump that one of his aides spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes. The Ukrainian leader knew Giuliani represented President Trump's political interest in his country and could help unlock the long sought-after Oval Office meeting that President Zelensky desire. The phony investigation sought by President Trump on July 25th call were not designed to bolster the national security interest of the United States of America. Quite the contrary, President Trump sought to benefit himself and his own reelection prospects. On the July 25th call, President Trump also suggested that President Zelensky speak with the Attorney General William Barr about the -- two fake investigations that the president sought. This is important to keep in mind. At no time during this entire sorted scheme --"

This is the Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, perhaps Rob Portman, perhaps Lamar Alexander. The senators who could conceivably vote for additional witnesses. So, what we saw today was Adam Schiff, trying to appeal to their sense of grandia, loftiness, guardians of the democracy, saw him quoting founding fathers and things like that. That was really a way of appealing to Susan Collins and those other senators to, in Schiff's mind do the -- do the duty? As for the White House, look, I think they're letting this play out, they're taking notes, they're watching, they haven't determined how long they're going to take for their defense. This -- I'm hearing they're probably going to take less than 24 hours to defend themselves. So, we'll see how that ends up playing out. And they're trying to make a really strong national security argument to these Republican senators to say, listen, you would be jeopardizing executive privilege. And you saw the president say that today. The argument they're making to Susan Collins is if you vote to subpoena John Bolton, you are compromising future president's ability to have confidential conversations with the National Security advisers."

And so, that has been put on the table and walked back a bit by some Democrats, who maybe wanted to try and get John Bolton. But, I think the bigger picture here is that Adam Schiff is yes, playing to the senators, of course. He's also trying to play to the American people. You noted earlier, Bret that the number one question being asked on Google today is what is the president being impeached for? And what I noticed today during Adam Schiff's opening statement is very close to the beginning and to the end, and Jerry Nadler did the same thing, discussed Russia a whole lot. And he talked about the Mueller investigation. And if he wants to go back to a narrative that didn't play out in terms of what he had been pushing for two years, while having a credibility problem that we saw today, with his mischaracterization of new text messages, I think Republican senators and the American people are going, we went through the Russia narrative, why are the Democrats bringing us back to that?

And they're certainly things that have riled up the different members on the House side over the course of this period, that have led them to the point where they would engage in this type of behavior on the Senate floor. But for the senators themselves, they expect something better than that. They expect more of an honorable approach to this thing. I think that you saw today an attempt on the part of Schiff and others to readjust this whole thing and say, hey, look, you know, we're, we're not going to engage in that behavior anymore. But to circle back to, you know, Senator Schumer's remarks about Schiff's presentation, calling it a tour de force. If it is, it's in the context of performance art, because that's what this is. It's performance art for a handful of senators that they hope to peel away. And it's a performance art that they hope to use and a lot of different campaign ads across the course of 2020. That's something that I think we have to understand this in the proper context here. This is not designed to achieve some kind of a sea change.

Trump spoke by telephone with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to congratulate him on his recent election. President Trump and President Zelensky discussed ways to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Ukraine, including energy and economic cooperation. Both leaders also expressed that they look forward to the opportunity to meet.\" That is the official White House call readout, dated July 25th, 2019. The official readout provided to the American people omitted key elements of the president's conversation. Let's review. The official readout did not mention the phony investigations requested by President Trump. The official readout did not mention the Oval Office meeting sought by President Zelensky. The official readout did not mention President Trump's elevation of a debunked conspiracy theory promoted by Vladimir Putin about 2016 election interference. The official readout did not mention President Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate his domestic political rival, Joe Biden. The official readout did not mention that President Trump maligned and threatened Ambassador Yovanovitch. And the official readout did not mention that President Trump praised a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor. The complete conversation, however, between President Trump and President Zelensky that we just outlined offers powerful evidence that President Trump abused his power and solicited foreign interference in the 2016 election. The 2020 election. Several members of the president's staff, listening in on the call, immediately grew concerned. As he sat in the White House Situation Room, listening to the conversation, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, realized that the president's demands of the Ukrainian leader were inappropriate and improper. He quickly recognized that as the president began referencing the Bidens and CrowdStrike, the call was diverging from the official National Security Council approved talking points that he helped prepare."

Some are kind of cycling back and forth between the cloak rooms. There are senators taking notes, copious notes. Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, they had big folders and binders at their desk there. Someone I noticed in the gallery a bit ago was Alyssa Milano, the actress. She was very present in the fall of 2018 for the confirmation hearings with Brett Kavanaugh. And the most popular place in the Senate chamber is the candy desk. A senator from Pennsylvania, in this case Pat Toomey, a Republican, has the candy desk -- remember, Hershey is based in Pennsylvania there -- and they stocked it with candy so senators can come by and get a sugar fix whenever they want. But I'll tell you, fatigue is starting to set in with these senators. That is why they're milling about.

JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Bret, at this point it wouldn't even be a surprise. I'm having flashbacks to January, 2016. And the way I read that \"New York Times\" endorsement, it was actually an endorsement, it was anyone but Bernie Sanders basically. And it's the same sort of -- the way Bernie Sanders is being treated largely, and I don't say, use a broad brush for the media, but he's been largely ignore until very recently. It's all right, you will see, like, he's number two in the polls or number one in Iowa and New Hampshire, and so doesn't get the coverage that, for example, Elizabeth Warren got when she was surging. And now you look, we're getting very close to Iowa and New Hampshire. He is probably the candidate best placed to win Iowa or New Hampshire given the demographics in those two states.

That was an issue that was going on. And then a complaint that the delegation sent to President Zelensky's inaugural was not high enough. This is not impeachable.

I've appeared before John Roberts before, of course, and I have known John Roberts. He is doing a great job as the presiding officer of the Senate. He basically said, lower the temperature down. But I'm going to tell you something, when they accuse my client on the floor of the Senate or they accuse senators of not being able to keep their oath and not being truthful and being involved in the coverup, we are going to say something. We're going to have to respond even on the floor of the United States Senate."

      "utterance": "Now I want you to look forward, because this is something you haven't done. In the House, obviously, in these committee hearings, the president's lawyers were not there. The counterargument was not essentially made. Besides, the Republicans were making it without really witnesses there. How do you structure your arguments going forward, if you can shed some light on that?"

      "utterance": "Look, in part, Bret, we are responding to what they are saying, but we're also going to put on an affirmative case, that not only the president was completely legal, completely unconstitutional, perfectly legal, perfectly constitutional, perfectly appropriate. But that the idea that this reaches the level of impeachment legally speaking is rarely absurd. But we are going to put on a series of lawyers that are going to be dealing with the issues on the facts in great detail, on the law and the Constitution. We have got two constitutional law professors, one former solicitor general of the United States with Judge Starr, Alan Dershowitz, of course, professor emeritus from Harvard Law School. We're going to talk about the foundations of what it means to rise to the level of what is impeachable and what is not. We have got a tremendous fact presentation. And look, we're going to be responding also to what goes on in the next few days. That's part of what you have to do when you go second"

Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, Lamar Alexander, Cory Gardner, as you look at that list, zero to 10, what is your level of concern that you may have to have witnesses in this Senate trial?"

      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Look, they're going to have to prove the need for witnesses in the sense that they are presenting all of this information. They've been doing this now for almost two days. I'm not going to predict what the Senate does. I'll tell you this. I'm not concerned about it because I know the facts and I know the law and we have a great team, and we're ready to proceed in any way it goes. I don't believe that it will get to witnesses, but that is going to be the Senate's decision."

We're going to make the case on why it's not necessary to have witnesses. We're going to talk about what the law requires, and we will deal with whatever the Senate decides and move forward. Our job, and we've been saying this for basically 18 hours, was to get this process started. And it's taken 12 hours to get it even started, and now we're getting started."

We have got you covered through the night. We'll be dipping in and out through our coverage, and each show will handle it. Martha is up next here in Washington. We'll be back tomorrow at 12:00 p.m. And that's it for SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. It's a busy time in Washington, and, oh, yes, the Iowa caucus 12 days away as we look alive on Capitol Hill. Keep it here on FOX. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
