Baby Shark Song is a favorite for Nats fans. And so all together, I was having a great time. This was the best of times to quote Mr. Dickens, but it was also the worst of times because my nationals lost all three games, Jesse, they scored three runs in three games. And that came after defeating Houston in the first two games in Houston. Washington will play Houston again tonight in Houston.

Whatever you think about the way he delivered his speech when he announced this, this is the way that President Trump does things. He is completely under siege. This was an enormously ambitious undertaking, extraordinarily risky. And what bothers me the most in hearing all of these harsh review is that, we are losing sight of these extraordinary achievements by these incredible members of our arm services by the Delta Force. And could the president have given other people a little more credit, could he have been more humble? Could he have been more sort of sedate in that moment? Of course, he could. Would that make him Donald Trump? No. It wouldn't. Now I know people like things to become out in a different tone, but this is the tone of President Trump. And I think the bottom line is that he said yes to something that he easily could have said no to. I mean, look back. Joe Biden did not want to do the Bin Laden raid, right? I mean, this is a difficult decision process.

And I think he would -- what he was saying is I did something the previous administration didn't do. I eradicated ISIS. But terror lives on. You can have those two thoughts. The problem with the story for the media is that it destroys two narratives. Number one, it kicks impeachment, you know, off the screen for a few days and that drives them crazy. Number two, it undermines the idea that what he is dealing with foreign policy wise in Syria is wrong. That story is destroying those narratives, which is why they had to do this resolution of whatever this impeachment crap is we're talking about later in the show. Look, I would hate to be on the side that is sad Baghdadi is gone and won't support a hero dog. I mean, what kind of person are you? Joy Behar these babies. I mean, you -- they get mad because something good happened? And they are picking apart the fact that Trump likes to tell a story that reinforces memories for us because we want to take part in this?

But we've been down this road before where we mock millennials for their ignorance over systems that have killed as many people as cholera. But maybe it's on us. Somewhere along the line, we broke our commitment to transfer the truths of history to incoming earthlings. You can't blame young people for getting -- for forgetting stuff you never taught them. And although socialism is a sweet idea, there's no college course called intro to sweet ideas that killed millions. Two analogies. We used to know that vaccines saves millions of lives. But once measles is nearly wiped out, what happens? We forget. And start talking about vaccines as an option like a sunroof. Then, measles returns. The horrible effects of socialism and communism seem remote, like a hangover you had from tequila back when you were 16. You threw up for two days and swear never again. But in a year, you do. Humans can forget the things that nearly killed him. In the same survey, 72 percent of all Americans wrongly believe communism killed under 100 million people in the last 100 years. It's more. Over 100 million people killed by something that many people today see as nice.

Scandinavian countries were going on a socialist route until about 40 years ago when the economy sort of tanking, they kicked all the politicians out and they slashed the state tax, corporate taxes, income taxes. They have school choice there. They don't have a lot of regulations. The unions are not very tough. There is no minimum wage laws in these countries. So, they can afford this great health care system there that takes care of everybody, because they don't get involved and overregulate and overly tax these companies and these individuals income.

Since Trump has been President, everybody has been concerned about this, that, concerned about his personality, concerned about his foreign policy actions, concerned about North Korea.

This was me this weekend and for a kid, you know, have to scrounge to pay for his pony league uniforms. I've got to see my favorite team; the Nationals play three home games in the World Series. Here I am with a lady dressed as the World Series trophy outside Nats Park. Here I am with my family at the game and here I am with another fan holding up a shark sign. Baby Shark Song is a favorite for Nats fans. And so all together, I was having a great time. This was the best of times to quote Mr. Dickens, but it was also the worst of times because my nationals lost all three games, Jesse, they scored three runs in three games. And that came after defeating Houston in the first two games in Houston. Washington will play Houston again tonight in Houston. Hopefully tomorrow they will bring the World Series championship to D.C. for the first time since 1924. That's been a long wait. Go, Nats."
