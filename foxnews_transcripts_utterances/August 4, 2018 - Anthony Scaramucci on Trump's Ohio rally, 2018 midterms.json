It is a newspaper for a certain mindset only. They as much as admitted it this week. When? When their latest editorial board hire, Sarah Jeong, an Asian woman, is outed for her cop-hating, Caucasian hating, male hating social media messages, the Gray Lady responds with a, \"What difference does it make,\" answer. And The Washington Post pooh-poohs the hate with this namby-pamby headline. \"Is it okay to make fun of white people online?\" As this, F the police or we should kill all men is humorous. Joeng has certainly given deeper thought than most of us to hate-filled tweets and their consequences since she herself wrote a book about online harassment. Now, ask yourselves, if any of the following sound like comedy to you. \"Cops are a-holes. Why don't we ever talk about banning police. F the police. We should kill all the men. Oh, man, it's kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men.\" Or \"#cancelwhitepeople, F white women.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we are not just talking about a writer for the Times. We are talking about an editorial board member, an esteemed and prestigious position at any newspaper. The editorial board is looked up to for direction by journalists. And the newspaper that has always prided itself on being there for the forgotten and on being open minded, fair-handed and it's the citadel of the newspaper publishing world is now admitting to its own hypocrisy. By defending Jeong, they are saying it's okay to be racist if your target is white, and they are saying all the outcry is over old tweets. Old tweets, as if three years ago is old and they say she's a young Asian woman. She's been subject to online harassment. As if hating cops or whites is okay if you say you've been harassed, but even more revealing is Jeong's own statement that her comments were not aimed at the general audience. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Pray tell, saying \"F the police,\" is about as general an audience as you can get. And someone who has a job at the New York Times as a wordsmith should know the difference between a specific and a general audience. It's specific when it's against one police officer. It's general if it's against all law enforcement and the whole group of them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know, the bigotry is alarming. As recently as a few weeks ago the New York Times goaded its readers in an editorial to fight the nomination of the latest Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Quote, to take a line from \"The Godfather.\" This is the New York Times: \"It's time to go to the mattresses.\" Really? \"The Godfather?\" Now, it's been a while since I've seen \"The Godfather.\" But last I recall, going to the mattresses meant that one family was going to wipe out another. But you are not surprised. You already knew this, didn't you. I'm tired of the elitist telling me and everyone else to not to believe our lying eyes when the truth is so painfully obvious whether it's Peter Strzok saying he hated and despised Trump and would stop his becoming President, but it did not affect his work when he's the one who began the counter- intelligence investigation against Trump that we are still living with. Or Jeong's defenders saying, \"There is no evidence her tweets had any bearing on her work.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It appears the old gray lady has finally flipped their wig. Time to go to the mattresses on a Supreme Court justice? Really? Here is my favorite quote from \"The Godfather,\" \"We are going to make you an offer you can't refuse.\" Stop your resistance. Stop your obstruction. Stop the hypocrisy and get on board with making America great again or get the hell out of the way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that's my open. If you love my opening statements, you will love my new book, the New York Times number one best seller \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And President Trump giving a fiery speech tonight hitting on a number of major topics all while urging Ohioans to vote for Republican State Senator Troy Balderson in Tuesday's special election.

They are the second largest economy now. The world has to turn around now and allow us to have a symmetrical trading system where it's free and fair trade, where their tariffs come down, and oh by the way, if you are not going to bring your tariffs down, we're going to raise our tariff to the meet your tariffs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so, what I liked about the strategy is it's finally getting people to the table. The President of the EU, Juncker was in town last week, and now, they've got an impasse or a ceasefire, and I think the President will eventually get his way. I've had two or three conversations with him about this and the most recent one was last week, where I am -- because I'm from Wall Street, I understand capital flows.

Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight, and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. We have a big show on deck with brand-new reaction to President Trump's rousing speech. Anthony Scaramucci, Dinesh D'Souza, Charlie Kirk -- all standing by and my open is just moments away. But first, some highlights from the President's rousing rally in Ohio in support of congressional candidate, Troy Balderson running in Tuesday's special election. Take a look."

I looked over and I said, \"I don't want to wrestle him, he's tough.\" They are talking about this blue wave. I don't think so. I don't think so. Maxine Waters is leading the charge. Maxine. She is a real beauty. Maxine. A seriously low IQ person. Seriously. My wife, the First Lady, Melania said, \"The women really like you.\" They do like me and I like them, but I said, \"How did we win the women?\" We won the women.

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "More on the fiery rally and reaction to it throughout the show tonight. But now to my open. You know, there are no secrets anymore. The New York Times which we all knew bent over backwards to lean left is now officially a leftist progressive socialist newspaper. There is no objective journalism anymore. It is a newspaper for a certain mindset only. They as much as admitted it this week. When? When their latest editorial board hire, Sarah Jeong, an Asian woman, is outed for her cop-hating, Caucasian hating, male hating social media messages, the Gray Lady responds with a, \"What difference does it make,\" answer. And The Washington Post pooh-poohs the hate with this namby-pamby headline. \"Is it okay to make fun of white people online?\" As this, F the police or we should kill all men is humorous. Joeng has certainly given deeper thought than most of us to hate-filled tweets and their consequences since she herself wrote a book about online harassment. Now, ask yourselves, if any of the following sound like comedy to you. \"Cops are a-holes. Why don't we ever talk about banning police. F the police. We should kill all the men. Oh, man, it's kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men.\" Or \"#cancelwhitepeople, F white women.\" Now, we are not just talking about a writer for the Times. We are talking about an editorial board member, an esteemed and prestigious position at any newspaper. The editorial board is looked up to for direction by journalists. And the newspaper that has always prided itself on being there for the forgotten and on being open minded, fair-handed and it's the citadel of the newspaper publishing world is now admitting to its own hypocrisy. By defending Jeong, they are saying it's okay to be racist if your target is white, and they are saying all the outcry is over old tweets. Old tweets, as if three years ago is old and they say she's a young Asian woman. She's been subject to online harassment. As if hating cops or whites is okay if you say you've been harassed, but even more revealing is Jeong's own statement that her comments were not aimed at the general audience. Pray tell, saying \"F the police,\" is about as general an audience as you can get. And someone who has a job at the New York Times as a wordsmith should know the difference between a specific and a general audience. It's specific when it's against one police officer. It's general if it's against all law enforcement and the whole group of them. You know, the bigotry is alarming. As recently as a few weeks ago the New York Times goaded its readers in an editorial to fight the nomination of the latest Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Quote, to take a line from \"The Godfather.\" This is the New York Times: \"It's time to go to the mattresses.\" Really? \"The Godfather?\" Now, it's been a while since I've seen \"The Godfather.\" But last I recall, going to the mattresses meant that one family was going to wipe out another. But you are not surprised. You already knew this, didn't you. I'm tired of the elitist telling me and everyone else to not to believe our lying eyes when the truth is so painfully obvious whether it's Peter Strzok saying he hated and despised Trump and would stop his becoming President, but it did not affect his work when he's the one who began the counter- intelligence investigation against Trump that we are still living with. Or Jeong's defenders saying, \"There is no evidence her tweets had any bearing on her work.\" It appears the old gray lady has finally flipped their wig. Time to go to the mattresses on a Supreme Court justice? Really? Here is my favorite quote from \"The Godfather,\" \"We are going to make you an offer you can't refuse.\" Stop your resistance. Stop your obstruction. Stop the hypocrisy and get on board with making America great again or get the hell out of the way. And that's my open. If you love my opening statements, you will love my new book, the New York Times number one best seller \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And President Trump giving a fiery speech tonight hitting on a number of major topics all while urging Ohioans to vote for Republican State Senator Troy Balderson in Tuesday's special election. Joining me now with reaction to the rally and so much more, former White House Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci. Good evening, Anthony."

All right, listen, the President tonight and you and I both know that he has energy from his audience that goes back and forth and I think he's at his strongest when in front of an audience like the one he was tonight, but when the Democrats go forward in this special election on Tuesday. What are they going to say? The economy is rotten? We are not safe anymore? What are they going to say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm going back to your book. Their playbook is that the Republicans are racist, that they are xenophobic. It's all of this identity politics and it's all of this politics of division. They can't really argue the policies, they can't really argue the state of the economy or rising wages for the Hispanic American or African-American communities, and so, they try to divide and they try to hit you with ad hominem attacks, Judge, so that's what they'll do, but tonight, what I loved about tonight is that the President was unleashing his vintage true self. And it made me think back to two years ago during the campaign and this is something frankly that other Presidents don't do is get out on the campaign and rally people the way he is. He's going to be so fresh and so ready for 2020 and right in through the midterm elections here. So, you've got to love the fact that it's a Saturday night, he could be in Bedminster relaxing, but he's in a 110-degree auditorium giving that kind of a rousing speech."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "A vote for Troy's opponent is a vote for open borders, which equals massive crime. Like they don't care about it. They don't care about the crime. They don't care about your military and they don't care about your vets. The new platform of the Democratic Party is to abolish ICE and let's not worry about crime. Oh really? It doesn't work that way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "I don't know who wouldn't agree with that. You?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, it's a bad strategy for them. What's happened is the President is a human wrecking ball for the Democratic Party and he set off the alarm bells on the far left, and so all of these politicians that want to run for President are racing towards the far left, and that's their third reel. That will be their ultimate demise. And so, I don't want to be a Democratic strategist here on your show, Judge Jeanine, but let me tell you, it is the absolute wrong strategy for them and they are playing right into the President's hands. And so he speaks in a common sense way to common people. And I'll tell you what, when you listen to him speak like I did in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, my dad's hometown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And my dad's hometown is Scranton."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Yes, there we go, so my dad is from Plains, maybe 15 minutes from Scranton, and right there, I'm thinking to myself, these people relate to him. He's the blue collar billionaire President. He is able to tap into their joy. He's able to tap into their aspirations. And by the way, the policies have been phenomenal. So, it's going to be very hard for them to argue against what the President is actually putting on the table for every day average Americans."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, Anthony, I want to ask you this question, and you know, the GDP and the tariffs. The President said tonight, if we get the trade deficit down the GDP goes up Now, you get finances, this your forte. He talked about the fact that we've rebuilt China with a $500 billion a year trade deficit. It's time that we rebuilt our own country. And everybody understands that. But this whole thing with tariffs, they talk about the fact that it's not a good thing for America, they are going to hurt us. Explain this to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Okay, so just briefly, the President's position is that the trade system since the end of World War II has been unbalanced. The US did that to help build the rest of the world after the devastation of World War II and with China's introduction into the World Trade Organization, they came in as a developing nation 17 or 18 years ago, and so the President's point is, we have rebuilt the world, we helped the Chinese. They are the second largest economy now. The world has to turn around now and allow us to have a symmetrical trading system where it's free and fair trade, where their tariffs come down, and oh by the way, if you are not going to bring your tariffs down, we're going to raise our tariff to the meet your tariffs. And so, what I liked about the strategy is it's finally getting people to the table. The President of the EU, Juncker was in town last week, and now, they've got an impasse or a ceasefire, and I think the President will eventually get his way. I've had two or three conversations with him about this and the most recent one was last week, where I am -- because I'm from Wall Street, I understand capital flows. I'm worried about the tariffs because it could change the psychology in the market. And the President has such great momentum -- Judge, 18 fantastic economic months. Let's dial into this surgically with great precision so that we don't blow the momentum and the positive optimism and psychology in the economy. But, I think the President is on the right track."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Quickly before we go, he made it real clear, he said we make a car and China taxes it 25% when it gets over there. They make a car and we charge them 2.5%, which they don't pay. I mean, that's real simple to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, that's correct. If you sell a Harley-Davidson in Germany, a $9,000.00 Harley-Davidson here; it's $24,000.00 there. So the President is 100% correct about the system. He's rattling everybody cage, I think it will be effective. What I don't want to have happen is any of the great momentum that he has created in this economy for these workers that he was talking to tonight. I don't want any of that to be deflated, Judge, but he's on course, and I think what he did with Juncker last week is a great sign of the things to come by the end of the year. I do predict lower tariffs and more free trade for the world as a result of President Trump."

Now, of course, this outrages a lot of people because they think, \"How dare you compare Trump and Lincoln?\" Now, on the face of it, Trump and Lincoln temperamentally are quite different, right? Here is Lincoln. He is brooding, he is melancholy. He is philosophical. So, I wouldn't say that temperamentally, they are the same, but their situations are eerily similar."

In fact, wins it only because it's a three-man race, and the moment that he's elected, all hell breaks loose. The northern Democrats openly call for his assassination and the southern Democrats prove that they are willing to break the country up rather than abide a Lincoln presidency. So, here we are, 150 years later, and with an outsider -- Trump -- who wins unexpectedly, a close election and the same party, the Democrats go nuts. And to this day, two years after the election."

      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "They're still nuts, and so the movie looks at the themes of fascism and racism which are the two incendiary bombs that the left is using to try to delegitimize Trump, basically saying he's ineligible to be President even if people voted for him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "Here's why. Where do you get the license, if I may say so, to trump an electoral majority in a Democratic society -- there is only one place. The only analogy that works is Hitler circa 1933. Because you and I would agree that if we were living in Germany and Hitler came to power, and remember, the Nazi party was the largest party in Germany, so -- and if Hitler was democratically elected, I think you and I would agree that would be terrible enough that we would be justified in using quote, \"any means necessary to get rid of him.\" So, the left is taking that logic and applying it to Trump."

      "utterance": "Based on what?"

    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "Based on the fact that they say he's a racist and he is a white supremacist, so all this kind of incendiary poison is used to basically legitimize all the craziness that the left has been doing from violence to attempts to engineer a legal coup. So, our movie basically takes them at their word. We say, \"Okay, let's look at fascism.\" Is it not a fact that Mussolini, the founder of fascism was a leftist. He was a Marxist. He was a life-long socialist. Let's look at Hitler, what's the name of his party? The National Socialist Party. Let's look at the Nazi 25-point agenda because they campaigned on that. State control of banks, state control of healthcare, state control of education, state control of religious liberty."

      "utterance": "Exactly. No sane person can read this and say, \"This is on the right.\" And then I look at the fascism of today. The left using the weapons of the state against their opponents. I mean, the key mover of the Nazis was the party is the state. Remember, the Nazi party basically became the state and this is what the Democrats have been doing."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAHN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I agree it's about sustainability and the President's total GDP since he took office is about where Obama's was, maybe it's a small percentage point higher."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Really? Read my book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAHN",
      "utterance": "A decimal point higher. Yes, absolutely. In his entire 19-month presidency, and in fact, the last 19 months of the Obama presidency, the economy created more jobs than they have in the first 19 months of the Trump presidency."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Really? Is that true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAHN",
      "utterance": "Those are the numbers, those are the facts. Google it, you could look it up."

      "utterance": "Is that true, Steve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVY",
      "utterance": "Well, President Obama's administration is the only one since World War II that did not have at least a 3% growth for a total year. The President right now is on pace to exceed 3% for the whole year, but look at the other numbers. Manufacturing is booming. The manufacturing is up to its highest level since 2007. Construction jobs are way up. That inures to the benefit of the middle class. So, Chris is correct that economics isn't everything, especially in a midterm, but it does help. You know, normally the party in power loses on those off years. There was an anomaly. 1998 with President Clinton. He had a very strong economy at the time. You have a very strong economy here, so if there is anything that can break that trend, it's the strong economy we are seeing today."

      "utterance": "Impeachment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAHN",
      "utterance": "The factor was that the Republicans overreached in impeaching the President. If the Democrats overreached to impeach this President ..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Wait a minute. He lied before the grand jury. Are you kidding, that's why Clinton lost his law license. He lied in front of the grand jury, don't talk about overreaching. You want to go Russia collusion, don't start with me, Chris."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAHN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVY",
      "utterance": "But you know, Democrats might be making the same mistake as Republicans did in 1998. You're right, Chris, there was an overreach there and the public reacted negatively. You might be seeing that this year as well which is why Democratic leadership is trying to tell all its minions through their talking points stop talking about impeachment because it can backfire."

It would be a complete overreach to make impeachment the issue, it would be an overreach to impeach unless there is something really there to impeach about. So, the Democrats have to be careful or they are going to hand Trump a 2020 victory."

Charlie Kirk is here to tell us all about this week's most outrageous statements. President Trump continues to be a target in the mainstream media. Take a listen to this one made about him after his Thursday rally."

      "speaker": "MIKA BRZEZINSKI, ANCHOR, MSNBC",
      "utterance": "There is no way that anyone who knows Donald Trump, unless they're bought in, in some way could watch him last night and not come away with a feeling that the President of the United States is completely unhinged and getting worse by the day."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And that's just one of the most of outrageous things I have heard this week. So joining me now with reaction to that and more, Turning Charlie Kirk. All right, Charlie, there isn't any way anyone who knows Donald Trump unless they are bought in some way doesn't think he's totally unhinged. What's your reaction to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT, USA",
      "utterance": "Well, I couldn't disagree more. Actually, and the American people disagree with that. He's getting more and more popular. Here is the stunning thing about the Trump presidency. Despite unprecedented media backlash and targeting, he's going against historical trends. Usually Presidents get less popular in their first 18 months. He is getting more popular. In fact, he's got 50% approval rating in the latest Rasmussen poll and Rasmussen was the most accurate poll before the 2016 election. His approval rating with black Americans was 13% a year ago, now, it is at 29%. Hispanic approval rating is up 10 points, so look, Mika, maybe in the \"Morning Joe\" circle, they all think he's unhinged, but the American people, the more of Trump that they see, the more they like."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Charlie, I've got to tell you, if somebody is unhinged with all the hits he's been taking, I mean, anybody would buckle and be in a corner. This guy is out fighting the fight every day. He gets energy from this stuff, he really does, and who benefits from it? We do. But speaking of that, Madonna suggests Donald Trump motivate her to move to Portugal. Take a listen. It's a full screen, \"I felt like we needed a change, and I wanted to get of America for a minute. As you know, this is not America's finest hour, not that leaving America makes anything different or changes anything.\" Charlie, what's this woman talking about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Well, this is actually a really interesting example. We, as conservatives, we remain loyal and patriotic, no matter who is President of the United States."

      "utterance": "Yes, isn't that the truth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Liberals base their love or their lack of love of America based upon whether or not their team member is President of the United States. Look, Judge, when Obama was President, I was just as loyal and committed American as I am today. It doesn't matter who is President of the United States. We believe in the idea of America. We believe in our history, in our heritage, and in our people. Liberals like Madonna, they dismiss America if there is a Republican in the White House, and that is a huge distinction going on in the America. Are you thankful to be an American or are you angry to be in America right now? And many liberals are angry when we should be pouring out our gratitude that we are able to live in this country at this time with this President and you see Madonna is a perfect example of this."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

She is always good for outrageous. All right, this tweet, \"Trump and his administration are the enemy of the American people.\" Charlie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",

Let's just add some context for viewers at home that might not remember, Kathy Griffin about a year ago posted a picture with a decapitated head of the President of the United States and then tried to play the victim 48 hours later because she was upset everyone was going after her. Now, imagine for a second that a conservative did that horrific stunt with Barack Obama's head. They would have been investigated by the Secret Service."

And look, the left -- like we keep on saying they are losing their minds. I doubt if they had those in the first place. But here is the thing, Trump is the ally of the American people. He is fighting, he is winning and the liberal elites like Mika, Madonna and Kathy Griffin, hey, the more they talk, the more popular Trump gets. As I said earlier, unlike other historical trends, Donald Trump is getting more popular with time and we are just getting started."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

Anyway, Charlie Kirk, thanks so much for being with us tonight."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "You are the great people. You are the great people. You work hard, you pay your taxes. You do all these things and you were forgotten. They forgot about you and you are the smartest people. You are the smartest people. You know, when they talk about it, they talk about the elite. The elite. Do you ever see the elite? They are not elite. You are the elite. You are the elite."

He is a former liberal whose movement now urges people to leave liberalism which he says has become too intolerant. Brandon Straka joins me. All right, good evening, Brandon. The last time you were here, you were on your way to the UK, you had just become a hit with your documentation of all of the hysteria on the left and the lying hysteria. What's happened since then? BRANDON STRAKA, FOUNDER, #WALKAWAY CAMPAIGN: Well, a lot has happened since then, the #walkaway campaign has continued to grow and grow, and it's had a really amazing impact. People are really, really recognizing the video that I put out, I'm just -- people are putting out their testimonials constantly and it's really growing like wildfire, especially in these minority communities, which is what I love to see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    {
      "speaker": "STRAKA",
      "utterance": "It's a combination of all of those things because we see and we hear these stories every day about violence, vandalism, incredibly petty and destructive behavior. But even in people's personal lives. I mean, people are being cut off by their siblings, they're being cut off by their best friends just for saying, \"Look, I support the President.\" They are losing their jobs. I mean, it's crazy."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

I mean, the President's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as well as a Cabinet member's boat, as well as Cabinet members being thrown out of restaurants and the Press Secretary being thrown out of grocery stores. I mean, I've had my own issue with being basically thrown off a set and out a building."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRAKA",
      "utterance": "Well, that's exactly what I was going to say. I mean, we have gone beyond anti-Trump. It's blatantly anti-American -- and sort of like Charlie Kirk was saying a moment ago, too. I mean, for eight years, conservatives stood by as they watched the erosion of American ideals under the Obama administration. We didn't see anything like this. And I can actually say, I was a liberal at that time. I was a Obama supporter. And I am here to tell you, I did not see people on the right behaving this way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And what is it that you saw on the left that caused you, you are a liberal, you are gay, talk to me, why? And to step out because a lot of people who stepped out, they get in a lot of trouble with the left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRAKA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that the left has done a really successful job in pushing this narrative of victimhood and oppressors. For many of us on the left, myself included, we bought into it. So it was like, I became a liberal because I was against racism and judging ..."

      "utterance": "We are all against racism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRAKA",
      "utterance": "Right. But I didn't know that. The common idea is that people on the right hate -- they are white people who hate black people. They hate Hispanic people. They hate gay people, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. This is what we hear over and over again. But for me, when the light bulb really started to go on in my head was when I started to say, \"Hey, I'm o over here because I'm against all of these things, but you guys hate white people. You guys hate straight people. You guys hate men. You know, so in my mind, these things aren't any better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But that's what I talked about in my open tonight, you know, Sarah Jeong, the woman from the New York Times, and the New York Times dug their heels in, and they said, \"We're keeping her.\" She heaves at the police. She hates whites. She hates men. And her excuse and the \"Times\" bought it as well. I feel like I have been harassed."

      "speaker": "STRAKA",
      "utterance": "This is how liberal ideology sort of gets ingrained in our culture. It's through the media. It's through the entertainment industry, and it's through our education system and what happened with the New York Times is just tacit approval from them saying, this is okay. I mean, Roseanne lost her show -- lost her show. But the New York Times is standing by this woman who by the way, these tweets go back to 2013. This is more than five years of virulently racist tweets. And they are standing by her because what they say is, \"Well, she is an Asian-American woman,\" so by default, she is a victim of racism in this country. And so, the white people that she has made these tweets about, they deserve it because ..."
