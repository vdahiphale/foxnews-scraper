I understand that, but that's, that's who he is. That's vastly different from say, another candidate who might get in from a business background that's been more on the right, which would take away. For instance, in 92, you had pro that I think pretty much skewed a little bit more to the right in terms of who he took from than the left. In this case, I definitely think he would take a lot more front from the Democrats and help the Republicans. But the second thing that I think is also missing in this is that when you look at the numbers very raw, as you did, which is how many people are registered? It looks -- it looks like Independents are up there. But when you actually break down Independents, which is something that we did extensively at the RNC. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We've assigned a voter score to every single voter.

Some may have been undercover. Two of them are reportedly critical. No word on the conditions of the others but we saw video of one officer who was conscious being taken away on a gurney and at least one officer was taken away by a life flight helicopter, all of the injured police officers have been taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital, which is a level one trauma center. As for the suspects, the numbers are still in flux. The mayor says one is confirmed down. There are reports one or two are dead and two others are still inside the residence. Their status has not been released. And SWAT teams are now on scene, which is not necessarily an indication that a standoff is underway but there are numerous reports that at least one suspect has barricaded inside and a neighbor just called into a local TV station saying that he can hear police trying to negotiate with people inside. The police presence, as you imagine, is immense. We are talking Houston P.D., the Harris County Sheriff's Department and the Department of Public Safety and Texas Governor Greg Abbott is allocating any needed resources.

Perhaps there are some other groups that maybe you could say this about more accurately at this point, but that wasn't what the conversation was about. It was about Hispanics in this country. But I think the point is that, unfortunately, just the ability to have a conversation about the importance of assimilation ends up in this sort of, you know, backlash that forces him to go on with these mea culpas over and over again on Twitter which I think just said something kind of sad about where we are as a nation and our ability to have conversations.",

And despite the clip that you played about him trying to portray himself as a centrist, he's been a huge supporter of liberal causes for decades. That's fine. He supported Hillary Clinton. That's fine, I mean, I -- this what makes the country great. But you can't then turn it around and start to call yourself a centrist up the middle. So, him, getting in would definitely be helpful to us as Republicans because no matter what he wants to call himself, he has a long record -- track record of supporting progressive causes and candidates that would really help us. So, I'm -- I am as of this moment going to become a big Starbucks man."

The numbers really look like 39 percent Independent about that. 34 percent Democrat, 25 percent Republicans. So, I mean, it's pretty clear that, that Independents have grown and people having a party affiliation has shrunk a bit in recent years. Does that create a different dynamic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "No, and again, two things that I need to go back on. One is, as I said, all Independents aren't created equal. You've got folks on the right and folks on the left that come in and just don't align with a party. That doesn't necessarily make them all the same, right? So, in this case, he's coming into this race basically as a progressive Democrat that just doesn't want to go through their system. I understand that, but that's, that's who he is. That's vastly different from say, another candidate who might get in from a business background that's been more on the right, which would take away. For instance, in 92, you had pro that I think pretty much skewed a little bit more to the right in terms of who he took from than the left. In this case, I definitely think he would take a lot more front from the Democrats and help the Republicans. But the second thing that I think is also missing in this is that when you look at the numbers very raw, as you did, which is how many people are registered? It looks -- it looks like Independents are up there. But when you actually break down Independents, which is something that we did extensively at the RNC. We've assigned a voter score to every single voter. You find that there's a lot of people who may not want to call themselves a Republican or a Democrat, but they have voted pretty much their lifetime as a Republican or a Democrat, they just don't like the label. So, when you really drill down on most voters, they may not want to call themselves or align with a particular party. But they are truly not Independents that gets weight its election. Generally speaking, they align with a party the majority of time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, so to this question about, \"Who are we?\" that Kamala Harris' posed, David Frum writes this about how Democrats win in the Atlantic. He said, \"You want the candidate with the broadest possible appeal, not the most sectarian. Trump will be beaten not by his fiercest enemies, but by his softest supporters. You want to appeal to them, detach them. Not chatter on social media about how you'd like to punch their kids in the face.\" Well, the reference to the Covington High School story there. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "I'm not a big fan of David Frum, but he's kind of right. Look, the Democrats did really well last cycle. You got to give it to them. But if you look at where they won in these Trump districts, in my state of Virginia, they picked up a handful of seats. And it was those folks that ran to the middle that talked about areas where they could be more fiscally conservative that talked about national security. Then, we're able to make a competitive case against the Republican incumbent in many -- in many instances. That's where I think they win. And the funny part is that they succeeded throughout so many House districts by running that strategy, and yet, the lesson that many of their presidential candidates are taking is instead of going more to the center and talking exactly like that, they're pivoting to the left and going to the extreme. So, it's ironic that they actually did well this past election in so many areas of the country."

But when you take a look at what Schultz is saying, and I don't know, you know, time will tell and voters will decide if he's that person I think anybody who would run as sort of a third party candidate would have to be so charismatic and have such a strong identity that they were able to potentially do that. But what he's saying is look, these folks are way too far to the left. And these folks who are on the right who aren't satisfied with President Trump are potentially people that you could peel off as Frum says, the softest supporters. So he is looking to build a constituency in that crowd."

      "speaker": "SPICER",

I mean, they kind of happen every decade or so. But the reality is I'm not one of these people that like Mike Bloomberg and everyone who dismisses them out of hand in terms of their ability to potentially win. Look, Donald Trump, best in 17 amazing candidates, blew through the system when no one gave him a chance. So, we are living in a world now where there are larger-than-life personalities that can do stuff. Schultz's background as a successful CEO, definitely, and he's got -- you know, billions of dollars. So, he can self-finance this thing. I don't think -- I think, he is a credible candidate. Don't get me wrong. I just think that his past history of doing this doesn't allow him to go after that right-leaning folks. They might -- he might be charismatic. But at the end of the day, they're going to say you're a progressive."

And I -- and she has done a great job of energizing those folks. That speaks volumes. When you look, and you mentioned it earlier. I mean, this is like they're going from the Olympic sized pool to -- I don't know what because you've gotten now 30-40 plus candidates that are jumping in. For her to have that degree of enthusiasm, I think portends well for her.  And I think people are excited about her. She's clearly tapped into something. So, as these other candidates on the left, look at what they're going to do to announce or be different than whatever. Now, they've got to realize that she's kind of set the bar for other candidates going forward. But she's done so -- she's -- she shown that you got to have that combination of charisma, excitement, commitment to the extreme left."

      "speaker": "EVAN BAYH, FORMER SENATOR",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple of things, Martha, I do think it tends to be the middle where elections are won and lost. And I think many Americans out there are now crying for practical problem- solving rather than ideology left, left or right. They want people who will actually move the country forward in practical terms. But in the primaries, particularly presidential primaries, a lot of the energy enthusiasm early on tends to be on the extremes of the two parties.  So, I'm a little worried about my own party -- you know, going too far left. I just still don't think even with the changes in the country that if we're perceived as being sort of a socialist pacifist party, that's the way to win a general election. And so, I'm hopeful that at the end of the day, the Democrats will come down to a choice there will be a candidate to the left, no question about it. But there might be a more centrist alternative, progressive, but not too progressive that would be more electable in the fall."

And I think that's partly because, despite the media caricature of Trump as some extremist or radical, he actually has pretty centrist policies that were appealing to a lot of people who were formerly voting democratic or more independent. On the Democratic side, there was a basically a freak out when he announced that he was thinking about running. Because the party is having this issue of being so far to the left or being needing to be so far to the left to win a Democratic primary that it can alienate other voters. But that shows how Schultz can serve a function by running. If he -- if by being a centrist out there who's an attractive option for people who aren't as radical as the base of the Democratic Party, it might serve the function of pulling the Democratic Party a little bit more moderate from its radical direction that it's going right now."

You'll have 10 or more candidates appealing to that far left element. And they'll get a lot of the headlines because of some of these proposals are -- you know, a little bit out there. But at the end of the day, I think a lot of Democratic voters are going to come back to OK that maybe -- you know, dreamland. But we got to get real here. Who could not only win this election? But at the end of the day, who can govern? I'm still hopeful if that's how things will work out. But Martha, you know, a fair amount if you're a Democrat, a fair amount of caution is an order twice in my lifetime my party has carried one state in a presidential election.

We're going to get a statement from the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, when we come back. Plus, now that the government is back open, can Republicans really expect Democrats to come through on their end of the deal, an immigration compromise which has been discussed that the president could sign? One of those Democrats who has suggested that there's room for compromise joins me next."

This is the hospital where five officers are confirmed to have been struck and transported according to the statement from law enforcement there this evening. According to this statement from Governor Abbott, a horrific attack on our police officers is a solemn reminder of the service and sacrifice our brave men and women in law enforcement make every day to keep us safe. The city of Houston and the Houston Police Department will have whatever state resources they need to bring swift justice to those involved. So five officers wounded and we will continue to give you updates on that throughout the course of THE STORY tonight. So who is winning the shutdown in border wall battle that now has three weeks to be determined and decided before a potential next shutdown? We've got some brand-new polls from Public Opinion Strategies which was commissioned by Brad Parscale the President's 2020 campaign manager. They spoke to 800 voters in ten districts that Trump won but are currently held by Democrats in Congress. They found that more voters than not approved of the President's job performance. 54 percent supporting his policies, 61 percent of them supporting his position on border security, 53 percent say they want to build a wall. These numbers are different, you know, than the national numbers that we see but this is a drill down on these ten districts that are Democrats which Trump won in 2016. So the average approval score for Democrats in Congress in these districts ranged between 20 and 35 percent. Half of them thought that Democrats should have taken the President's deal exchanging DACA for border wall funding. California Congresswoman Katie Hill is a Democrat and member of the House Oversight Committee. She was also elected to be the freshman co- representative to leadership.

So I think we've got this great group of appropriators who are meeting in conference. I think their first meeting is on Wednesday to really drill down and from everything I know that if you if you let appropriators do their work, then they're going to come to a good deal so I'm excited to see how that plays out."

I want your thoughts on what you saw in this new set of polls. As I said they were commissioned by Trump 2020 by Brad Parscale, the campaign manager but they were done by a couple of pollsters who worked for Bush and who worked for Mitt Romney, an outside group. What do you make of these numbers?"

    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that the most important numbers are the ones that you pointed out showing that you know, that there's a you know, a solid ten-point advantage that President Trump has in terms of wanting to build some sort of physical barrier. And -- but the thing that must be even more troubling for Democrats or at least Democratic leadership in the House is the fact that when you drill down and you realize the more that voters learn about the proposals that President Trump is putting forward, the more they like it. And the reason these districts are so vitally important is because as you point out these are districts that Trump -- Donald -- President Trump won but are now represented by Democrats in the House. And you know, as you know, the House is designed to be the closest body to the people. Those people representing those districts, they don't have the luxury that Nancy Pelosi and leadership in the House of Representatives have for getting into these partisan fights over stuff. What matter is the sensible stuff and the sensible argument that's been made over the last several months about this is all about border security. And Donald Trump is the one who's forced that issue to the forefront."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, we heard a lot from these national polls about how the whole shutdown was bad for President Trump and it was good for Nancy Pelosi. And on a national level when they look at those polls, that may be true. But when you drill down on these messages as you say, which are probably one of the most interesting things here, that the move towards President Trump was from 27 to 33 after the messaging came across that the border will improve security. During that same time, that same messaging sent Nancy Pelosi down four points from 28 to 24. Quick last thought here, Charlie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes. And of course, it's not just in these districts. If you take the partisanship and all of the squalling back and forth that we hear, you know, in terms of politics, if you take that out, I think that those policies that President Trump was talking about with building some kind of barrier, securing the border, the popularity of that cuts across Democrat, Republican, it's -- those are very generally popular positions and that's why Donald Trump not only won the Republican primary but then went on to win the general election in 2016."

That's what you always say, sure, we'll talk, but I don't see Roger Stone going the way of George Papadopoulos or Michael Flynn who finally threw in the towel and copped a plea. Stone is a different kind of an animal and he should take this to trial because a false statement charge is exceedingly difficult for prosecution to prove because the statute said the false statement has to be knowingly and willfully made.

It's unclear how many open fired on police but a neighbor heard more than a dozen rounds fired and Houston P.D. has confirmed, as you said, that five officers have been shot. Some may have been undercover. Two of them are reportedly critical. No word on the conditions of the others but we saw video of one officer who was conscious being taken away on a gurney and at least one officer was taken away by a life flight helicopter, all of the injured police officers have been taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital, which is a level one trauma center. As for the suspects, the numbers are still in flux. The mayor says one is confirmed down. There are reports one or two are dead and two others are still inside the residence. Their status has not been released. And SWAT teams are now on scene, which is not necessarily an indication that a standoff is underway but there are numerous reports that at least one suspect has barricaded inside and a neighbor just called into a local TV station saying that he can hear police trying to negotiate with people inside. The police presence, as you imagine, is immense. We are talking Houston P.D., the Harris County Sheriff's Department and the Department of Public Safety and Texas Governor Greg Abbott is allocating any needed resources. Clearly, you can see from the video the scene remains active and very dangerous. We will continue to bring you breaking news updates as we get more.

According to Pew Research and all the others that study the 45 million Latinos in this country, they are assimilating at a rate that's faster than any other ethnic group in our history. The first crew in from whether Mexico or Central America or where from so ever, they come in and they are obviously Spanish language dominant. The survey show that by the second generation however, the children are English-speaking dominant, the majority of them, and by the third generation they have to go to night school to learn Spanish and get a B because they don't speak Spanish anymore."

But you have to be blind, Martha, not to look in Texas or in Florida or in California or indeed in New York and Chicago, in Orlando and not see a culture that is assimilating -- that is blending with the fabric of the American society in a way that is very traditional and has accelerated by the pervasiveness of the media. Hispanics are becoming, you know, part and parcel of the nation in a way that is very, very impressive. They are adding to the gross national product. They are becoming Ph.D.'s, and so forth. And I think for Tom to make that statement, and I really don't think that it was made maliciously. I think it may have been based -- well, I can't be his shrink and tell you why he said it. All I can say is that it's the kind of throwaway statement that offends a lot of people unnecessarily.

Perhaps there are some other groups that maybe you could say this about more accurately at this point, but that wasn't what the conversation was about. It was about Hispanics in this country. But I think the point is that, unfortunately, just the ability to have a conversation about the importance of assimilation ends up in this sort of, you know, backlash that forces him to go on with these mea culpas over and over again on Twitter which I think just said something kind of sad about where we are as a nation and our ability to have conversations."

It was very -- they had failed two Senate votes on Thursday. Everybody, you know. So, we had folks from NASA there. We had the coast guardsmen there. We had, you know, people from all the different federal agencies that have been furloughed and unpaid for more than a month. So, I thought it would be a nice thing to, you know, buy them a beer and tell them that we still love them and they support them and then the news came, you know, it's almost like the president was listening.

She makes a lot of statements for someone who hasn't actually been here to see what is going on. I think if she would come here, she could see for herself what's going on and make a decision."
