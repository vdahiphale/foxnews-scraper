That we have to raise the debt ceiling is understandable. But where things stand, where the numbers are, is outrageous. Is there no end? And how sharp is that line going to go up? One more way to punish our children and grandchildren is what we're doing now. And now we get this outrageous notion, excuse my parochialism about forgiving all this student loan debt. Sorry, folks, you signed up for this to get your education, to get your degree, and you got to pay it back. It was an obligation freely accepted. Now, I will admit a lot of these institutions of higher education are in the rip-off business. But you did this knowingly. This can't happen. We can't add another $1 trillion because of forgiveness of loans and debts that were freely incurred by students for their own benefit.",

In terms of how hard they are pushing it, I think there is more push for it from progressives on Capitol Hill, from Senator Warren and other colleagues of hers. And they have appealed to the White House to go through with it. It was part of President Biden's campaign promises when he was running for office last year. But, and to your second point, I think that the White House's answer to concern about debt is that it's on their radar, but they would probably come back with a political answer and say that the Republicans weren't concerned about it during the last administration with the tax cuts, and so that shouldn't prevent Democrats now from going through with their policy priorities as well.",

They are not getting better. That's been one of Manchin's red lines. And then also that new CBO score that showed the honest accounting of the Build Back Better agenda, which is closer to $5 trillion rather than the $2 trillion that Democrats have been saying. Those have been the two big issues for Joe Manchin all along, and it's hard to see how he walks back some of those comments. Now, I think he's reluctant to be the guy who says no, I'm calling it off before Christmas.

The president made his decision to go with vaccine mandates earlier this fall when he decided that he needed to use more of a stick instead of a carrot approach to getting people to get vaccinated.

Its' very sad to see that vigil, 800,000 people, and we got these drugs coming out, fine. The average age last time I looked of someone who died from COVID was 68, not five to 11.

We as families and individuals can't do it.\" Nick, I do it all the time. Democrats and Republicans, it's just that lawmakers haven't cared about that for recent years. We will see if they do. Kristen asks, \"Whatever happened to the Border Patrol agents and horsewhip drama?\" Great question. We asked. The DHS Inspector General decided not to investigate. It then went to the Office of Professional Responsibility, seemed to die there. We don't know. The Border Patrol, president of the Border Patrol union says horseback agents, all of them in question, are still on duty, and we have seen them on the border with our crews there. Here is a good one from Dan. \"Bret, do you have any ideas for a new book?\" Yes, I do, Dan, it's in the works. I just can't tell you right now. Up next, Ann asks \"favorite Christmas song?\" That's \"White Christmas\" by Bing Crosby. Finally, Mike asks \"Good afternoon, Bret. Having worked very closely with former FOX NEWS SUNDAY host Chris Wallace, what was your reaction to Chris's decision this past Sunday to leave FOX News?\" Well, I was surprised with everybody else here. I wish Chris the best. I worked with him 18 of my 24-and-a-half years here. Had a great time, and I wish him the best in his next adventure. I am hosting FOX NEWS SUNDAY this weekend, so check your local listings. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.

Obviously, there is still a concern about unvaccinated, but there is a measure of also concern about these mandates and how they're affecting different aspects, as you take another look at that video of the vigil up on Capitol Hill."

      "utterance": "Yes, Bret, the vaccines, the mandates in particular, as you say, have certainly become controversial and have been very political. I think that you won't see this White House giving up on that stance even though they have been challenged in the courts. I think they are going to continue to go forward with that. The president made his decision to go with vaccine mandates earlier this fall when he decided that he needed to use more of a stick instead of a carrot approach to getting people to get vaccinated. But it has certainly been something that Republicans, in particular, have pushed back on, and it's become a political liability at least to some extent for this president."

Thousands of nurses have left the industry or lost their jobs rather than get vaccinated. As of September, 30 percent of workers at more than 2,000 hospitals across the country surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were unvaccinated.\" We saw what Amtrak did, saying you can get tested, not vaccinated, in order to keep labor so the trains could say keep running."

      "utterance": "Yes, Amtrak, Joe Biden's former mode of transportation. Yes, that's the price of coercion. This seems to be the default position of this administration and the governors. When things are falling apart, and things really are falling apart for them, more coercion, more forced vaccination, more compulsion. And now we have the children. So five to 11-year-olds. Its' very sad to see that vigil, 800,000 people, and we got these drugs coming out, fine. The average age last time I looked of someone who died from COVID was 68, not five to 11. Let's stop using these kids in this experimental way when the risks are so small. But that's their default position. When things are going badly, just more coercion, more vaccination mandates, and thus the price that's being paid."

      "utterance": "I love the bird tweeting. Finally tonight, it is time for Tuesday Tweets. First from Nick. \"I'd love for to ask politicians on both sides of the aisle why if we have to balance our finances at home, why can't Congress. We keep borrowing and borrowing. We as families and individuals can't do it.\" Nick, I do it all the time. Democrats and Republicans, it's just that lawmakers haven't cared about that for recent years. We will see if they do. Kristen asks, \"Whatever happened to the Border Patrol agents and horsewhip drama?\" Great question. We asked. The DHS Inspector General decided not to investigate. It then went to the Office of Professional Responsibility, seemed to die there. We don't know. The Border Patrol, president of the Border Patrol union says horseback agents, all of them in question, are still on duty, and we have seen them on the border with our crews there. Here is a good one from Dan. \"Bret, do you have any ideas for a new book?\" Yes, I do, Dan, it's in the works. I just can't tell you right now. Up next, Ann asks \"favorite Christmas song?\" That's \"White Christmas\" by Bing Crosby. Finally, Mike asks \"Good afternoon, Bret. Having worked very closely with former FOX NEWS SUNDAY host Chris Wallace, what was your reaction to Chris's decision this past Sunday to leave FOX News?\" Well, I was surprised with everybody else here. I wish Chris the best. I worked with him 18 of my 24-and-a-half years here. Had a great time, and I wish him the best in his next adventure. I am hosting FOX NEWS SUNDAY this weekend, so check your local listings. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That is it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. \"FOX NEWS PRIMETIME\" hosted by Will Cain starts right now early, because I took time yesterday."
