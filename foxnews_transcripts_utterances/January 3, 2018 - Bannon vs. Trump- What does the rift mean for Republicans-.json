Tonight, President Trump fighting back against Steve Bannon saying his former chief White House strategist has, quote, lost his mind. It all comes ahead of the release of a new book in which Bannon is reportedly quoted calling the 2016 Trump Tower-Russia meeting treasonous among other slides. This afternoon, Mr. Trump discrediting his former advisor in a lengthy statement, quote, Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency, when he was fired he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, doesn't represent my base.He's only in it for himself. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue when he helped write phony books.

One of the things President Bush called me into the Oval Office and said was, I hear you're upset about this book, but I don't want you to worry about it. And I said, well, can I throw him under the bus first? He said now, I want you to try to forgive him. He said believe me, no one is going to think about this in three weeks. That could be true here except for two things. One I think that is positive for Republicans in the long term and one thing that could be trouble ahead. One is that the severing of ties between President Trump and Steve Bannon is more good it's actually probably good for continued cooperation for the type of accomplishments that Greg was alluding to especially on the legislative side of things, because if you don't have the constant pushing against Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan from Bannon, then you actually allow them to work together and be able to accomplish things. And you probably don't have to worry about Steve Bannon trying to primary all of those incumbent senators that he wanted to do. The thing I think that was eye-opening about the excerpt that Greg is referring to that Michael Wolf writes about is that in one of the quotes Steve Bannon talks about that the issue here really isn't anything that has to do in 2016, it was before 2016 and it's about money laundering. And he talked specifically about Jared Kushner. And that to me was the one that I was like, I'd pay attention to that. In the president's statement, he doesn't address any of the claims. He just calls him a staffer, which is a real burn. And I remember Matt Lauer asked President Bush when his book came out, why didn't you write about Scott McClelland in your book? And President Bush said because I didn't think it was relevant. And that's the way that you try to sort of push these things out of the spotlight. This will be a story for a couple days and we'll finally move on.

Tonight, President Trump fighting back against Steve Bannon saying his former chief White House strategist has, quote, lost his mind. It all comes ahead of the release of a new book in which Bannon is reportedly quoted calling the 2016 Trump Tower-Russia meeting treasonous among other slides. This afternoon, Mr. Trump discrediting his former advisor in a lengthy statement, quote, Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency, when he was fired he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, doesn't represent my base.He's only in it for himself. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue when he helped write phony books. The White House is unfazed by the latest developments. Sarah Sanders says this has no effect on the president, his agenda and his base."

He's continuing to fight for it and push for that agenda. And I think the base is extremely excited and happy with the job that this president has done in his first year in office.

And is now doing a damn decent job. I mean, I'm sorry. But we've gone through some of these accomplishment."

If you think about George Stephanopoulos when his book came out during the Clinton administration, it was a really big deal. And he was basically cut off from them for a really long time with advisors like James Carville and Paul Begala, basically saying you are dead to us. Scott McClellan during the Bush administration wrote the book -- I was press secretary at the time."

      "utterance": "And Scott had hired me. I was super upset about it because I knew Washington loves a story. Americans dig into it. One of the things President Bush called me into the Oval Office and said was, I hear you're upset about this book, but I don't want you to worry about it. And I said, well, can I throw him under the bus first? He said now, I want you to try to forgive him. He said believe me, no one is going to think about this in three weeks. That could be true here except for two things. One I think that is positive for Republicans in the long term and one thing that could be trouble ahead. One is that the severing of ties between President Trump and Steve Bannon is more good it's actually probably good for continued cooperation for the type of accomplishments that Greg was alluding to especially on the legislative side of things, because if you don't have the constant pushing against Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan from Bannon, then you actually allow them to work together and be able to accomplish things. And you probably don't have to worry about Steve Bannon trying to primary all of those incumbent senators that he wanted to do. The thing I think that was eye-opening about the excerpt that Greg is referring to that Michael Wolf writes about is that in one of the quotes Steve Bannon talks about that the issue here really isn't anything that has to do in 2016, it was before 2016 and it's about money laundering. And he talked specifically about Jared Kushner. And that to me was the one that I was like, I'd pay attention to that. In the president's statement, he doesn't address any of the claims. He just calls him a staffer, which is a real burn. And I remember Matt Lauer asked President Bush when his book came out, why didn't you write about Scott McClelland in your book? And President Bush said because I didn't think it was relevant. And that's the way that you try to sort of push these things out of the spotlight. This will be a story for a couple days and we'll finally move on. But that piece that I've talked about the money laundering one was eye-opening."

There's three big lies, Trump didn't want to win, Melania cried when Trump win, and Kellyanne Conway didn't think they were going to win. I know those are all lies. And then, you have Bannon saying that this whole meeting at Trump Tower was treasonous. And then on 60 Minutes, two months ago, he said the collusion thing was a farce. I don't know what to think this guy Wolf has a terrible reputation in his own industry. People say he is a gun for hire.

How dare he? I mean, what he did to Donald Trump Jr., I mean, that's one thing. I think that the best defense for Donald Trump Jr. in that infamous meeting at the White House, not being nefarious, is that he was so naive there was no lawyer there. So inexperience, he's so overeager, overenthusiastic. To me, that's his best defense for Donald Jr. that he didn't intend to collude with Russians in any way that was illegal anyway.

The Washington Post, the New York Times, every investigative reporter in this nation has been striving to connect Donald Trump with that meeting with the Russians and has failed to do so. So now, here's Steve Bannon suggesting you can take it to the bank. Zero possibility it did not happen. To me, that is -- and this is the guy who was his best friend for at least those few months?"

The aggressive journalism and aggressive policing are actually resents due in part to what I call the PTW effect, prove Trump wrong effect. For years, Fox News railed against media bias. Does the media care? Not really. The last few years we've covered Chicago's problems. Did Rahm Emanuel listen at all? No. he's slammed chick-fil-a instead. Now we're seeing the media adjust its behavior over accusations of fake news, and now a city mayor under a president who isn't his best friend puts more cops on the streets. My theory, bureaucrats and media hates Trumps so much that they can't let him win the argument, so they up their game just to shut the guy up.

He's using it, I think, effectively, diplomatically, on the international stage, as it relates to national security, whether it's immigration, it's taxes. It's his approach. It worked for him during the campaign, so he's doing it still."

They should take it in stride a little bit and just go, \"OK, fine.\" And Mitt Romney, by the way, he may have lost the presidential election, but he's a winner. I mean, you know, this is somebody that actually, I believe honestly, can serve Utah very well; and this is somebody who didn't go around and cry like a baby after and write \"What Happened?\" and do a whole big you know, book like blaming everybody for everything when she just didn't campaign that hard. And it wasn't about Trump. It was like she was not a very good candidate. You know, he worked ten times harder than she did. Everybody knows it. Her staff knows it. President Obama knows it. They put themselves out on the line for her, and she disappointed a lot of people that worked very hard and gave a lot of money to support her.

When you're asking does she really believe it, she doesn't believe it, but she can't allow herself to admit it because of the confirmation bias. She cannot admit that all of that emotional input that she's held for so long could be wrong. And this happens to everybody. If you hated Obama for eight years, and then you find -- and you look back and you find out maybe there were a few things that he did bad, can you actually -- do well, can you admit that, because you held onto this? So which is -- it's the confirmation bias. And Ana Navarro, I -- you know, she is smart, but her confirmation bias and the cognitive dissonance has turned her into a one-note wonder. She can't stop."
