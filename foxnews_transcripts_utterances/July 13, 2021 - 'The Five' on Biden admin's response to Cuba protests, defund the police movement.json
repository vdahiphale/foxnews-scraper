Not good enough. But I do think this White House learned a little bit about supporting dissidents and freedom movements after what happened with Iran and the green movement. We didn't do anything during the Obama administration and they took a lot of heat for that, and actually never, I don't think they ever really got over that. So, I think that they finally got there.

I think we have been forceful, we've been allies to them, we are saying we support you in your, you know, your cause, your desire for freedom, to live free of an authoritarian, and authoritarians come in many packages.

And it's one thing to read about the stories in history books, but if you sit down with those Cuban-Americans that are in the United States right now and they tell you the broken promises, they believed it, and it broke them. And they came to America as a result.

You tell the gangs, just like they want them to turn in in the guns, you've got a week to clean up your actions, and then you start buzzing down doors. You get warrants, you make sure the assailant you have one judge that is assigned to these cases to look at the evidence presented, they know who the gangs are.

Because the reason why they couldn't admit there was a crime problem is because then they did have to admit that they were wrong. It's a huge, huge sunk cost when you spend so much time saying that this doesn't happen. They put so much investment in an anti-cop narrative that they can't now admit that it was wrong. But there is a reason why they do this, and it happens in every political situation. They only choose the situation based on what Republicans do. So, if Republicans come out as pro-law enforcement, they instinctively come out as anti-law enforcement. So, if you come as a Republican, talk about freedom in Cuba, then they talk about freedom as a phrase being antigovernment.

I was lucky enough to hear them speak a few years ago where they talked policy in the work of the Carter Center, but I was most taken by their open talk about their marriage and what keeps them going strong after decades and decades.

Not good enough. But I do think this White House learned a little bit about supporting dissidents and freedom movements after what happened with Iran and the green movement. We didn't do anything during the Obama administration and they took a lot of heat for that, and actually never, I don't think they ever really got over that. So, I think that they finally got there.

You just had an assassination in Haiti, you've got China making aggressive moves in, you know, all over the place. You've got Russia in ransomware, which is basically cyber warfare, and now we have this Cuba stuff. But our press is doing other trench reporting in the culture war.

I obviously haven't been a press secretary myself but the statement that the Biden White House put out this morning, Tony Blinken also commented on this to make sure that everyone knew because the Cuban government is saying that the U.S. is fomenting this, that we have no role whatsoever in causing this uprising, and it is their people that are upset with how the regime works. I think we have been forceful, we've been allies to them, we are saying we support you in your, you know, your cause, your desire for freedom, to live free of an authoritarian, and authoritarians come in many packages. They come in communist packages and they come in Putin-like packages now. They come in packages like an Assad. And so, I don't really see a problem with calling them that."

When I was on the campaign trail, I spent a lot of time in Florida. And it was very clear that the Latino vote was shifting because of the socialism mess. And it's one thing to read about the stories in history books, but if you sit down with those Cuban-Americans that are in the United States right now and they tell you the broken promises, they believed it, and it broke them. And they came to America as a result. And so, I think what was tone-deaf is that the president and the press secretary didn't really speak to that audience and say, we hear you, we hear the people that are on the street, and we know the cause of that. That's why the word matters."

And I would say it goes back, you know, two, three weeks is actually when the polling started dripped in to say this is the problem which is when we have a press conference on gun control and what's going on in our cities. I thought it was a good day for the White House on this, for sure. I think Eric Adams is certainly, you know, taking advantage of the new bully pulpit that he will get in November, we are going to elect a Democrat here. I liked the show of, you know, that we had, there was a female police chief standing there with him, who also spoke.

Second of all, this is a local matter, this is not a federal issue that attempt to federalize this issue is a problem. He knows what to do. It's very simple. And I call it just a simple justice plan. You bring the D.A.s in, you bring the beat cops in, the police chief, you bring in the chief judge, you assign a judge to these cases, and you give them a week. You tell the gangs, just like they want them to turn in in the guns, you've got a week to clean up your actions, and then you start buzzing down doors. You get warrants, you make sure the assailant you have one judge that is assigned to these cases to look at the evidence presented, they know who the gangs are. The problem is you have the D.A.s that are allowing people with these weapons charges back on the streets. You've got judges that are assigning bail when people are a risk to society. So, everybody needs to get on the same page right here. You can talk about root causes all day, but that doesn't solve the problem right now.

They're shooting in the street? i went out to a restaurant, I didn't see any crime! Idiots. Because the reason why they couldn't admit there was a crime problem is because then they did have to admit that they were wrong. It's a huge, huge sunk cost when you spend so much time saying that this doesn't happen. They put so much investment in an anti-cop narrative that they can't now admit that it was wrong. But there is a reason why they do this, and it happens in every political situation. They only choose the situation based on what Republicans do. So, if Republicans come out as pro-law enforcement, they instinctively come out as anti-law enforcement. So, if you come as a Republican, talk about freedom in Cuba, then they talk about freedom as a phrase being antigovernment. So, you see what's happening here, it's a really stupid professional wrestling type of debate, but they can't let go. And that's what's happening right now. You are seeing them try to let go.

Stray bullets are killing innocent people and Democrat D.A.s, prosecutors, and judges are making it impossible to incarcerate these people, as you mentioned. I get it. I'm a realist. There is going to be street violence in the inner city. But we don't have to be so permissive about it. Every time we are so permissive about crime, crime explodes and people died. Joe Biden used to get this. That was his thing. And now because the left wing animates his base so much, he has now to walk this tight rope. He knows the solution. He won't address the problem. Trump, love him or hate him, he would actually say what the problem was in really stark terms. People loved him for that, but they also hated him for that. But that's what real leaders do.

Oh, there you go. Now we don't see the outtakes. We don't see the outtakes, but you know good video, good trick, good stunt. Well done."

Now, he said a 15-year-old caught the viral moment. This is what he said. When I saw the lightning bolt, my first instinct was to run. I slipped on the wet floor and was just happy I caught myself. I was just glad the lightning hit the ball instead of me."

OK, so it was a big weekend for former President Jimmy Carter and former First Lady Rosalynn Carter as they celebrated 75 years of marriage with a party for 300 that included the Clintons, Nancy Pelosi, Garth Brooks, and Trisha Yearwood, alongside civil rights icons, and everyday Georgians. I was lucky enough to hear them speak a few years ago where they talked policy in the work of the Carter Center, but I was most taken by their open talk about their marriage and what keeps them going strong after decades and decades. It was mutual respect and partnership. So, whatever your politics, I think we can all raise a proverbial glass to these two."
