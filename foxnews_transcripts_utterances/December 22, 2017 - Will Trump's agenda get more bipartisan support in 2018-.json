And so I would like to see a statement from the president saying that Russia should come -- should get out of eastern Ukraine, that Russia should not have taken Crimea, and that the U.S. will not tolerate expansionism by Russia in Europe, and that the U.S. is going to stand with its NATO allies in preventing that.

Why the spotlight may be shifting to Hillary Clinton. Stay tuned."

This week, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe went before two House committees behind closed doors for official grillings over the Russia probe. But it's the FBI's handing of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal that is suddenly coming into sharp focus. Congressman Matt Gaetz joins us from Florida with new information about his Judiciary Committee meeting with McCabe yesterday. Welcome, Congressman. So, what happened behind closed doors and what are you allowed to say to us?"

      "utterance": "Well, Jesse, this is the first in what will be a series of confidential interviews that we'll be having with key witnesses that have front row seats of the exoneration of Hillary Clinton, which seems to depart from the standard practices and procedures. So, I can't share with you the specific questions or answers. I can share with you my reactions to them. I can tell you three things that have been confirmed for me. First, Hillary Clinton absolutely got special treatment. Her process departed from the standard process most Americans would face. Second, she received that special treatment because she was a candidate for president. No other reason. Third thing, that we absolutely know there were people in the highest levels of this government that were doing everything possible to make sure that Hillary Clinton didn't face consequences. Some of those very people have now migrated over to the Mueller probe and persecuting the president of the United States without a valid basis. That's why the work we're doing in the Judiciary Committee is so important."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right. That's very interesting. So, we all know that Hillary got special treatment from the tarmac meeting to riding an exonerating letter before exonerating her to softening the language to take out the criminality to -- I mean, she went in for an interview and wasn't under oath. So, we know that happened. At this point, what are you going to do about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, we have to change the laws so that this can never happen again. We have also got to find out whether or not some of the bribes paid to the Clinton Foundation are actively disrupting the policies and priorities of the United States on a going forward basis. Until we have a thorough investigation of the potential bribes that the Clinton Foundation took and then the actions that fell as a consequence of those bribes, I fear that we won't truly know the depth of the corruption in the last administration. But we've got the change the laws so that never again can we have a circumstance where someone gets special treatment because of their political status or because they're a candidate for high office. That is not the blind lady justice that we promised the American people in this country under our constitution, Jesse."

      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, for five months now, Jesse, over 20 members of the Judiciary Committee have been calling for a second special counsel to investigate the Clinton Foundation, the e-mail server and the entire handling of that process. But what is so troubling to me is that the attorney general has been sitting on his hands despite the fact that we've had these calls for a second special counsel. The attorney general hasn't done it. It's just a double standard when you have the special counsel that has a limitless budget, limitless authority persecuting the president and we are not looking at the real crimes from the real criminals."

Did you ask about that?"

I don't know if you know about it, but it looks like James Baker, who was the top lawyer in the FBI, was just reassigned. Turns out, they found out he had contact with this left-wing outfit, Mother Jones and David Korn (ph). Two weeks later, they break the dossier story. It seems really suspicious."

I believe that Mr. Baker is a witness because he's a witness, I think he's very well may be one of the next people called before one of these committees conducting a fact-based investigation. Because certainly, we have had at the very highest levels of the FBI and the Department of Justice a number of contaminating events that erode the American people's confidence in these institutions."

Democrats still think the ongoing Russia investigation could be their ace in the hole against the president next year, but it could boomerang on them. A Wall Street Journal poll released shows the public is souring on Mueller. His positive rating has inched up from 24 to 28 percent since June. His negative numbers jumped from 11 to 21 percent in the same period. And no wonder, with all the bitter anti-Trump bias revealed among Mueller's top investigators and key players at the FBI and Justice Department. Some Democrats are stuck in utter denial."

Let's examine that with political analyst and former Secret Service agent, Dan Bongino, in Palm City, Florida, and in Washington, former Ohio State Senate Minority Leader Capri Cafaro. All right, Dan, this is just Republicans working the refs. You know, when a coach yells at officials and then next time they maybe get a better call.

You had a man at the top in Jim Comey who admitted to initiating, trying to start this special counsel by leaking information to the press. You had number two, Andy McCabe, whose wife was running as a Democrat in the state of Virginia and taking money from the Clintons. You had a number two in charge of the investigation, Peter Strzok, talking with his mistress about the insurance policy in case Donald Trump is elected. Let's get this straight. We're not supposed to ask questions about any of that? That's only in the liberal bizarre fantasy land. In the real world, you are darn right we're going to ask questions and we are right to do so."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

Certainly we want to make sure that the Russia investigation is done and the American public deserves answers in a fair manner about that issue, about what happened in the 2016 election. Ultimately the Democrats, the way that we win, is when we turn people out actually as we have done in some of the more recent elections in 2017.

But the real flash point is likely to be the brewing confrontation with North Korea over its nuclear ambitions. On that score Trump got a big win at the U.N. today and celebrated with this tweet, quote, \"The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional sanctions on North Korea. The world wants peace, not death.\" But the administration's critics just can't handle the sight of the U.S. reasserting itself on the world stage such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's rightful capital."

Let's bring in our guests, Jim Hanson of the Center for Security Policy and former State Department official David Tafuri. Jim, I want to just start with the sanctions that we just slapped on North Korea, cuts fuel imports by about 90 percent, forces about 100,000 North Korean workers who are working in other countries to return back, that really dries up their hard currency, and then it tightens up North Korean shipping inspections. China and Russia went along with that. Is that tough enough?"

So President Trump said you have one chance to do this. Russia, stop dealing on the black market with them. China, stop propping them up, and let's see if there's any chance at all that diplomacy and sanctions will stop him from his nuclear ambitions. If it doesn't, the world now knows that President Trump means what he says and there will be consequences, consequences that will leave parts of North Korea as smoking rubble."

On the Jerusalem thing, it's right to criticize her tactics a little bit. Of course the U.S. has every right to move its embassy if it wants to do that, but that wasn't a positive thing with respect to advancing the peace process between Israel and Palestine. And I wish the president had a plan for that, and I wish Nikki Haley was talking about that rather than just moving our embassy. That would be more productive."

      "utterance": "He's got a plan, and it's already in play. And the big change has been the new crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, is going to will be an ally in this as opposed to an obstacle. So the first step he took was saying we're going to stop this delusion that hasn't helped anyone any time of pretending the capital of Israel is not Jerusalem, and we're going to put our embassy where it belongs, sending a reality check to the Palestinians and to everyone who has been helping them obstruct peace for all of these years. So that was a great start to these negotiations, and the plan will follow on from there."

      "utterance": "And David, another new development this week, which was pretty interesting, I think the president wants to send lethal arms to our ally in Ukraine, something the Obama administration never wanted to do for our ally. They just wanted to send food. That's pretty tough when it comes to confronting Russia. Trump is a big Russia puppet. Why is he acting so tough on Russia all of a sudden?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFURI",
      "utterance": "Jesse, I couldn't agree with you more. This is a very substantial development and I applaud the Trump administration for finally doing this. There's a lot of dissonance in the Trump policy towards Russia and towards Ukraine. Remember, it was the Trump campaign that pushed for changing the Republican platform in July at the Republican convention, and they removed the provision for arming the Ukrainians from the platform. So now he's reversed that, and that's a positive. But there's very little else that he's done to take a stance against Russia. He still seems to support Putin and Russia at every chance that he has. And so I would like to see a statement from the president saying that Russia should come -- should get out of eastern Ukraine, that Russia should not have taken Crimea, and that the U.S. will not tolerate expansionism by Russia in Europe, and that the U.S. is going to stand with its NATO allies in preventing that. We haven't heard that from President Trump. But I agree with you, this change is welcome."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Sure, now, listen, I agree with you somewhat, but to say that Trump has been soft on Russia. He sent about 50 tomahawks missiles into Russia's friend's backyard when he nailed Bashar Assad for the chemical weapons violation. And not the other proxy, Iran, the nuke deal is in the crosshairs. So I don't think he's been really that soft on Russia. Jim, why don't you take it from here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFURI",
      "utterance": "He hasn't done anything else in Syria to take a stance against Russia. In fact he's moved towards Russia's policy in Syria. He's pulled back support for the moderate forces that are fighting against Russia, Iran, and Assad."

      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "I think when President Trump managed to go ahead and, as you mentioned, take out a Russian airfield in Syria while ordering chocolate cake with the Chinese president, that sent a pretty good message. And right now what we need is a way to get to peace. If he's got to make a deal with the Russians to make that happen, good. Better that than more fighting."

It airs at 8:00 p.m. eastern right here on FNC. Plus I'll be hosting Fox News' \"All American New Year's\" special, doing the big countdown to 2018 on New Year's Eve. Kennedy is going to be my partner in crime. And that's all the time we have for tonight. Thanks for watching this \"Ingraham Angle\" special. From all of us here, have a very merry Christmas.
