      "sentences": "All right and good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham thanks for joining us, this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Let's get right to our top story breaking news out of the Department of Justice about a possible special counsel investigation targeting Hillary Clinton. In a letter obtained by Fox News, we've learned that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is directing prosecutors to take a closer look at the 2010 sale of Uranium One to a Russian-backed company and the Clinton Foundation's alleged unlawful involvement in it. Clinton's alleged donations to the Clinton Foundation amounted to a quid pro quo for Hillary's State Department to sign off on a transaction which gave Russia control of about 20 percent of America's uranium capacity. And according to a letter from DOJ to the House Judiciary Committee, the attorney general is open now to the possibility of appointing a special counsel to look into the matter and other matters related to the Clintons. And news comes ahead of Mr. Session's highly anticipated testimony tomorrow before the House Judiciary Committee. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now, exclusively for reaction are two House Republicans who want a special counsel to investigate Mrs. Clinton, Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida. Welcome to the show gentlemen. You guys wrote an op-ed and you asked Jeff Sessions to move forward on a special counsel, Congressman Jordan are they listening. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This is the way that I look at it. I lived in the former Soviet Union as a student. And I have two Russian sons who I adopted. I'm fascinated by the Russian psyche. One thing about the Russians is their pride. They have a lot of pride in Russian history, and everything they have been through. So I bet Vladimir Putin, when you see him trying to talk to Trump, he kept trying to talk to him, Trump is doing small talk, but I think they, like China in many ways, they want to be shown some respect.

      "utterance": "All right and good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham thanks for joining us, this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Let's get right to our top story breaking news out of the Department of Justice about a possible special counsel investigation targeting Hillary Clinton. In a letter obtained by Fox News, we've learned that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is directing prosecutors to take a closer look at the 2010 sale of Uranium One to a Russian-backed company and the Clinton Foundation's alleged unlawful involvement in it. Clinton's alleged donations to the Clinton Foundation amounted to a quid pro quo for Hillary's State Department to sign off on a transaction which gave Russia control of about 20 percent of America's uranium capacity. And according to a letter from DOJ to the House Judiciary Committee, the attorney general is open now to the possibility of appointing a special counsel to look into the matter and other matters related to the Clintons. And news comes ahead of Mr. Session's highly anticipated testimony tomorrow before the House Judiciary Committee. Joining us now, exclusively for reaction are two House Republicans who want a special counsel to investigate Mrs. Clinton, Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida. Welcome to the show gentlemen. You guys wrote an op-ed and you asked Jeff Sessions to move forward on a special counsel, Congressman Jordan are they listening."

We sent a letter on July 27th outlining why we think it's warranted. We met with Attorney General Sessions and Justice Department staff on September 28th, so far we've got nothing but it's amazing, today we do an op-ed and suddenly the Department of Justice has had a come to Jesus moment and now there's going to be a special counsel, at least they're talking about a special counsel. That's exactly what has to happen when you think about how the things we've learned and how serious they are; the American people want answers, we want to give them those answers, we think a special counsel's the way to go."

What among those many things and again our viewers heads are swirling, what are the most concerning elements of those given what you both know already about this?"

      "utterance": "So many of these scandals link back to the Clinton Foundation and it highlights that the American people are tired of this double standard where there's one set of rules for the Clintons and another set of rules for everyone else. Now we're six months into this investigation of President Trump and his team and Russia; they found nothing. But look at the treasure trove of information that continues to be found out about the Clinton Foundation functioning essentially as a money laundering operation for the Uranium One deal and that really ought to concern us. Our uranium assets are precious, we're an importer of uranium it's crazy to give Russia this access to our uranium assets, but you have the very people that are now investigating President Trump involved in approving this deal and then silencing the witness who was ready to tell us that bribes and kickbacks were contributing to undermining America's interests. It's crazy, we need a special counsel to go after the Clinton Foundation and Robert Mueller and Rod Rosenstein are way to conflicted to proceed against the president."

      "utterance": "Yes we don't know how far that goes. What we do know is stuff you brought up, Laura, James Comey called the Clinton investigation a matter not an investigation. James Comey began drafting the exoneration letter prior to interviewing Secretary Clinton before the investigation was over. When he ultimately gets fired, which he should have been a long time ago, but when he's fired what does he do? Leaks a government document through a friend to The New York Times and what was his goal? He told us under oath, to create momentum for a special counsel and who does that special counsel have to be? His best friend, his predecessor, his mentor, Bob Mueller who was the guy who was conflicted in this whole Uranium One deal. So when all those facts come out -- not to mention the dossier -- when all this comes out we're saying if this doesn't warrant a special counsel, what the heck does? That's all we said and finally today they finally decide oh there's an op-ed today, maybe we better answer Congress who three and a half months ago sent us a letter demanding it clear back then."

This does go to National Security, the integrity of the justice system, the credibility of Jim Comey and how he handled this investigation from the beginning, when I heard he wasn't present; unless something's changed he was not present when Hillary Clinton was interviewed. How can he not present? How do they have no notes of that; no transcript of her testimony? It happened on a Saturday I believe if my memory serves me correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well it's absolutely ludicrous that James Comey made the decision to start drafting and exoneration letter before interviewing witnesses and before interviewing Hillary Clinton herself. Your question is why did it take so long and why tonight do we have on the eve of Jeff Session's testimony before the judiciary committee a statement that they're open to a special counsel rather than what Jim and I would like which is via appointment of a special counsel. It all goes back to the Clinton Foundation, Jeff Session's in his testimony to the senate said he was recused on any matter that had any nexus to the Clinton foundation. There was no legal obligation for Jeff Session's to say that or do that, but he did. There's no way to investigate the Uranium One deal without looking into the Clinton foundation filling out deposit slips with millions of dollars in donations from the Russians. So that appears to be the challenge, the nexus and we certainly cannot leave to Mr. Rosenstein the question of appointing this special counsel because it's Rosenstein's name on the signature block, stealing from Congress and the American people; the very testimony of the informant ready to tell us about the bribes and the kicker."

Someone leaks that the CNN, who leaked that? Who leaked that to CNN and did that become the thing the legitimatized the (DCA) so much that the press can then turn it, which CNN did and thus we can print the entire (DCA) itself, so those are the kind of questions, we haven't even got really to the (DCA) but if a Clinton financed, Democrat National Committee financed (OPO) research was turned into an intelligence document and if that was the basis for the Visa Court giving a warrant to spy on American's associated with the Trump campaign. If all that happened, if our government polluted with a major party and a major campaign to go after the other campaign, in this country, you are not supposed to come anywhere near that, if that, now we don't know if it did but there's a lot of evidence pointing in that direction, read Byron York's piece, today or yesterday's piece outlined a lot.

The democrats just want to take Trump out, they want to redo the election, and they want to show everybody that they were right, we never should have elected them and then republicans just want to go after the Clinton's.

We're now less than a month away from Alabama's special senate election where Judge Moore will appear as the Republican party's candidate. The Republicans are certainly in a bun and today's Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, called on Moore to step aside. The worst case scenario for the GOP would be for the Democrats to take advantage of the turmoil and actually win the seat in deep red Alabama. And even if Moore wins, it's increasingly likely that the Senate will either refuse to seat him or expel him soon after he's sworn in. Today the New York Times reported that the White House officials are actually considering scenarios where Attorney General Jefferson Sessions would return to his old job in the Senate. Joining me now for a reaction and try to sort all this out is Harmeet Dhillon, a Republican strategist and civil rights attorney. Chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner. This Gloria Allred press conference today doesn't really surprise me. I can't believe it took her this long to bring an accuser forward, but the facts didn't sound good.

And if indeed these charges are true, it's very unlikely that it was done once and never again. So I think you're likely to see more, but the Republican party is in a terrible mess here.

We also have Bob Riley, the former two-term governor very popular of Alabama who I bet you could convince to throw his hat into the ring on this and he's very well thought of.

It's great to see both of you thank you so much. And with sexual harassment and assault scandals rocking some of the top names in Hollywood, in media, now politics even some on the left are turning their attention back to Bill Clinton who's been dogged by sexual assault allegations for years. For example today on the liberal Atlantic Magazine's website, this is shocking; an article reads in part \"Feminists saved the 42nd president of the United States in the 1990s. They were on the wrong side of history; is it finally time to make things right?\" Joining us now for reaction from Arkansas is one of Bill Clinton's accusers, Juanita Broaddrick who claims that Bill Clinton raped her and she joins us now.

So here point is interesting because she said look no one believed me, no one believed me all those years ago and now it looks like because it's so obvious the double standard when it comes to the left versus the right that I think some on the left are now saying maybe we should have given her a little more credence.

And I don't care if it's a democrat, a republican or someone who's not well known at all. And this has got to change. This whole situation has got to change.

Data is now showing that the U.S. government issued nearly 30,000 visas to people from countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism between 2007 and 2016, again, all through that a lottery. This is not good. It doesn't take a genius to say that. And joining now for reaction here in Washington is Michael Starr Hopkins, a Democratic strategist, and Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. It's a group that advocates for stricter controls on immigration. Gentleman, it is great to see both of you. Michael, what is going on here? I mean, we have a lot of problems in our country. We have a lot of problems with gang violence, and some crime. Some crime has gone down, but we still have a big struggle with drugs and so forth. And now we are bringing in people on this lottery system. It is kind of like affirmative action for visas I think because we have to solve diversity. Diversity, we need diversity, but it turns out we are bringing in a lot of people from countries where we really can't really vet people being very well. Are you in favor of that?"

And then those people have their own spouses, those spouses have their own relatives, and it goes on and on and on. And what the lottery does is it starts new migration chains.

Those immigrants when on welfare. The Bloomberg administration said wait a minute, they sent them a bill, and they said you guys are on the hook for this. A lot of people paid. They collected several million dollars, and then the de Blasio administration came in and mailed the money back to those people. It doesn't work because it is not going to be enforced."

Joining us now for reaction, from L.A. is Roger Simon, the cofounder of PJ Media, and here in Washington Mike Warren, a senior writer at The Weekly Standard. All right, Michael, let's start with you. This is the way that I look at it. I lived in the former Soviet Union as a student. And I have two Russian sons who I adopted. I'm fascinated by the Russian psyche. One thing about the Russians is their pride. They have a lot of pride in Russian history, and everything they have been through. So I bet Vladimir Putin, when you see him trying to talk to Trump, he kept trying to talk to him, Trump is doing small talk, but I think they, like China in many ways, they want to be shown some respect. Is it a bad thing for the United States not to try to engage with Russia where we can engage and actually maybe accomplish something?"

      "speaker": "MICHAEL WARREN, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think anybody is seriously saying that we shouldn't engage with Russia. It is a big country. It's got a lot of natural resources. It has that permanent veto power on the U.N. Security Council. That being said, I think it is important to be clear about not just Russia but Vladimir Putin in particular and his designs for his own -- you mentioned pride. He also has designs to be a major power in some areas where the United States has its own interest. And a lot of times those interests conflict or really actually come in contact with each other. Take the Middle East for instance. That is a place where I think you go back to the Obama administration. They made a mistake I think in not getting involved."

    {
      "speaker": "WARREN",
      "utterance": "They wanted to reset. And what they ended up doing in, for instance, the Middle East, is they didn't engage in Syria, they allowed the Russians, who, again, are allies with Iran and Bashar al-Assad, to really take it control. Now they are in charge of that region where the United States is no longer a player."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Roger, when I think of all that hear about Russia, we can't do this, we can't do that, I always say, OK, now apply that analysis to China. China is building islands in the South China Sea. China is stealing our intellectual property. China stole 50 million personnel background check files from the Office of Personnel Management. China is forever hacking into our systems. China has terrible human rights violations, and they have a 2025 plan to dominate most major industries. But we have no problem having constant dialogue with China and wanting to work with China doing joint ventures with China. China, China, China is good, Russia, Russia, Russia bad."

But the other interesting thing and here is where I differ in nuance, and I hate the word, with Mike is that I think that a lot of the Russia stuff that has been going on since the beginning of the election has sort of distorted things to such a degree the public can't deal with Russia and Trump has been undercut continually in the ability to try to deal with them. And he is being called a softie. But who was more soft than Obama when he whispered to Medvedev that tell Putin I will be fine after the election? If Trump had done that, he would be impeached and beheaded. It's ridiculous."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Why does Kasich think his voice is wanted in the current political environment? He is still governor of Ohio, but he has zero constituency in the party in the grassroots. And remember, he wouldn't even attend the Republican convention in his home state. I don't know if Kasich felt like he was just too humiliating to show his face in Cleveland. And don't you hate a sore loser? Even Detroit Mayor Coleman Young welcomed the GOP to the city of Detroit in 1980, and he was a Democrat. And though Kasich is a total washout nationally, let's face it, it's uncharitable to say but he is, he's considering running in 2020 on something called a unity ticket with Democrat governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado. That'll work. In his commentary, you can hear Kasich's simmering disdain for the party that so roundly rejected him, and his contempt for President Trump is now legendary. Perhaps, I was thinking back on this, I think it's one debate moment perhaps from October of 2015 that really stuck in his craw. Let's watch."

John Kasich can go on all the Sunday shows he likes and reporters will continue to celebrate him as the uber, coolest never-Trumper of them all. But after all the bluster and the photo shoots and the camera time and the greenroom time, John Kasich is where he was at the end of the primary season. He's a man with enormous ambition and just minimal support, just a little bit. We may not know where Kasich is headed, but boy do we know where he came from. Do you remember what his father did?"

In their \"Man of the Year\" edition, \"Gentlemen's Quarterly\" has named Colin Kaepernick Citizen of the Year. The man who started the NFL kneeling epidemic during the National Anthem, the man who inspired his fellow players to break faith with their audience, the man who is responsible for the league losing millions in merchandising and tickets and viewers, is being hailed by a men's fashion magazine as an exemplary citizen. If you are looking for exemplary citizens, I have a few. How about Stephen Willeford, the Texas man who confronted and pursued that church shooter in Sutherland Springs. Or how about Houston Texans star J.J. Watt. He raised $37 million for hurricane Harvey victims. By the way, \"GQ\" also named Stephen Colbert the bad hombre of the year. I suppose if you hate President Trump, stage protests, and complain, you are instantly something of the year at \"GQ.\" The good news is Kaepernick and Colbert made our year end cut as well. Not sure if they are going to be celebrating this honor though. And that's the Angle. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team is up next.
