That's a long time. But I have a feeling you'll be back. I don't know if I could put him in the same position, though. He's not quite as strong on those tariffs as we want him."

Gary Cohn is advocating for her, but so are senior people on Capitol Hill. She's definitely in the mix. But there's others as well. We've reported Kevin Walsh who is in the running for Fed chair, he's a name that Trump is talking about. But he is still spent falling."
