There was no collusion in it, much less treason. It wasn't much of anything actually, it was disappointing.

There are many of those, or they could double down on a weekend and demand that Robert Mueller come testify before Congress. As you know, they chose the latter. Mueller himself did not want to participate in any of this. He didn't see the point of it, but Democrats insisted. And so this Wednesday, Mueller shuffled up to Capitol Hill.

You remember when the First Step Act was being debated, we were all told that only nonviolent criminals would be the beneficiaries of the law. Some like Senator Mike Lee of Utah told us that the Bill would not provide early release to criminals, only incentivize participation in so-called recidivism reduction programs. But that turned out to be completely untrue. In less than a year, the First Step Act has granted early release to a lot of dangerous people and it didn't require any of them to do anything to earn it. Here's one example. In October 2008, Okin White participated in the robbery -- an armed robbery -- of a Brooklyn apartment. During that robbery, White and his accomplices tied up two children including a seven-year-old girl. They pistol whipped a woman and threatened to kill her and her entire family if she didn't reveal where the cash and the drugs were hidden. Every victim of that robbery had be hospitalized; one, for more than a week. Now, White would still be in prison right now where he deserves to be, but thanks to the First Step Act, he was released last week. Here's the key. He didn't join any recidivism reduction program. Instead, since the Bill retroactively increased his good behavior credits, his sentence was simply shortened. White didn't have to do anything. He is out of Federal Prison now along with hundreds of other people like him convicted of sex crimes, robbery, assault, and other acts of violence. Remember, these are the nonviolent marijuana users who are getting out early. Right? It's not true, but Washington doesn't care. For them, crime is an abstraction. They don't have to live with the consequences. So, it's not a big deal.

Ninety five percent of the homeless in New York are now living in shelters, and we don't see the same kind of diseases. Wake up, Los Angeles.

They are never going to get rich putting up with the garbage they put up with and I'll tell you what, in the Giuliani administration, here was the rule, Tucker, if someone threw a rock or a bucket at a cop, you got arrested. The second guy who throws a bucket or a rock at a cop, they get arrested. There was no third guy. The example have already been set. No one else wanted to go to jail. With de Blasio, it's lectures about how he has to give his son a special lecture about the police because they're all racist or something. He is a disgrace to humankind and our gene code.

But eventually other people did read it or skim it and those people let our trusted television journalist know that actually Mueller's report really didn't say very much. There was no collusion in it, much less treason. It wasn't much of anything actually, it was disappointing. So, at that point, the media and their masters in the Democratic Party had a choice to make, they could have moved on and started worrying about America's actual problems. There are many of those, or they could double down on a weekend and demand that Robert Mueller come testify before Congress. As you know, they chose the latter. Mueller himself did not want to participate in any of this. He didn't see the point of it, but Democrats insisted. And so this Wednesday, Mueller shuffled up to Capitol Hill. Democrats prodded him like a zoo animal hoping that he would transform suddenly into Clarence Darrow and deliver an epic speech denouncing Trump as a traitor to our nation and a war criminal. But he didn't do that. So, California's Ted Lieu pushed him. Lieu tried to make Mueller explain that even though he did not indict Donald Trump, Trump should still be in prison."

But it's also unnerving because adult political parties must exist in tangible reality. The Democratic Party no longer does. For two years, they have accused anyone who has ever read a Tolstoy novel of being a Russian agent, and they mean it. Stacey Abrams announced that she is the real governor of Georgia after losing by 50,000 votes. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told us recently that border enforcement is actually a plot to build Nazi death camps in America, and so on. These are not minor figures in the Democratic Party. These are its leaders. What's going to happen when these people get to run the country? Buck Sexton is the host of \"The Buck Sexton Show,\" a frequent guest on our show, and we're always glad to have him. Buck, just let's -- I've been dismissing these claims as absurd. But I just want to run them by you, just as a fact check. Is there any evidence that the Russians are controlling Robert Mueller? BUCK SEXTON, HOST, \"THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW\": No, absolutely not. But let's remember that there have been former very senior members of the Intelligence Committee where I used to work as a C.I.A. analyst. There have been people who have come out, former directors, who have also indicated that without any evidence, by the way, without evidence, like the journalists like to say about some things, maybe someone got to Donald Trump, they have something on him. He is a Russian asset. He's a traitor. There's nothing that is too extreme for them to say in this regard, and yet they never provide any evidence. It used to be, \"Oh, once the Mueller report comes out, then we'll see this elusive evidence.\" Now it's \"Well, Mueller didn't get it. But the gum shoes in Congress are somehow going to find this stuff out just in time for the election.\" Look, Tucker, it's just bad faith at this point. It's been bad faith all along, and if someone believes that Trump is controlled by the Russians, they're either very cynical or not very smart."

I don't think that the hosts on those networks could say, \"You know, maybe we got this mostly, if not entirely wrong all along.\" So, they have to double down and play into this. But let's also remember that the big reveal this week was that Bob Mueller was not in fact, running this investigation, he was not -- the paragon of virtue that Bob Mueller supposed to be was used as a front. He was essentially a cover story for a whole bunch of people that everyone knew all along working on the Mueller probe, were effectively Democrat pro-Hillary operatives with law degrees. But we were told, \"Don't worry about it. Bob Mueller would never let them run wild. This couldn't be a political vendetta.\" Well, Mueller was just a figurehead. It was a political vendetta, and now I think they're talking even crazier than they usually do, Tucker, on this stuff, because they just want to change the subject at some level. And let's also note that when Eric Swalwell said, I know the day that he dropped out was the saddest day in American history for point 0.0001 percent of Democratic primary voters, but now that he said that maybe somebody in the Russian government or maybe the Russian Intelligence Services could affect votes, just by planting that seed, there will be nutcases on the left with major platforms -- and I'm sure some who are elected to office, who when Trump wins, as I think he will -- not to jinx anything in 2020, they'll make that claim just based on Swalwell's wild speculation on television, but that's kind of been the M.O. the whole time for the Democrats with the Mueller probe."

If you made different human decisions, you would get a different result. And so if you see a result, if you see a resulting end product that seems to encode a bias of one sort or another, there must have been that bias in the process that produced the end result, because like I say, you know, different human decisions that went into the process would produce completely different results."

      "speaker": "COPPOLA",

In fact, in my experience, you know, as algorithms get more complicated and more advanced, they only have -- that only means that they have more human decisions going into them.

For example, after last month's Democratic debates, Tulsi Gabbard, the Congresswoman from Hawaii, was the single most searched candidate and she well deserved to be. She was the only one on stage saying anything interesting or sane. All of that extra attention was a great opportunity to buy ads for her campaign, but Google wouldn't let her. For several critical hours, Tulsi Gabbard was blocked from buying new ads on Google. Now, Gabbard is suing Google. She is accusing them of deliberately censoring her ads and sending her campaign's e-mails to the SPAM folder at a much higher rate. Is that true? We can't say for sure, it certainly sounds true. And given what we already know about Google, it is definitely possible. We hope Gabbard's lawsuit is able to find the truth and of course, we'll be keeping you abreast of what it does find. We want to bring you a Fox News Alert, the Supreme Court has just handed the Trump administration a major victory tonight in its fight to build a wall along our southern border. Last February, you'll remember, the President declared an emergency along our southern border and sought to use money allocated for Defense to build barriers -- the border wall. The lower court blocked him from spending the money though. Well, now in a decision released tonight, the Supreme Court overturned that lower court ruling and the administration will have access to about two and a half billion dollars of Pentagon funds. A final ruling has not yet been issued, but the administration can now begin wall construction before the litigation finishes. President tweeted in response quote, \"Wow. Big victory on the wall. The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows southern border wall to proceed. Big win for border security and the rule of law.\" We will continue to follow the story, of course. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is finally getting the attention she deserves for her radical views from her mysterious past and her obvious duplicity. Now a new report says there could be real drama in her personal life. Trace Gallagher has that story for us, next. Plus, the White House plans to execute five criminals, Democrats are outraged.

She religiously married Ahmed Hirsi in 2002, had two children, then religiously divorced him back in 2008. They got back to together in 2012, had another child, but didn't legally get married until last year. When asked about the latest separation, Ahmed Hirsi her see said quote, \"Wow, I can't comment on that. I'm sorry. I just can't say anything.\" Then of course there's the controversy surrounding her other marriage. In 2009, she legally and religiously married Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. Both PJ Media investigative reporter David Steinberg and Judicial Watch claim they have significant evidence to prove that Ahmed Nur Said Elmi is actually Ilhan Omar's brother and she married him as a sham to get him into the country. Fox cannot confirm these reports, but we can confirm that Ilhan Omar was found to have violated campaign finance laws by filing a joint tax return with Ahmed Hirsi when she was still legally married to somebody else -- Tucker."

      "utterance": "Byzantine. Trace Gallagher, thanks so much. Well, thanks to the recently passed the First Step Act, more than 3,000 criminals have been released early from Federal Prison. You remember when the First Step Act was being debated, we were all told that only nonviolent criminals would be the beneficiaries of the law. Some like Senator Mike Lee of Utah told us that the Bill would not provide early release to criminals, only incentivize participation in so-called recidivism reduction programs. But that turned out to be completely untrue. In less than a year, the First Step Act has granted early release to a lot of dangerous people and it didn't require any of them to do anything to earn it. Here's one example. In October 2008, Okin White participated in the robbery -- an armed robbery -- of a Brooklyn apartment. During that robbery, White and his accomplices tied up two children including a seven-year-old girl. They pistol whipped a woman and threatened to kill her and her entire family if she didn't reveal where the cash and the drugs were hidden. Every victim of that robbery had be hospitalized; one, for more than a week. Now, White would still be in prison right now where he deserves to be, but thanks to the First Step Act, he was released last week. Here's the key. He didn't join any recidivism reduction program. Instead, since the Bill retroactively increased his good behavior credits, his sentence was simply shortened. White didn't have to do anything. He is out of Federal Prison now along with hundreds of other people like him convicted of sex crimes, robbery, assault, and other acts of violence. Remember, these are the nonviolent marijuana users who are getting out early. Right? It's not true, but Washington doesn't care. For them, crime is an abstraction. They don't have to live with the consequences. So, it's not a big deal. They can feel virtuous, your neighborhood gets more dangerous. Senator Tom Cotton represents Arkansas. He was one of the most vocal opponents of this law last year and he joins us tonight. Senator, are you surprised?"

I don't think that everybody who commits a crime should spend the rest of his life in prison and I believe in rehabilitation. What I'm infuriated by is they told us that the people getting out early would be sent to recidivism reduction classes, in other words, they would be rehabilitated. And in a lot of cases, as the one we just described, they haven't been. They've just been released early. They lied to us."

So, when they leave prison as everyone does, if they're not sentenced to death or life without parole, they become a productive member of society. But it was always the case that thousands of serious felons were going to be released early if that Bill passed. I said it at the time, and it's come to pass now."

His hands have been largely tied, though on these releases up until now. But just look at what Attorney General Barr did this week in signing execution warrants for five heinous murderers. One, who murdered an eight- year-old girl and her parents just a few miles up the road from where I grew up in Arkansas. It gives you a sense of where Attorney General Barr's mind is when it comes to criminal justice; that he wants to make sure that we are protecting the vulnerable among us in our communities."

Now that we know that the law isn't working the way they told us it was going to work, have any of those people come up to you and said, \"You know, I was wrong. I'm sorry.\" COTTON; No, Tucker, not many people in Washington, which is a town of a lot of folks who make confident predictions that don't come to pass have come up and said, \"Yes, you told us so.\" And I don't take pleasure in saying, \"I told you so.\" You know what has come to pass is what I predicted that thousands of serious and oftentimes violent felons will be released. To my knowledge, none of them have committed a crime yet. I said at the time that given recidivism rates, especially if they don't go through any kind of anti- recidivism training, they're likely to commit crimes in the future. I hope I'm wrong in that prediction. But with the thousands of serious felons release early, I fear that I won't be."

We're going to start seeing Bubonic Plague. Now, we can treat it with antibiotics, which we couldn't do in the Middle Ages, but you've to first know somebody has it, and you have to first be able to get the antibiotics to them, which is the point I've been making, which is as long as 60,000 people are living on the streets of Los Angeles, we can't treat their mental health issues.

Here we are back in Middle Ages type situation. And let me tell you how we can fix that. I worked in the Bellevue Emergency Room in the 80s and the 90s, and you know what we did? We used to have a diagnosis found on street, living in cardboard box, came in for three squares in a blanket. These patients came in with infections. They were dehydrated, they were malnourished. What we did? We built shelters in New York. Now, New York, of course, is another Democratic stronghold, but two Republican Mayors were behind the expansion of shelters. Ninety five percent of the homeless in New York are now living in shelters, and we don't see the same kind of diseases. Wake up, Los Angeles. You have a Democratic Mayor that's waving his hands saying, \"Here's another garbage truck. Here's a shower I'm sending out to one of these streets.\" We need to get the homeless off the streets or we're never going to be able to treat these problems, and they're going to burgeon the neighborhoods next to them."

The Navy has admitted that its pilots encounter unidentified aircraft so often that they've had to draft new reporting guidelines to allow pilots to come forward. It's easy to find this funny, but it's also scary if you think about it. Our vast, well-funded defense establishment is seeing things in the sky they cannot account for, doing things they cannot understand. Should we be worried? Congressman Mark Walker is a Republican representing the State of North Carolina. He just sent a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, about the Military's UFO investigations.

We don't know that nuclear warheads can be attached to those. Is it something like that? Or is it something more? We don't know.

Is this something that another defense system in another country is more advanced? Or is it something else? We're not trying to spin people out, but the AATIP, which is basically a program that monitors this was to close down a 2017, so part of my question, Tucker, is it really closed down?

They are never going to get rich putting up with the garbage they put up with and I'll tell you what, in the Giuliani administration, here was the rule, Tucker, if someone threw a rock or a bucket at a cop, you got arrested. The second guy who throws a bucket or a rock at a cop, they get arrested. There was no third guy. The example have already been set. No one else wanted to go to jail. With de Blasio, it's lectures about how he has to give his son a special lecture about the police because they're all racist or something. He is a disgrace to humankind and our gene code. And this guy should resign immediately and give the cops a real leader in New York City. It's a disgrace what's happening to some of the finest men and women we have on our planet. These are great men and women, they really don't deserve this."

I mean, what's going to happen in a city of eight million people where the police are powerless even to you know, respond to this?"

      "utterance": "You're going to have the David Dinkins New York, pre-broken windows where chaos reigned, everybody jumped the turnstile. You peed in the street, you drank in the street, you beat up your buddies in the street and nobody cared because we didn't do anything about low level crimes unless you murdered someone."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Exactly."

    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "The problem, Tucker is the same guy who was peeing in the alleyway after drinking was the same guy who would have murdered someone later. That's why broken windows, policing work, but de Blasio doesn't understand any of that because he is all about making SJW -- social justice warrior tropes out there to try to raise campaign dollars to get above 0.0000 percent in his dopey presidential race. Just another embarrassment to politics."

      "utterance": "All right, well final story has been covered to death, the disaster on Capitol Hill, the Mueller implosion. What a mess. Listen, here's my quick thought on this. If Jerry Nadler who decided this was a good idea had done this -- and literally any other job in America -- he'd be walked out of the building immediately. What a mess. Jerry Nadler should have resigned after that disaster. Terrible job."
