I look like I once worked at the Sharper Image, but was fired for defiling a full support body pillow. I look like the waiter who spit in your bouillabaisse. Yes, it was only a month ago that I looked like this. And now I look like this. If that's me now, what will I look like in another month? But yet we're handling it America.

But that's the media, they can only juggle one ball at a time. They don't have blood on their hands, but they also don't have brains in their heads. But do you remember their other go-to conflict stories well before the pandemic? Always depicting America on the brink of Civil War, men versus women, black versus white, gay versus straight. Where did those stories go? Could it be they really weren't real at all? Just media concoctions meant to imagine a false disunion. It was a good business plan selling conflict. But our steadfast unity obliterates that -- for now. I'm sure at the moment, \"The New York Times\" is doing a story with these headlines, The Secret Homophobia of the Pandemic; Social Distancing: An excuse to marginalize minorities even more. Toilet Paper: Why does it have to be white? I kid, but let's not forget when a few early voices said shut down the border or noted the virus's origins they were called racist. Maybe that's died down for now. But will the things that died come back? The woke brigade have all but vanished. Perhaps this crisis exposes that uselessness of the identity obsessions, or maybe it's just mutating. Still I do miss the good old days when Twitter was littered with purple haired activists demanding an end to the tyranny of binary bathrooms. But things are changing. Look at the TV industry. Gone are the gleaming studios with airbrushed anchors. What have we replaced it with? Hosts in their kitchens like this one."

We've got the great podcaster, Dave Rubin. Great to see you, Dave. Also back again, Fox Business Network, Dagen McDowell, always good to see her there. Looking chipper as ever. On the West Coast, we have attorney and Fox News contributor Emily Compagno. Looking fit. And here as usual, we have Kat Timpf. Clearly, we've relaxed our standards. It's true even clothing giants like Walmart and Old Navy are selling tons of shirts, but not pants. Meaning everyone is Donald Ducky get which makes sense, at least for anchors. I mean, why wear pants when you're always talking out of your ass? For example, what did the media do when faced with a man doing good deeds?

Michael Lindell thrived after crack. These wimps can't even handle cracks from Trump. The media mocking Lindell are like drunk hecklers jeering a pro ball player whose sock drawer is bigger than their houses. In sum, the media sucks. They pretend they always knew more about the pandemic. Not true. They called Trump racist when he shut down travel. Not true. They defend China's phony stats. A few shouted, hey, we're number one, when America's cases of illness allegedly surpassed that country. Yes, we were number one, but each day the media it looks more like number two. But as these dopes obsessed over impeachment, I was lucky. I hated the hearings, which meant I had more time to look at other stuff.

The ultimate reality is you've got to restrict and ban travel. You've got to spend more money for testing which is what we're doing. You've got to quarantine.

Even though we're just sitting at home, eating peanut butter out of a jar and Googling the names of our exes, it is still heroic. We are risking our livelihoods so others might live and we aren't running away from the tough questions. Unlike the media who focus on what's racist today? We openly discuss how to balance the health of others with a precarious economy, knowing the media will call that insensitive even as they think the same thing. So you and I we aren't taking advantage of the calamity. This isn't survival of the fittest. It's the opposite, a countrywide pact to protect our most vulnerable citizens. We're not letting the chips fall where they may, we're trying to catch every chip. And we understand the need for optimism. Our economy is based on it. High expectations attract investments that fulfill those expectations. As long as we stay positive about this amazing economy, it can withstand anything. Because the economy is us. It's our energy, our minds. We aren't what the media paints us to be. In crisis, we don't return to our tribes. Instead, we become one. We don't need tribes. We don't even need pants.

DAVE RUBIN, HOST, \"THE RUBIN REPORT\": Well, it's completely obliterated it, but quickly, Greg very importantly, before we get to that I am complete -- I am in complete agreement with you about the pants thing. And as you can see, here in Los Angeles, we have been reduced to wearing bathing suits. It doesn't matter. That's the point, people. We're all Americans. It doesn't matter if you're wearing a bathing suit or jeans. It just doesn't matter. But Greg, yes, you are right. You are right. When things actually hit the fan, when it's suddenly -- when you suddenly have real issues to deal with, nobody cares about race. Nobody cares about sexuality or gender, or any of it.

And all of that pales in comparison to that hyper partisan throwing everyone under the bus, self-agenda forwarding mired in the details, wasting of energy and time and dollars. It all pales in comparison to life and death and the fact that we are Americans first, and this is hopefully a silver lining or a good side to what's going on. And my two cents about the pants, I will not stand up, but I know that a lot of America is sort of bummed right now because they have to be half presentable from their work from home Zoom meetings and stuff, but I've been doing this for a while because you know, I satellite into the network often. So for me, it's amazing. Like, instead of being oh, dang, I have to be half presentable. It's like this is a mystery like Dave just did. Is this a dress? Or is this a shirt? And sweats?

Speaking of old fashions, alcohol sales in America have spiked 55 percent - - tequila, gin, wine, beer all jumped compared to last year and online booze sales are up 243 percent. Good for us, I say. Just remember not to drink and drive like my neighbor's dog, Steve."

To stop -- I know that's the opposite of normally how this goes, but he compulsively cleans and organizes. And I'm someone who feels perfectly happy and comfortable just living among her own garbage. I'm fine with that. We got into a fight this morning because he was organizing my bathroom and he was totally in the way and I wanted to stand in front of the mirror. I had solid plans to stand in front of the mirror and squeeze blackheads out of my nose. And I was trying to tell him that you're in the way, he wasn't listening. He kept just asking me questions like, Kat, why is there so much trash and all your drawers? He completely ignored me. And then it was really hard for me to find one of my lotions."

More than 300,000 people have been infected. Globally, more than one million people are battling the virus and more than 64,000 have died. Turning to politics now, aides and allies of Senator Bernie Sanders are encouraging him to end his 2020 presidential campaign. That's according to \"The Washington Post.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden is now the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

He honestly has no real insight because this is the first time that we've experienced something like this. And he comes across as is often incorrect and borderline or over the line delusional.

But you know, we've all dealt with this kind of thing with a grandparent or an older relative where they start talking and you just don't know where or when it's going to end and it's sad and embarrassing at this point. You know, the Bernie thing, it's like when you see these guys now just in their sort of lonely rooms and there's nobody else there, but them, it really does have a grumpy old men feeling to it like they're just kind of yelling into a camera and praying that somebody is listening.

If someone is not actually relatable, if someone is not actually normal, we are all seeing through it. And right now, there is a zero tolerance for anything but that right now, which is why videos like Anthony Hopkins playing the piano with his cat, like when we see real, real things, real humans, then it's touching and it's beautiful and that's connective.

And then this other crew of people that have been sort of professionally pushed at us, whether they're celebrities or just, you know, the major talking heads that have, you know, a staff of 20 writers. I'm guessing Greg Gutfeld, doesn't have 20 writers, most of that stuff is coming out of Greg Gutfeld's brain and when you see these guys without their writers, without all the people to make them look pretty and tan and puff the hair and everything, it really does break the illusion.

That was weirder than any of it, right? Like I've got a tub. I'm sure I could get my hands on some pedals if I wanted to. Who was filming this? You have state of the art production equipment in your bathroom? Like address that and I think that's the difference between the ones that are cringe- worthy and the ones that aren't. It's fine to post on social media about what you're going through. I do it compulsively. But I think that you need to be self-aware enough to know, hey, most people don't have 11 mansions.

The middle aged rappers just announced their signature Whoop Dub beer, and it can be delivered right to your door. This is me after I ordered my first six pack of Punk Slap."

And can I just say that the dog, that the neighbor trained her dog to bring groceries to her other neighbor. What I thought was so simple and profound, though was that how the neighbor who was being helped said, this makes it bearable. This little act is pretty much my only connection to a living soul all day long. And she said, I look forward to it. And it's my only form of communication. And she said, the small things are what is so helpful. So I think that's something for all of us to remember, too, that it's the little acts and the little things that can really make such a big difference to those people in need right now."

I don't know anything more heroic than offering your bathroom to a truck driver, because you know her is hot. He's tired. It's a complete stranger. That's heroic. Can you top that, Kat?"

Right now, we're still working on the whole don't take a dump on the rug thing. He's hot -- the puppy is like, people can train these dogs to do things. Now, that I'm training a puppy, I have so much respect for these people. I don't even know where you begin. Like a puppy, you leave them alone for two seconds. I mean, he does this cute thing where he hoards all of his toys in one corner. We're like, oh, he is so cute. He's got all of his toys, until he peed in that corner. And he peed on all -- not one, not two, but all of them. So yes, truck stop lady, but then again, I don't know -- is she a hero? Yes. But also, that does sound like my kind of party."
