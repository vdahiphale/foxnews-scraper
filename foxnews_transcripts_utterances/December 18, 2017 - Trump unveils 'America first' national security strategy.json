In an address at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington, the president outlined a plan that includes defeating ISIS, protecting the U.S. from North Korea and securing our borders among other topics.

And also, all the cybersecurity issues that we're dealing with. The president touched on that a little bit, and I think you'll see a push in the New Year, especially when it comes to funding.

Nobody on the ground, nobody in cars below were killed, but 77 people were taken to local hospitals. They have, obviously, various degrees of injuries. This was an inaugural trip for this Amtrak train which connects Seattle to Portland. It was meant to be a high-speed train that would shave 15 minutes off of the travel between those two cities. It's a more direct route, but it also has a sharper curve here. So an NTSB investigators get on the scene, they will obviously be looking at the speed at which that train was traveling. There's also been an unconfirmed report of an obstruction on the track. Again, all the things the NTSB investigators will be looking out when they get here. In the meantime, we have a lot of equipment assembled here. The goal, once the investigators get here is to clean up this scene and get this interstate reopened as quickly as possible.

Andy grew up in a navy family. And then, as I said, Chris is one of our fearless warriors with the Navy SEALs. And it's a follow-up to Andy's first novel. \"My Father's Son\" is a behind-the-scenes look at the Special Ops community and what it takes to be part of that brotherhood and tells the story of one boy, of one family who has their world ripped apart by war. It's actually going to be preordered on Amazon, but it's out officially in March, just in time for my birthday. Congratulations.",

The president also spoke about living a greater America to our children and our grandchildren. Watch."

On January 20, 2017, I stood on the steps of the capital. To herald the day the people became the rulers of their nation again. American success is not a foregone conclusion. It must be earned and it must be won. Together we will leave our children and grandchildren a nation that is stronger, better, freer, prouder and yes, an America that is greater than ever before."

In particular, you're going to see a push about this next year and we need to talk about it more, which is military readiness and the state of our military, repairs that are needed for our planes and new planes that are needed, the new equipment. And also, all the cybersecurity issues that we're dealing with. The president touched on that a little bit, and I think you'll see a push in the New Year, especially when it comes to funding. The other thing that I like to hearing him say was that as a force for good throughout its history, America will use influence -- it's influence to advance our interests and benefit humanity, and I think that really does keeps us separate from other countries in he world. That we are exceptional for a reason and that really is the main reason."

If America is doing better economically, that means you have more money in the world and more influence and more money to pay for military readiness in order to protect the country, and also economic freedom is a part of that. Preserve peace through strength and advance American influence. If you're just reading it that way, you could say any president over the past 200 years could have had similar things."

So, it all fitted together at the end, but for me the two things that stood out the most was military readiness, which we know we have a huge problem with and that has to get fix, and the second piece being this -- saying that we will continue to be a force for good in the world, which the world needs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "But I'm OK with that. This is a central piece of his agenda. I called it the stool of security. So, it's a table with three legs. One of them is national security, dealing with our enemies and adversaries like ISIS north and North Korea. Then you have domestic security, which is basically reinvigorating the way the country feels and appreciate law enforcement because we've saw them disrespected for so long. And the third is the border, which is linked to the above. The border becomes more valuable in terms of national security when you have terrorism and you have technologies. Those are the three legs on this stool. But the big point here is, somewhere along the line is government grew we've lost the plot. What is government for, primarily? This. Without this, the stool of security, you don't have freedom or prosperity. Security and strength guarantees freedom and prosperity. The last thing, politically, is that if you don't like Trump or you just couldn't get -- you just couldn't accept him, this is a kind of agenda that makes you overlook the small stuff that bugs you. You know what I mean. I've said this before, if somebody is right on the big picture, you can forgive or overlook the smaller, more embarrassing Polaroids. You know, so what if he tweets and there's always this kind of underlying chaos and conflict. Somebody is right on the big picture, it doesn't matter. When we look back, we will realize that it didn't matter. No one will remember a lot of this stuff. But we will remember the strong military and enhanced security and no terrorism."

      "utterance": "Leaders in Washington imposed on the country an immigration policy that Americans never voted for, never asked for, and never approved. A policy where the wrong people are allowed into our country, and the right people are rejected. American citizens as usual have been left to bear the cost and to pick up the tab. A nation without borders is not a nation."

    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "I think he was trying to strike a very clean break from past administrations by saying he's here to ignite a reawakening in American confidence, and usher in a rebirth of pride and patriotism and prosperity by putting America first and putting the people above the powerful, and American greatness has to be guarded vigilantly because our destiny is not assured. And he tried to inspire all the American people to be competitive in a new competitive world, and pointed out China and Russia as other great nations that are trying to see is what we have. And then he pointed to all the litany of failures from past administrations, taxpayers bailing out other alliances, jobs being fleeced by overseas out of country, spending a lot of blood and treasure on wars where we tied. And he went along that list but then like Greg said, pointed out to the four pillars. Protect the homeland, and you just heard him. Border security, and that's the wall. That's reinforcing our great border patrol agents, and that's getting rid of things like chain migration and the visa lottery. Also, defeating ISIS and make sure they can't come over here. But then promoting peace and prosperity, and that's through cutting taxes and cutting regulations. And not signing bad trade deals where workers get hosed and big companies make out great, and then preserving peace through strength. Taking about a huge reinvestment in our military, but also focusing on modern threats like missile-defense and cyber. And then at the end, he kind of tweaked President Obama, he's trying to focus on realism, not idealism. We're not going to try to impose our way of life on other people, and we're not going to lead from behind, so we're going to champion our values, and I think he believes that's the best opportunity for us to maintain our number one posture."

      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Not at all. I certainly agree with Jesse that he was playing against, you know, grievance politics, going at all the presidents who came before, when in fact this -- I think, I think somebody else in the panel, maybe you, Dana, said it could be any other president. This is basically in keeping with our national security framework."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Yes, she said that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "But where it differs, and to me he identified it. So you've got to give him credit for that. Is that China and Russia are exerting increasing evidence that they want to increase their profile in the world globally. So to me, if you look at Asia where we backed out of the Asian trade deal, I see China stepping up, and it's not only stepping up in terms of economics but militarily. Similarly, Russia in the Middle East, given what happened in Syria but also with Iran. You see Russia playing a bigger role. So Trump identifies that, but he then doesn't say exactly how we will respond. To the contrary, he says we're going to be more focused on our interests and our security. Well, of course, he's going to focus on our security, but I don't see that we are taking the necessary steps to fight back against Russia and China's growing influence in the world. I was out at that Reagan library the other day for the national defense forum, and this is what the defense experts are saying, is that there's a lot of talk from Trump, a lot of rhetoric, but no action in terms of saying here is what our Middle East policies is going to be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "But this is -- he is reprioritizing. The number one threat isn't Russia, the number one threat isn't China, its existential terror. That's the ball that he sees. These other things are behind that ball and he will deal with them, and maybe they can help. Maybe Russia can help with terror. When you look at it from that angle, that's what happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I don't agree with you. And by the way, there was an interesting phone call over the weekend between Trump and Putin, where Putin thanked, apparently, Trump for intelligence that boarded attacks that would have taken place in St. Petersburg. But I don't think that terror is the number one issue here. If you're talking about our national security structure, I think you are talking about the possibility that terror would be generated in a place like the Middle East, especially after what he did with Jerusalem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Well, President Trump also addressed the strategic goal of the U.S., which was destroying ISIS."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We have dealt ISIS one devastating defeat after another. The correlation to defeat ISIS has now recaptured almost 100 percent of the land once held by these terrorists in Iraq and in Syria. Great job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We're now chasing them wherever they flee, and we will not let them into the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "OK. So focus now on our national security, obviously, on borders, a strong immigration policy, peace through strength. Echoes some of the comments you made earlier about former presidents, past presidents really focusing on this, kind of Reaganesque theme, and then here, using a specific example, talk extensive, ISIS."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Right. I do think that technology has advanced so much in -- just in 16 years. And one of the things that you can do is shrink ISIS's territory. You can even prevent them from getting in here. But we have shown in just the last months that we continue to have a problem with online radicalization. So, ISIS is able still to put videos online to try to figure out a way to get to people. And the president is saying, OK, the first thing we have to do as a part of America first is figure out a way to use the tools that we have been in order to prevent that from happening. He doesn't spell it all out in here, and you can't in a national security document. A lot of these stuff has to be classified. But I do think that he will have to have quite a strong push, and probably you'll see it in the state of the union, that military readiness which includes dealing with possibilities of biological terror, online terror attacks like cyberattacks. And then, you had somebody like China just to pull this all together, as that what Juan was talking about. This morning, China released a huge plan for its government to be the number one artificial intelligence creator and technology developer in the world. So they're like way ahead in terms of that type of planning, and we don't want to be playing second fiddle to that. So there's a lot that's going to happen. And I think this next year, in fact, you set the stage for how are you going to provide the resources to our military and intelligence forces in order to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Those resources, $700 billion investment, that's a historic investment in the U.S. military. And to Juan's point, I mean, he's ripped up the rules of engagement which allowed us to destroy the caliphate over there. No artificial timelines in Afghanistan. The Iran revolutionary guard is now labeled as a terrorist organization. That bad deal is also in the cross hairs. And the North Korea situation, major sanctions slapped on them. So to say that the president isn't really doing anything or hasn't really spelled out how he's doing it. Juan, you want to remain unpredictable, but I think there's a lot of leather out there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I can't remember which Sunday show, yesterday. It was pretty funny. They're interviewing some dude, some expert, and he was talking about -- beginning about how Trump had a bad year. Trump had a bad year except for ISIS. Except for ISIS. The economy is doing pretty good. (INAUDIBLE) But he had a really bad year. Yeah, except for ISIS. It's like, if all he did was ISIS, that's a pretty damn great year. But the way, we had other news today -- I don't know how true it is, but what a difference from Obama who gave a pass to Hezbollah. I'm not sure if that's true, but it's something that maybe we should look into."

He's going to fire Mueller. Let's go to the street. Who told you that? Well, the other guy on twitter told me that. This is a real boring version of the Hatfield and the McCoy's. The media and the Democrats were the Hatfield's. They just never expected the McCoy's to show up. It's always been a one-sided fight. So now they have, like, OK, you've got collusion. We yell corruption. You yell Russia. We yelled deep state. It's a lot of energy. It's like a game of tic-tac-toe that always ends in cat. It allows two sides to dig in. And I really do think this cancels each other out. Both sides has got to go like that, it's a push."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

I mean, even had Don Jr. going and testifying. And then he saw leaks right after that coming out by shifts. The whole thing to me is not coming off a very good at all because it just seems like there's a specific intended purpose to undermine the president. We're going to see what Mueller has to say. I don't think he's going to remove him whatsoever. There's nothing to hide. There is no collusion. Everyone has cooperated and testified. You're getting to the bottom of what was going on in this investigation and the unclean hands that are there. So let the truth come out, to silence it once and for all that they didn't do anything wrong."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think there's any question. I think that what this is. It's a whole propaganda campaign against Robert Mueller, against the Justice Department, against the FBI. Even as you have Trump officials like Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, like Christopher Wray, the FBI director, saying, no, these people are doing a good job. They're patriots and they're working hard to protect America. But just what we've heard last week, as the president was leaving was he said no collusion. He talks about himself, but he doesn't talk about all the aids that were involved in the campaign. And that's why I think a lot of people were, Greg, thinking, oh, something is being set up here that would allow him to justify going after Robert Mueller. But I think now we even have a spat between Fox and Friends and Hannity."

      "utterance": "Yeah. And Dana, that death toll stands at six, according to the Associated Press. A national transportation safety board go team is in route to Washington State from Washington, D.C., and we expect them to be here this afternoon and fully here by this evening. If I step out of the way, you can see that we now have a lot of large equipment, caterpillars and other equipment that will eventually be used to take those train cars off of interstate 5 here in DuPont, Washington, which is about 50 miles south of Seattle. Several of these cars jumped the tracks and fell onto vehicles that were southbound on I-5, killing six people. All those who were killed were in the train. Nobody on the ground, nobody in cars below were killed, but 77 people were taken to local hospitals. They have, obviously, various degrees of injuries. This was an inaugural trip for this Amtrak train which connects Seattle to Portland. It was meant to be a high-speed train that would shave 15 minutes off of the travel between those two cities. It's a more direct route, but it also has a sharper curve here. So an NTSB investigators get on the scene, they will obviously be looking at the speed at which that train was traveling. There's also been an unconfirmed report of an obstruction on the track. Again, all the things the NTSB investigators will be looking out when they get here. In the meantime, we have a lot of equipment assembled here. The goal, once the investigators get here is to clean up this scene and get this interstate reopened as quickly as possible. This is a major artery that goes all the way from Canada to Mexico, and 60,000 vehicles passed through here southbound each day. So they want to get this open up as quickly as possible. Dana?"

But that's just too easy. So maybe it's better to ask why would you get a tattoo of Hillary when there are so many other more preferable options? Like a gorgeous dolphin. Look at that.

And people -- everybody has a phone, and we don't see anymore. The reason why there has been no contact is because they aren't -- they do not exist. And they don't exist, because we don't exist. We go out and we look at the lifeless orbs, these planets out there, that's what we look like to them, because this is is all a computer simulation that basically was created long ago.
