      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Great interview with Ivanka. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News alert. All right. Tonight as one of those nights, we have so much new information. It will take much longer than an hour to get through it, but we'll going to try. Now, we have more proof tonight that when it comes to the Clinton scandals, the fix is already in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Democratic Party tonight is in complete and total disarray with a barrage of massive scandals unfolding like we told you they would. This is an all-out battle that is playing out between Donna Brazile, the Democrats, the media, after she revealed that Hillary Clinton rigged, stole the DNC primary election. She stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. It's all unfolding tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Brazile has a simple message for her critics. He can go straight to hell. Also tonight, The Hill's John Solomon is reporting that Senator Chuck Grassley has confirmed that an early draft of the former FBI Director James Comey announcement exonerating Hillary Clinton accused her of gross negligence. This is key in the email server scandal which means by definition, she broke the law but he changed it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, the fix was in here. The Clintons rigged everything. And disturbing new information about Fusion GPS. That is the company that produced the Hillary Clinton's dirty dossier. Remember, they used fake news, Russian lies and propaganda all to smear, besmirched and slander Donald Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is now asking the firm for records of alleged pavements to journalist. Plus, another high ranking Democrat is now forced to admit that she's seen no evidence, zero after a year of Trump and Russian collusion. Maybe it's time to give it up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And also, it was the worst mass shooting in Texas history. Sadly 26 people were killed, 20 others injured. And what happens, the left races to politicize that horrific tragedy. That and much more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. All right. Tonight, we're going to go through step by step, we're going to explain how the fix was in with every single scandal involving the Clintons. Here is everything you need to know when it comes to America's most corrupt political family: No rules apply. No laws exists. Ethics do not matter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Hillary Clinton rigged the Democratic primary to stop Bernie Sanders. She robbed him blind. The fix was in. Hillary Clinton actually colluded with Russia by paying, you know, millions and millions of dollars for that fake news dossier, Russian propaganda, Russian collusion to smear Donald Trump, and she tried to influence you the American people to swing the election with those lies. The fix was in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } James Comey changed the announcement about Clinton's private email server even after her team deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, destroyed some of them by using acid wash known as BleachBit and even taking a hammer to Blackberries. The fix was in. Bill Clinton met with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch on a tarmac and on airport for 40 minutes, only days before Comey's decision. Are we really to believe all they talked about was their grandkids? The fix was in. Then there is the corrupt Uranium One deal. Millions of dollars pour into the Clinton Foundation and Bill and Hillary's pocket, she is the Secretary of State, she approved this agreement ,one of nine people, and of course all while Bill is doubling his speaking fees with Moscow and by the way trying to meet with nuclear officials in Russia and he did meet with Vladimir Putin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And there is also the massive plot that the FBI uncovered one year before that deal was approved which includes bribery, extortion, money laundering, kickbacks, racketeering. Key members of the Obama administration knew this was happening, including Mueller and Eric Holder. Yet they decided to give 20 percent of America's uranium to Russia and to Putin? The fix was in. Even Lindsey Graham is now calling for a special counsel to be appointed to investigate Clinton. He actually wants two special counsels. All these cases prove that the Clintons think they are above the law and they are protected by Democrats and a colluding media. But tonight one Democrat is calling them out. Former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile continues to expose this corrupt Clinton political machine on a level nobody ever know existed. Hillary rigged, stole the Democratic primary, stole the Democratic nomination. And Donna Brazile is continuing to tell her story after she wrote an article for Politico magazine last week entitled \"Inside Hillary Clinton's secret takeover of the DNC.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And she explained how it was all rigged and she found evidence that Hillary, quote, \"Rigged the DNC,\" cheated Bernie Sanders and his supporters out of the nomination. It was so bad, Donna Brazile agonized when she had to tell Bernie the truth. She also revealed that there was a secret agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC. It gave Hillary Clinton and her campaign total control of the DNC's finances, strategy, personal decisions, budgeting, data, analytics and mailings. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Think about this for a minute. Hillary Clinton, former first lady of Arkansas and the United States, former senator, stole a primary election. All of you who voted for Bernie Sanders, you were cheated. Everybody. Disenfranchised. She sold you out. There are also new parts of Donna Brazile's book that are coming out like how she considered trying to replace Hillary Clinton with Joe Biden as the party's nominee. Remember when Hillary collapsed at the 9/11 memorial? We've played it a lot. Brazile also writes that the Clinton campaign treated her like crap by writing that she told Clinton's team, quote, \"Y'all keep whipping me and whipping me and you never give me any money or any way to do my job. I am not going to be your whipping girl.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Predictably, Democrats are lashing out at Donna Brazile for telling the truth and blowing the whistle on Clinton corruption. Watch this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Those words are precise and specific. That exact standards which means she broke the law. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And John Solomon obtained a copy of a letter that Senator Chuck Grassley sent to the FBI which contains the key sentences found in the draft memo that says, quote, \"There is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary of State Clinton and others used the private email server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect of the handling of classified information and material.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And another part of the memos says, quote, \"Similarly the sheer volume of information that was properly classified as secret at the time it was discussed on email, (that is excluding the 'up' classified emails) supports the inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information.\" Now, those words are key. They were later then edited out and replaced with the term \"extremely careless\" -- at the time, I told you there is no difference -- even though he explained that Clinton had secrets, top secret, special access program, classified information on an email server stored in the basement of a mom and pop shop which by the way we now know five separate intelligence agencies, countries that don't like us, were able to hack into. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And a source also told John Solomon that three other people were involved in helping draft and then edit out of the legal realm, Comey's statement about Clinton. Now, they are deputy director Andrew McCabe. Now he's been under fire ever since the Wall Street Journal reported that a political action committee ran by yes, Virginia governor, \"I don't care about the rule of law,\" Terry McAuliffe had deep ties to the Clintons. They donated half of million dollars to the State Senate campaign of McCabe's wife Jill and she also got another $200,000 from the Virginia Democratic Party, for a state race. This is unheard of. And late last week, we learned from Judicial Watch that Andrew McCabe did not recuse himself from the Clinton server investigation until just days before the election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is also more tonight. The FBI general counsel James Baker, he was also involved. Investigative reporter Sara Carter reported back in July that Baker was being investigated for leaking classified information to the press. And the third person who helped Comey was his former chief of staff. Now, John Solomon's report also notes that it was not clear who recommended making the crucial change in wording but that the Senate will likely demand those answers. Good. It's about time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have been saying for over a year, Comey, the Obama Justice Department were protecting Hillary Clinton for laws she broke that we would be put in jail for. This revelation tonight offers up even more incontrovertible evidence. Comey's original news conference never made any sense because he literally explained how Clinton broke the law for 13 and a half minutes but then he stopped short of recommending charges by claiming she was extremely careless instead of grossly negligent. A huge legal distinction. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look at the side of your screen. It's a list that our friend and colleague, Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, put together for us tonight showing the laws that Clinton violated with the private email server. We'd go to jail for this. Comey top FBI officials knew Clinton engaged in criminal conduct. Otherwise they wouldn't have accused her of gross negligence. But then something happened. The million dollar question is what? And remember one other thing. Remember, Comey made his decision well before he ever talked to the main people involved. He had concluded before he investigated what the outcome would be. Remember he refused to testify under oath -- did testify that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, remember she pressured Comey to call the investigation which was an investigation a \"matter,\" and then he complied. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we also know that Comey decided to not recommend charges against Clinton months before interviewing the key witnesses in the case including Hillary Clinton. You can't decide before doing the investigation. That is why in addition to Congress, the Department of Justice needs to open an investigation into how the FBI and the Obama administration handled the Clinton case where obvious law breaking took place. We cannot in this country have a two-tier justice system. That's not how this country works or is supposed to work. Also tonight, a source is telling Fox News, our own Catherine Herridge, that the House Intelligence Committee are now asking that Fusion GPS, that is the company behind the fake phony anti-Trump Russian dossier, to turn over records that allegedly show payments to journalists, two published stories.

      "utterance": "All right, Tucker. Great interview with Ivanka. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News alert. All right. Tonight as one of those nights, we have so much new information. It will take much longer than an hour to get through it, but we'll going to try. Now, we have more proof tonight that when it comes to the Clinton scandals, the fix is already in. The Democratic Party tonight is in complete and total disarray with a barrage of massive scandals unfolding like we told you they would. This is an all-out battle that is playing out between Donna Brazile, the Democrats, the media, after she revealed that Hillary Clinton rigged, stole the DNC primary election. She stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. It's all unfolding tonight. And Brazile has a simple message for her critics. He can go straight to hell. Also tonight, The Hill's John Solomon is reporting that Senator Chuck Grassley has confirmed that an early draft of the former FBI Director James Comey announcement exonerating Hillary Clinton accused her of gross negligence. This is key in the email server scandal which means by definition, she broke the law but he changed it. In other words, the fix was in here. The Clintons rigged everything. And disturbing new information about Fusion GPS. That is the company that produced the Hillary Clinton's dirty dossier. Remember, they used fake news, Russian lies and propaganda all to smear, besmirched and slander Donald Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is now asking the firm for records of alleged pavements to journalist. Plus, another high ranking Democrat is now forced to admit that she's seen no evidence, zero after a year of Trump and Russian collusion. Maybe it's time to give it up. And also, it was the worst mass shooting in Texas history. Sadly 26 people were killed, 20 others injured. And what happens, the left races to politicize that horrific tragedy. That and much more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue."

      "speaker": "All right. Tonight, we're going to go through step by step, we're going to explain how the fix was in with every single scandal involving the Clintons. Here is everything you need to know when it comes to America's most corrupt political family",
      "utterance": "No rules apply. No laws exists. Ethics do not matter. Hillary Clinton rigged the Democratic primary to stop Bernie Sanders. She robbed him blind. The fix was in. Hillary Clinton actually colluded with Russia by paying, you know, millions and millions of dollars for that fake news dossier, Russian propaganda, Russian collusion to smear Donald Trump, and she tried to influence you the American people to swing the election with those lies. The fix was in. James Comey changed the announcement about Clinton's private email server even after her team deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, destroyed some of them by using acid wash known as BleachBit and even taking a hammer to Blackberries. The fix was in. Bill Clinton met with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch on a tarmac and on airport for 40 minutes, only days before Comey's decision. Are we really to believe all they talked about was their grandkids? The fix was in. Then there is the corrupt Uranium One deal. Millions of dollars pour into the Clinton Foundation and Bill and Hillary's pocket, she is the Secretary of State, she approved this agreement ,one of nine people, and of course all while Bill is doubling his speaking fees with Moscow and by the way trying to meet with nuclear officials in Russia and he did meet with Vladimir Putin. And there is also the massive plot that the FBI uncovered one year before that deal was approved which includes bribery, extortion, money laundering, kickbacks, racketeering. Key members of the Obama administration knew this was happening, including Mueller and Eric Holder. Yet they decided to give 20 percent of America's uranium to Russia and to Putin? The fix was in. Even Lindsey Graham is now calling for a special counsel to be appointed to investigate Clinton. He actually wants two special counsels. All these cases prove that the Clintons think they are above the law and they are protected by Democrats and a colluding media. But tonight one Democrat is calling them out. Former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile continues to expose this corrupt Clinton political machine on a level nobody ever know existed. Hillary rigged, stole the Democratic primary, stole the Democratic nomination. And Donna Brazile is continuing to tell her story after she wrote an article for Politico magazine last week entitled \"Inside Hillary Clinton's secret takeover of the DNC.\" And she explained how it was all rigged and she found evidence that Hillary, quote, \"Rigged the DNC,\" cheated Bernie Sanders and his supporters out of the nomination. It was so bad, Donna Brazile agonized when she had to tell Bernie the truth. She also revealed that there was a secret agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC. It gave Hillary Clinton and her campaign total control of the DNC's finances, strategy, personal decisions, budgeting, data, analytics and mailings. Think about this for a minute. Hillary Clinton, former first lady of Arkansas and the United States, former senator, stole a primary election. All of you who voted for Bernie Sanders, you were cheated. Everybody. Disenfranchised. She sold you out. There are also new parts of Donna Brazile's book that are coming out like how she considered trying to replace Hillary Clinton with Joe Biden as the party's nominee. Remember when Hillary collapsed at the 9/11 memorial? We've played it a lot. Brazile also writes that the Clinton campaign treated her like crap by writing that she told Clinton's team, quote, \"Y'all keep whipping me and whipping me and you never give me any money or any way to do my job. I am not going to be your whipping girl.\" Predictably, Democrats are lashing out at Donna Brazile for telling the truth and blowing the whistle on Clinton corruption. Watch this."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Good for her. Also tonight, a smoking gun bombshell report from The Hill's John Solomon. Now, an early draft of James Comey's now infamous announcement about the Clinton email investigation actually accused Hillary of being grossly negligent. OK. Understand. Those words are precise and specific. That exact standards which means she broke the law. And John Solomon obtained a copy of a letter that Senator Chuck Grassley sent to the FBI which contains the key sentences found in the draft memo that says, quote, \"There is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary of State Clinton and others used the private email server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect of the handling of classified information and material.\" And another part of the memos says, quote, \"Similarly the sheer volume of information that was properly classified as secret at the time it was discussed on email, (that is excluding the 'up' classified emails) supports the inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information.\" Now, those words are key. They were later then edited out and replaced with the term \"extremely careless\" -- at the time, I told you there is no difference -- even though he explained that Clinton had secrets, top secret, special access program, classified information on an email server stored in the basement of a mom and pop shop which by the way we now know five separate intelligence agencies, countries that don't like us, were able to hack into. And a source also told John Solomon that three other people were involved in helping draft and then edit out of the legal realm, Comey's statement about Clinton. Now, they are deputy director Andrew McCabe. Now he's been under fire ever since the Wall Street Journal reported that a political action committee ran by yes, Virginia governor, \"I don't care about the rule of law,\" Terry McAuliffe had deep ties to the Clintons. They donated half of million dollars to the State Senate campaign of McCabe's wife Jill and she also got another $200,000 from the Virginia Democratic Party, for a state race. This is unheard of. And late last week, we learned from Judicial Watch that Andrew McCabe did not recuse himself from the Clinton server investigation until just days before the election. There is also more tonight. The FBI general counsel James Baker, he was also involved. Investigative reporter Sara Carter reported back in July that Baker was being investigated for leaking classified information to the press. And the third person who helped Comey was his former chief of staff. Now, John Solomon's report also notes that it was not clear who recommended making the crucial change in wording but that the Senate will likely demand those answers. Good. It's about time. We have been saying for over a year, Comey, the Obama Justice Department were protecting Hillary Clinton for laws she broke that we would be put in jail for. This revelation tonight offers up even more incontrovertible evidence. Comey's original news conference never made any sense because he literally explained how Clinton broke the law for 13 and a half minutes but then he stopped short of recommending charges by claiming she was extremely careless instead of grossly negligent. A huge legal distinction. Take a look at the side of your screen. It's a list that our friend and colleague, Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, put together for us tonight showing the laws that Clinton violated with the private email server. We'd go to jail for this. Comey top FBI officials knew Clinton engaged in criminal conduct. Otherwise they wouldn't have accused her of gross negligence. But then something happened. The million dollar question is what? And remember one other thing. Remember, Comey made his decision well before he ever talked to the main people involved. He had concluded before he investigated what the outcome would be. Remember he refused to testify under oath -- did testify that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, remember she pressured Comey to call the investigation which was an investigation a \"matter,\" and then he complied. And we also know that Comey decided to not recommend charges against Clinton months before interviewing the key witnesses in the case including Hillary Clinton. You can't decide before doing the investigation. That is why in addition to Congress, the Department of Justice needs to open an investigation into how the FBI and the Obama administration handled the Clinton case where obvious law breaking took place. We cannot in this country have a two-tier justice system. That's not how this country works or is supposed to work. Also tonight, a source is telling Fox News, our own Catherine Herridge, that the House Intelligence Committee are now asking that Fusion GPS, that is the company behind the fake phony anti-Trump Russian dossier, to turn over records that allegedly show payments to journalists, two published stories. Wow! You talked about -- first Russia propaganda. Hillary, the DNC that she ran, she paid for it all. And then of course, the group that used it, now they say, hey let's pay the journalists. Now keep in mind, the same company that they used to funnel $10 million or more through a third party lawyer to create the dossier that used Russian sources to smear the president and try and influence the American people with phony Russian information to steal an election. And on the issue of so-called Trump-Russia collusion, tonight, yet another prominent Democrat forced to admit a year later, she has seen nothing to indicate there was any collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians. Here's Democrat, Senator, liberal, leftist Diane Feinstein."

And finally tonight, our hearts and prayers go out to the people in Sutherland Springs, Texas, their unimaginable pain and suffering after a madman attacked a church yesterday killing 26 people including young children, injuring 20 others. This is beyond tragic. Yet, the Democrats, sadly, members of the mainstream media, what, within hours, they're racing to politicize this tragedy, call for more gun control. Now think about this for a second. People are still in the hospital. Others have not been laid to rest. All they care about is politics. And what's ironic is, these are the same people who are exploiting this tragedy -- they never talk about Chicago. I have some information about Chicago from this weekend. I've been saying it for years. We scrolled the names of the thousands killed because the media ignored it. And even then, President Obama ignored it. Eighteen thousand shootings in Chicago in his last six years. Really? Three thousand dead? Now, 30 people were shot this weekend. It's been almost 600 homicides this year in Chicago. We'll talk about all of this later in the program.

That was the term that was in the statute and it was surprising that it got edited out. And the questions for Congress are going to be, who did they talk to before they edited out? Who recommended it editing it out and why did they do it? And I think we will get those answers in the next couple of weeks."

When you cross out gross negligence and insert \"extremely careless,\" that's pretty incriminating evidence that Comey or others may have been obstructing justice. They were trying to interfere with the do administration of justice and they were stupid in the way they did it because gross negligence is extremely careless behavior. In fact, when jurors struggle with that, the judge gives them a standard jury instruction. Here's Californians for example. Gross negligence is an extreme departure from ordinary care. In other words, extremely careless behavior. So it tells me Comey in addition to attempting to obstruct justice perhaps, doesn't know a damn thing about the laws."

People within the FBI, former FBI agents, they were so frustrated. They didn't understand what was going on here. One thing they did understand was that, there was some kind of fix.

Obviously, my political views are different. But if you and you donate and you work and you go to the polls and you wait in the primary, and it turns out it was for nothing, and every major Democratic is just saying trying, oh, it's nothing. That's an insult to every single person. That's a rigged election. That is them doing the things, you know, we literally have rendered the votes of people meaningless in America!

For them to even ostracized her. For someone who has spent over 40 years, the Democratic Party has been a Clinton loyalists to bring this note and for them to pretty much crucify her for speaking the truth is an injustice. You know they pretend all of the pundits for 10. You know, there is no way Democrats can rig a primary. No one is saying that people win in and changed the voting, you know, the voting machines.

They watch each other's back. And they did what they thought would guarantee their future under a Hillary Clinton White House. The wrong candidate won. We see what we see today. I will share one thing that I have not said before on television. I tried for 6 months to work with the FBI out of the White House on a specific project. The FBI of the highest level blocked me. At the end of the day, I had a senior FBI agent said the following to me, he said, Sebastian, you need to understand, the 7th floor of the FBI, the senior leadership, looks at the Trump White House as the enemy.\" That is how bad it is, Sean."

If I would had been the FBI Director, I would have called in every FBI agent on her detail and asked how that meeting came about and what were they responsible for? I don't think that is been done yet. Where was Comey's inter-moral code? Let me tell you a story about him.
