So he has obviously a very strong base there and it's obviously an interesting dilemma now for Heidi Heitkamp and others.

So, also some changes at the White House this evening, we are told that that Bill Shine, former co-president of Fox News will be taking over a position in communications. The chief of communication spot has been held open for several months and we understand that the former executive of Fox News, the former co-president, as I said, will be taking over a very high level position at the White House.

FBI agent Peter Strzok, the top agent, this person's name is so familiar to everyone I think across America now, he was central to the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Russia probe. He testified today behind closed doors about those anti-Trump texts that were uncovered that he and his girlfriend Lisa Page, who was also working on the case, sent each other in voluminous amounts. So he was grilled during this closed door session. House judiciary and oversight committees were in there. He reportedly defended those texts as part of an intimate conversation.

In the mold of Justice Gorsuch, as we know, Justice Gorsuch has been one who's been respected on both sides of the aisle. He received, obviously, the highest rating from the American Bar Association. Someone incredibly qualified, and that's what the president is going to look for. A very qualified candidate who's going to uphold the Constitution. As we know, when it comes to the judicial system, it's one that has to interpret the law, not make the law. And when we've seen in so many cases in many of these activist judges across the country it's that of activism in the courts.

He had his hearing and was -- he was obviously nominated, had his hearing and was confirmed. President wants to move on this quickly. And so, he is -- he is expecting Congress to move in that direction. We're looking to see obviously when you looked at, for example, Elena Kagan in 2010, where the Democrats was three months before the midterm elections, and they were able to get her confirmed because they knew that there was no reason for there to be a holdup and to simply get her confirmed.

So, Donald Trump needs to break with Republican precedent then, because the Democrats are betting 1,000 when it comes to putting judges on the court that toe the line -- the liberal line. Whereas, Republicans have placed a lot of judges on the court that ended up defecting to the liberal block. Justice Kennedy, among them who was a regular -- a regular -- regularly voted on some issues with the liberal block. So, that's one, there's two reasons why this is an absolute nightmare for Democrats. Number -- it's both -- its bit of nightmare judicially, it's a nightmare politically. Judicially, the Gorsuch nomination basically preserved the status quo. They took an opportunity away from them from moving the court to the left. Gorsuch replaces. Scalia, that's the status quo ante from before that nomination. But this moves the court to the -- to the further to the right because Justice Kennedy was that swing mode in a lot of cases. And we're going to have now if Trump does his job correctly and picks from that list on justice who does not defect the way Kennedy did. Now, politically, it's a disaster because that this is coming just as the Democrats are trying to take back the United States Senate. There are five Democrats running in states that Donald Trump won by double digits. And this is a nightmare for them because they have to know -- this is the last thing they want to be talking about for the next -- for the next three or four months because they can't win no matter what they do. They have to present themselves as a centrist in order to -- in order to win their seats. If they vote again for the Trump Supreme Court nominee, the left will crucify them. If they vote against the Trump nominee, the right will crucify on the movement. So, there is no safe harbor for these people, this is an absolute political disaster for Democrats."

But other than that he's been pretty consistent, but it kind of puts him potentially in the swing vote. Let's go to the pollster.

I think they're going to vote against. And I think that's what you're going to see happen here.

The moral clarity lies in making proposals that are completely untenable that will never be paid for. You know, this person was on MSNBC this morning and she was asked specifically about how she pays for all of this and she proceeded to blab for a solid two minutes without giving an answer to that question because she doesn't have a way of paying for any of this.

There's a reason Bernie Sanders came very close to knocking off Hillary Clinton in primaries and it is pathetic to say that a near-octogenarian is the wave of the future but I think that Bernie Sanders has a lot more acolytes among the other thirty crowd that Hillary Clinton ever did and this is pretty good proof of that. I thought that this was you know, particularly ironic, Lin-Manuel Miranda who I think is a genius. I thought Hamilton was wonderful. But I think it's interesting that someone who essentially wrote a musical that is a love letter to the founding fathers and to the Federalist Papers and to Alexander Hamilton is applauding. He's saying congratulations to you, you know, for this woman who is essentially you know, not essentially, she's put herself out there as a socialist. What do you make of that?"

Bernie Sanders never did anything in the Senate until he ran for president and I highly doubt that any of the policies that are espoused by Ocasio-Sanchez are really going to result in anything real here because it's easy to go home and say that big government is going to solve all your problems when it comes time to hash out the actual legislation, it's going to be pretty difficult to get that stuff passed. The Democrats who were so all-fired eager about the new wave of the Democratic future, they may find that this is not the mainstream. This is a New York district. It has been a Democratic district for 20 odd years, I mean longer than that but the person she replaced had been a ten-term Congressperson.

And coming up tonight, new satellite pictures raising serious questions about the commitments that President Trump got from North Korea. General Jack Keane breaks it down next.

A live look at Fargo, North Dakota where he is for a rally for Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer who is running against Heidi Heitkamp. This is clearly one of the races to watch. He would like to see Congressman Cramer replace Heidi Heitkamp but President Trump won North Dakota by a 36-point margin. So he has obviously a very strong base there and it's obviously an interesting dilemma now for Heidi Heitkamp and others. We talked about like Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly who live in red states and are Democrats running for reelection in the Senate. So, tonight, the president is going to speak at a venue that we are told holds about 6,000 people. And we would expect -- and there is John Kelly, the chief of staff getting off the plane as well. We would expect that we will hear something probably about the Supreme Court pick that came up today, also several could Supreme Court decisions that went President Trump's a way that we can also talk about this evening as he tries to rally this crowd. So, also some changes at the White House this evening, we are told that that Bill Shine, former co-president of Fox News will be taking over a position in communications. The chief of communication spot has been held open for several months and we understand that the former executive of Fox News, the former co-president, as I said, will be taking over a very high level position at the White House. So, lots of decisions being made there. And we see the beast as it is called parked outside of Air Force One ready to take the president over to the North Dakota rally. As soon as that gets underway, we will take you there live. Breaking tonight out of Capitol Hill, nine hours and counting. FBI agent Peter Strzok, the top agent, this person's name is so familiar to everyone I think across America now, he was central to the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Russia probe. He testified today behind closed doors about those anti-Trump texts that were uncovered that he and his girlfriend Lisa Page, who was also working on the case, sent each other in voluminous amounts. So he was grilled during this closed door session. House judiciary and oversight committees were in there. He reportedly defended those texts as part of an intimate conversation. Here now with more on what happened behind the scene, the man who led the questioning today of Peter Strzok, chairman of House judiciary committee, Bob Goodlatte.

And these are questions not about the substance of that second investigation, but about the process of his getting involved in that. And they are advising him not to answer those questions.

The first one got many more votes than the second one and I know there are many members of Congress from different vantage points who are already talking about working together to find the votes to make some adjustments to one of those bills, probably the first bill that could bring us to the majority on one bill.

But the reality is to this, Martha, the issues are just so serious facing the international community, thousands are dead in Ukraine, hundreds of thousands have died in Syria and Putin has enabled both of that and the killing goes on. Meddling in European elections and the U.S. elections are back door assistance to North Korea while all of our negotiations are going on, and he's doing that. And he's backing the Iranians as well. These are big issues and I think it's very appropriate for President Trump to sit down, eyeball to eyeball, with this man.

I think he uses President Xi, and I think we should use it as a framework to look at what's going on in the president's head. He knew full well that President Xi is trampling all over our interest and our allies interest. He was brief in detail on that before we ever met him but he wanted to have a personal relationship to discuss these tough issues and get them on the table. And he keeps referring to Xi as my dear friend, he's a great leader, and the rest of it. But look at that, he got Xi to make progress on North Korea. Now we don't know the final outcome yet. That's going to be determined. But there has been considerable progress to this point. I think President Trump uses that as a framework. Listen, I'm going to talk to Putin, thug and killer for sure. And I'm to see if we can make some progress on this establish some rapport. I think that's where he's coming from."

Well, I'm not going to foreclose yet on the fact that North Korea is not going to denuclearize and they are going to follow for everything that they said, you know, with President Trump at the Singapore summit. Well, first of all, on what you just showed to the audience that's an outside look and definitely something has been added to be sure. Inside, we don't know. So we don't know where we're going with North Korea. They've got to identify and locate all of the nuclear missiles and all the nuclear capability. And if they don't do that then we are going to walk away."

Both candidates are here live this evening with a preview. We begin with the Florida commissioner of agriculture. Good to see you tonight, Mr. Putnam. Thank you for being here.

      "utterance": "Well, certainly I'm proud of everything that the president is doing to save Floridians money with Trump tax cuts. I'm thrilled that he's going to have second pick on the United States Supreme Court so that we are going to get more decisions like we've had for the last couple of days. And I'm excited to share my vision for putting Florida first, Florida jobs, Florida safety and security and Florida families first."

      "speaker": "PUTNAM",
      "utterance": "Well, look, it doesn't -- it's not a great surprise to me that the two have built a relationship over Washington issues, but I'm focused on Florida issues. A conservative pro-business vision for the future of the State of Florida. One that certainly is going to help make America great again, but it begins with the third largest state. And the third largest state is on our roll. Our unemployment rate is under 4 percent, we're setting new records for tourism and we got a thousand new people a day moving to Florida from high tax high bureaucracy states like Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and California. And we are going to continue to build on that strong foundation, put vocational and technical training back into our schools and continue to diversify our economy and make good job stay here in Florida."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You point out a lot of achievements that have happened under Rick Scott, his time as governor. Where do you separate from him? You know, is there anything that you say, well, I wouldn't do this the way that Rick Scott did it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PUTNAM",
      "utterance": "Well, Governor Scott has been an exceptional turnaround CEO for Florida. Eight years ago, when Governor Scott and all of us came in to office, Governor Scott, you know, the unemployment rate in Florida was almost 12 percent. Today it's 3.8. The Wall Street Journal and Time magazine were writing Florida's obituary and saying that tourism was broken, our growth model was broken and wouldn't come back and that our real estate market would never recover. And putting conservative pro-business policies in place, we're an economic engine for the nation and a magnet for talent from around the world. So Governor Scott if he does a fraction for the United States Senate of what he has done for the great State of Florida, it's going to be an amazing thing to observe and Washington doesn't know what's coming his way."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, my opponent has got a lot of special interest money. They've been raining down, I think $11 million over the last three months. I've just now started our ad campaign. Obviously we got the endorsement by the president. He had tweeted for me in December which was great, but a lot of people I wasn't even a candidate then. A lot of people don't even remember that. So this is a fresh reminder that the president of the United States has identified me as a guy who would be the best leader for the State of Florida. And if you look around the country there are very few, if nay primaries, contested primaries with no incumbent where the president has been willing to do that. And so I think that's a testament to the leadership I've demonstrated in my time in the Congress, as well as in the military and back from McKay (Ph) in Florida. So, I'm very honored to have his support and I think that your debate is going to be a focal point where people start to really focus and really scrutinize the candidates going forward."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm an Iraq veteran, I have a proven conservative record and I'm endorsed by Donald Trump. I think Commissioner Putnam has been in office since he was 22 years old. He is a career politician, he is an insider transactional type Republican. I'm a principled conservative and I think Florida voters are much more in sync with them in terms of what they want to see. I mean, Adam Putnam he supported the Wall Street bailout. He supported Obama's cash for clunkers. He supported the Obama-Schumer immigration amnesty which was the biggest amnesty in history would have lowered wages for Americans. I was not for any of those things. And so are you in touch with what Florida voters want, and I think my record is, and I think he has not been."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So in terms of, obviously you both have to be the candidate, and to win in this primary there is five -- it's a very crowded Democratic field on the other side. In terms of running against that person if you get that privilege to do that, who do you think is going to be and how will you run against them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "I have no idea who it's going to be. I think it's a total Charlie foxtrot over there and I like watching it because I hope they tear each other apart. But here's the issue, Martha. We need to build up the success that Governor Scott has had, and really cement Florida as the place to be for job creation, for education reform. And then, we're talking about Justice Kennedy the next governor in all likelihood is going to get to replace three liberal state Supreme Court justices. I am the most well qualified to be able to do that. If the Democrats want to run on turning us into Illinois or New York, let them try to do that. Florida voters do not want that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. General, thank you very much. To both of you. We'll give Mr. Putnam a chance tomorrow night to respond to some of those things that you laid out there, and we're glad you're both here. We're very much looking forward to it. Thanks to you guys."

The president obviously traveling the country trying to have a big impact on these elections. Congressman Cramer versus Heidi Heitkamp for the Senate seat in North Dakota. We'll take you there live, next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So the room is waiting at the hockey arena in North Dakota. President Trump about to step on the stage. And here is a tee to what you are likely to see in tomorrow morning favorite news, it's the Daily News, never a big fan of President Trump but that's the way that they have described for the story that happened today. And the fact that Justice Anthony Kennedy is about to step down from the court, so no doubt the president will address that in some way. The fact that he's got another vacancy, second, since his time as president of United States. And he's hoping to rally people for Congressman Cramer in North Dakota. Heidi Heitkamp is going to be in a very tight race there. So we'll be watching closely as the president arrives. We'll bring you there live. Have a great night, everybody. I'll see you in Florida.
