That's a state he won by eight points and a state where he's currently trailing a democratic frontrunner by eight points in that latest Quinnipiac poll with Joe Biden. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That rally is not the only big breaking news tonight that we expect the president to address there.

We got to remember, also, there's been a whole litany of attack the president physically. Joe Biden said on two occasions, he wanted to beat the president out. Just recently, Cory Booker says I want to hit him in the mouth. And then I wrote a column about that this week and then to my surprise, Senator Tester said the same thing yesterday. He wanted to hit physically Trump in the mouth. I don't think I've ever seen that in my life that we had major politicians bragging that they wanted to physically assault the president of the United States. And they're channeling a whole Hollywood genre. You remember of blowing up, dismembering, shooting, decapitating, stabbing the president from the likes of everyone from Johnny Depp to Madonna.

Good evening, everybody. I'm Bill Hemmer, in for my friend, Martha MacCallum tonight, and this is \"The Story.\" President Trump about to take the stage in Cincinnati, Ohio. That's a state he won by eight points and a state where he's currently trailing a democratic frontrunner by eight points in that latest Quinnipiac poll with Joe Biden. That rally is not the only big breaking news tonight that we expect the president to address there. Today, if became official, the Department of Justice is letting James Comey off the hook. The former FBI director, who the president often refers to as leaking lying James Comey will not face charges for leaking classified information about the president. That information, by the way, ultimately made its way to the front page of The New York Times. In moments, Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz will react. But first, Mike Tobin begins this hour live at the rally in Cincinnati. And Mike, good evening there."

The people who have filled the U.S. Bank Arena here in Cincinnati are certainly hoping that the president is going to needle the Democrats who hope to become his opponents. They drive -- loyal members of his base will drive hours and wait hours in the hot sun to get into the arena, and they expect that from this president. They say they hope to be entertained. They expect that he will deliver a shot of electricity into the base. Controversy is a very real potential here. About half the people with whom I spoke today said if that chant of \"sent her back\" starts, they will support it. 100 percent of the people with whom I spoke say if he goes after Elijah Cummings or the track record in Baltimore, they will support it. Donald Trump Jr. was warming up the crowd here a little while earlier. He went after Representative Cummings, and it was rewarded with very loud support. So, in a few minutes, well, you know, the president will take the stage. He is in the building here. If he goes after some of the new information that you just talked about with James Comey, we'll learn that in a short time. And he's the president, they'll go just about wherever he wants in one of these rallies.  Bill?"

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, this is the first chapter in the story of Jim Comey's criminal culpability. Certainly not the last. Jim Comey's leaks were one area where the Inspector General rightfully referred, review for criminal prosecution. Ultimately, the Department of Justice didn't find that they could make out all of the elements. I accept that decision, but I think that the testimony of Robert Mueller highlighted where Comey's greatest culpability could lie, and that is in the origins of this investigation. You heard Mueller in response to my questions about the Steele dossier.  Say that, that matter was not his purview because it was under review from the Department of Justice. Jim Comey signed those FISA warrants based on that dossier."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "That's right. If you believe the reporting you've seen, it is the lack of intent to commit a crime that resulted in this declination decision by the Department of Justice. But, of course, as we illuminate more facts, we learn more about people's intent in why they do various things. It's our proposition that the Trump-Russia narrative wasn't the crime. It was the cover-up that the real crime occurred when you had elements of our intelligence community politicizing a secret court with no defense attorney to get the permission to spy on a rival political campaign. And if Jim Comey signed those warrants, knowing that there was not complete information included about George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, then that may be the true area where he has to be held to account."

      "speaker": "HEMMER",

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I never believed that this was the strongest case we could make against Jim Comey. But remember, I think that this behavior of his is certainly not blessed. Again, you had the Obama appointed inspector general. A feel that was so concerning that he referred it for criminal prosecution.  Even though that prosecution didn't occur that doesn't mean this is good conduct, and it's indicative of a broader dynamic that occurred under Jim Comey's leadership, and that is that the FBI believed that their role wasn't to investigate crimes and make decisions, instead, they were to shape public opinion through the press. That's why you continue to see Andrew McCabe, who was Jim Comey's deputy, face potential criminal penalties as a result of his own leaks, and then, subsequently lying about those leaks to the inspector general which is a crime."

      "speaker": "HEMMER",

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Based on my conversations with Bill Barr and his testimony, I am fully confident he's going to get to the bottom of this. In response to a question by Senator Cornyn, he said that he is not certain that the Steele dossier wasn't part of Russia's misinformation campaign. And if Americans participated in injecting that opposition research lies from Russians into our deliberative intelligence process, then there has to be a mechanism to hold that behavior accountable, and then, to ensure that it never happens again to any president. Because this is a vulnerability of our system if we allow our intelligence community to be politicized."

      "speaker": "HEMMER",

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",

They want to see a system that is shaken up for their benefit not the benefit of special interests. And I'm confident the president's going to rally him up pretty good in Ohio tonight. I got to say, \"Bill, I wish I was there seeing the energy and electricity from all the great folks in Ohio. I know they'll carry our president to victory in the mid -- in the Midwest."

And I would argue that pragmatist isn't someone who rejects or doesn't chase after big bold ideas, it's someone -- the pragmatist is someone who figures out how to get them done.

They have no leader. Obama has walked off into the sunset. He's not around to sort of corral all of this nonsense.

And part of that game of chess requires that we embrace Barack Obama one, because he's a very popular president with both Democrats and Republicans. He's -- I think he's still the most admired man in the world. And beyond that, he was a very popular President when he left office. So I think it's very important for Democrats to wrap ourselves around Obama going into this election. But to talk about leadership and talk about a leader of a party, what Donald Trump right before we got in that helicopter to speak in this rally we're waiting for the speak at, he says he's not even sure if you can control his crowd from saying hateful things.

I want to read you a quote from the New York Times and allow you to go ahead and frame this the way that you choose. Here's what they say. \"Mr. Trump may be understandably worried about the course of Congressional inquiries, but his aggressive and race-baiting responses have been beyond the pale. He has chosen a reelection strategy based on appealing to the kinds of hatred, fear, and ignorance that can lead to violence.\" Where are you on that?"

But we don't know exactly who is susceptible to that so it's wise not to do it. But what I'm worried about when the New York Times writes that, we -- are they balanced? Are they worried about both sides? I mean, we had James Hodgkinson who was a Bernie Sanders activist and he went out and tried to take out the Republican leadership and wounded five people including the House -- at that time Majority Leader Steve Scalise, or what I -- what I write something about Mr. Johnson, who shot five Dallas police officers and wounded nine at a Black Lives rally because weeks earlier Black Lives marchers have said pigs in a blanket fry them, where Barack Obama had criticized the shootings of suspects who were black. I didn't make that connection. I don't think anybody will. Or we can go on and on but that's a very dangerous thing to do to isolate it. I think what you have to do is on all sides cool it."

      "utterance": "I think they're all engaging in ad hominem back and forth. And what's different about Trump is, he's an equal opportunity replier. He waits, and if somebody attacks and he goes disproportionately back on the attack. And it's in -- he's indifferent to the race or gender or class of the people who attack him and we haven't seen that before. We got to remember, also, there's been a whole litany of attack the president physically. Joe Biden said on two occasions, he wanted to beat the president out. Just recently, Cory Booker says I want to hit him in the mouth. And then I wrote a column about that this week and then to my surprise, Senator Tester said the same thing yesterday. He wanted to hit physically Trump in the mouth. I don't think I've ever seen that in my life that we had major politicians bragging that they wanted to physically assault the president of the United States. And they're channeling a whole Hollywood genre. You remember of blowing up, dismembering, shooting, decapitating, stabbing the president from the likes of everyone from Johnny Depp to Madonna. So I'd like to see the New York Times address across the political spectrum, what they see as a heightened and dangerous level of rhetoric."

    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",

There's only seven of 53 congressional seats that are occupied by Republicans supermajorities in both houses of the legislature and that is -- it's not a very healthy society when you have a one-party system and that's what we have in California. So each politician, as we saw, analogously on the democratic debates, tries to outdo the other person in leftist rhetoric.

The second thing was that there were some moderate voices, but they were either voice by people who have less than two percent approval, or they were booed by the crowd. So we have four or five candidates who have agendas that don't pull 51 percent outside of the Democratic Party. And I think, if they're not careful, they're going to go the whole 1972 McGovern route, or maybe the 1984 Mondale. There's no adult saying, wait a minute, you don't know how you sound to America. You sound great to ten million people watching or your democratic base but -- Republicans have had this happened with Goldwater in 64 and it leads nowhere but to a landslide defeat."

Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, at some point, they're all going to be going after Biden together. But the point I would make is that as they attack Biden, they're also going after Obama. You can't -- to borrow a phrase from earlier today with regard to chant. You can't decouple the two, sir."

    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "No, and not -- what I meant was the people who are poor -- polling the worst among that 20 percent field are the most moderate, so you're absolutely right. The leading five or six candidates are going way beyond their rhetoric just six months ago. I mean, it was maybe some help for illegal aliens, and now it's free tuition, and then the next thing it's Medicare for all the illegal aliens, and the next thing is candidates are going to escort them across the border, and then the next thing is a U.S. Senator goes into Mexico and escort somebody in the United States for medical treatment. So there is no range, there's no sense that you can be too -- you can be too progressive or too hardcore left. It's like the Jacobin revolution in France. Everybody is afraid of being called not just a moderate but a liberal or maybe even a progressive. We're in full neo-socialist mood.  And I think they need to listen to tapes of themselves and play it in Ohio, play it in Bakersfield, play it somewhere in Texas and announce to people what they think of, what they just heard, to the degree that people were watching it."

But so many of these national elections come back to the electoral basket in Ohio. And that's the big reason why the president has gone back there tonight. The other reason is he to talk about the economy and jobs, because the manufacturing sector in that part of the country has been very strong. All right. So here we go.

And then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we are the hottest economic country in the world but they are also coming up because you have people like that governor say come on up. We'll give you healthcare.
