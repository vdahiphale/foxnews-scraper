They say they're sparking conversation, but that's what they call it when they tie you to a chair and shout accusations at you, then asking for money. But how enlightened is Gillette, really? Look at these razors. The blue is for males, and the pink is for females. Talk about enforcing gender stereotypes. Now, the cowardly media, scared of the social media mob, backs the ad. Meanwhile, everybody else hates it. And Gillette will say it's because the ad spotlights bad male behavior, and we insecure rubes, we just can't handle it. No, it's because the ad sucks. Gillette didn't just condemn bad behavior, something most men do whenever they see it: it suggested that behavior represents the norm. It sold you out and judged you. Gillette said, you know, our consumers are beastly, and you should applaud us for being brave enough to say so. Sorry if we don't. We're too busy joining Dollar Shave Club. All right, Dana.

I mean, if an asteroid came and wiped out half the United States, the most important -- the lead at MSNBC and CNN will be, \"How does this impact the Mueller probe?\" There are 150 million people dead but we need to know more about the Mueller probe. And then the gist is like every question is how are you going to deal with Donald Trump? So it basically boils down to this, we hate Trump. You like Trump? We hate you too. So, he's not applying for A.G. He's applying to gain entrance into the Donald Trump hate club. And he's got to like -- he's to say all the right things. I believe there is a tree house out back for that with a secret knock."

And everything he said was based on law. When he was asked, you know, what would you base a recusal on? He said, the facts. And it stopped a few senators in their tracks. They want him, and I agree with Greg, they don't want a Trumper as A.G. They want a weak A.G. They want someone that's going to recuse at the slightest whiff of controversy and they want someone that is going to treat Mueller like a god. And I think he kind of straddled that pretty well. He said, if there is something that's going to happen, I will deal with it but I'm not going to abdicate my responsibility as A.G. I have an authority here and I'm going to be a strong attorney general. But he also had said in this memo that Comey deserved to be fired and Mueller going after an obstruction case against the president was kind of on weak legal ground and Mueller shouldn't have stacked his team with Democrats. It didn't look good. And he said, and I think this caught President Trump's attention, is that there's a lot of reasons to go after Hillary, on Uranium One and things like that, more than to go after Trump-Russia collusion in 2016."

So I think the standards, Dana, for the Democrats was if the ethics officials come to you and say Mr. Attorney General, we think you should recuse yourself. Will you abide by their findings? And he said no. He said he would go with his own sense of whether or not he should be recused. Similarly and I think this is the big point, it's not a matter of, you know, the hate anybody club. There was a question about whether or not he will release the report, the Mueller report. And he said, you know what, the way that we deal with I think what they are called, declination memos, where they decline to prosecute somebody, is we don't go out and talk about them."

Put it out there for the American people and he refuses to say that."

      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, it's been such a big topic of conversation for the country for the last two years, that it should be released in full as much as possible, but he didn't say he wasn't releasing it for reasons of personal or political purposes or because the president doesn't necessarily want it released. He specifically referred back to the rules and regulations that are in the Justice Department when it comes to releasing reports like this. But one thing I caught today that I found interesting is I think there was a bit of a missed opportunity because everything was so focused on Russia that all of these other issues kind of got ignored. For example, there were questions today about Bill Barr's role as attorney general in the 1990s when there was a lot of crime. There is a reason why violent crime and murder in America today has been cut in half. It's a result of a lot of the policies that they put into place. And as you have Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and President Trump pushing forward with criminal justice reform, which is important, he really did a good job of saying, look, I'm not going to apologize for the things that we did in the 1990s to bring down the crime across cities in America. At the same time, I am open to the idea that maybe we can pull some -- pull back on some of those policies now that we have solved a lot of the problem in places like New York and Washington, D.C. Chicago came up as one place where it hasn't been solved. So, that's an issue that will be ongoing for the next 10 to 20 years and I don't think that they really focused on it enough."

      "utterance": "Yes, I guess it's a good thing. Well, and I think that was the other problem with Sessions, was that I think that he wasn't going to go for it. I think that's the direction of the country. And I do agree that we have to be really careful about talking about how great this police reform thing is going to be because the facts are the facts. We saw dramatic reduction in crime, and that had something to do with policies that we are now kind of saying, well maybe we don't need them anymore. And that's the thing that always happens. After something works, we all started thinking maybe we don't need it anymore like walls. We don't need any walls anymore."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "It is now day 25 of the partial government shutdown over border wall funding, the president pointing to a new migrant caravan on its way from Honduras heading toward the USA. Meanwhile, a new push from the president for border security -- he tweeted the following, \"A drone flying around will not stop them. Only a wall will work.\" Also, Democrats declining Trump's invitation to the White House today, a small group. He wanted a working lunch with Democrats and Republicans to try to solve the crisis. While neither side is budging, the Senate has now created though a gang of 20 people -- 10 Republicans, 10 Democrats who are intent on trying to resolve the issue. So Jesse, today I was thinking to myself, we've seen the president talk about this new caravan. We've also seen him talk about yesterday the Hispanic caucus retreat in Puerto Rico. And then you had him sharing an article by an anonymous senior administration official saying these government workers are not loyal. They are not good people. I mean, he is on a campaign, but the polls don't seem to move."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he's winning the argument on the logic of the wall and that's pretty clear, that walls work. You had Obama's chief Border Patrol agent say that walls work. Jim Acosta accidentally prove that walls work. So, the country gets that. But the problem is that he took ownership of the shut down a month ago. And the Democrats are just going to wait him out because they believe that they have the politics on their side. On the caravan, I talked to our chief caravan correspondence Griff Jenkins today. He said it's about 1,000 or 2,000 strong. And by Friday or Saturday, it's going to head to the border with Guatemala and Mexico where we saw all that violence last time where they tried to come over. Interestingly, out of the El Chapo case in Brooklyn, we have found out that El Chapo bribed the president of Mexico $100 million, the last president of Mexico, the one that just left office. But think about how corrupt that is. He's taking money from El Chapo."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "All right. So, Katie, one of the realities of the caravan is this time, as last time, you end up with people approaching, as Jesse was saying, the Mexican border. Mexico granted people in the last caravan humanitarian visas. Most of them remained there. A whole bunch of them went back to Latin America, other countries. So, how do you view this new caravan? Is this an invasion or is this a publicity effort to try to row support for the wall by the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "I don't think that the caravan is a publicity stunt by the president. I think that they're making this journey because they believe that Democrats are going to allow them to come in because they don't believe in walls and they don't believe in any kind of other structure to stop them from coming in. They are getting impatient and jumping the border wall, what we have of it, anyway, which by the way, people who come to this country legally are also inpatient but they do it and they take the time and it takes 5 to 10 years for it to happen. But if you listen to what DHS is saying, what the ICE agents and Border Patrol agents are saying. These caravans are violent. It's the kind of violence they haven't seen before. And the new incoming Mexican president is actually looking to put more barriers on the southern border with Mexico to stop this from happening."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "All right, and Dana, let's talk for a second about the lunch today or the lunch that didn't happen. The president tried to invite some - - what he described or the White House described as moderate Democrats, because he wanted to try to get around Pelosi and the leadership. But it looked like Pelosi held those people in place. They didn't go."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Right. So, groups are stronger when they stick together. And so far the Republicans are sticking together and the Democrats are sticking together. So we are at quite an impasse. I thought that maybe you would start to see some Democrats. Remember Cher last week? She tweeted the thing saying, \"This isn't worth it. Just give him the $5 billion for the wall. Let these workers get back to work for the government.\" I thought that might like pick up some steam but so far, no dice. I do think though on this issue with the caravan, people are on the move all around the world. This is not just happening at our southern border. That is why you have these problems in Europe. I think they had the big Brexit issue today. People are leaving because their governments are failing. And there's a bigger conversation that needs to be happening. There is a $5 billion squabble. It's a little bit petty compared to what is really going on."

I'm going to defend the caravan, number one, because you can't blame them for like, say, trying to go into California when you start offering them incentives like saying, hey, the taxpayers are going to pay for your insurance for illegal immigrants until you are 26. And if anyone happens to be a criminal, don't worry about it. We have ample sanctuary cities ready for you so, we are putting our citizens at risk. Hopefully, that if the people who get here survive, they'll vote Democrat. So I see the incentives as a huge problem. Number two, I'm wondering what the media is going to do about this incoming caravan because the initial caravan, remember, they called that a humanitarian crisis. And then when President Trump jumped in and said it was a humanitarian crisis, they said no, it wasn't. It wasn't at all. They mocked it. Now, you have a humanitarian crisis. There are kids coming. Kids could be hurt. Kids could die. Are they going to make fun of that or are they going to call it a crisis? Anyway, I also want to defend Mexico. We talked about the drugs coming in. I think we also need to face the facts of the demand."
